            <li>Super happy!</li>
            <li>I will not take a star  away for this because of the exceptional value and performance of this device.</li>
            <li>Battery life is great and the charger works off both 110v and 220v, very important for those of us who travel abroad often.</li>

            <li>this is an incredible shaver very first</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer because of the good reviews wich said it was very smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>This I-stubble is amazing, it&#x27;s Sunday a day before Memorial Day</li>
            <li>It really is a comfortable tool and has a great weight and feel.  </li>
            <li>If you bend the top-plastic with help of your thumb and trim, you get amazingly shorter stubble, still it is not as close as the one which is shown in the advertising video.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>and I had fantastic results, the trimmer did a great job</li>

            <li>and I liked the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look of a day or two after using it.    </li>
            <li>Conair makes excellent products and this stubble trimmer has a lot of extras with removable head and easy to clean and adjust.</li>
            <li>This feature comes in handy immediately as you are told to charge the battery for 16 hours before using it</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The iStubble trimmer gives the appearance of quality and comes with a nice cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>he really liked it</li>
            <li>It provided a nice even cut on his face.  </li>
            <li>I just need a good, efficient, razor to give me a \\&quot;slightly more than stubble\\&quot; shave.</li>
            <li>None of them I was really that impressed with until now.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m sure you can see from my reviews, we&#x27;ve owned our fair share of cordless trimmers over the years.</li>
            <li>I really liked the lengths between 1.60-2.00.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t shave stubble that evenly.</li>
            <li>Awesome product for 6 whole months -</li>
            <li>Gives a clean, easy, and even trim every time, leaving me with the perfect stubble.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have a corded form of operation, then you&#x27;d better have a hell of good battery, not one that dies in a couple of months.</li>
            <li>It took way too many passes to get a good look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering leaving them out in the elements to get them nice and rusty.</li>
            <li>For me, these features made it a keeper.ttachments is really nice.</li>
            <li>A travel bag would be nice.</li>
            <li>My husband had one of these before a really liked it.</li>
            <li>My husband liked how it worked</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going for the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look, which seems to be popular, this is THE razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does trim nicely but it has to be plugged in just to use it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re time, you should have better luck than me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a perfect trimmer for someone who wants that look.</li>
            <li>it trims well and trims close for a nice stubble look.  </li>
            <li>THis has a nice swivel head.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable length feature is really nice.</li>
            <li>Each of these are &#x27;just okay&#x27; for me, the shaver misses hairs, and the body groomer (which, to be fair, is not rated for use as a shaver)</li>
            <li>The iStubble is definitely a handy shaver to have for beard control.</li>
            <li>and he is loving it.</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting the istubble to work as advertised, but I&#x27;ve had it for about a week now and have used it twice.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t have any complaints, I would have liked the trimmer to have allowed me to trim at longer lenghts.  </li>
            <li>just kind of move your nose around and play at the angles of the strokes youre using.</li>
            <li>Includes a nice brush.</li>
            <li>Nice and tidy design</li>
            <li>While the trimmer seems awesome and works very well,  I ordered the bonus item and was under the impression it would have an additional attachment.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for an effective way to get the fashionable 5:00 shadow look.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it to adjust a bit longer but I am getting used to that</li>
            <li>It would also be nice if you the maximum length was also a bit longer as well.</li>
            <li>is handy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this shaver cuts nicely</li>
            <li>Excellent product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Create your own stubble design.</li>
            <li>claims of not being able to get good detail work done..</li>
            <li>With this trimmer I just set it to 1.8 mm (two days of stubble for me) and I quickly and easily have a perfect stubble look.</li>
            <li>I-Stubble is great for anyone that likes to customize their unique look.  </li>
            <li>I will have to throw away a perfect trimmer because they do not sell new blades!</li>
            <li>Great price, super fast shipping, awesome product!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this machine and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>iStubble looks cool, and it works great for trimming chin &amp; cheeks.</li>
            <li>iStubble looks cool, and it works great for trimming chin &amp; cheeks.</li>
            <li>It might take one or two tries to get the perfect size you want to shave at, but I tried 0.6 mm and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Overall good build quality, excellent batteries</li>
            <li>Another super great feature is the automatic adjustments.</li>
            <li>Adjustability is actually more than needed, but there&#x27;s really nothing to complain about, excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It never pulls hairs, cleans easy and has good battery life.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and to take care of.</li>
            <li>and it is very easy to operate with.  </li>
            <li>But cleaning is very easy.</li>
            <li>very easy blade length</li>
            <li>Either way this has helped me great the perfect beard where other stubble type shavers could not.</li>
            <li>Still, I am happy with the iStubble as I do not need to shave every day, and do like the stubble look more than a clean shave look.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Amazing :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s by far the best trimmer i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>-- this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across so far.</li>
            <li>This was by far the best stubbler I have owned.</li>
            <li>So this was the perfect stubble trimmer you can find in the market and by far even is one.</li>
            <li>so far its great!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for that sexy stubble.</li>
            <li>many looks that r amazing get it for a picky razer guy</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on all of the stubble trimmers that I could find and this one rated the best by far.</li>
            <li>I have a corded Wahl clipper that is over 10 years old and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li>Tried my best to fix it, even replace it with my old trimming part, but to no avail.</li>
            <li>This is the best trimmer I have owned so far.  </li>
            <li>The one I gave him was about 3 years old and still worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Was debating between this model and the Philips Norelco QT 4070 but liked these features a bit better.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin, but it was a perfect shave.</li>
            <li>Especially on more sensitive areas of the face</li>
            <li>Best trimmer I have had so far.</li>
            <li>except for not holding a charge more than 1-2 shave this is a nice stubble razor.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good trimmer and does a good job of maintaining the &amp;#34;stubble look&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The i-Stubble works perfectly for my needs, allowing me to go from a full beard down to the perfect length of stubble in just minutes.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I never made it Wal-Marts, I did a break-dance right over to Happy Harry&#x27;s a.k.a Walgreens and saw the iStubble for $60.  </li>
            <li>It has very fine adjustments and keeps an even trim all over.  </li>
            <li>Did I mention I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Shaver!???</li>
            <li>Works great, cuts very even and allows me to play with more lengths!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Addition after 4 years:&lt;br /&gt;After 4 years this trimmer is still going strong!</li>
            <li>The 0.4 mm setting cuts my beard to the perfect length of about 1-2 days after a clean shave, which is exactly the maximum length of beard I want to keep.  </li>
            <li>I read the good reviews for the iStubble and was excited to receive it today.</li>
            <li>I rarely give full stars, so this is the best most anything ever gets.</li>
            <li>The heat from it growing so fast, or the incredible power of my brain seems to have worn our the follicles on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>Get the GMT900R from Gourmet Kitchen Gallery (Free shipping and no-sales-tax for most states), and they have good customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait some time to review this, to see how it held up, and this trimmer is by far the best I have had in terms of being able to get the correct amount of stubble.</li>
            <li>Good for people who don&#x27;t mind spending time to clean up often.</li>
            <li>This one is actually very good, it glides along easily, and gives a consistent shave once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for the first three months.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, and works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Just want too tell anyone who is interested in getting one of these, that these are really great shaving razors.</li>
            <li>Was pretty pumped about using this product, I&#x27;ve heard great things about it.  </li>
            <li>I have generally been very happy with Conair iStubble</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the battery life, the iStubble is pretty neat and does a great job with adjustable trimming.</li>
            <li>Excellent buy, no regrets.</li>
            <li>This beard trimmer works great for about the first 3-6 months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with this since I use the lower settings, but take note that to reach 5mm you have to push the button 14 times!  </li>
            <li>It is very accurate and gives a uniform shave.</li>
            <li>Adjusting the length is electronic and is very accurate with the lit display.</li>
            <li>It is very accurate and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>, I did not find it very precise for the mustache area under the nose and at the edge of the sideburns.</li>
            <li>Very precise blade setting</li>
            <li>Very smooth on the skin and</li>
            <li>I have very light</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It is a very smooth cut and glides over the face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very precise and comfy.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Very very smooth.</li>
            <li>head pivots, which does allow for a very comfortable ride as you go over the edge of your chin, etc.</li>
            <li>easy to use, trims nicely</li>
            <li>The design would be much better if you could easily take the floating head off or if there was some kind of detail</li>
            <li>This worked fine for a while, I even liked the design but the battery life kept getting shorter and shorter</li>
            <li>Be smart about the product and it will work great for you.</li>
            <li>The iStubble precision is incredibly accurate!</li>
            <li>thing needs a huge clearance (just look at the size of the guard on the picture!)</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t know if they upgraded it and made it better or what.  </li>
            <li>+ STARS, if Available!</li>
            <li>Want more information?  </li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for more than six months.</li>
            <li>The reviews are mostly created by users who are incentivized to use and review the product.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is great for trimming your beard and getting your face ready for closer shaving.</li>
            <li>He really enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li>think the bottom line is you need to spend more than $20 to get the close shave.</li>
            <li>OK, I bought this to shave my head.</li>
            <li>I have several Wahl trimmers and have been very happy with all of them.</li>
            <li>I wanted a better routine though.    </li>
            <li>After reading reviews of the $25 piece, I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting a &#x27;grade A, top choice trimmer.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s cordless too, but that isn&#x27;t anything new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not as versatile as the Wahl or Remington, both of which can be used for hairstyling/haircuts, that&#x27;s quite ok with me.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not as versatile as the Wahl or Remington, both of which can be used for hairstyling/haircuts, that&#x27;s quite ok with me.</li>
            <li>and I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Using it for more than 1 year and never faced any issues.</li>
            <li>would like it better if it were waterproof and could be used in the shower to prevent the mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a stubble or close trimmer than you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I suspect something like .1 mm would be more like it.    </li>
            <li>--it will be thicker and more pronounced.    </li>
            <li>The design on this trimmer is top notch</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed this trimmer.</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mostly bald man with a beard</li>
            <li>you use it to make sure</li>
            <li>Okay, so what am I supposed to do with the 7 minutes I&#x27;ve just saved?</li>
            <li>I picked this up as an Amazon deal of the day, and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>find the idea of this trimmer to be much better than the implementation.  </li>
            <li>trimmer&#x27;s design allows you to change length settings without fiddling around with attachments as with most trimmers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The iStubble thus seems to do a much better job than the cheaper trimmers in this regard.</li>
            <li>Best facial hair trimmer on the market!</li>
            <li>It is better than Philips Norelco Qt4022/41 Stubble Trimmer Pro.</li>
            <li>wider top helps you to have an even trim all over your face, neck and jaw line.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve got more than just stubble</li>
            <li>and I have gone through many of them.  </li>
            <li>Much better than ones</li>
            <li>Cheap and effective stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li>In fact, I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>One feature that I preferred the most is that you are able to use it while it is charging.  </li>
            <li>So, the question: is this razor worth the money for those of us who just want a good, efficient, razor?    </li>
            <li>SURE</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t wait around to buy it.</li>
            <li>What I love most about it is how close the shave is.</li>
            <li>Love the LCD screen too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll need more time to evaluate this.</li>
            <li>Maybe the GMT880 with manual adjustment would be better.</li>
            <li>My fiancÃ© has tried many trimmers, and couldn&#x27;t seem to find just what he wanted in one shaver, this one he love it had just about everything.. ..</li>
            <li>so you have more looks to play with.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>So in that sense Conair GMT900 iStubble Facial Trimmer was perfect.</li>
            <li>I love the flip up blade cover that allows for mustache trimming.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to check the length every time you turn off the trimmer or you will end up losing your beard.</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Work okay on most of my face</li>
            <li>this is as durable as it appears, it could be my best beard trimmer purchased over the last 20+ years.</li>
            <li>I have a short beard and the 5mm setting is perfect.</li>
            <li>I look forward to using it for many years to come.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>Conair is a better trimmer from perspective of trimming dynamics.</li>
            <li>Better for traveling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the product and its ease of use.</li>
            <li>But its ok i still used it choose between 0.2 or 5.</li>
            <li>So I bought these and am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer</li>
            <li>It works ok.  </li>
            <li>I need precision with a trimmer for my stubble look and most \\&quot;manual\\&quot; trimmers</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so shaving the &#x27;stache area is more of a process.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Better grip...</li>
            <li>Best trimmer if you want a really short trimmed beard.  </li>
            <li>Shaves better than everything else I have</li>
            <li>he&#x27;ll absolutely love it</li>
            <li>What more do I have to say to fill the word requirement.</li>
            <li>$3 more bucks is aweful but who cares.  </li>
            <li>I am able to exchange it.</li>
            <li>Love the simplicity of design and the usage.</li>
            <li>shave more than once a week.  </li>
            <li>Battery life seems just ok.</li>
            <li>Easily Adjusts  Strong Blades that can cut through my thicker beard  Easy to Use  Good Battery Life  </li>
            <li>The top will break and that will be the end of it.</li>
            <li>It is nice and smooth while it works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing</li>
            <li>Just like so many reviews here</li>
            <li>I love the battery indicator</li>
            <li>I love this shaver and use it every day.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better trimmer for keeping a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li>The best part of it besides for the trimming has to be digital readout of the blade length.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>guide, as I said before, can&#x27;t be taken off of the trimmer, but it can be flipped to the back of the trimmer, which is perfect for when trimming sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li>guide, as I said before, can&#x27;t be taken off of the trimmer, but it can be flipped to the back of the trimmer, which is perfect for when trimming sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li>They both love it.</li>
            <li>I also love the look it gives.</li>
            <li>A nose/ear trimmer works for touching those areas up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for about 2 weeks now, but it has worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I have a better $10 trimmer that has worked better than this.  </li>
            <li>Iâ€™m able to keep a 5 oâ€™clock shadow to a scruffy look at all times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-more challenging to clean&lt;br /&gt;-no</li>
            <li>Trimmer functions great out the box, &amp; very cool-looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For stubble, simply use it without any attachments for a perfect .2mm to .3</li>
            <li>For stubble, simply use it without any attachments for a perfect .2mm to .3</li>
            <li>Overall this is the best product that I have tried to date for stubble management!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s multiple settings are great!      </li>
            <li>I would love this product if either the battery kept a charge or if it was corded and worked plugged in.  </li>
            <li>BUT THERE ARE BETTER TRIMMERS</li>
            <li>Love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>For this price on Amazon, it is an OK deal.</li>
            <li>With the i-stubble you&#x27;re barely touching the skin.</li>
            <li>DONT KNOW FIVE MORE</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Also the trimmer is pain free and trims quite effectively.</li>
            <li>It does what it meant to be and does is the best way possible.</li>
            <li>glad Amazon will let me returned it</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t shave the top of my moustache.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>And I didn&#x27;t keep the receipt, so now I have to find something else and spend more money.</li>
            <li>I have owned many shavers including wahl/phillips ect ..</li>
            <li>Probably the best shaver in the market for stubble control however it doesn&#x27;t work as effective as expected in some areas.</li>
            <li>I love the one week stubble look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown to love.</li>
            <li>Overall, the iStubble is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a while.</li>
            <li>Ive used many a trimmer</li>
            <li>love the .4mm length.</li>
            <li>Certainly better than the cheap-crap-plastic bad-battery-junk-falls-apart-doesn&#x27;t-cut stuff that they sell at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>smooth kind of  shave.</li>
            <li>LINE IS I am not wowed by this trimmer, but I learned to love it because it delivers and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>, so I just gifted it to the guy who works in my office by cleaning up the hair that came in the box.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>more than one would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had it for 4 months now and love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so I will try this with one more unit before I thrown in the towel.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>NOT disappointed at all!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent for that but not actual shaving  </li>
            <li>What more can I ask for?</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li>I have used this several times per week for 90 days now, and my results continue to be superb.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now had the istubble for about four months and love it.  </li>
            <li>I am able to use it while its plugged in though.</li>
            <li>yet I have used it in a pinch (when on the road) and was satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A+ Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>The drawbacks is that it doesn&#x27;t hold power for more than three uses before I have to recharge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all that and more.</li>
            <li>Love how you can adjust the height with a click of a button.  </li>
            <li>This is the one that impresses me most.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- uniform shave across most curved areas</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I have had better.</li>
            <li>all around, it leaves some hair greater than .4</li>
            <li>so maybe it works better for others.</li>
            <li>I actually Love the product but it broke 4 months after purchase from amazon...</li>
            <li>that Conair - oh well - Better Business Bureau here i come&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it cuts much more evenly and reliably giving me a better look.</li>
            <li>To top it all off, after 3 weeks of use</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see many of these out in stores, which makes me nervous that they&#x27;ll discontinue the product.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works great otherwise, the longest length is 5mm so this is only good for stubble(hence</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conair People: Charge $10 more and make this trimmer with a Li-ion battery.  </li>
            <li>But overall, this thing is awesome.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the performance of the charger, but quite displeased with the fact that it never holds a charge.</li>
            <li>i want to able to give it ZERO rating.  </li>
            <li>Battery life could be better, you get about 10 shaves per charge.</li>
            <li>Best to give it a charge regularly or just always plug in.</li>
            <li>The battery life is better than the reviews I read.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it&#x27;s pretty consistent, probably the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used in my five years of shaving experience.</li>
            <li>that I love the thing.  </li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Amazon is sending a replacement and we&#x27;ll see if that one fairs any better.  </li>
            <li>Agree, needs something for better grip..</li>
            <li>It is called iStubble for a reason :)</li>
            <li>very even and great results.</li>
            <li>It is called iStubble for a reason :)</li>
            <li>very even and great results.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the shaver should be more durable, so my 5-star rated review has been reduced to 2-stars.</li>
            <li>Make sure you charge it for 16 hours.</li>
            <li>Is is very easy to use and adjusting the levels on the blade is as easy as pressing a button.</li>
            <li>The I-Stubble was very easy to unpack and has easy instructions.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer holds a really good charge to the point he used it right out of the box without having to charge it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Flipping the head to trim right under nose or side burns seems to work good.</li>
            <li>This product works great, the settings allow you to create a nice trim.&lt;br /&gt;Product allows you to do many styles of facial hair, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>One of the best features is that it you have so easy to adjust the trimmer to get the exact right shave.</li>
            <li>The I-Stubble&#x27;s 15 settings allow him to create and maintain his own unique look.  </li>
            <li>Really does trim to 0.4mm, although it&#x27;s just a tad longer than I would have liked - it basically gives me that full 2 day look, which is great, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Battery life is great and the digital settings make getting the perfect trim easy and fast.</li>
            <li>advise you start long and go shorter till you reach a length you&#x27;re happy with, and this is good advice.</li>
            <li>It adjusts extremely easily and cuts effectively, but I wish the battery lasted a bit longer and that the battery indicator was a bit more accurate.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and smooth all while saving me plenty of money on blades.</li>
            <li>Its light weight and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will highly recommend it if the replacement arrives and works without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will highly recommend it if the replacement arrives and works without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly if you&#x27;re looking for a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, easy to handle and effective trimmer</li>
            <li>Continues to go on strong, and works fine!</li>
            <li>Makes for a very clean shave every time.</li>
            <li>Even on the lowest setting it cuts very cleanly and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>while it doesn&#x27;t have a rubberized grip, it is very comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This thing was exceptionally easy to use, and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m becoming follicly challenged on the top of my head and have been shaving my head once a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to choose how long you want your beard to be.     </li>
            <li>First, the unit is well made and feels good on the hand.</li>
            <li>is that the stubble cut by the device is, in many ways, not the \\&quot;ideal\\&quot; stubble grown in a day or two after a good traditional shave with a good blade (or safety blade).</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good though.</li>
            <li>Battery life was also pretty good.</li>
            <li>First, the good:</li>
            <li>I find the battery life to be pretty good.</li>
            <li>My final though is this; that the functionality of this trimmer is actually excellent, as it keeps your stubble very even and looking good.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>You can trust it to keep your beard looking good in between barber&#x27;s visit, but you won&#x27;t be looking like the pretty boy in the poster.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, couldn&#x27;t change lengths of blades.</li>
            <li>and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>thought it would be a gimmick, but it is actually pretty good.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is exactly what I wanted - a high precision stubble trimmer which leaves a perfect stubble on your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I also haven&#x27;t experienced any significant issues regarding not being able to get my whole face.  </li>
            <li>Great new profit scheme by the wizards at Conair.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to change the settings.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, make sure you fully charge before use.</li>
            <li>It does have a lot of nice features and does work well to give a nice even shave, however it doesn&#x27;t seem to get very close, even on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>It has a good cutter and no trouble catching the hair.  </li>
            <li>0.4mm is the shortest it shaves with the guard in place, and it is a nice, short stubble that looks great for me.  </li>
            <li>I was used to an old Remington MB-300 that I used for many years with great results.</li>
            <li>I have had several electric trimmers and the lengths available for this one are awesome.</li>
            <li>I also find it very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>and it is very easy to clean</li>
            <li>Gift recipient was very pleased as how well trimmer works, it&#x27;s easy to clean and light weight.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable and accurate.</li>
            <li>Smooth shaving very accurate.</li>
            <li>The head glides smoothly, and feels very comfortable against my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be perfectly fine with adjusting that manually and getting a trimmer that lasts more than 2 months.</li>
            <li>it gives me a clean shave look at 0.4mm!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome for quick shaves in the morning and provides some detailer settings to get more involved beard / facial hair styles.</li>
            <li>This is very easy to use, full charge gives about 50minutes of usage.</li>
            <li>it is very good especially if u want to avoid shaving</li>
            <li>my skin gets irritated by most shavers, however this istubble is perfect for me because it does leave a little stubble that works much better for me.</li>
            <li>Very nice product so far!</li>
            <li>This product has been great so far.</li>
            <li>but so far it has been great.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use the brush every day to free them.</li>
            <li>It does passable duty as a body hair trimmer, but if that&#x27;s your primary purpose, there are better choices out there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>GMT900 is good for any one if you maintain the product very well.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain!</li>
            <li>I may add that not not a hair was pulled and i was able to trim everything very quick and comfortably.</li>
            <li>works fantastic very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>On it&#x27;s lowest setting, the trimmer cuts hair very close to your skin and gives you a very light stubble look, which is nice.</li>
            <li>This, on the other hand, is wonderful.</li>
            <li>But other than those 2 things great buy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and gives you that perpetual unshaven look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as easy as shaving with an electric razor</li>
            <li>The $20 trimmer I was using before this could easily get twice that</li>
            <li>how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li>This literally has improved my life because I never spend money on razors and I can get a nice clean looking stubble quickly</li>
            <li>The adjustable head make it easy to shave at every length.</li>
            <li>The display lights up, making it easy to read and adjust</li>
            <li>No skin irritation and easy adjustments to trim my goatee, and leave a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on the rest of my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The guard pops up for easy cleaning, screen shows battery life and height.</li>
            <li>I found it easy to trim my face, moustache and neck.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s easy to deal with; I just shake the whiskers out in trash after each use.  </li>
            <li>I shaved my head when I retired for the easy care.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+Super easy to adjust length setting</li>
            <li>The iStubble charges very quickly and keeps its charge longer than the Philips device.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s always that easy either</li>
            <li>The blades pop out for easy cleaning and oiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>trimmer is easy to hold and handle and the blade can be rinsed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start it off easy:  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily manipulated to any angle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning the trimmer is easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning the trimmer is easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to set.</li>
            <li>Easily adjustable and cuts just to the length I need.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It charges very quickly</li>
            <li>It cuts hair but it doesn&#x27;t make it easy.</li>
            <li>micro-adjustment is fantastic; much more precise than mechanical adjusters&lt;br</li>
            <li>No razor burn, easily controlled stubble length, and well built.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy, doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate skin.</li>
            <li>I like that you can&#x27;t easily lose the comb</li>
            <li>I like that you can&#x27;t easily lose the comb</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It shaved so well better than I thought it got really close to a nice one day length.</li>
            <li>Continues still to go on strong.</li>
            <li>And that is not advice for this trimmer in particular, it just promotes good battery health.</li>
            <li>Still going strong after 2 years.</li>
            <li>Had the thing for almost a year and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>It is a great idea but save your money and wait until some major improvements take place.</li>
            <li>For a comparable price, the [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips-Norelco BG2040]] is as good (if not a little better), and easier to use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and good value for money</li>
            <li>The finish is cut more evenly, specially at lower lengths and for me thats</li>
            <li>I set it for 0.4 and was very pleased with how well and fast it cut.  </li>
            <li>I liked the idea, but the first one broke within weeks.</li>
            <li>The best part it doesn&#x27;t cut good when buzzing it stops only when the head of the trimmer is bent back</li>
            <li>I look much better with a 5&#x27;oclocker than I do with a full beard.</li>
            <li>The .4 mm length is perfect for me, and since it adjusts with the push of a button, I can style down to the look I want.</li>
            <li>, i like how you can adjust just by clicking the up or down button for a perfect time,</li>
            <li>I have to say this is hands down the best trimmer I ever used.</li>
            <li>Very easy to calibrate to ones specific need, gives a good finish.</li>
            <li>The battery life is still just as good as before, it cuts just as well and even as new.</li>
            <li>Worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Buy one, as I tried many others first, and am pleased with this one</li>
            <li>/&gt;It trims fine</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to use</li>
            <li>It cuts just fine and hasn&#x27;t pulled my hair so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is still working fine.</li>
            <li>I have bought many clippers in the past and this is the best one so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>I assume it would be fine.</li>
            <li>Was worried about battery life but have had it now for 6 months and it is fine - if you follow manufacturers instructions for charging you won&#x27;t have any issues.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine, however, for a couple of months and then quit working.</li>
            <li>and it still works fine.</li>
            <li>Best trimmer I have ever used, in fact this is my second one, the first doesn&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li>The electronic length adjustment works fine</li>
            <li>It works fine once you connect the charge</li>
            <li>If I shave quick I might be able to get 4-5 shaves out of it without recharging.</li>
            <li>If you want to maintain 1-2 days of growth (&#x27;stubble&#x27;, in my book), I&#x27;ve found the Wahl Super Taper II, with no comb attached, to be a much better choice.  </li>
            <li>Conair, if you built this product with even a modicum of care, you&#x27;d probably make millions more dollars from loyal customers.</li>
            <li>Finding the right &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; for the job was not that easy!</li>
            <li>There are plenty of length options available in between these high and low settings which allows you to trim the beard at the most perfect length you want it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very powerful, lightweight and charges very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The varying length of trim is great, and it flows easily, in my opinion, over facial contours.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, cuts well, does not pull hair, easy to clean, but I have to charge it over night before using it.</li>
            <li>Smooth , pain free, easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>blade slips off easily for cleaning and the device is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is SUUUUPER easy to use, which is great for me because as I mentioned I suck at getting the proper trim.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how smoothly it trimmed my whiskers, and the efficient functionality of this fine trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Best part is the fact that it leaves little to no irritation.</li>
            <li>Very good trimer with long time batteries!!!</li>
            <li>the results were fine, it didn&#x27;t scratch or irritate my face in any way, it was easy to clean and</li>
            <li>and I wanted an accurate beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>And no, I do not have some sort of huge crow like nose like the Wicked Witch of the North.</li>
            <li>then you will see a huge depletion  of battery life.  </li>
            <li>esp when we&#x27;re not talking about a huge yard and a mower but your face.</li>
            <li>And that it, I got the result that I desire and gave me great stubble and great beard shapes without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>and I was happy but 3 days later when I went to use it again</li>
            <li>I like the idea of the iStubble quite a lot, and the control of length is fantastic for inexpensive clippers.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER had a trimmer that cuts so close and smooth.</li>
            <li>smooth, even finish of stubble that this trimmer did.  </li>
            <li>smooth, even finish of stubble that this trimmer did.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>floating head is comfortable, and I didn&#x27;t feel any pulling or receive any nicks.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean after use.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a great beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>When I tried the trimmer it made one growling sound and nothing since.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over 3 months with no problems and feel comfortable recommending it.</li>
            <li>Overall for me, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>A huge design flaw for a device that&#x27;s primarily used in a bathroom.</li>
            <li>A huge design flaw for a device that&#x27;s primarily used in a bathroom.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and holds a charge.</li>
            <li>Just smooth all over.</li>
            <li>Cannot stop talking about how smooth it is - doesn&#x27;t catch his hair or rip any out.</li>
            <li>just wish it also had a smaller head too ..but great unit.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap beard/stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Completely smooth, it doesn&#x27;t pull at all.</li>
            <li>just a great trimmer for keeping it short.....or very short.  </li>
            <li>Just a cheap product all around.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of body/face groomers and this one appears to have fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>They are also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>to try and keep my  stubble maintained in a comfortable</li>
            <li>/&gt;+Cuts smoothly and evenly</li>
            <li>I have a light stubble.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even turn on after 16 hr charge cheaply made, junk.</li>
            <li>It, like the iStubble is a precise electronic moving head with LCD display for length.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need very short stubble, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Great budget trimmer, after 2 years of daily use the plastic guide snapped so deducted a star for durability but besides that it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Advanced blade technology --</li>
            <li>I have not shaved in years based primarily on style choices but also because I can be prone to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>Extremely precise adjustment of length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The height adjustments are with a push of a button all with a precise cut and all the power you need  </li>
            <li>Does not feel cheap, cuts smooth.</li>
            <li>I primarily use it for body hair.</li>
            <li>The Conair GMT900 iStubble Facial Trimmer is a great product.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and effortless to use.</li>
            <li>It comes with a brush and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I knew what I wanted and could not achieve the precise look.  </li>
            <li>this is a fantastic trimmer when it works.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Because of the always attached guard you get very close without the blades even touching your skin, great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to clean it out so it won&#x27;t get clogged.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great idea but</li>
            <li>Putting a blade on my face every day is not something I enjoy.</li>
            <li>You can also remove the cover and use the guard free setting to trim up around your &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; or hairline.</li>
            <li>I prefer a light beard, maybe 6 days without shaving, and no trimmer I tried would do it.</li>
            <li>I actually really enjoy using this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Which is such great value...</li>
            <li>This trimmer will trim facial hair and gives a great haircut to boot.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t run or even light the LED display.</li>
            <li>I bought this facial trimmer, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>The device is cheaply made and the blades motor seems to be powerless.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Tried many different trimmers and the iStubble is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I get the light when its charging and it shows battery 100%.</li>
            <li>easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with a secure travel case, but putting it inside a shoe seems to work well.</li>
            <li>I just liked the trimmer so much that I decided to buy another one without even looking at the alternatives.</li>
            <li>this is great product which allow me now to control facial hair length on my face</li>
            <li>It is easy to adjust, cuts cleanly, and has been easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The shaver works great, however the charge cannot last through one shave, the warranty makes me cover shipping and takes 4-6 weeks and maybe longer.  </li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave, no nicks or hair tugging.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews about how comfortable this thing was.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t throw hair all over the place which makes for easy clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a comfortable stubble.  </li>
            <li>faster if it had a bit more powerful battery.</li>
            <li>The trimming isn&#x27;t precise.  </li>
            <li>The conair also works great at the lowest setting when you push the trimmer guard all the way back.</li>
            <li>It is light and efficient.</li>
            <li>I tried it for 2 weeks now, it works great to trim facial hair and bet that stubble look.</li>
            <li>but it give an even shave hassle free out of the box.</li>
            <li>I actually really enjoy this device.</li>
            <li>This thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Its quite smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect stubble every time, and no time wasted changing the plastic length pieces.</li>
            <li>It was not a violent drop, which the shaver should have survived.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>next day is my anniversary, and I&#x27;m ready to try it out as I want to have the perfect look for my anniversary dinner.</li>
            <li>So far, so good on the battery life.</li>
            <li>and I felt the iStubble was far superior.</li>
            <li>far this unit seems to be good.  </li>
            <li>So put this on the charge for 3 hrs unplug and Good for the next 7 times or more.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Downsides are the lack of a good way to do edging (I use the small-tip from my old Norelco for that), plus I think it would work better/</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>in all, this product is by far superior to the others I have tried on the market.</li>
            <li>With my Wahl I have to concentrate a lot more on holding the trimmer at the right angle to ensure even length and to avoid stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was dirt cheap compared to many others and it works exceptionally well if you are looking for the stubble look or for maintaining a proper beard.</li>
            <li>It is a very fun gadget for any guy to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The digital display is also very nice.</li>
            <li>Overall, works very nicely.</li>
            <li>But it is very useful for trimming.</li>
            <li>Its pretty good- anything below 2.5 mm is what I&#x27;d call a heavy 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and the 3, 3.5 and 4 are great for that scruffy look.</li>
            <li>I like this one it is well designed, good quality, doing a nice shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is not bad though i expected a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>battery has been pretty great so far.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to give it a good long charge (8 hours</li>
            <li>look a lot better than the normal shavers as it followed the contours of my face better</li>
            <li>It requires multiple passes in order to get a perfect trim, and be sure to remember the last setting used because every time you use it, the unit resets itself to 0.4mm, which is the shortest available option.</li>
            <li>The conair does this perfectly and is pretty precise and accurate down to a couple mm.  </li>
            <li>If you want to buy one of these it is worth a try but buy it somewhere that it can be returned easily if it breaks even under light use.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, comfortable and quick.</li>
            <li>It cuts cleanly, doesn&#x27;t pull / tug on hairs and is very easy to use straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>and he says that it works better than the first one he had.  </li>
            <li>So when I first started, I found that it seemed to take more effort than I thought it should.</li>
            <li>2 min after I got out of bed, I was so excited.</li>
            <li>When originally asked about the delivery i explained it was received damaged.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely worth the money!</li>
            <li>figured there had to be a better way and started looking into higher quality trimmers.</li>
            <li>If I stick to .8mm or higher I am ok.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>adjustment is unique.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also super easy to clean and keep clean.</li>
            <li>I love it because it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Unique floating contouring head</li>
            <li>Be sure to charge overnight (16 hr) before using the first time.</li>
            <li>Even if I grow my facial hair out for more than 10 days, this only takes 5-7 minutes to perfect your stubble.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to see companies beginning to develop products that was specifically geared just for that.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull or snag, cordless (as long as its charged), fully adjustable, and creates the great 5 o clock shadow look.</li>
            <li>However, i&#x27;m really happy with this trimmer and hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I stick with my original assessment:</li>
            <li>Suppose that is not the fault of the product, but be sure this is exactly what you need before you buy it.</li>
            <li>These minor complaints aside, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The lengths are perfect for any length stubble to a small beard.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the battery instructions for first use.</li>
            <li>THE LCD LIGHT IS COOL TO LOOK AT.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth my money!</li>
            <li>AND the price is the most reasonable!</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for a long time, has a scoop to catch some of your clippings, does a great job of trimming the stubbly and has provided me the shortest shave time.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is the lightest weighing electrical shaver I&#x27;ve ever used and it has diminished my hand joint pain remarkably, but I think the design could be improved upon.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>My Original Review:  </li>
            <li>It is also very effective in keeping my stubble just at the 5&#x27;o clock length which is pretty impressive since I have very coarse hair and have slightly chubby cheeks - and this device still gets the job done at the 0.4mm setting.</li>
            <li>So I figured the less sexy older trimmer is better than this beautiful looking one.</li>
            <li>Its very good if you like to keep a short beard or stubble and the razors are very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s NOT waterproof - don&#x27;t try to clean with water</li>
            <li>What I found is that hair gets all over the place in my bathroom, which becomes a challenge to clean.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this and out of all the electric shavers I have found this is 100% my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a wall charging unit, a brush and oil to keep your trimmer blades clean and cared for.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve already spent way too much time online, reading reviews and forums trying to find the perfect trimmer.</li>
            <li>this is only one the is easy comfortable and perfect SHORT stubble.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s super light and 110 to 220 V</li>
            <li>/&gt;Minus: Pain to clean up Trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t remove the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; to clean it up.</li>
            <li>I think conair made a mistake resorting to this digital length setting, it looks nice, but is much more ocmplicated than needed -- I am now purchasing a trimmer with mechanical length setting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve try several trimer and the iStubble is by far the best.</li>
            <li>And clean up couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
            <li>Just pop the guard up and wipe off, clean with Q-tip.</li>
            <li>cuts well and cleanly.</li>
            <li>Its not for a clean shave.</li>
            <li>But this is not for the man looking to be completely clean shaven every morning.</li>
            <li>If you want a perfectly clean shave, this might not be the one for you.  </li>
            <li>However if you&#x27;re looking for a clean shave after the trim (to line the stubble)</li>
            <li>the digital length gauge works flawlessly, and makes it very easy to get the exact same cut every time.</li>
            <li>I wish Con air put more time into researching ways to improve this product rather than spend money selling the \\&quot;Super Hot Model attracted to the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow guy\\</li>
            <li>I loved the old one but the new one is even better.</li>
            <li>I was mistaken, but it does the stubble look great, and cuts very clean with few passes, just not my style.</li>
            <li>Good, but it goes back to original setting every time you turn it on, instead of staying at the setting the was set up by user.</li>
            <li>Other than that, its a good product and I recommend it for buyers wanting the most out of a shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Conair over the years and they&#x27;ve certainly become a name that I&#x27;ve grown to know, love and trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Conair over the years and they&#x27;ve certainly become a name that I&#x27;ve grown to know, love and trust.    </li>
            <li>The front comb takes some time getting used to specially the area under the nose.</li>
            <li>i love to have certain hair length on my face.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t hold a cake to the top contender, but for specializing in stubble, it does the job.</li>
            <li>and I just received it right on time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quick, easy, and painless to use (do my whole face in say 30 seconds).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quick, easy, and painless to use (do my whole face in say 30 seconds).</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try it out, but</li>
            <li>The length control is incredibly granular, down to .4mm (in .2mm increments)!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a unique look that looks great and can&#x27;t be done with any other beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful in appearance, larger than it looks, sleekly designed, and very well built.</li>
            <li>First shave, took a few minutes to figure out the best angle to hold it.  </li>
            <li>First one was defective, however the 2nd one has worked great for over a year.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only good part.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair grows really fast, so in a day or two there is a lot of it, well, except up top.</li>
            <li>In addition, the floating head feels good and, contrary to some reviewers, I had no problem shaping the stubble under the nose, though it did require some back and forth movements and, as in all razor situations, making faces.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t had a good enough reason to.</li>
            <li>It lights up and makes cool mechanical sounds as you adjust it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone that wants more options than 3 or 5 settings.</li>
            <li>I will try one more but it is a real gamble.</li>
            <li>You plug it in occasionally and you&#x27;re good to</li>
            <li>Despite the negative reviews I decided to give this a try... and to my delight it works GREAT!</li>
            <li>The cool color LED display makes the unit look like a work of art.  </li>
            <li>I think it took 15 min for a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should get a full refund on this ripoff of a product.</li>
            <li>LCD display shows selected length and charge level: This part is really cool -- that you can choose the length you want and read it on the screen.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even bother try using this with a full length beard.</li>
            <li>Works well for stubble, but not for full on beards.</li>
            <li>I got one full use out of it.</li>
            <li>But they seem to sacrifice function &amp; versatility, and opt for cool looking design (neon glow-in-dark display, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I just don&#x27;t want a drawer full of electronic grooming devices.</li>
            <li>But they seem to sacrifice function &amp; versatility, and opt for cool looking design (neon glow-in-dark display, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I just don&#x27;t want a drawer full of electronic grooming devices.</li>
            <li>Good overall trimming and range of options.</li>
            <li>Otherwise this is easy to clean, simple and nice for 5 o&#x27;clock shadows..</li>
            <li>Plus it looks cool.</li>
            <li>so I followed the directions and gave it a full 16 hour charge.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone needing a good beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I figured I would at least get a couple years out of the item, HUGE LETDOWN!!!!!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my son who likes the \\&quot;too cool to shave every day\\&quot; look...</li>
            <li>So I would say after two full uses, let it run and just let the battery die and recharge.  </li>
            <li>overall experience with this trimmer is good</li>
            <li>Received and immediately tried this since I have only heard good things.</li>
            <li>a full 16 hours per the directions.  </li>
            <li>will tell how it stands up... but initial impression is quite good.</li>
            <li>will tell how it stands up... but initial impression is quite good.</li>
            <li>I might hesitate to buy it because of the inability to trim near my nose and not doing a good job in getting consistent lengths all over.</li>
            <li>Most men do have trouble keeping up with the modern facial fashions and this has to be (according to my son) one of the best, if not the best trimmer on the market that he&#x27;s tried in a very long time!  </li>
            <li>he really likes that he can adjust the closeness and finds this razor comfortable to hold and easy to operate.</li>
            <li>Other wise its a great product for 4 months but a bit pricey for that short of a lifetime</li>
            <li>Easy to use and settings give exactly what&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li>Easy to program for exactly the length of stubble you want.</li>
            <li>other great statements on the box:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 2 other stubble razors and both held up, but didn&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li>instructions clearly say to charge the trimmer for 16 hrs before its first use, this is a must, according to the manufacturer, to make sure you get the most out of the battery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, if you want the shadow look or the perfec stubble, look no further, the Conair GMT900 is not just the tool you need, but it is well made, simple to use a true stubble trimmer.er gave me the perfect shadow look, the way my beard looks a day or two after I shave, which is my favourite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will note, that I had about 10mm or so of growth at first use and it did fine.</li>
            <li>First time used was fine but has not held a charge since</li>
            <li>Lastly, the contoured shape of the actual trimming attachment is excellent.</li>
            <li>The charge lasts a good amount of time, and the trimmer is really useful, especially on trips.</li>
            <li>No biggie, I keep a regular gilette Fusion for cleaning up my non stubble areas and the back razor on it is perfect for getting that bit under the nose.</li>
            <li>I was worried that the longest setting, 5 mm, would be too short, but the 4 mm setting works perfectly for the medium to short length that I like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to make a quick update on this item.</li>
            <li>up, it takes a while to charge, so don&#x27;t think when the battery dies you can just quickly charge and then continue shaving.</li>
            <li>The Wahl is super durable, so now I use the wahl just for shaping sideburns, and I use this for the stubble.  </li>
            <li>Vendor had quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to follow directions and charge completely before using and enjoy.</li>
            <li>I still use the trimmer two to three times a week for a quick trim in college.</li>
            <li>6/24/16 - After using this for almost 3 years I wanted to give a quick update.</li>
            <li>so I can fade my sideburns into my hair without issues, but you may want to keep a trimmer or something along those lines for under your nose and your sideburns if you have a longer hairstyle, although I also find that probably overkill, as flipping up the guard for edging purposes is extraordinarily</li>
            <li>&quot; Luckily, I came across this product and took a chance on it.</li>
            <li>Tried super glues and Bondic without sucess.</li>
            <li>gave it 4 stars because of how long I had my first one and how great it was.</li>
            <li>They warrantied it quickly and without issue.  </li>
            <li>and I like the fact I can quick charge if it runs out before I finish.</li>
            <li>Luckily after airing it out for a day it started working again.</li>
            <li>This is leaps and bounds better than anything I have been able to find at the big box stores.</li>
            <li>Works really well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>And it comes with a precision trimmer so you can clean up hairs on the edge of your lips and right underneath your nose.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that 0.4mm still seems like more than a day&#x27;s worth of growth, I&#x27;d love it if they could go even shorter</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with the iStubble trimmer overall.</li>
            <li>But some guys can rock the perpetual five-o-clock shadow and look great doing it, and they need a better answer than simply shaving every third day.</li>
            <li>may like a normal electric trimmer, with a plastic guide and metal blades, but the iStubble&#x27;s magic is its precision</li>
            <li>This is a great stubble trimmer, BUT after using it for 2 years now I have to say my only complaint is that the guard does not feel that great.</li>
            <li>; look, with a very consistent hair length.</li>
            <li>Pros - Even shave, great for sensitive skin, digital readout of blade length, comfortable to use&lt;br</li>
            <li>when trimming the edges I want a pretty precise cut</li>
            <li>Not really a negative ractor, since I remember what I like my settings at, but more of an inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the trimmer did work, it was really nice; clean, uniform and simple to use.</li>
            <li>Worked great for about 4 weeks, then the plastic that holds down the spring in the cutter assm.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is great and I highly recommend it for men who want the \\&quot;stubble look\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer,,, i use it maintain a good french beard,,, used it for a few weeks now,,, at the 0.4mm setting the beard is trimmed very fine,,,  has replaced my shaver for sure,,, also the ability to make sharp and neat shapes</li>
            <li>Worked great for one and a half years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was using a Toni and guy trimmer previously, and I am hAppy</li>
            <li>Odd shaped head, but it works great.</li>
            <li>Oddly, the comb isn&#x27;t user-replaceable, so you have to send it to Conair for replacement (they have great customer service though).</li>
            <li>You can go real close without the gaurs for a one day stubble look and the adjustments move easily up from there.</li>
            <li>The swivel head really makes it easy to contour to your face.  </li>
            <li>But having a trimmer that can adjust to different lengths without a drawer full of attachments is really nice.</li>
            <li>The way the guard flips up and the blade head pops off for easy cleaning was very well thought-out.</li>
            <li>Recently having stuble is a popular alternative to a full on shave.</li>
            <li>It really does glide easily over your skin as the video</li>
            <li>I researched for a long time to see what would be the best to maintain a constant stubble.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fast, easy,</li>
            <li>Last time it got a full soak, and that kind of did it.  </li>
            <li>The last trim was as good as the first.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen trimmers with much higher price tags that don&#x27;t do what the Conair Gmt900 does!    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it makes a mess at all, and the way the trimmer contours to your face is great.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>Also, remember to charge the battery for 16H on the first charge to ensure maximum battery life!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a STUBBLE trimmer which does exactly that!</li>
            <li>They have a great warranty policy &amp; I ended getting a new one in the mail 7 days later!</li>
            <li>It has no thin blade to clean out the edges and corners, or clean out the neck area.</li>
            <li>He was in love, no complaints and over a year later, the trimmer is going strong.  </li>
            <li>It shaves quickly and efficiently while also being nice and quiet.</li>
            <li>It makes it very quick and easy to get a neat, even trim of my beard, much more so than other beard trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past.verall.</li>
            <li>Yes a clipper is great, but being able to see the setting of last use and in general is very help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I casually mentioned that I got a new trimmer at work and two guys at work chimed in that they also own it and think it&#x27;s the greatest trimmer they&#x27;ve ever used as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to use battery life is standard.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is great, it&#x27;s quick, easy to use, has customizable size settings, and the battery lasts a ridiculous amount of time.</li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;trim/shave&amp;#34; this morning with the i-Stubble was quick, comfortable and allowed me to get much much closer than I was ever able to with my old beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this device and only wish I could return the other for a full refund.</li>
            <li>Works great for keeping that little bit of stubble that I like.</li>
            <li>Great product for maintaining stubble on different levels, quiet precise too.</li>
            <li>This was a great investment in my opinion, if you&#x27;re trying to get the after 5&#x27;oclock look or the few days without shaving look</li>
            <li>I wanted a fast and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used a friends prior to purchasing and just had to get my own.  </li>
            <li>Have had no cutting issues with it.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, you have to charge this puppy for 16 hours and it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>the Conair Gmt900 Istubble is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The i Stubble has been by far one of his (and my) favorite Christmas presents this year.</li>
            <li>all hairs have had a chance to come out, and even if all cut at 0.4 mm they do clearly form thicker and more pronounced stubble.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost perfect, but I still give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s not deserving of losing a whole star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as the price goes, this one looks even better in person and the simplicity of use makes it worth the money to me.  </li>
            <li>As far as the price goes, this one looks even better in person and the simplicity of use makes it worth the money to me.  </li>
            <li>I have tried regular razors, the $300 Philips Norelco 3D, the cheap versions of that, and many others.</li>
            <li>Some NiMH batteries suffer from short shelf lives, but the fact that this trimmer buzzed very well fresh out the package is good indication to me that it&#x27;s a quality battery.  </li>
            <li>digital display on the iStubble is also a nice touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also useful even if you&#x27;re clean-shaven or beardy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also useful even if you&#x27;re clean-shaven or beardy.</li>
            <li>The device works OK but after only 4 months of use maybe twice a week, the cheap plastic trimmer guide broke off.  </li>
            <li>I like the adjustable levels, and rarely cut my skin.</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>: this razor is truly worth the money.</li>
            <li>It rarely has to charge, and I think you can use it even while it is charging if needed.</li>
            <li>I felt it was worth pointing out for those who might not realize this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would be nice if you could simply rinse off the excess hair on the blade like my cruZer 6, but I like the way this one cuts and feels while trimming.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the digital control over the length</li>
            <li>Throwing it in the garbage was worth one star.</li>
            <li>Gotta let it charge a full 24 hours before first use.</li>
            <li>so far i love it.</li>
            <li>does a good job, cuts even,  multiple length settings without  multiple  clips too attach, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I have almost 2 weeks worth of growth</li>
            <li>but it is well worth it for the cut.</li>
            <li>So much easier than the straight blades I&#x27;ve used all my life, not to mention that a bit of stubble looks better.</li>
            <li>Swiveling head to make it more comfortable around facial</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>The head, blade, and comb are easy to clean with an old toothbrush and the directions suggest lubricating the blades with the included oil monthly.</li>
            <li>but it seems worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked it and would buy again.</li>
            <li>This item is fantastic and I would recommend to anyone, it cuts well, one tiny thing I would say would be that make sure you lube it with the lube that comes with it</li>
            <li>Worth the $$$</li>
            <li>Its mono directional pivoting head glides over the surface of the skin easily / smoothly and I find that I only need 1 - 2 passes to collect most hair.</li>
            <li>Also, folding the comb back to use the blade to trim the neckline, around the ear, sideburns &amp; close shave is nice beause</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different buzzer trimmer things, ranging from your cheap $10 Wal-Mart Remmington trimmer to the $40 Wahl hair trimmer from Costco without the clip.</li>
            <li>The Wahl did a nice job, but this Conair \\&quot;iStubble\\&quot; (which may be the stupidest name for a product in human history) seems to rule</li>
            <li>The box also had kind of a white sticker on it, could be that this sticker is to denote that the item is used and has been returned.</li>
            <li>Pretty Sweet.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this a couple months ago, but I decided to wait to review it until I had some time with it to see how I liked it.</li>
            <li>I keep a very short stubble beard (slightly more filled in for the goatee area).</li>
            <li>For that sole purpose, it&#x27;s the most comfortable device I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I have loved Amazon (I&#x27;ve been a Prime member for several years), but this has really soiled my impression of Amazon.</li>
            <li>For example, the Wahl razor this replaces, while not as nice of a tool overall</li>
            <li>That makes it worth it for me despite the annoyingness of charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps that phrase is inappropriate for a beard trimmer, but I found this product to be well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>motors are really powerful</li>
            <li>and I could use this for around 45 minutes after the first full charge of 16 hours</li>
            <li>But, it has the adjustable levels so that makes it more precise for what your personally want.</li>
            <li>but no other unit shave as close, easy and comfortable as this..</li>
            <li>There is no vacuum, but there is a catch that collects most of your stubble unless you are making a significant trim.</li>
            <li>Perfect for all facial and other needs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike some of the other reviews that remove stars because they still need different trimmers for under nose, etc... this product works perfectly for my moustache and goatee</li>
            <li>/&gt;I came to like the iStubble pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I came to like the iStubble pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>very comfortable consistent soft shave.</li>
            <li>others, I bought this because it looks cool and received positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it cuts fairly well, and the maximum 5mm setting is just about right.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the most precise and easy to use facial trimmer I have ever used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable trimmer that hates the clean shaven look!</li>
            <li>A single pass and every single hair looks perfectly trimmed and even?</li>
            <li>I researched the hell out of beard trimmers before purchasing this one and I made the right decision.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>I used it right out of the box</li>
            <li>&quot; right.</li>
            <li>As you know the clean-stubble look is in right now.</li>
            <li>It is all built right in.</li>
            <li>had issues with this right off the bat.</li>
            <li>; rapid charging system - 90 minute charge provides 45 minutes use: That&#x27;s probably about right.</li>
            <li>just the right look you&#x27;ve been going for.</li>
            <li>For $45 US, it is in the right price bracket.   </li>
            <li>Right off the bat the trimmer didn&#x27;t hold charge</li>
            <li>I chose this trimmer watching the video review on youtube and tell you what the video gets it right on the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the 1.6 length is just about right for the half-beard that drives the fellas crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The settings and cut are right</li>
            <li>and no matter how you try to shape your face - there&#x27;s just not a way you can get those hairs right under your nose, so</li>
            <li>never, ever reaches the area right under my nose; I have to finish with scissors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have a non-movable trimmer right in there.</li>
            <li>Garbage did not work right out of box</li>
            <li>I do it with my old trimmer, and it works great - clean, sharp lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer about 1.5 years ago and was happy first few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product build seems fine, and it is easy enough to use.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Its great for the first few shaves.</li>
            <li>Once again I can only praise this product but make sure you give it the full 16 hour charge</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying the idea of getting this product came about as a simpler way to look clean in college without taking as much time to shave.</li>
            <li>It is surprisingly quiet and very easy to set the trim length.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to adjust settings for different heights, and the guard goes with the contour of your face.</li>
            <li>The trimmer has a digital length indicator which makes it very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to adjust for different lengths depending on your mood or needs.</li>
            <li>, the blade snaps out and back in very easily.</li>
            <li>This little guy is amazing!</li>
            <li>That said the way the height mechanism leverages makes it have a very large rear head (not shown in the product picture), which is tricky to get under a Roman nose like mine.  </li>
            <li>All in all, with this device it takes literally less than 5 minutes to have the perfect length of stubble or short beard every day.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly easy to use, allows very simple yet precise control of stubble length, and let&#x27;s me get my stubble to the length I want in about one</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a great stubble trimer for years now and really thought this would be the one, based on the previous reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily i was able to open it up and it started working again.</li>
            <li>Good quality razor, though I wish it could get slightly closer...leaves about 2 days worth of growth at the .4 length</li>
            <li>Lightweight, easy to use and operate, in my opinion, an excellent purchase ... now the only thing is to check how long it will last (:</li>
            <li>My husband has not been able to adjust the levels, so he&#x27;s still using his old shaver most days, and this one only 1-2x/week.  </li>
            <li>Humbly, long before &amp;#34;the look&amp;#34; became popular.  </li>
            <li>this one is really good value for money and provides and nice clean height to your beard, only problem is its hard shave around under your nose/top lip.</li>
            <li>He is extremely picky about having the perfect trim and has tried multiple trimmers ranging from high end items to practical ones and this is his favorite by far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually pretty good at assembling things, but I can&#x27;t currently figure out how the two blades and the spring fit back in Satan&#x27;s trimmer.</li>
            <li>Even trimming, fast, comfortable, digital display, self adjusting guard, looks great, long charge.  </li>
            <li>the spacer is a good 1/2 inch or more ahead of the cutter and that makes for problems... especially when the leading edges are so dang sharp.</li>
            <li>In addition, there are certain spots it just can&#x27;t get!  </li>
            <li>This is great for people with different styles of facial hair.  </li>
            <li>trimmer I had before this is probably 5 years old and still going strong.</li>
            <li>Using the iStubble one handed was easy and fairly natural, the weight and balance</li>
            <li>Using the iStubble one handed was easy and fairly natural, the weight and balance</li>
            <li>Sure, there is also a substantial price difference as well, about double, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it in the end given the ease of use and precision.</li>
            <li>The result is that a day or two \\&quot;natural\\&quot; stubble after a good shave will be less dense than the day after day use of the iStubble.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll happily give it back if the replacement works properly over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll happily give it back if the replacement works properly over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The length adjusting buttons are clearly marked and easy to manipulate, even while I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: after a few weeks of using this trimmer im on the lookout for a more powerfull machine with a better battery life.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very picky and has only amazing things to say about this.  </li>
            <li>Ergonomic design for easy control and complete comfort:</li>
            <li>Overall, I find this trimmer to be very convenient to use (no storage, losing and various length switching blade screens), easy to use with good battery life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not loud, easy to hold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great for facial hair, neck, back and everything</li>
            <li>Quite happy overall, but if 50% charge and you don&#x27;t oil the blades or regularly (oil provided), neck hair can be tugged and cause alot of discomfort and blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s great for keeping your beard, mustache &amp; hair short.</li>
            <li>It was a bit more expensive than others, but I must say it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say the pulling is NOT normal.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find the right position or positions to help you keep your facial hair the way you want it, or try something</li>
            <li>It is a little tough getting your stache right under your nose as some have mentioned, but still doable; honestly though I&#x27;ve yet to see a razor or trimmer with a guard get there perfectly anyway.</li>
            <li>They both love them, and I love their tame beards</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the battery used to be really good in the beginning (about 4-6 shaves worth) but after about a year or two really went down in quality (about 2 shaves-worth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads</li>
            <li>It also charges VERY fast.</li>
            <li>very fast 5oclock shadow shave which what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The battery wears down kind of quickly and it can&#x27;t be used while plugged in   </li>
            <li>While the trimmer works fine, it is completely non-water resistant.</li>
            <li>I found the unit very well built and very user friendly.</li>
            <li>Worked fine till just over a year old...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every stubble trimmer out there, and this is the most comfortable due to the plastic comb that glides along the face.</li>
            <li>I think Conair should continue with this line of trimmers, though I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve hit the sweet spot in this particular incarnation.  </li>
            <li>I really thought this would be the perfect facial hair trimmer for me... and it was... for less than 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for the overall design, it would be nice if it came with a stand, like products that Phillips offer, which are neat and tidy and allow for the power supply cord to essentially be hidden.</li>
            <li>Has good adjustable settings, I would say its for those who like to keep a 5oclock shadow going or to trim it close but not clean shaven.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing some people glared over that little detail and it changed their view of how good the trimmer was in their opinion[s].  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing some people glared over that little detail and it changed their view of how good the trimmer was in their opinion[s].  </li>
            <li>so you may have to wait just a little, but eh still good</li>
            <li>Excellent product, wish the cutting blade was a little wider but otherwise great.  </li>
            <li>The length choices are good for people with longer facial hair needing to achieve a \\&quot;darker\\&quot; or more full look, but keep everything neat, clean and intentional stubbly is the name of the game here.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very surprised that it&#x27;s received so many positive reviews, but be warned that this trimmer may hurt a lot more than you ever expected.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>This razor does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and lasts long on a charge.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this Trimmer and would not EVER use another different Trimmer AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li>If its maximum length is the same as the minimum on most clippers..</li>
            <li>It is, after all, exactly for what it&#x27;s name implies.. stubble.. and stubble alone.  </li>
            <li>It does the job and gives a pretty close trim.</li>
            <li>If you purchase this trimmer, be sure to handle it with care because it&#x27;s fragile.</li>
            <li>Let me first start off by saying I&#x27;ve read the biggest portion of the reviews for this trimmer here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I charged mine for 3 days for 4 hours and maybe even an extra day for maybe another hour or so to be sure it would be fully functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I charged mine for 3 days for 4 hours and maybe even an extra day for maybe another hour or so to be sure it would be fully functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cut height returns to &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; each time, It doesn&#x27;t hold a memory of where you set the depth, so you have to adjust it first each time you use it.  </li>
            <li>I have a corded model, a cordless model, and my most recent purchase a Bald Fader.</li>
            <li>I flipped the guard back and used the included brush to sweep away the hair buildup on the blade and the shave was so much better.</li>
            <li>While giving it its first 16hr charge, I read over the instructions to familiarize myself with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first one died after the rechargeable battery gave up after 2 years of use.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Comfortable &amp; offers many lengths without multiple attachments</li>
            <li>I did follow the manual that charge it for 16 hrs at the first.</li>
            <li>I call the hot line telephone number, from the body of the trimmer, since it comes with a two year warranty.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well for just over four monthes</li>
            <li>I personally use it on the 1.4mm setting where the stubble is a bit more visible.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>This is the first stubble shaver I&#x27;ve used but in reviewing others I wanted one that looked like it would get the hairs that grow against the skin.</li>
            <li>So, as soon as it arrived, I handed it to him and he couldn&#x27;t believe just how low and precise the iStubble cut!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This came charged and ready to use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen trimmers with much higher price tags that don&#x27;t do what the Conair Gmt900 does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I broke my first one by dropping it...</li>
            <li>Guys if you are looking for a quality stubble shaver and more, this in my opinion is the ultimate.</li>
            <li>I can see this motorized length control as the first thing to break since you have to adjust the length on every use.    </li>
            <li>At first, I thought I would just use it at it&#x27;s lowest setting all the time, but after I saw how close it can get I will probably using a step or 2 higher.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I&#x27;ve been able to keep it alive by immediately drying it out with some heat after the occasional accident, but I don&#x27;t expect this to work</li>
            <li>Fortunately I&#x27;ve been able to keep it alive by immediately drying it out with some heat after the occasional accident, but I don&#x27;t expect this to work forever.</li>
            <li>You will have to oil it, as with many trimmers, but the numerous settings makes it so much easier to trim anything to need to trim!</li>
            <li>Sure, with the guard in place - you&#x27;ll be left looking like Hitler.</li>
            <li>The first was when I attempted to trim my sideburns.</li>
            <li>This one for variable length trimming, and my old hacksaw for precise lines.</li>
            <li>I bought this Trimmer for a friend and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>The Conair would be okay for short beards, but I found it rather &#x27;grabby&#x27; when using at its shortest setting (0.4 mm).  </li>
            <li>Plugs in (so no recharging), runs at a higher RPM, and cuts through like nothing.</li>
            <li>This will be the last one I ever purchase cuzz it doesnt get better than this.</li>
            <li>Product does exactly was it is meant to do with ease.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>The ONLY trimmer my husband has ever used more than once.  </li>
            <li>I thought for sure it would die at first contact with hair, but it is just that quiet.</li>
            <li>, even bleary-eyed first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I followed the recommendations for first charge and charging thereafter.</li>
            <li>I look so hot</li>
            <li>application for purpose make this a first rate trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and it will definitely be all of my buddies&#x27; christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li>so you can get a consistent trim each time you use it.</li>
            <li>is that the trimer guard is not removable, which means you can&#x27;t really do any edging with this device (if it does come off and someone knows how, please let me know!)</li>
            <li>Finally, it keeps losing its setting when it&#x27;s swtiched off for a more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I went with this one, and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I love the way that the blade adjusts through the buttons and has a digital display for the length setting.  </li>
            <li>You just have to get up in there and make a bit of a funny face.  </li>
            <li>Traditional blades were always harmful to me as they delivered too close of a shave and contributed to more razor bumps.</li>
            <li>and you have to pull the head up its pain and its slowwww compaired to old cheap norelco</li>
            <li>I bought it for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re cool with the downsides, you&#x27;ll likely really enjoy owning this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Read the instructions - charge it for 16 hours before first use.</li>
            <li>Did intense research and this seemed really worth it.</li>
            <li>It also cuts very short (way shorter than Philips) and gets a more consistent length cut.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>I must&#x27;ve convinced myself that this fancy adjustable digital display one was better, but it really just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>So, in mid-late December I asked for this as a present for Christmas and if I was to be honest it does everything necessary as a trimmer for a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li>You are even able to disconnect the razor attachment and get under there if deemed necessary.  </li>
            <li>MAKE SURE you follow the directions for the initial charge up (which is 11-12 hours), and that you hold the razor correctly.</li>
            <li>The first time I went to try this</li>
            <li>It really is a pleasure to use!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help resisting writing about the marketing folks that worked on this product first.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>the blade mechanism  malfunction since first use</li>
            <li>So when having some beard stubble became more acceptable and fashionable in recent years, I decided to try a stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li>I ordered it more than 6 months ago but used it in the last 4 months</li>
            <li>This trimmer is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It says on the plug, &amp;#34;Charge 16 hours first time&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this one and was psyched the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>first time, the blades detached from the motor/actuator.</li>
            <li>The first had two issues.</li>
            <li>Make sure to trim multiple times to get consistent stubble (see the iStubble usage video, search on youtube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>if it could only fix the gray that is coming out in my beard.... :)</li>
            <li>, I first tried it at 1mm</li>
            <li>OK this is the second one I owned.</li>
            <li>I have concluded now that my first one died from over charging.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have written a review on a product I have purchased through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I bought one for my husband first and my son started to borrow it</li>
            <li>The first was a cheaper one I found in CVS.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to tailor my beard as it was a first time growing it out.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a all-in-one trimmer/groomer for goatee or stubble, I&#x27;d recommend something more versatile, such as ([[ASIN</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a all-in-one trimmer/groomer for goatee or stubble, I&#x27;d recommend something more versatile, such as ([[ASIN</li>
            <li>did exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li>No problems with this trimmer except my first one stopped working after 6 months.</li>
            <li>My last electric trimmer lasted for many years</li>
            <li>Granted, most of the trimmers I bought were on the low end, so I decided to invest in</li>
            <li>You must charge it for 16 hours the first time, and every once in a while thereafter.</li>
            <li>I wish it would not reset to the lowest setting every time, but I love how well it works at keeping my beard short.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Short story is, mine started malfunctioning after the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love that it is digital, and how the head bends with every arch of your face/head.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have never used a trimmer like this that has ever cut my skin... until now.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, soft on your face, doesn&#x27;t pull, and the trimmer and head unit glides over your face and cheek bones without pulling hair as it trims.</li>
            <li>first me</li>
            <li>I have to go over the same spots again to make sure it trims evenly.</li>
            <li>With the regular daily use, I think this should give me enough credibility to review this trimmer with excellent judgement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This device was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Followed all the instructions, charged for 16 hours before first use, cleaned after each use, kept away from water.</li>
            <li>pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The guard flips back allowing for even closer shaving and touching up.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Pros: Many levels of stubble are possible.</li>
            <li>And I have used many different styles and brands over the years.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>However, after using this (just used the blades straight on my hair/skin), my face no longer got shaving bumps!</li>
            <li>Blue LED light is cool which monitors the battery and the adjustable level for length.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and thought I would take my chances because I like the idea, so I ordered this trimmer and followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>I love the digital control to adjust the length.</li>
            <li>Still holding a charge pretty</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It worked fairly well and was pleased until i tried to use it the next day and was completely dead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While not perfect, this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned yet.  </li>
            <li>Even if it only lasts a year I will gladly but another at this price.</li>
            <li>That seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>Hence the review ;)</li>
            <li>,  it can give you a real close &amp;quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;quot; to a nice long stubble..  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still recommend this but just be aware of the battery issue..</li>
            <li>/&gt;You have to charge it for 16 hours the first time before using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This trimmer trims my beard exactly as I want it trimmed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d even be willing to help if you need someone to test it.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I like all of the different settings and the fact that I can use it while plugged in and charging (unlike many electric razors).</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It fell apart the first week I had it</li>
            <li>It makes life that much easier so its worth it...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and light hair</li>
            <li>This is the first item I&#x27;ve ever been compelled to rate on Amazon after years of using prime.</li>
            <li>When I first got this trimmer, I followed the instructions and everything</li>
            <li>yet it broke within 5 min of me first using it.</li>
            <li>... I love that it goes up in increments of .2 mm starting with from .4</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Sure you will get different trims depending on if you use your dominant hand vs. your none dominant hand.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s exactly the stubble length I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Love the multiple length settings.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you very carefully wrap it in clothing (or better, ensure that the head can&#x27;t press against anything) you&#x27;d be ok, but I would advise against putting it in a suitcase unless you put it back in the original package.</li>
            <li>The design allows for easy maneuverability over the contours of your face and for easily lining up around sideburns or other close</li>
            <li>Super precise settings make this a must for anyone wanting to fine-tune facial hair.  </li>
            <li>worked for about a week or so, then started making loud noise and kept pinching me every time i shaved, do not buy!!!!</li>
            <li>you can shave fast, clean it fast, and it holds a charge for a long time (even when weaken) I love it, and would buy again.</li>
            <li>If your made of money and want to buy a new one every 6 months, then not a bad product.  </li>
            <li>For more meticulous people you may want to go a little more high end.</li>
            <li>But there are a lot of shortcomings - most importantly the fact that a little bit of water can kill it and because I need to carry a 2nd trimmer with me most of the time.</li>
            <li>It measures in millimeters, and gives you that nice short, rugged, yet professional shave every time!</li>
            <li>However, it does cut very smoothly and cleanly, and with less irritation than any trimmer I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>In fact I plugged it in before I left for work around 7am and didnt use it for the first time until the following morning giving it a good first charge.  </li>
            <li>This would be handy for trimming hair in other places.  </li>
            <li>The floating head and sharp blades give nice even results.</li>
            <li>Glad to report this one does the job and seems to be worth what I spent on it.  </li>
            <li>Glad to report this one does the job and seems to be worth what I spent on it.  </li>
            <li>My main goal was to look for something that could maintain a stubble look of about a 3-5 days worth of growth.  </li>
            <li>I hope this is the last review, because I have tried several trimmers and none as good as this one.</li>
            <li>and it has many settings, including  a 0.4 setting that gives you a really CLOSE trim, yet leaves just enough there to give you &amp;#34;that look&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Simply flip the guide to the back, grab the included brush and give it a good swipe accross the trimming head, then, apply a drop or two of the included oil</li>
            <li>Simply flip the guide to the back, grab the included brush and give it a good swipe accross the trimming head, then, apply a drop or two of the included oil</li>
            <li>quick, clean, short.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant when purchasing this trimmer, but I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>Amazing little shaver, great battery life once broken in, easy to clean and cuts very short.</li>
            <li>so the first charge should be a full sixteen hours followed by three complete cycles of completely discharging the battery and recharging it to full capacity to achieve maximum battery performance.</li>
            <li>I have owned easily a dozen clippers/trimmers of all kinds; however, this guy has convinced me that this is truly the FIRST facial hair trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Taking apart the head and cleaning the blades is pretty simple and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cool looking, with digital programmable adjustable length (from .4 mm to 5 mm).</li>
            <li>However, I was under no obligation whatsoever to give it a positive review, and in fact I found some flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep the charger handy as it will run low after a few (3-5) uses.</li>
            <li>I generally use it on the longest setting (5.0) because the shorter ones make a light beard invisible but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>Sure, there is also a substantial price difference as well, about double, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it in the end given the ease of use and precision.he guide was removed and the head contacted skin directly.  </li>
            <li>But within its operational range this thing works very well and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>My almost tireless search pretty much ended when I found the ~$24 Gillette Proglide Trimmer System.</li>
            <li>This trimmer really seems like a great idea, but ultimately fails to be as precise as it tricks you into thinking it is.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning could not be easier, the blade (and all the hair) is accessible by popping off the top guard, run the included brush through a few times and your done.</li>
            <li>The charge lasts an extremely long time and will provide many uses.  </li>
            <li>have used this every other day for the last year, and it still works great.</li>
            <li>I first bought the BabyLiss i-stuble trimmer (which really looks identical by the way), and it did not work (just didn&#x27;t charge), so I had to return it.  </li>
            <li>The head pivots-extremely cool for precision and for those like me with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>3: It is sturdy and the design is cool but definitely not a heavy duty trimmer that you will hand over to your son someday...</li>
            <li>The battery lasts long (so long as you charge it the full 16 hours before you first use it), it is easy to use, it comfortably glides over your face and neck.  </li>
            <li>causing me to seriously question why so many people seem to have so many issues.  </li>
            <li>My main issue with most of the trimmers have been their ability to get the hairs without having to go back and forth a hundred times.</li>
            <li>For the price, honestly, I&#x27;m a bit let down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why it has to be so large, but it does feel good in the hand.</li>
            <li>The built in trim guard can easily be flipped back so that you can use just the bare cutters - this is great for getting around tight spots like around your nose.  </li>
            <li>The length adjustments are smooth and accurate; I&#x27;ve used multiple trimmers and most have trouble getting an even length around my neck area, but the iStubble got the length I prefer spot on.  </li>
            <li>sure to charge for a full day before using and use the first (and second and third) charge fully, before recharging.  </li>
            <li>This new trimmer is the same as the old trimmer and works great with a sharp trimmer to comfortably cut beard hair.  </li>
            <li>He loves the digital screen and the easy controls.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*It is easy enough to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades come un-oiled and the trimmer head seemed jammed when I first turned it on ,like many have said.</li>
            <li>So if you want a non irritating and non-adjustable shave, check out the Styliner, but if you&#x27;d like an adjustable trimmer, the iStubble is pretty great ignoring the battery life.</li>
            <li>The shaver is easy to use and maintain and relatively quiet for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I have no problem saying that I believe this could take a daily use easily.</li>
            <li>While its not as easy, its still relatively simple to reach that spot.  </li>
            <li>Only problem is it can break easily if dropped.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t easily be replaced, and now the *only* thing I can use it for is close shave (you can&#x27;t adjust it *</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t nick me, didn&#x27;t make me red, and it&#x27;s easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>Although this is a current Conair product and the comb is easily replaceable, Conair does not have replacement parts.</li>
            <li>Apparently rims beard nice and short</li>
            <li>This was to replace a previous i-Stubble that my son really liked.  </li>
            <li>That is a minor complaint for an awesome product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The digital display is easy to read, and the way the guard is designed it moves across my face with ease.</li>
            <li>This is pure nonsense.</li>
            <li>have always wanted to keep my stubble beard at one certain length each and every day for decades.  </li>
            <li>: The comb is gentle on the skin, it holds a charge for a long time (I use it once to twice a week and have only had to charge it about 9 times in the 18 months), and it is quick and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take a little more time if I want precise trimming around my nose, but I find this is true of any trimmer with a guard; your nose is simply too close to your mustache!</li>
            <li>: work your way down to progressively shorter lengths until you&#x27;re sure you have the right length.</li>
            <li>It cuts my facial hair to a fine stubble.</li>
            <li>After the initial 16 hour charge everything is fine.</li>
            <li>They also include a handy little brush for cleaning it after use and mineral oil for lubricating the blades.</li>
            <li>It is not perfect but it is very good.</li>
            <li>you can get past those two minor issues then buy this product, it does a very good job maintaining that stubble look.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;first, this thing is fast and cuts so good, it&#x27;s hard to believe how well it really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every beard/mustache trimmer on the market with a few exceptions[mostly the Braun cruzers, Phillips &#x27;perfect stubble&#x27;, and a few others].  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every beard/mustache trimmer on the market with a few exceptions[mostly the Braun cruzers, Phillips &#x27;perfect stubble&#x27;, and a few others].  </li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re trying to make your mustache the same length as your beard, you won&#x27;t have an accurate length unless you use scissors.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li>He has even left it off the charger for a few days and it held a great charge.  </li>
            <li>Until I bought and used the Conair GMT900, I had no idea how much difference in appearance would result from a trimmer that precisely cut all bristles to the same length.  </li>
            <li>so I cant comment on the battery life that a few people have mentioned, but overall this is a great product</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much</li>
            <li>The comb stayed in place the whole time the trimmer was in use and didn&#x27;t tug or pull whatso</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have plenty of hair on the side of my head that grows insanely fast.</li>
            <li>So I found that Bald Fader was REALLY close</li>
            <li>Holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li>to its marketing, the iStubble worked very well when used as intended.  </li>
            <li>it works fast anyway.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.      </li>
            <li>Considering my boyfriend is BEYOND VERY picky, that is a feat in itself.</li>
            <li>would recommend this trimmer if you are not concerned with longevity of your product and an amenable customer service department.</li>
            <li>The real test will be when he shaves his head with it.</li>
            <li>And it does seem to cut hair to .4 mm, which seems to be a much closer cut than the competition.</li>
            <li>I really like the electronic mechanism that raises the the trimmer to your desired setting.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t want that half-trimmed look haha).</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>Performs as advertised, simple to use and is hassle free.</li>
            <li>That means I can FINALLY get rid of the pile that I have in my closet in the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swiveling head flips up and open so that you can clean it easily with the oil and brush that comes with the Conair iStubble itself.  </li>
            <li>It comes highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>It comes highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and IStuble.</li>
            <li>I have very &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>What seems to happen is that an opening on the height-adjustment for the blade causes the softer skin on your face to fill the opening more than the harder skin leaving inconsistent stubble length.  </li>
            <li>I really like stubble beards.</li>
            <li>The Wahl trimmer I recently purchased feels cheap in comparison.</li>
            <li>iStubble trims very neatly even for medium length beards.</li>
            <li>I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not so much with the GMT900.</li>
            <li>He says it is really gentle on his skin</li>
            <li>and it gives him the effect that he wants when shaving.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to using it as my primary trimmer for several years to come.</li>
            <li>I really like these clippers</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this trimmer to all men in the market for a trimmer.</li>
            <li>This item is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It seems like this part is not designed very well.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the closest shave available for a facial trimmer.</li>
            <li>Never could&#x27;ve expected better.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, even to Hawaii.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well on your mustache area</li>
            <li>A very close shave also if needed.</li>
            <li>Overall, it works well and it works comfortably.</li>
            <li>Does a very even job, but you have to go over your beard in a couple of directions.</li>
            <li>I feel like I can trim with just a couple passes in a very controlled manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>does not shave VERY close</li>
            <li>From day one this trimmer was a pain to use and gave a very inconsistent length trim.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to try a &#x27;stubble&#x27; approach and found this product to really stand out.  </li>
            <li>This has been proven to increase alertness in the morning using intense agony to really wake you</li>
            <li>The manual has a diagram of the device, but said diagram doesn&#x27;t show the blades or how they fit back in.</li>
            <li>I just want to trim my &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34;, thanks.</li>
            <li>The lowest setting did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>This one has a floating head, which means it moves to the contours of your face and makes the whole process a lot easier.</li>
            <li>It work really well.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast .  </li>
            <li>once you find the proper length , its smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>Feels like it should cost three times as much as it does.</li>
            <li>Works really well ...</li>
            <li>Thanks, Tom   EDIT:</li>
            <li>I have found this product to be even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really like the razor</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really get my mustache area as well as I can get everything else</li>
            <li>really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>It shaves really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I paid roughly $50 for it, so I&#x27;m not going to just stop using it, and I hope it (maybe?) gets better, but</li>
            <li>I really like this trimer with one exception.</li>
            <li>It absolutely does not hold a charge for longer than one use.</li>
            <li>It cuts fast and without pulling&lt;br</li>
            <li>have a moustache and goatee and really don&#x27;t like to blade</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really use electric shavers (norelco, braun, etc.)</li>
            <li>really like how it goes in increments</li>
            <li>Plus the battery holds a charge really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only downside is (and I&#x27;m being very picky since I haven&#x27;t come across one that does it) is when changing sizes (i.e. from 0.4 to 0.6) it powers off.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this one by Conair!</li>
            <li>This is my whole head shaver, face and hair (shaved head).  </li>
            <li>So the product works really well for its intended purpose.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it is straight forward to use and automatically switches off after a minute or so of non-use.   </li>
            <li>what so ever compared to shaving, and is much happier.</li>
            <li>Adjusts better than expected.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand the logic of Conair.</li>
            <li>It cuts very well.</li>
            <li>These things take much longer to use that hair clippers.  </li>
            <li>And it really does --</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t to much to it.</li>
            <li>so you cant really complain about</li>
            <li>It feels like a very well put together unit and the motor driven adjustment system</li>
            <li>works really</li>
            <li>A friggin&#x27; shame really.</li>
            <li>Very even trim on my head and face.</li>
            <li>It seems very well engineered.</li>
            <li>I also get a really close trim with this iStubble making it look like I had shaved my face a day ago.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s adjustable but it still doesn&#x27;t add much variety in length.  </li>
            <li>thing really works and is really helpful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>But the real kicker is my face is a lot happier since I stopped shaving.</li>
            <li>This is not seen same as others which I bought from the stores that available outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From the specs and features, I really like it</li>
            <li>: The blade broke after three months, had to toss the whole thing.</li>
            <li>I did the whole charging thing and</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>Theres like 8 different settings so it will create a smooth fade.</li>
            <li>(it makes that much of a difference).</li>
            <li>I really like the way this one cuts.</li>
            <li>holds the charge reasonably well</li>
            <li>Gives a much closer trim than my Philips-Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great idea, poor execution.</li>
            <li>The Istubble is a much easier system for us grooming at home.</li>
            <li>I have found it very reliable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being 21, I&#x27;ve not had much experience with beards.  </li>
            <li>This product is absolute garbage.</li>
            <li>and I really like when he has the &amp;#34;hasn&#x27;t shaved in 2 days&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>He loves that he can set it on whatever length he wants.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely unacceptable.</li>
            <li>I use the shaver for about 2 minutes in the morning and done; so much easier than shaving every day for work.</li>
            <li>Noisy, does not work straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>I use this to trim my goatee and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the micro adjustments that can be made, it is used for all the hair on my body.</li>
            <li>The clipper is also wide so gets more done in each pass.</li>
            <li>Does not work on side burns very well.  </li>
            <li>much do I like this thing?</li>
            <li>People have been reporting that theirs go out much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides, you can have a very close shave if you use the device without the comb head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spent way too many hours reading reviews, looking on the internet, watching videos to pick a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I can&#x27;t see any way to really improve on it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, this is for someone who wants a stubble type beard.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, this is for someone who wants a stubble type beard.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li>Always room for improvement, but this felt like just a tad too much room.</li>
            <li>The trimmer has nice features but is pinches the skin around the lip area and cannot  trim close under the nose leaving an uneven trim</li>
            <li>With full charge for the first 4 months, it lasted about 20 to 30 mins (non-stop), after 6 months to a year, fully charged battery life can only sustain about 15 to 20mins...</li>
            <li>if I could give this a negative review I would, bought this and straight out of the box, I knew it couldn&#x27;t be good</li>
            <li>I liked the iStubble a lot but only very briefly.  </li>
            <li>It makes it very quick and easy to get a neat, even trim of my beard, much more so than other beard trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>This is a great stubble/beard trimmer so long as you do not need to shave down to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Also, I participated in Movember and grew a full beard this time and this trimmer was fantastic when I shaved down into my mustache of choice to end the month.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as intended and is not hard to operate.</li>
            <li>I have very dense, thick facial hair and this one is able to managed it easily to maintain it at a true stubble length (1mm and shorter).&lt;br</li>
            <li>then this item will most certainly NOT replace what you&#x27;re already using.  </li>
            <li>Oddly large head, but works better than other options tried.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m really into new age technology and was the first to buy a CD player on my block)  </li>
            <li>I received this facial hair trimmer through the Amazon Vine program and it really does a great job of trimming my beard down to very light stubble without looking patchy or uneven.  </li>
            <li>Thank you conair, you&#x27;ve finally put my endless hours spent shopping for and trying for the perfect trimmer to rest.!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to someone who wants to keep sideburns or a short goatee trimmed and nice looking, but for beards of ANY length it is just too messy and it takes longer to clean up everything</li>
            <li>However, I ordered a new one because my first one would no longer charge.</li>
            <li>The head adjusts easily and the batter lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It usually (like above) takes about 2-3 minutes of just making sure I went over every area to have a complete shave and its cleanup is rather easy by just blowing the hairs off of the trimmer and using the provided brush to clean underneath.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best hands down.</li>
            <li>He loves the digital length settings which made this item unique to him.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does create a stubble and which is why you will buy this, anything more than 5mm you have to look for other options like Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed many other reviews say this,</li>
            <li>So now my first use of the i-Stubble might be a little more slippery than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>You have to be creative around your nose but other than that it has served its purpose</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not used any other stubble trimmers to compare this unit to, but I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love this thing lots of length settings and hold a charge for about a month with my every other day of shaving my stubble.</li>
            <li>It trims great but is hard to clean due t</li>
            <li>Where I wish it would do more, I am not willing to pay the price.</li>
            <li>Other than some better grip on the unit, I can&#x27;t think of anything I could tell the mfr to change.</li>
            <li>Other than some better grip on the unit, I can&#x27;t think of anything I could tell the mfr to change.</li>
            <li>Both original item and replacement did not hold charge after 16 hours of constant charging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can flip the spacer off to use it for trimming along the edge of your beard, but I didn&#x27;t find this as nice because it was hard to see exactly where I was holding it and</li>
            <li>I actually prefer a clean shaven face, but for those who don&#x27;t this is what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a shaver, it won&#x27;t work if you want clean shaven, it is for stubble lengths only.  </li>
            <li>The guard flips open and rinses clean in just one pass under the sink.</li>
            <li>The shaver works well, and is fairly quiet, but I found that any setting lower than 2.5 basically came close to a clean cut look.</li>
            <li>The only way I knew to get it was to shave clean and wait three days, so I started researching beard trimmers online.  </li>
            <li>some small improvements would result in a far superior product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also consider this a true stubble trimmer whereas the other device was more of a short beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Some spots, specially on my neck and the corner of my mouth, required some skin stretching and different approach angles, but the results were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Finally made the right purchase!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I see very little difference between these settings even though they&#x27;re 5 steps away.</li>
            <li>Get used to using short, quick, gentle strokes and this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cuts very accurate with less fuss like the others.  </li>
            <li>First off, if you read the guide book that comes with the trimmer, it clearly tells you to charge the trimmer for 4 hours, 3 days.  </li>
            <li>First off, if you read the guide book that comes with the trimmer, it clearly tells you to charge the trimmer for 4 hours, 3 days.  </li>
            <li>the first pass over my face, I&#x27;m surprised as how it leaves a trail of...well, perfectness.</li>
            <li>Actually does trim close enough to give a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, shaved stubble never looks quite as good as actually grown stubble - but it is as close as I have yet found.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel like going through contacting the seller or Conair and paying to ship it back and hoping the next one works better.</li>
            <li>I also have difficulty trimming by my nose, as the design doesn&#x27;t allow the blades to get close enough to the bottom of my nose to do a full job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>As far as those who say they can&#x27;t hit the area between the nose and the upper-lip, that&#x27;s funny.   </li>
            <li>, I think this thing may have been designed to shave a woman&#x27;s beard because it can&#x27;t cut through real stubble even when it appears to be working normally.  </li>
            <li>Although it is cool, and electrically operated, the issue that I have with it makes me wish that it was just a regular comb.</li>
            <li>Only thing is the battery technology is not that great, takes a long time to charge and doesn&#x27;t hold charge long.</li>
            <li>the body is made with very nice hard plastic, however the very edge trimmer, especially the adjustable comb, is made with soft plastic which can easily break over extensive amount of usage.&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:</li>
            <li>You have to store the trimmer lying down which means it takes up more counter space than it would with a stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trimming under the nose is also difficult, but I was willing to live with that because while it worked, the trimmer did a great job.</li>
            <li>This trimmer offers a very reliable shave for those going for a certain look, or a range of looks.</li>
            <li>All in all this is a good choice but be careful how you set it, test it by going high first and take it down in increments.</li>
            <li>It looks as though they did a little re-design of the comb, which is good because I broke 2 using the prior model.  </li>
            <li>It also makes a big mess in your sink, although this is probably true for most beard/facial hair trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Luckily for me, my old trimmer still works, so I trim my mustache with my old trimmer, and the rest with the new one.</li>
            <li>Bought this after reading many reviews; good and bad.  </li>
            <li>Then my better half wanted to manscape my chest hair.</li>
            <li>Much more discrete than previous trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Charging is easy and the LCD display gives a rough estimate of battery charge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Norelco that could less and performed much better than this unit.</li>
            <li>Easy to use with minimal risk of &#x27;user error&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a previous trimmer, looking for a closer &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; result than I was able to get from the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK product, but it lasted less than 1 year.</li>
            <li>&quot; look that kinda looks like a five o&#x27;clock shadow and most trimmers do not work at properly capturing that specific look.  </li>
            <li>The shortest length of cut (.4mm) left a near smooth surface in its wake.  </li>
            <li>The shortest length of cut (.4mm) left a near smooth surface in its wake.  </li>
            <li>It performs very well and gets VERY close, even closer than my old conair trimmer without no guard.</li>
            <li>The trimmer was decent when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The depression subsides quickly as I continue trimming my stubble and realize 2 minutes later that I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Istubble because it seemed to have decent reviews</li>
            <li>The digital length setting is nothing short than magical.</li>
            <li>and this one did even more than I expected (by far)</li>
            <li>It simply cuts your facial hair better than the Phillips.</li>
            <li>a battery life indicator, which is such a basic feature but lacking on most trimmers</li>
            <li>The i-Stubble is able to cut my facial hair very short and give me the &amp;#34;one-day look&amp;#34; without any problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides the above complaint, this trimmer really is great still.</li>
            <li>I do know that he&#x27;s tried many different electric facial trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Different isn&#x27;t always necessarily better (especially in this case).</li>
            <li>If you want the close shave then pop top off (guard) and it folds back and clips on back of razor.</li>
            <li>My main problem was that after a month of using it, it just died.</li>
            <li>I tried several more times and got about 1/5 of a second run time and all out...</li>
            <li>Gift for son - didn&#x27;t use it much before he started having issues with it not cutting properly</li>
            <li>: It can be messy, and it is only fair in the mustache area.</li>
            <li>I have to do that especially when trying to trim above your top lip and below the lip.</li>
            <li>There is seriously no razor burn when I use this thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At 0.6mm the actual trimmer sits proud of the plastic attachment so not sure how it could be 0.6mm?!  </li>
            <li>so overall, its very consistent and it wont pull or cut you, even with the guide off.</li>
            <li>The battery life is good - you can use it for weeks without a recharge, and the digital display helps alot when determining how long you want your facial hair to be.  </li>
            <li>was cool enough to do the refund thing and send me a new one.</li>
            <li>If I was single and had my own apartment no big deal, but with a wife who wants clean bathrooms I am constantly being asked to clean up the mess.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trimmer trim the hair at the temples, making it even better than my tight beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, the main things other people gripe at are definitely true.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need a high end product.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended for beard, mustache and head trimming usage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, the adjustment method is near genius, the battery lasts a long time, it has a backlight, I don&#x27;t have to fool with a bag full of different size clip-on spacers...</li>
            <li>Used often and high quality...works well</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone looking for this type of shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to add.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews for this and made the purchase given the high rankings.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I end up with needing to go over the same areas many times and ending up with uneven lengths compared with my old, cheap trimmer.</li>
            <li>I still would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was a tad high</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>This is a high quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>and it started working again, have only had this a few months and only used about 1 time a week for basic trimming and it is now completely crapped out, I got a new one today that im very happy with and is very sleek and come charged straight out of the box</li>
            <li>liked the digital setting on the trimmer because with other clippers, the point at which we would hold it was where the settings were</li>
            <li>The head of the trimmer is so large it does not allow you to trim the hair directly under the nose.</li>
            <li>negatives about the Conair is that it is a little more flimsy than the Phillips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this little guy.</li>
            <li>Will spend a little more for a Philips now.</li>
            <li>Cons:  Slightly more difficult to use right under the nose, but not impossible.  </li>
            <li>It trims extremely well, the length settings (in mm) are intuitive so getting the look you want is relatively easy after just a bit of experimentation.  </li>
            <li>Be sure and start on the longest settings (3.0 or 3.5) and work your way down!</li>
            <li>Also the flip top to produce a straight line trimmer is hard to gauge when trying to cut a straight line for sideburns.</li>
            <li>Decent product when new.</li>
            <li>In this age of immediate gratification waiting nearly two days to try the device is too much.</li>
            <li>I &#x27;m just shocked it is made by conair (Not the best reputation).</li>
            <li>Not a good ideal to wet electronics.</li>
            <li>My skin is rather sensitive to a straight razor, but I havent had to use one since getting the iStubble.  </li>
            <li>so far it has work very good,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really miss my old Panasonic trimmer (edit - just saw my review for the er-203 trimmer.</li>
            <li>read the reviews saying this isn&#x27;t what you want for a long beard, I &amp;#34;thought&amp;#34;... it would be ok because I only trimmed with a normal 2-3 size guide anyway.</li>
            <li>It was only alleviated when I pressed back the faceguard as far as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One explanation is that .4 mm is still not short enough for the ideal stubble if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li>So, in a few words, if you have thick face hair or a lot of it your iStubble will work, but the stubble will not be that \\&quot;ideal\\&quot; light stubble that develops after a good shave</li>
            <li>Long lasting battery, The top flips over you can line up your edges, and it electronically changes the guard size.</li>
            <li>definitely think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>While reading the instructions it noted that you may experience pulling and that it is completely normal.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s adjustable and all, but I&#x27;ve owned it for just over a month and the battery is COMPLETELY dead.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Buy the trimmer, it&#x27;s worth it because of how low it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>would REBUY following the success I have had.</li>
            <li>Just happened to me, trimmed normally at 4.0 this morning</li>
            <li>Most of the time, the problem lies with the plastic guard that creates an uneven trim.</li>
            <li>In normal use, a weekly recharge is sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been someone who has had stubble long before it was a cool thing</li>
            <li>, I definitely think I get my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li>I dont normally write reviews</li>
            <li>- let&#x27;s hope I have better luck on round 2.</li>
            <li>I waited to write a review for a few reasons, I read some that were so strange to me, then I read some that sounded too good to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good product EXCEPT it&#x27;s extremely difficult for me to get the hair under my nose.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t reaaly vouch too much for the various settings, but using ti with the guard off produces exactly the look I want.</li>
            <li>Still kind of annoyed at the first ones DOA.</li>
            <li>Purchased this after reading the poor and good reviews.</li>
            <li>, other sellers might sell the older version GMT900 (new one is pretty much same but mostly with some fixed quality issues).</li>
            <li>The other one was fine.</li>
            <li>You will have to package and ship the item yourself and pay for them $5.00 to ship out a new one (wtf lol?).</li>
            <li>He thought it was easy to adjust to different settings and try different styles.  </li>
            <li>The different length settings definitely work and I can easily tell a difference just adjusting it a couple clicks.  </li>
            <li>Had beard growth at about 3 days and the .4mm setting does the trick, subject to your own personal growth rate.   </li>
            <li>But overall very decent - it certainly does what &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; 1mm trimmers don&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Firstly, let me start out saying that I am a guy that has very sensitive skin - in general - and my intended purpose for this shaver is for my face.</li>
            <li>it charging right before you use to ensure it will last!</li>
            <li>So this is the right price for a next step up.</li>
            <li>facial hair grows right up to within about 1/8 of an inch of my nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of trimmers to get just the right stubble look, and I&#x27;ve finally found one that works!  </li>
            <li>I guess I should consider myself lucky that it lasted as long as it did.</li>
            <li>I just had to charge it for a very long time at first just like most of the other electric devices.</li>
            <li>It does a good job with producing even hair length although it may be necessary to go over an area multiple times in different directions and not only against the growth as directed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although, the battery does seem to wear down easily.  </li>
            <li>My current trimmer takes out too much hair and the attachment was too large for it cut any hair at all.</li>
            <li>it looking cheap and patchy like with other beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>At first is quiet but gets loud in like the third use and after the first two times using it you have to use it connected all the time because the battery doesn&#x27;t last more than 5 min. and gets low power if not connected.</li>
            <li>used it once, and liked the length I had, but then wanted to go just a little shorter the next day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially if it&#x27;ll be your first beard trimmer (as it was for me).</li>
            <li>The power is very good, especially when plugged in to an outlet, needless to say it still gets the job done when it is used without the cord plugged.</li>
            <li>and i dont even live in usa</li>
            <li>It does take some maintenance to keep it working well, but its work it as it still works like its brand new.</li>
            <li>I can live with it.  </li>
            <li>a new owner</li>
            <li>on 10/7/13: I received my replacement and haven&#x27;t had any new issues since.</li>
            <li>a new owner</li>
            <li>on 10/7/13: I received my replacement and haven&#x27;t had any new issues since.</li>
            <li>The new Conair Gmt900</li>
            <li>So now I am stuck with an almost brand new trimmer that won&#x27;t work because I can&#x27;t replace a 20c plastic piece.</li>
            <li>In a week I had a brand new trimmer.</li>
            <li>I contacted Conair and they replaced it with a new unit immediately.</li>
            <li>The new one is like being touched by an angel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s brand new still.</li>
            <li>This is why I may need to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>They expect me to include money with the trimmer to they can use the money to pay to send me a new one if they choose</li>
            <li>The amount of time for them to choose to send me a new one is 6 weeks&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Their return policy is a joke: the customer pays shipping both ways and has to wait for weeks to receive a new one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear</li>
            <li>Had to return it for a new one...</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ll get a brand new one.</li>
            <li>I contacted con-air and they sent me a brand new one.</li>
            <li>As we all know, it is something we have to live with for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would give it 4 simply because its not easier to clean then my Cruzer which requires a simple rinse under running water and a little oil from time to time, but after trimming with it I love the way my stubble looks and feels so</li>
            <li>Easy to clean with the brush given and glides very smoothly no matter how big your beard gets</li>
            <li>So this one hurts, it&#x27;s very loud when compared to other trimmers, the blade has two parts and one comes off which takes me a while to fit in.</li>
            <li>I had seen a commercial for this and the whole iPhone, iPod, and now \\&quot;iStubble\\&quot; thing really sold me.  </li>
            <li>So if your unit seems DOA , don&#x27;t fret the blades are most likely initially jammed like mine.</li>
            <li>most reasonable complaint</li>
            <li>Really the price for this facial trimmer is quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>and it is big so good look getting at your philtrum (stache) without alot of wonky manipulation.  </li>
            <li>The components and action all seem high quality.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it a cool techie feature, but you actually get to know the exact length of your facial hair and at the same time this allows you to be more picky in terms of how long you exactly want your facial hair.</li>
            <li>Again, I am very surprised at how well this works and</li>
            <li>I think I figured out why I had that original issue - this little trimmer is VERY susceptible to moisture/water getting in to it.</li>
            <li>I think I figured out why I had that original issue - this little trimmer is VERY susceptible to moisture/water getting in to it.</li>
            <li>I found the trimmer to be similar to rough grading, i.e. after going over my face several times and then inspecting, I found many facial hairs still there at the original length.</li>
            <li>I had searched the net for countless of hours looking for a true stubble trimmer, before ending up buying this one in particular.</li>
            <li>They work great for a few months and then the adjustable trimmer breaks, the charger stops charging, and ultimately they whole trimmer shuts down.  </li>
            <li>Its neat, tight design fits easily in one&#x27;s hands.  </li>
            <li>It can get stuck or suddenly slip, and the result is that I can never be sure to get the right length, and now I have a few bare spots where it cut to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what its said to do - trip your hair at intervals of 0.2, starting at 0.4mm.</li>
            <li>First reason isn&#x27;t necessarily the razor&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m more inclined to do it every day, which means far less mess to clean up and no clogged drains.</li>
            <li>First one, the digital display just melted could not see the numbers.</li>
            <li>My first use I tried it with the guard clipped back.</li>
            <li>(Pretty damn short!)</li>
            <li>it trims your hair to fairly consistent lengths if you want very short hair on your goatee, and even shorter stubble elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and so far he likes it!  </li>
            <li>and it gets everything either the first or second time.</li>
            <li>did try a different brand stubble razor after I broke my first Conair iStubble</li>
            <li>the head has many small plastic pieces that can break.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Well, I actually think it holds the trimmings a lot better than other trimmers I used.</li>
            <li>charge lasts a long time rarely needs a charge.</li>
            <li>I had read the instructions and followed them for the charging prior to the first use.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that they stand behind their products.</li>
            <li>Initial &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; this morning was EXACTLY what I was hoping it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My old trimmer still works!</li>
            <li>GMT900R instruction manual will have GMT900 written on it, just check the back of the trimmer to know exact model.</li>
            <li>First, one of my pet peeves are product reviews written before a user has had a sufficient amount of time to actually learn all they should about a product before writing a review.  </li>
            <li>Oil is included to lubricate the blade, and it is recommended doing so before shaving for the first time, but upon inspection mine seemed sufficiently oiled so I didn&#x27;t oil mine before starting shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but that doesn&#x27;t allow the short &#x27;5 O&#x27;clock&#x27; shadow to be consistent.  </li>
            <li>(Although some kids have beards at 15 years old!).  </li>
            <li>The bummer is that if the first charge runs out in the middle of use, you canNOT use it while the charger is hooked up.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t exactly shopping around looking for &#x27;The Ultimate Shaver&#x27; or something like that.</li>
            <li>After the first super-charge, you just need 4 hours for the subsequent chargings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been a good trimmer, the only complaint I have is that there is no hair trap for the shaved hair.</li>
            <li>Other than a waste of money, it felt good to throw the thing away.</li>
            <li>Everything works fine, but when it comes time to trim the Chin or Go T area, the closeness of the razor Buzzes it to a near 0.5 Looking at the LCD Screen, it still says 3.0, but when you get close to the actual chin area, it definitely without a doubt buzzes it to a near 0 or 0.5</li>
            <li>Press the up or down buttons and the guide moves into the precise position.</li>
            <li>I have a collection of 4 other trimmers and none come close to how even and clean the trim looks with the I-Stubble.</li>
            <li>So, I get one of those $9.99 stick trimmers that you see on TV and in stores, and carefully clean up right under my nose, it&#x27;s not that hard to do.</li>
            <li>It took over a week to get in, and I live out in the country where the nearest FedEx and UPS drop boxes are an hour and a half away (costing me more in gas to return it than I&#x27;ll be getting back when I return it).  </li>
            <li>So it is a trade off, if you want a quick even trim with minimum strokes you have to have a wide trimming blade</li>
            <li>Regular clippers don&#x27;t trim precisely enough to keep that stubble in the \\&quot;sweet spot.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually fixed the second one from a part from the first and that gave me 6 months.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; guards for this thing as I seem to have collected/lost mismatching guards from other trimmers that I keep around for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li>For instance, I use 1.0 mm on my face, but under my chin, I drop it to 0.6 mm because, obviously, you have a true shadow under your chin, and if it is cut the same length, it looks like you forgot to trim under your chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, if you want the shadow look or the perfec stubble, look no further, the Conair GMT900 is not just the tool you need, but it is well made, simple to use a true stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have had a number of trimmers over the years and this is the first one that gives you the ability to adjust the cut to the right length every single time since it is digital.  </li>
            <li>After I charge it, the battery indicator will go down to 1/3 power within one or two uses, but it still works well for weeks and many subsequent uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After oiling and working the blades a little with a toothpick the trimmer began to run just fine.</li>
            <li>I purchased the i-Stubble following a reasonable amount of research on the web for a trimming device that would allow for detailed trimming as my current clippers leave something to be desired for facial trimming, i.e. I would either be very closely trimmed or have a short beard.   </li>
            <li>I read up on multiple reviews about it that were mainly positive.</li>
            <li>Earlier this year, I started getting positive feedback about how I look with three-day-scruff.  </li>
            <li>I then decided to test further and at the 2mm setting it is pretty much the same effect as clippers with no attachment on.</li>
            <li>It would have been sweet if I was into other peoples hair trimmings.</li>
            <li>If you live and work where you can have a stubble appearance without consequence, then this is the trimmer for you and you will look just like your favorite movie stars who appear on the late night</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it is so easy to adjust the cutting height.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that you can&#x27;t shave super close to your face, that is the only limitation</li>
            <li>It worked good while it was working, but it broke down within a year of purchase with only minimal use.</li>
            <li>I knock my original review down from a 3-star to a 2-star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very powerful and hasn&#x27;t slowed down and actually seems like it trims much closer.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for a few days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a trimmer that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the open design of the top, where there&#x27;s space between the unit and the shaving head, reduces the mess a bit.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take him long to have a nice clean trimmed beard (about 4 mins) which he said he hasn&#x27;t gotten from any other trimmer in the past.</li>
            <li>Any stubble trimmer will take a little bit of practice to get a perfectly even shave, you&#x27;ll notice that some areas of your face you&#x27;ll have to shave in a different direction, and some areas a little harder push than others.  </li>
            <li>oiling of blades and has a few nooks and crannies that are tricky to clean (I used compressed air which makes it easy, but not clean around my sink!)&lt;br /&gt;-Has</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get all worked up over a beard trimmer, but this one is ok.  </li>
            <li>it shaved ok while it worked, it also turned off every time you switch the mode, it&#x27;s not worth it!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to maneuver, sharp enough to cut but not bite.</li>
            <li>The plastic top which glides over your skin is soft and won&#x27;t create rashes even if you press it hard against your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>THE PUSH BOTTON ADJUSTABLE COMB IS GREAT and precise!!!(except if you don&#x27;t push too hard against your face which can cause the soft comb trimmer plastic to bend, and that will lead to uneven trim).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with the clippers cutting ability.  </li>
            <li>Had to watch a video on how to use it because of the awkward design but was happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Great cutting experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received the product that would not charge and was clearly used.</li>
            <li>Directions on usage, cleaning, and maintenance are clear and explained well.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave me with a handful of \\&quot;heads\\&quot; to toggle on the device, and it gives me clear options as to how close I&#x27;d like my shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I went back to my old trimmer, one I had for 8 years and that one cuts very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, when you flip back the head, you get a much shorter (uneven) finish, and the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; part is huge and bulky so you can&#x27;t really get too close to the upper lip, etc.</li>
            <li>It cuts much closer than I expected and very evenly too.</li>
            <li>Clearly a faulty battery that needed to be returned.</li>
            <li>this trimmer is set to the same 1.6mm as my old one, it gives a MUCH closer shave.</li>
            <li>I travel frequently and will need to find a case to protect it in my travel bag.</li>
            <li>It darn near cuts as close as a razor.</li>
            <li>The iStubble makes it a breeze to keep my head close (nearly) every day.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer actually works, and it works really well.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, these aren&#x27;t lengths, just a number.  </li>
            <li>I always had to plan my stubble if I wanted it to be present when I went out, so having stubble was really like a 3 or 4 day process.</li>
            <li>It works, like clockwork so far.</li>
            <li>It really molds to your face and reduces irritation even further.  </li>
            <li>Some people have also said that the advertisement video is misleading and that it doesn&#x27;t really trim as short as in the advertisement video,</li>
            <li>and it shaves my head to the bone and that was an unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li>Second, it really should keep the length setting.  </li>
            <li>I decided to stick with my old trimmer for this area.</li>
            <li>I decided to stick with my old trimmer for this area.</li>
            <li>While it does include an ad-on razor, I only used the trimmer part on my face to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how well this product works.  </li>
            <li>I use (even those for sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>but so far no luck.</li>
            <li>have a sensitive skin and fear to shave with both Gillette Mach3 and electric Shavers for cuts and acne problems.</li>
            <li>This item was a Christmas gift for my son-in-law, as far as I know he likes it.  </li>
            <li>I now look forward to grooming when before it was real drudgery, and I avoided it until it was completely necessary.  </li>
            <li>Finally got around to unscrewing everything to replace battery, but it was very glued in, including the connectors which ripped when I pulled out.</li>
            <li>really like this shaver, and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>result is that you have to go over the same spot over and over again so it takes ages to trim your whole</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m actually surprised that I went out and bought another.</li>
            <li>YOU CHARGE THE BATTERY COMPLETELY, THEN USE IT TILL IT DIES, THEN CHARGE IT AGAIN, DO NOT LEAVE IT ON THE CHARGER</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, but using it every day has not bothered my skin at all.</li>
            <li>As far as I know</li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>I can not as soft beard, but it is growing at a millimeter a day and every two days this razor saves me from irritation of the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cut some, but that doesn&#x27;t matter if it snags a dozen hair every time and feels like they&#x27;re being ripped out at the root (unexpectedly).  </li>
            <li>By far, the end all-be all for trimming stubble.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that&#x27;d replace my old trimmer.</li>
            <li>it is, though it&#x27;s definitely far from blowing its competition out of the water.</li>
            <li>Old one lasted about 2 years.  </li>
            <li>I just wish the trimmer had higher setting for long beards.</li>
            <li>The clippers made a loud noise and were seized up.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s a couple years old</li>
            <li>10 year old trimmer was dying, so I tried this and the [[ASIN:B003U8ESI4</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never liked a trimmer or a trim better.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really the only downside though.  </li>
            <li>The idea of a trim taking about a maximum of only 1-2 minutes in a shared dormitory really appealed to me.</li>
            <li>So far no nicks or jams.    </li>
            <li>My old one died and I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement anywhere</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and I haven&#x27;t used a razor in years.</li>
            <li>i \\&quot;Old</li>
            <li>Stop attempting to use it straight up only.   </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use this as a beard or facial hair trimmer b/c I can&#x27;t grow a bear.</li>
            <li>, so you can adjust how much stubble is left.</li>
            <li>This was supposed to be a replacement for the identical one I purchased nearly 5 yrs ago.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is a stubble trimmer and it is not meant for long beards.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints so far about this trimmer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works really well for shaping my beard, and experimenting with different lengths.</li>
            <li>You should know, the comb part isn&#x27;t really meant to fold like that on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>His stubble is 0.2 to 0.3 mm ... to get that close, you need to flip back the comb head, and trim with just the metal blades against the skin - much like using [[ASIN:B000JNQSIQ Wahl Hair Clippers]]</li>
            <li>I still have to use my old trimmer for my mustache and sideburns.</li>
            <li>so far no issues.  </li>
            <li>The stubble trimmer lets me cut my hair much shorter than a regular hair trimmer, and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the product gets the job done, but leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>I could not do this with my old razor.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I always keep the day old stubble</li>
            <li>I set it at 1.8 for what I wanted, 1.6 was really too low</li>
            <li>(i.e. why would I want something that doesn&#x27;t completely shave?)but</li>
            <li>so I often use my old plug-in trimmer for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesnt even work while plugged into the wall directly</li>
            <li>I have zero complaints so far and am recommending it to friends and family.</li>
            <li>For a complete shave I use this for 90 percent and then a precision</li>
            <li>Not as versatile as my old Norelco</li>
            <li>Far from stubble look, it did not even cut my beard with 1.0mm setting, so I returned it and bought Con air I-stubble.</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, this wasn&#x27;t from a third-party vendor, but from Amazon directly.</li>
            <li>The only one that they should really fix.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Naturally I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li>WOW ..</li>
            <li>Has control, power, ease of use, flexibility for the short beard/stubble beard guyay to really improve on it.</li>
            <li>WOW ..</li>
            <li>I wanted a shaver that holds its charge and indicated how much charge it had left.  </li>
            <li>I expected with a week&#x27;s worth of beard</li>
            <li>It would have been vastly more functional with a few extra combs, so I&#x27;m docking a star for that.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s fun to watch the motorized guide move back and forth, I wish the iStubble could just remain at the last</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s fun to watch the motorized guide move back and forth, I wish the iStubble could just remain at the last setting.    </li>
            <li>There were many uneven spots left after trimming.  </li>
            <li>If you hate shaving as much as I do but want to keep your facial hair close, this is probably your best option.</li>
            <li>Nice concept, poorly executed</li>
            <li>He has very fine hair and in the past, some of the trimmers would just glide over the hair and not give a close enough cut until it grew out too far</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it does not give an extremely close shave, which is fine for me.</li>
            <li>Only draw back is right under the nares, for that I freehand,  </li>
            <li>After trying several different trimmers, this item does manage to provide the right closeness I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>Sure you can take out the attachment comb but that empty blade is not thin or sharp enough.</li>
            <li>I also used it to clean up around his ears and it worked well in that tight area.  </li>
            <li>This razor not only gives a very smooth shave, but you can adjust lengths with a small push of a button (and see what setting you are on via its digital display, which is very convenient).</li>
            <li>The Istubble is also small, lightweight, and cordless which makes is really easy to use.    </li>
            <li>Some other things I really like about it is that you really don&#x27;t need a rechargeable stand.</li>
            <li>When cutting under the nose you have to turn the shaver side ways, but other than that excellent product.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that gave me enough control to either trim a beard, make some short stubble, or just some clean up work with the facial hair and</li>
            <li>In addition, the battery life is fantastic as I only have to to charge it once every couple of weeks (I shave with the i-Stubble every other day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use; small learning curve to get the feel of letting the trimmer glide across the face.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several other cheap battery operated beard trimmers.  </li>
            <li>His favorite part is that the trimmer has a wide range of lengths and that the gaps between the different lengths are very small, so he can get exactly the length he wants.</li>
            <li>This may not sound very short, but its about the equivalent of the SHORTEST length available on my normal clippers/trimmers while the guard is still on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an iStubble trimmer for a couple years (bought at KMart) and it is far and away better than any other other beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, including Norelco and Wahl.&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have long facial hair (it&#x27;s more bum fluff)</li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking it would add a whole new dimension to lengths I could go to while trimming up and shaping my facial hair, while at the same time replacing my old trimmers/clippers.  </li>
            <li>I went to the dry cleaners yesterday with the sole intention of dropping off my suits, exchanging witty banter with the Japanese lady who cleans them followed by a trip to the local Wal-Marts for a Panasonic trimmer.  </li>
            <li>London Drugs is actually $95 CAN which I would consider far too high.</li>
            <li>I loved the adjust on the fly feature for different beard lengths, hated having all the attachemnts floating around in the drawer from my previous trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably as even of a &amp;#34;stubble shave&amp;#34; as possible, and true it is hard to get to the area right below the nostrils.</li>
            <li>A bit of trial an error followed on some body areas not typically visible to others, and I had it worked out.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer worked fine while it lasted, which was only about a year and half after being used once a week.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco Beard &amp;amp; Head trimmer Series 5100 has sharper blades and cuts a little closer if you want a true 0.4 MM</li>
            <li>The fact is, All-in One groomers like the Norelco G370 won&#x27;t give a decent stubble look because it isn&#x27;t for that purpose, plus you can&#x27;t really get 0.2mm or 0.3mm that other people are claiming.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for a face shaver.</li>
            <li>The only thing to be careful of is that every time you turn the trimmer on, it goes back to the shortest setting, so make sure to adjust or else you&#x27;ll have a very short stubble!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The highest setting is a 5 which may not be high enough for someone with a longer beard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few different types of shaver that claim to offer a genuine stubble grooming solution and this is the only one that works REALLY well.</li>
            <li>The only negative is there is no way to catch the hair which just means a little more clean up</li>
            <li>One small thing can make huge difference.</li>
            <li>Combined with the fact that it takes a long time to get your whole face done this results in the battery</li>
            <li>I would usually hit this area lightly with a razor and problem solved.</li>
            <li>those really are minor points...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t normally grow my facial hair grow out.</li>
            <li>Not exactly an even cut (but better than your average beard trimmer).</li>
            <li>With a tilted angle you will be able to do so, but the hairs very close to your nostrils will be left behind.</li>
            <li>Went from a full charge to dead and hasn&#x27;t worked since.</li>
            <li>course if it had a less slippery grip, I wouldn&#x27;t have dropped the first one and had to replace it with this one!</li>
            <li>Not impossible for me, but it takes a little contorting of the face.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it--I won&#x27;t use any other trimmer!</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s surprisingly hard to find a trimmer that can cut evenly, quickly, and comfortably at lengths down to .4mm.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s surprisingly hard to find a trimmer that can cut evenly, quickly, and comfortably at lengths down to .4mm.</li>
            <li>If youdecide to buy this trimmer or any other one...Be SMART!</li>
            <li>This Trimmer works very well and holds a charge for a long time!</li>
            <li>and I have to decide if I buy a new one or move to a different brand.</li>
            <li>I am new to facial hair and had never used a trimmer before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The claim to fame for the iStubble is the lack of multiple attachments for trimming hair to different lengths, thanks to its motorized head which adjusts to the length you want at the touch of a button.  </li>
            <li>I got this to maintain a really low look because I don&#x27;t like facial hair much, so this did what I want.  </li>
            <li>Even though it was on the more expensive side of a lot of the electric trimmers I looked at, I think you really get what you pay for with the iStubble.  </li>
            <li>Being able to adjust the length of the trimmer, and having the comb guard, helps me get close to my skin with the least irritation possible.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure, because there were a lot of mixed and negative reviews, but took the chance</li>
            <li>Following this research, the i-Stubble appeared to be the obvious solution at a reasonable price to boot.</li>
            <li>If I have it set to 1.5mm, trim, and return the next day to trim again, it defaults back to .4mm, causing me to shave much shorter than I intended.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts through multiple shaves, the LCD screen is very helpful, and trimming facial hair is now a breeze!</li>
            <li>This is by far the most frustrating trimmer I have every used.</li>
            <li>TRYM II - The Rechargeable Modern Hair Clipper Kit - Ultra-sleek Hair, Body, Mustache, and Beard Trimmer Looks Great in Any Bathroom - AC Adapter, Base Dock, and Trimming Attachments</li>
            <li>gave it a quick, few hour, charge.</li>
            <li>The razor is very powerful and the flexible head had no trouble taking 5 days of beard down to .5mm in a single pass.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>There seems to be less hair trapped in the shaver, and the flip-up head makes cleaning very easy.</li>
            <li>I like trimming by facial hair rather than shaving it, because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>but it is limited to how much it can trim.</li>
            <li>A couple of things I might want changed but nothing major.</li>
            <li>and this thing holds a charge like no other trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>no real big deal..you will see what I mean when you purchase one :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it does a job that no other razor has done for me.  </li>
            <li>just isn&#x27;t right for this trimmer, but it hurts like crazy and snags way too many hairs.  </li>
            <li>The unit seems to arbitrarily reset back to .4mm if it sits for 5-10 minutes (not on the charger - on the charger it resets right away after a cut).</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that they didn&#x27;t include an option for 0mm to completely get rid of my facial hair, but that&#x27;s okay because the razor wasn&#x27;t designed to do that.</li>
            <li>The hardest part was deciding on the right setting, seeing as how my previous trimmer just had the numbers 1-5.</li>
            <li>This is MUCH better than the typical plastic clips that you get with other trimmers and that sometimes change while you&#x27;re shaving!  </li>
            <li>Very even shave and does not irritate sensitive skin (other units have caused redness).  </li>
            <li>(at least for me this is the case, it works fine).</li>
            <li>I have been using an older Conair product for a long time and decided it was time for a change.  </li>
            <li>And while most reviews were positive, there were quite a few negative as well.  </li>
            <li>The top white piece will start making a wicked ridiculous noise....</li>
            <li>/&gt;1.) The trimmer head is a bit big and kind of painful to use around your mustache/under nose area (as many other reviewers have noted).</li>
            <li>/&gt;1.) The trimmer head is a bit big and kind of painful to use around your mustache/under nose area (as many other reviewers have noted).</li>
            <li>Many other trimmers don&#x27;t go down as low as the 0.4 setting.  </li>
            <li>I had used an identical trimmer for my beard for 5 years until the battery died and the clipper became too dull to comfortably cut hair.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use it everyday the battery doesn&#x27;t really die that quick as I read in some of the other reviews</li>
            <li>I purchased the iStubble due to all the positive reviews and have not been dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Generally a charge lasts me about 4 weeks</li>
            <li>In general, this trimmer gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Therefore, I generally stick to .4mm-1mm settings.&lt;br /&gt;-Requires</li>
            <li>does not fling hair everywhere in the bathroom like others report, but generally collects in the trimmer and comes out with a shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very careful with my items and everything else about this item is in great shape, but the plastic guard is very thin and after enough normal use it finally gave in and broke.</li>
            <li>I really like how simple it is to adjust the razor and also how long the charge holds for.</li>
            <li>Even though we followed the directions, the battery was nearly wiped out after only 15 minutes of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t deliver as well as my old trimmer with the traditional attachments.</li>
            <li>Apparently this issue was reported in 2013...</li>
            <li>owned one of these left it on my bathroom counter near my sink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using it, but so far I&#x27;ve had mixed</li>
            <li>No regrets.  </li>
            <li>Another (hidden) feature that I really like is the quick charge feature, which allows you to charge for only a few minutes on those days where you need a quick shave with a low or empty battery.     </li>
            <li>So quiet that the first time I turned it on, I thought I hadn&#x27;t charged it long enough</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d to keep going back to my old trimmer to finish the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fool proof, barely requires any set up or instructions to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this one for my stubble now, instead of an old Wahl that has the plastic trimmed low to achieve stubble.  </li>
            <li>and it would barely cut and just pulled out my hair.</li>
            <li>My old beard trimmer dies on my a short while ago.</li>
            <li>So far that&#x27;s my only gripe.  </li>
            <li>I did see that several people had this same complaint, but many others did not.</li>
            <li>I am going back to the old one.</li>
            <li>For those of you old enough to remember it gives allows you to trim your beard to the \\&quot;Miami Vice\\&quot; style.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After doing much research through the years, using one after another, trying a few different stubble beard trimmers (not all recommended, though several),  I couldn&#x27;t get it to be exactly what I longed for daily.&lt;br</li>

            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I talked through the guy that cuts my hair, and we figured out the different settings of the istubble are equivalent to a professional trimmer (e.g., Wahl) with something like 12 removable guards.</li>
            <li>I would buy again and would upgrade if they fixed the above 2 problems.</li>
            <li>You really have to be careful when you&#x27;re trimming, too, because you will get scraped.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is how sensitive it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd one of these now as they break frequently...</li>
            <li>I still have my old shaver for about 4 yrs now, however the battery can only do one shave on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;thats understandable, after</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on the lowest setting of my old trimmer, which that manufacturer reports as 1.6mm, I initially set the Conair to 1mm.</li>
            <li>The resulting trim was MUCH shorter than I expected, almost a shave.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want a bare blade against my face.  </li>
            <li>, I would have bought it a long time ago for the normal price.  </li>
            <li>I arbitrarily decided to go for 1.4mm (although in retrospect I should have started at a higher number and just gone with multiple passes, lowering as I went</li>
            <li>However, the latest one I bought was made rather poorly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It usually takes me around 6 days to have an absolutely full 37th hour beard, so I like to keep it around a number 3 or 2.5.</li>
            <li>It works okay, but not great, and then after just two months it broke.</li>
            <li>After the initial charge, the unit will take from 2 to 4 hours for a full charge from a completely dead battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was also getting tired of my electric razor and have been skipping more days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times a week for several weeks and the battery is at 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>(Sounds like a little but this trimmer makes quick work of facial hair)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several less expensive razors and they either didn&#x27;t cut very smoothly or were just a pain to use (coming, as they did, with their several plastic attachments that take up space and aren&#x27;t that easy to change).</li>
            <li>My advice would be to start much higher than you think, and work down.</li>
            <li>The other negative is that the power button on the unit is very easy to press.</li>
            <li>Trims right down to the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow!</li>
            <li>that despite what the instructions say it doesn&#x27;t work very well plugged into an electrical outlet when the battery is dead, meaning that once the battery has reached the end of life I&#x27;ll have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>It has the attachment comb on the trimmer which also has adjustable lengths for up &amp; down right above the power button.  </li>
            <li>You will also get different results if you try and trim while hanging upside down from your bed rather than standing right side up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 23 y.o. black male and as you know, most black guys have curly hair</li>
            <li>Yes, pretty odd request which is why this still gets 5/5 stars.  </li>
            <li>Thus is my second one, first one had battery charge issues out of the box, I&#x27;ve tried all sort of other units</li>
            <li>I started at 3mm and actually took off most of my &#x27;short beard&#x27; which I thought was no more than 3mm long, the result being a lot shorter than 3mm.</li>
            <li>Little difficult on the head, but works great for the face and the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow</li>
            <li>Unlike some other comments here, I find .4mm very short--shorter than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>The floating head is really helpful for those tricky parts under the neck, my other trimmers could never reach those parts evenly.</li>
            <li>Other than that, works very well.</li>
            <li>Too much of hassle with charging it and charge does not last long enough.</li>
            <li>Because of this I usually do not end up shaving since the hair is already too long by the time I get around to it.</li>
            <li>One thing to be careful of, is that when you first turn it on, it doesn&#x27;t save your settings from last time, so you could potentially shave off your mustache by accident.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have found this a long time ago because I used to hate shaving and then waiting for my hair to grow back to look perfect and then having to shave it all off again.</li>
            <li>and he really likes how it works it shaves his face down far enough where he never has to shave with a razor and get ingrown hairs anymore or bumps.</li>
            <li>Not a single pulled hair, no straining of the</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t live in USA, so it would be more expensive to send the item back to Amazon</li>
            <li>negative reviews were complaints about the guide comb not being secure enough or not getting problematic areas[such as under the lip, soul patch, etc].  </li>
            <li>I was very unsatisfied with the product and it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li>Currently, we have an old standard clipper/trimmer from Wahl and a Remington cordless clipper/trimmer.  </li>
            <li>They typically last me a couple of years and get the job done, but I usually spent way too much time trying to get the \\&quot;look\\</li>
            <li>However, I expected it to last much longer than it did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because the guide folds back completely, you can use the naked blades to shape your beard or sideburns, trim your neck hairs between haircuts, and even clip stray body hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li>For the price, I did get value from it, although I expected it to last for much longer.</li>
            <li>For sensitive skins with potential risk of stubs leading to shaving bumps, I will only recommend this trimmer if you are using it to maintain a beard (preferably a five o&#x27;clock shadow).&lt;br /&gt;Fact 2:</li>
            <li>I only wish that they had some type of smaller adapter to allow for easier trimming directly under your nose.</li>
            <li>, the only downside (so far) is that you can&#x27;t properly trim your mustache.</li>
            <li>To my surprised, they weren&#x27;t much more expensive and after reading a ton of reviews, I settled on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still like it to cut a little closer, though this is one of the (or maybe *the*) closest of the consumer-grade trimmers.</li>
            <li>major caveat I have is that the head unit is relatively fragile -</li>
            <li>the various length settings may as well all be the same - there isn&#x27;t much variance, and the minor point changes are in no way noticeable at all - between 0.4 and like 3.0, probably noticeable - but anything smaller increments than that, may as well be the same&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades and motor are powerful enough to cut your bead and even shave your head, but the digital adjuster was broken when I first removed the iStubble from the box.  </li>
            <li>This has a solid motor that cuts beard hair smoothly with no bogging down like some other brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very skilled, and even I get a consistent trim every time.  </li>
            <li>I can get close enough without looking sloppy, and I don&#x27;t irritate my skin, so my skin looks healthy and stays ingrown hair-free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great trimmer you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li>It comfortably has enough battery life to last at least 2 sessions of trimming.  </li>
            <li>This is so the battery is primed and will potentially have a longer life in general.</li>
            <li>; I generally use it 1-2x/week and go several weeks between charges.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it works as much as any other trimmer with the exception of the digital settings for the length, and the rotating head is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li>/&gt;This does make a pretty big mess.  </li>
            <li>other minor thing is that you have to charge the device for 16 hours before you use it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I use the bare clipper (fold back guard) on face and neck for that &amp;#34;Perfect Stubble&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>I like stubble, but not long stubble...</li>
            <li>You will need to pull the comb back and use the bare metal blade to trim around the lips and under the nose.</li>
            <li>and it runs at full steam - if it&#x27;s not plugged in for at least a day before I use it</li>
            <li>bought my first one a few years ago 2011?).</li>
            <li>The battery runs down as fast as it can -- as if I was using it continuously, even though the power is off</li>
            <li>Also does a decent job shaving other parts of my body.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my son who was recently in the market for a facial trimmer, but didn&#x27;t know which one to buy and well, to say the least, I really wasn&#x27;t much help.  </li>
            <li>It is not easy to use for detailed trimming, due to the design of the head of the device.  </li>
            <li>If you prefer a slightly less intense shave, I would look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anything less really doesnt look like you have stubble</li>
            <li>The battery holds a charge for a long time and has never died on me mid trim (my old trimmer didn&#x27;t have a battery indicator and would leave me hanging all the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was quite loud and my facial hair wasn&#x27;t long at all</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well until it started draining battery after 1 shave.&lt;br /&gt;Right now, I use it once and by the time i need a 2nd shave in a few days, the battery is drained by then.</li>
            <li>but personally I would of spent my money on another normal trimmer with the clip on adjustments.</li>
            <li>And while it pivots open for cleaning, I found a large amount of hair got under the blades, too, which is difficult to clean out (especially since it didn&#x27;t come with a cleaning brush).  </li>
            <li>: Can really trim down to short lengths.</li>
            <li>The only thing that kinda annoys me is that it holds so much hair, so every time he sets it down hair falls out of it</li>
            <li>It was fine, but it wasn&#x27;t as close as the Bald Fader, and it seemed to be a bit tough to do on my head.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t really make a mess at all like some others here</li>
            <li>As a black male with ingrown hair issues, these trimmer really help.</li>
            <li>Luckily, that&#x27;s all I use it for as the battery usually dies before I&#x27;m done with one arm!</li>
            <li>The other trimmers I used left different lengths depending on the angle  the trimmer was held and the location of the hair on the chin or face whether it be on a flat, convex or concave surface.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t miss hairs, it doesn&#x27;t have a hard time cutting (I have thick hair), the battery lasts (I&#x27;m still on my first charge weeks later), and the best thing for me is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all.</li>
            <li>I decided to get the trimmer with the built in vacuum, because using this every other day left a constant mess of stubble around the sink, and I could never quite clean it all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really find this trimmer makes a big mess</li>
            <li>I hate shaving for many reasons, but the iStubble makes it a quick simple task.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a little bottle of oil which I applied to the blades as directed, but to really get that wake-up call in the morning</li>
            <li>The device has a much safer trimmer guard which allows you to glide the device across your skin with little risk of nicking yourself.</li>
            <li>That is some over-the-top language, but it feels fine in your hand (I don&#x27;t know about complete</li>
            <li>The head did need a little bit more pressure than I expected to get it to pivot around curves, but not a bald patch or uneven length was to be had.  </li>
            <li>Bought on 12/20/2011, used very little until weather started getting to hot for longer stubble</li>
            <li>disappointed with product specially considering that I order it from Amazon US and got it delivered in Singapore, so huge wastage of money.</li>
            <li>I read other reviews that complained about it not being strong enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this if you don&#x27;t care about the price, and want that stubble look badly, and have a back-up good trimmer/razor to do the clean-up job.</li>
            <li>this product is FANTASTIC at leaving random patches of longer hair without warning - you have to go over multiple times, and then frequently revisit it later in the day when realizing you still missed something - they should advertise it as &amp;</li>

            <li> Good design too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for trimming.</li>

            <li> and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> Trims good at all advertised lengths.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li> Good trimmer</li>
            <li> It is still a good buy.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself does a good job and the adjustability in millimeters</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as everyone says it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;OK so now onto the good and the bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great control, flipping up the comb, I am able to get a great edge, good trimming,</li>

            <li> Battery still holds a great charge and it makes getting an even trim very easy.</li>
            <li> Very good battery life, easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the best out there, but, as in many things, it could be even better.    </li>
            <li> The description, \\&quot;Its floating, contoured head tracks the curves of your face for exceptional accuracy and comfort\\&quot; is an understatement.  </li>
            <li> Super happy!</li>
            <li> I will not take a star  away for this because of the exceptional value and performance of this device.</li>
            <li> Battery life is great and the charger works off both 110v and 220v, very important for those of us who travel abroad often.</li>
            <li> I have a schedule of shaving my head with this about every two days and am very pleased with it.    </li>
            <li> Arrived timely and worked great but broke in my luggage while going through the airport, so make sure you pack it correctly</li>
            <li> Could not be more happy with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the iStubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be more than happy to answer any and all of them.</li>
            <li> I cant believe that i can get better service from a no name fly by night company</li>
            <li> I like being able to select the length of the cut - a great feature for an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is well worth it, it is on point perfect!</li>
            <li> I own two just to have one as a backup, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> The adjustable settings are excellent and it is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The perfect shaver for keeping my face trimmed at just the right length.</li>
            <li> I use 0.4 to 0.6 mm - excellent no need to shave smooth in the winter  :)</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, easy to use and very safe on skin.</li>
            <li> This is the  best trimmer I have found for a consistent length.</li>
            <li> Just used the trimmer for the first time and it works perfect!</li>
            <li> I use it for my head and face, and love it!</li>
            <li> , if you&#x27;re on the fence about purchasing the iStubble for yourself or for someone you love, I say go for it!</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re on the fence about purchasing the iStubble for yourself or for someone you love, I say go for it!</li>
            <li> I even have real fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I used it this morning for the first time and shaved my head and face in 5 minutes leaving a perfect 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> To start, they call it the \\&quot;i-Stubble,\\&quot; how creative!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Another guy who &#x27;shaves&#x27; his head recommended this and glad he did!</li>
            <li> Love this thing!</li>
            <li> Defenetly satisfied!  </li>
            <li> Works well, I love the adjustment flexibility to the .5 mm!  </li>
            <li> This iStubble trimmer actually IS better!)</li>
            <li> Makes a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;The length adjustment is both easy to set and stays at the chosen length during usage.</li>
            <li> This thing is so easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li> Adjustable length works great and the floating head makes it easy to get all spots.</li>
            <li> This would have been a great trimmer if it didn&#x27;t break so easily.</li>
            <li> this is an incredible shaver very first</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because of the good reviews wich said it was very smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> This I-stubble is amazing, it&#x27;s Sunday a day before Memorial Day</li>
            <li> It really is a comfortable tool and has a great weight and feel.  </li>
            <li> If you bend the top-plastic with help of your thumb and trim, you get amazingly shorter stubble, still it is not as close as the one which is shown in the advertising video.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> and I had fantastic results, the trimmer did a great job</li>
            <li> The iStubble is amazing.</li>
            <li> Does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it&#x27;s comfortable to use and gives you a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Works great and always gives fast, comfortable and perfect shave.</li>
            <li> and I liked the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look of a day or two after using it.    </li>
            <li> Conair makes excellent products and this stubble trimmer has a lot of extras with removable head and easy to clean and adjust.</li>
            <li> This feature comes in handy immediately as you are told to charge the battery for 16 hours before using it</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The iStubble trimmer gives the appearance of quality and comes with a nice cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> he really liked it</li>
            <li> It provided a nice even cut on his face.  </li>
            <li> I just need a good, efficient, razor to give me a \\&quot;slightly more than stubble\\&quot; shave.</li>
            <li> None of them I was really that impressed with until now.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m sure you can see from my reviews, we&#x27;ve owned our fair share of cordless trimmers over the years.</li>
            <li> I really liked the lengths between 1.60-2.00.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t shave stubble that evenly.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for 6 whole months -</li>
            <li> Gives a clean, easy, and even trim every time, leaving me with the perfect stubble.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have a corded form of operation, then you&#x27;d better have a hell of good battery, not one that dies in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> It took way too many passes to get a good look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering leaving them out in the elements to get them nice and rusty.</li>
            <li> For me, these features made it a keeper.ttachments is really nice.</li>
            <li> A travel bag would be nice.</li>
            <li> My husband had one of these before a really liked it.</li>
            <li> My husband liked how it worked</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going for the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look, which seems to be popular, this is THE razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does trim nicely but it has to be plugged in just to use it.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re time, you should have better luck than me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a perfect trimmer for someone who wants that look.</li>
            <li> it trims well and trims close for a nice stubble look.  </li>
            <li> THis has a nice swivel head.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable length feature is really nice.</li>
            <li> Each of these are &#x27;just okay&#x27; for me, the shaver misses hairs, and the body groomer (which, to be fair, is not rated for use as a shaver)</li>
            <li> The iStubble is definitely a handy shaver to have for beard control.</li>
            <li> and he is loving it.</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting the istubble to work as advertised, but I&#x27;ve had it for about a week now and have used it twice.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have any complaints, I would have liked the trimmer to have allowed me to trim at longer lenghts.  </li>
            <li> just kind of move your nose around and play at the angles of the strokes youre using.</li>
            <li> Includes a nice brush.</li>
            <li> Nice and tidy design</li>
            <li> While the trimmer seems awesome and works very well,  I ordered the bonus item and was under the impression it would have an additional attachment.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for an effective way to get the fashionable 5:00 shadow look.</li>
            <li> I would have liked it to adjust a bit longer but I am getting used to that</li>
            <li> It would also be nice if you the maximum length was also a bit longer as well.</li>
            <li> is handy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this shaver cuts nicely</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Create your own stubble design.</li>
            <li> claims of not being able to get good detail work done..</li>
            <li> With this trimmer I just set it to 1.8 mm (two days of stubble for me) and I quickly and easily have a perfect stubble look.</li>
            <li> I-Stubble is great for anyone that likes to customize their unique look.  </li>
            <li> I will have to throw away a perfect trimmer because they do not sell new blades!</li>
            <li> Great price, super fast shipping, awesome product!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this machine and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> iStubble looks cool, and it works great for trimming chin &amp; cheeks.</li>
            <li> iStubble looks cool, and it works great for trimming chin &amp; cheeks.</li>
            <li> It might take one or two tries to get the perfect size you want to shave at, but I tried 0.6 mm and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Overall good build quality, excellent batteries</li>
            <li> Another super great feature is the automatic adjustments.</li>
            <li> Adjustability is actually more than needed, but there&#x27;s really nothing to complain about, excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It never pulls hairs, cleans easy and has good battery life.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and to take care of.</li>
            <li> and it is very easy to operate with.  </li>
            <li> But cleaning is very easy.</li>
            <li> very easy blade length</li>
            <li> Either way this has helped me great the perfect beard where other stubble type shavers could not.</li>
            <li> Still, I am happy with the iStubble as I do not need to shave every day, and do like the stubble look more than a clean shave look.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Amazing :)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s by far the best trimmer i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> -- this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across so far.</li>
            <li> This was by far the best stubbler I have owned.</li>
            <li> So this was the perfect stubble trimmer you can find in the market and by far even is one.</li>
            <li> so far its great!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for that sexy stubble.</li>
            <li> many looks that r amazing get it for a picky razer guy</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on all of the stubble trimmers that I could find and this one rated the best by far.</li>
            <li> I have a corded Wahl clipper that is over 10 years old and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> Tried my best to fix it, even replace it with my old trimming part, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have owned so far.  </li>
            <li> The one I gave him was about 3 years old and still worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Was debating between this model and the Philips Norelco QT 4070 but liked these features a bit better.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin, but it was a perfect shave.</li>
            <li> Especially on more sensitive areas of the face</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have had so far.</li>
            <li> except for not holding a charge more than 1-2 shave this is a nice stubble razor.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good trimmer and does a good job of maintaining the &amp;#34;stubble look&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The i-Stubble works perfectly for my needs, allowing me to go from a full beard down to the perfect length of stubble in just minutes.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I never made it Wal-Marts, I did a break-dance right over to Happy Harry&#x27;s a.k.a Walgreens and saw the iStubble for $60.  </li>
            <li> It has very fine adjustments and keeps an even trim all over.  </li>
            <li> Did I mention I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Shaver!???</li>
            <li> Works great, cuts very even and allows me to play with more lengths!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Addition after 4 years:&lt;br /&gt;After 4 years this trimmer is still going strong!</li>
            <li> The 0.4 mm setting cuts my beard to the perfect length of about 1-2 days after a clean shave, which is exactly the maximum length of beard I want to keep.  </li>
            <li> I read the good reviews for the iStubble and was excited to receive it today.</li>
            <li> I rarely give full stars, so this is the best most anything ever gets.</li>
            <li> The heat from it growing so fast, or the incredible power of my brain seems to have worn our the follicles on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> Get the GMT900R from Gourmet Kitchen Gallery (Free shipping and no-sales-tax for most states), and they have good customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait some time to review this, to see how it held up, and this trimmer is by far the best I have had in terms of being able to get the correct amount of stubble.</li>
            <li> Good for people who don&#x27;t mind spending time to clean up often.</li>
            <li> This one is actually very good, it glides along easily, and gives a consistent shave once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> It worked great for the first three months.  </li>
            <li> This product is great, and works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Just want too tell anyone who is interested in getting one of these, that these are really great shaving razors.</li>
            <li> Was pretty pumped about using this product, I&#x27;ve heard great things about it.  </li>
            <li> I have generally been very happy with Conair iStubble</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the battery life, the iStubble is pretty neat and does a great job with adjustable trimming.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy, no regrets.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer works great for about the first 3-6 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with this since I use the lower settings, but take note that to reach 5mm you have to push the button 14 times!  </li>
            <li> It is very accurate and gives a uniform shave.</li>
            <li> Adjusting the length is electronic and is very accurate with the lit display.</li>
            <li> It is very accurate and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> , I did not find it very precise for the mustache area under the nose and at the edge of the sideburns.</li>
            <li> Very precise blade setting</li>
            <li> Very smooth on the skin and</li>
            <li> I have very light</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It is a very smooth cut and glides over the face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very precise and comfy.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Very very smooth.</li>
            <li> head pivots, which does allow for a very comfortable ride as you go over the edge of your chin, etc.</li>
            <li> easy to use, trims nicely</li>
            <li> The design would be much better if you could easily take the floating head off or if there was some kind of detail</li>
            <li> This worked fine for a while, I even liked the design but the battery life kept getting shorter and shorter</li>
            <li> Be smart about the product and it will work great for you.</li>
            <li> The iStubble precision is incredibly accurate!</li>
            <li> thing needs a huge clearance (just look at the size of the guard on the picture!)</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know if they upgraded it and made it better or what.  </li>
            <li> + STARS, if Available!</li>
            <li> Want more information?  </li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for more than six months.</li>
            <li> The reviews are mostly created by users who are incentivized to use and review the product.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great for trimming your beard and getting your face ready for closer shaving.</li>
            <li> He really enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li> think the bottom line is you need to spend more than $20 to get the close shave.</li>
            <li> OK, I bought this to shave my head.</li>
            <li> I have several Wahl trimmers and have been very happy with all of them.</li>
            <li> I wanted a better routine though.    </li>
            <li> After reading reviews of the $25 piece, I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting a &#x27;grade A, top choice trimmer.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s cordless too, but that isn&#x27;t anything new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not as versatile as the Wahl or Remington, both of which can be used for hairstyling/haircuts, that&#x27;s quite ok with me.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not as versatile as the Wahl or Remington, both of which can be used for hairstyling/haircuts, that&#x27;s quite ok with me.</li>
            <li> and I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Using it for more than 1 year and never faced any issues.</li>
            <li> would like it better if it were waterproof and could be used in the shower to prevent the mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a stubble or close trimmer than you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I suspect something like .1 mm would be more like it.    </li>
            <li> --it will be thicker and more pronounced.    </li>
            <li> The design on this trimmer is top notch</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this trimmer.</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mostly bald man with a beard</li>
            <li> you use it to make sure</li>
            <li> Okay, so what am I supposed to do with the 7 minutes I&#x27;ve just saved?</li>
            <li> I picked this up as an Amazon deal of the day, and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> find the idea of this trimmer to be much better than the implementation.  </li>
            <li> trimmer&#x27;s design allows you to change length settings without fiddling around with attachments as with most trimmers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The iStubble thus seems to do a much better job than the cheaper trimmers in this regard.</li>
            <li> Best facial hair trimmer on the market!</li>
            <li> It is better than Philips Norelco Qt4022/41 Stubble Trimmer Pro.</li>
            <li> wider top helps you to have an even trim all over your face, neck and jaw line.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve got more than just stubble</li>
            <li> and I have gone through many of them.  </li>
            <li> Much better than ones</li>
            <li> Cheap and effective stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li> In fact, I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> One feature that I preferred the most is that you are able to use it while it is charging.  </li>
            <li> So, the question: is this razor worth the money for those of us who just want a good, efficient, razor?    </li>
            <li> SURE</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t wait around to buy it.</li>
            <li> What I love most about it is how close the shave is.</li>
            <li> Love the LCD screen too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll need more time to evaluate this.</li>
            <li> Maybe the GMT880 with manual adjustment would be better.</li>
            <li> My fiancÃ© has tried many trimmers, and couldn&#x27;t seem to find just what he wanted in one shaver, this one he love it had just about everything.. ..</li>
            <li> so you have more looks to play with.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> So in that sense Conair GMT900 iStubble Facial Trimmer was perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the flip up blade cover that allows for mustache trimming.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to check the length every time you turn off the trimmer or you will end up losing your beard.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Work okay on most of my face</li>
            <li> this is as durable as it appears, it could be my best beard trimmer purchased over the last 20+ years.</li>
            <li> I have a short beard and the 5mm setting is perfect.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using it for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Conair is a better trimmer from perspective of trimming dynamics.</li>
            <li> Better for traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the product and its ease of use.</li>
            <li> But its ok i still used it choose between 0.2 or 5.</li>
            <li> So I bought these and am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer</li>
            <li> It works ok.  </li>
            <li> I need precision with a trimmer for my stubble look and most \\&quot;manual\\&quot; trimmers</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so shaving the &#x27;stache area is more of a process.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Better grip...</li>
            <li> Best trimmer if you want a really short trimmed beard.  </li>
            <li> Shaves better than everything else I have</li>
            <li> he&#x27;ll absolutely love it</li>
            <li> What more do I have to say to fill the word requirement.</li>
            <li> $3 more bucks is aweful but who cares.  </li>
            <li> I am able to exchange it.</li>
            <li> Love the simplicity of design and the usage.</li>
            <li> shave more than once a week.  </li>
            <li> Battery life seems just ok.</li>
            <li> Easily Adjusts  Strong Blades that can cut through my thicker beard  Easy to Use  Good Battery Life  </li>
            <li> The top will break and that will be the end of it.</li>
            <li> It is nice and smooth while it works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing</li>
            <li> Just like so many reviews here</li>
            <li> I love the battery indicator</li>
            <li> I love this shaver and use it every day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better trimmer for keeping a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> The best part of it besides for the trimming has to be digital readout of the blade length.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> guide, as I said before, can&#x27;t be taken off of the trimmer, but it can be flipped to the back of the trimmer, which is perfect for when trimming sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li> guide, as I said before, can&#x27;t be taken off of the trimmer, but it can be flipped to the back of the trimmer, which is perfect for when trimming sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li> They both love it.</li>
            <li> I also love the look it gives.</li>
            <li> A nose/ear trimmer works for touching those areas up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for about 2 weeks now, but it has worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I have a better $10 trimmer that has worked better than this.  </li>
            <li> Iâ€™m able to keep a 5 oâ€™clock shadow to a scruffy look at all times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-more challenging to clean&lt;br /&gt;-no</li>
            <li> Trimmer functions great out the box, &amp; very cool-looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For stubble, simply use it without any attachments for a perfect .2mm to .3</li>
            <li> For stubble, simply use it without any attachments for a perfect .2mm to .3</li>
            <li> Overall this is the best product that I have tried to date for stubble management!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s multiple settings are great!      </li>
            <li> I would love this product if either the battery kept a charge or if it was corded and worked plugged in.  </li>
            <li> BUT THERE ARE BETTER TRIMMERS</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> For this price on Amazon, it is an OK deal.</li>
            <li> With the i-stubble you&#x27;re barely touching the skin.</li>
            <li> DONT KNOW FIVE MORE</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Also the trimmer is pain free and trims quite effectively.</li>
            <li> It does what it meant to be and does is the best way possible.</li>
            <li> glad Amazon will let me returned it</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t shave the top of my moustache.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t keep the receipt, so now I have to find something else and spend more money.</li>
            <li> I have owned many shavers including wahl/phillips ect ..</li>
            <li> Probably the best shaver in the market for stubble control however it doesn&#x27;t work as effective as expected in some areas.</li>
            <li> I love the one week stubble look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown to love.</li>
            <li> Overall, the iStubble is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a while.</li>
            <li> Ive used many a trimmer</li>
            <li> love the .4mm length.</li>
            <li> Certainly better than the cheap-crap-plastic bad-battery-junk-falls-apart-doesn&#x27;t-cut stuff that they sell at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> smooth kind of  shave.</li>
            <li> LINE IS I am not wowed by this trimmer, but I learned to love it because it delivers and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> , so I just gifted it to the guy who works in my office by cleaning up the hair that came in the box.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> more than one would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had it for 4 months now and love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> so I will try this with one more unit before I thrown in the towel.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> NOT disappointed at all!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent for that but not actual shaving  </li>
            <li> What more can I ask for?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> I have used this several times per week for 90 days now, and my results continue to be superb.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had the istubble for about four months and love it.  </li>
            <li> I am able to use it while its plugged in though.</li>
            <li> yet I have used it in a pinch (when on the road) and was satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A+ Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> The drawbacks is that it doesn&#x27;t hold power for more than three uses before I have to recharge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all that and more.</li>
            <li> Love how you can adjust the height with a click of a button.  </li>
            <li> This is the one that impresses me most.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- uniform shave across most curved areas</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> I have had better.</li>
            <li> all around, it leaves some hair greater than .4</li>
            <li> so maybe it works better for others.</li>
            <li> I actually Love the product but it broke 4 months after purchase from amazon...</li>
            <li> that Conair - oh well - Better Business Bureau here i come&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it cuts much more evenly and reliably giving me a better look.</li>
            <li> To top it all off, after 3 weeks of use</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see many of these out in stores, which makes me nervous that they&#x27;ll discontinue the product.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works great otherwise, the longest length is 5mm so this is only good for stubble(hence</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conair People: Charge $10 more and make this trimmer with a Li-ion battery.  </li>
            <li> But overall, this thing is awesome.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the performance of the charger, but quite displeased with the fact that it never holds a charge.</li>
            <li> i want to able to give it ZERO rating.  </li>
            <li> Battery life could be better, you get about 10 shaves per charge.</li>
            <li> Best to give it a charge regularly or just always plug in.</li>
            <li> The battery life is better than the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> and I have to say it&#x27;s pretty consistent, probably the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used in my five years of shaving experience.</li>
            <li> that I love the thing.  </li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> Amazon is sending a replacement and we&#x27;ll see if that one fairs any better.  </li>
            <li> Agree, needs something for better grip..</li>
            <li> It is called iStubble for a reason :)</li>
            <li> very even and great results.</li>
            <li> It is called iStubble for a reason :)</li>
            <li> very even and great results.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the shaver should be more durable, so my 5-star rated review has been reduced to 2-stars.</li>
            <li> Make sure you charge it for 16 hours.</li>
            <li> Is is very easy to use and adjusting the levels on the blade is as easy as pressing a button.</li>
            <li> The I-Stubble was very easy to unpack and has easy instructions.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer holds a really good charge to the point he used it right out of the box without having to charge it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Flipping the head to trim right under nose or side burns seems to work good.</li>
            <li> This product works great, the settings allow you to create a nice trim.&lt;br /&gt;Product allows you to do many styles of facial hair, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> One of the best features is that it you have so easy to adjust the trimmer to get the exact right shave.</li>
            <li> The I-Stubble&#x27;s 15 settings allow him to create and maintain his own unique look.  </li>
            <li> Really does trim to 0.4mm, although it&#x27;s just a tad longer than I would have liked - it basically gives me that full 2 day look, which is great, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Battery life is great and the digital settings make getting the perfect trim easy and fast.</li>
            <li> advise you start long and go shorter till you reach a length you&#x27;re happy with, and this is good advice.</li>
            <li> It adjusts extremely easily and cuts effectively, but I wish the battery lasted a bit longer and that the battery indicator was a bit more accurate.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and smooth all while saving me plenty of money on blades.</li>
            <li> Its light weight and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will highly recommend it if the replacement arrives and works without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will highly recommend it if the replacement arrives and works without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly if you&#x27;re looking for a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, easy to handle and effective trimmer</li>
            <li> Continues to go on strong, and works fine!</li>
            <li> Makes for a very clean shave every time.</li>
            <li> Even on the lowest setting it cuts very cleanly and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> while it doesn&#x27;t have a rubberized grip, it is very comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This thing was exceptionally easy to use, and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m becoming follicly challenged on the top of my head and have been shaving my head once a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to choose how long you want your beard to be.     </li>
            <li> First, the unit is well made and feels good on the hand.</li>
            <li> is that the stubble cut by the device is, in many ways, not the \\&quot;ideal\\&quot; stubble grown in a day or two after a good traditional shave with a good blade (or safety blade).</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good though.</li>
            <li> Battery life was also pretty good.</li>
            <li> First, the good:</li>
            <li> I find the battery life to be pretty good.</li>
            <li> My final though is this; that the functionality of this trimmer is actually excellent, as it keeps your stubble very even and looking good.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> You can trust it to keep your beard looking good in between barber&#x27;s visit, but you won&#x27;t be looking like the pretty boy in the poster.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, couldn&#x27;t change lengths of blades.</li>
            <li> and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> thought it would be a gimmick, but it is actually pretty good.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is exactly what I wanted - a high precision stubble trimmer which leaves a perfect stubble on your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also haven&#x27;t experienced any significant issues regarding not being able to get my whole face.  </li>
            <li> Great new profit scheme by the wizards at Conair.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to change the settings.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, make sure you fully charge before use.</li>
            <li> It does have a lot of nice features and does work well to give a nice even shave, however it doesn&#x27;t seem to get very close, even on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> It has a good cutter and no trouble catching the hair.  </li>
            <li> 0.4mm is the shortest it shaves with the guard in place, and it is a nice, short stubble that looks great for me.  </li>
            <li> I was used to an old Remington MB-300 that I used for many years with great results.</li>
            <li> I have had several electric trimmers and the lengths available for this one are awesome.</li>
            <li> I also find it very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> and it is very easy to clean</li>
            <li> Gift recipient was very pleased as how well trimmer works, it&#x27;s easy to clean and light weight.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable and accurate.</li>
            <li> Smooth shaving very accurate.</li>
            <li> The head glides smoothly, and feels very comfortable against my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be perfectly fine with adjusting that manually and getting a trimmer that lasts more than 2 months.</li>
            <li> it gives me a clean shave look at 0.4mm!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome for quick shaves in the morning and provides some detailer settings to get more involved beard / facial hair styles.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use, full charge gives about 50minutes of usage.</li>
            <li> it is very good especially if u want to avoid shaving</li>
            <li> my skin gets irritated by most shavers, however this istubble is perfect for me because it does leave a little stubble that works much better for me.</li>
            <li> Very nice product so far!</li>
            <li> This product has been great so far.</li>
            <li> but so far it has been great.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use the brush every day to free them.</li>
            <li> It does passable duty as a body hair trimmer, but if that&#x27;s your primary purpose, there are better choices out there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> GMT900 is good for any one if you maintain the product very well.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain!</li>
            <li> I may add that not not a hair was pulled and i was able to trim everything very quick and comfortably.</li>
            <li> works fantastic very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> On it&#x27;s lowest setting, the trimmer cuts hair very close to your skin and gives you a very light stubble look, which is nice.</li>
            <li> This, on the other hand, is wonderful.</li>
            <li> But other than those 2 things great buy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and gives you that perpetual unshaven look.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as easy as shaving with an electric razor</li>
            <li> The $20 trimmer I was using before this could easily get twice that</li>
            <li> how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li> This literally has improved my life because I never spend money on razors and I can get a nice clean looking stubble quickly</li>
            <li> The adjustable head make it easy to shave at every length.</li>
            <li> The display lights up, making it easy to read and adjust</li>
            <li> No skin irritation and easy adjustments to trim my goatee, and leave a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on the rest of my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The guard pops up for easy cleaning, screen shows battery life and height.</li>
            <li> I found it easy to trim my face, moustache and neck.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s easy to deal with; I just shake the whiskers out in trash after each use.  </li>
            <li> I shaved my head when I retired for the easy care.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Super easy to adjust length setting</li>
            <li> The iStubble charges very quickly and keeps its charge longer than the Philips device.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s always that easy either</li>
            <li> The blades pop out for easy cleaning and oiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It charges very quickly</li>
            <li> It cuts hair but it doesn&#x27;t make it easy.</li>
            <li> micro-adjustment is fantastic; much more precise than mechanical adjusters&lt;br</li>
            <li> No razor burn, easily controlled stubble length, and well built.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s easy, doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate skin.</li>
            <li> I like that you can&#x27;t easily lose the comb</li>
            <li> I like that you can&#x27;t easily lose the comb</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It shaved so well better than I thought it got really close to a nice one day length.</li>
            <li> Continues still to go on strong.</li>
            <li> And that is not advice for this trimmer in particular, it just promotes good battery health.</li>
            <li> Still going strong after 2 years.</li>
            <li> Had the thing for almost a year and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> It is a great idea but save your money and wait until some major improvements take place.</li>
            <li> For a comparable price, the [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips-Norelco BG2040]] is as good (if not a little better), and easier to use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and good value for money</li>
            <li> The finish is cut more evenly, specially at lower lengths and for me thats</li>
            <li> I set it for 0.4 and was very pleased with how well and fast it cut.  </li>
            <li> I liked the idea, but the first one broke within weeks.</li>
            <li> The best part it doesn&#x27;t cut good when buzzing it stops only when the head of the trimmer is bent back</li>
            <li> I look much better with a 5&#x27;oclocker than I do with a full beard.</li>
            <li> The .4 mm length is perfect for me, and since it adjusts with the push of a button, I can style down to the look I want.</li>
            <li> , i like how you can adjust just by clicking the up or down button for a perfect time,</li>
            <li> I have to say this is hands down the best trimmer I ever used.</li>
            <li> Very easy to calibrate to ones specific need, gives a good finish.</li>
            <li> The battery life is still just as good as before, it cuts just as well and even as new.</li>
            <li> Worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Buy one, as I tried many others first, and am pleased with this one</li>
            <li> /&gt;It trims fine</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to use</li>
            <li> It cuts just fine and hasn&#x27;t pulled my hair so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is still working fine.</li>
            <li> I have bought many clippers in the past and this is the best one so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> I assume it would be fine.</li>
            <li> Was worried about battery life but have had it now for 6 months and it is fine - if you follow manufacturers instructions for charging you won&#x27;t have any issues.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine, however, for a couple of months and then quit working.</li>
            <li> and it still works fine.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever used, in fact this is my second one, the first doesn&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li> The electronic length adjustment works fine</li>
            <li> It works fine once you connect the charge</li>
            <li> If I shave quick I might be able to get 4-5 shaves out of it without recharging.</li>
            <li> If you want to maintain 1-2 days of growth (&#x27;stubble&#x27;, in my book), I&#x27;ve found the Wahl Super Taper II, with no comb attached, to be a much better choice.  </li>
            <li> Conair, if you built this product with even a modicum of care, you&#x27;d probably make millions more dollars from loyal customers.</li>
            <li> Finding the right &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; for the job was not that easy!</li>
            <li> There are plenty of length options available in between these high and low settings which allows you to trim the beard at the most perfect length you want it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very powerful, lightweight and charges very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The varying length of trim is great, and it flows easily, in my opinion, over facial contours.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, cuts well, does not pull hair, easy to clean, but I have to charge it over night before using it.</li>
            <li> Smooth , pain free, easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> blade slips off easily for cleaning and the device is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is SUUUUPER easy to use, which is great for me because as I mentioned I suck at getting the proper trim.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how smoothly it trimmed my whiskers, and the efficient functionality of this fine trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Best part is the fact that it leaves little to no irritation.</li>
            <li> Very good trimer with long time batteries!!!</li>
            <li> the results were fine, it didn&#x27;t scratch or irritate my face in any way, it was easy to clean and</li>
            <li> and I wanted an accurate beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> And no, I do not have some sort of huge crow like nose like the Wicked Witch of the North.</li>
            <li> then you will see a huge depletion  of battery life.  </li>
            <li> esp when we&#x27;re not talking about a huge yard and a mower but your face.</li>
            <li> And that it, I got the result that I desire and gave me great stubble and great beard shapes without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> and I was happy but 3 days later when I went to use it again</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the iStubble quite a lot, and the control of length is fantastic for inexpensive clippers.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER had a trimmer that cuts so close and smooth.</li>
            <li> smooth, even finish of stubble that this trimmer did.  </li>
            <li> smooth, even finish of stubble that this trimmer did.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> floating head is comfortable, and I didn&#x27;t feel any pulling or receive any nicks.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean after use.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a great beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> When I tried the trimmer it made one growling sound and nothing since.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 3 months with no problems and feel comfortable recommending it.</li>
            <li> Overall for me, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> A huge design flaw for a device that&#x27;s primarily used in a bathroom.</li>
            <li> A huge design flaw for a device that&#x27;s primarily used in a bathroom.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and holds a charge.</li>
            <li> Just smooth all over.</li>
            <li> Cannot stop talking about how smooth it is - doesn&#x27;t catch his hair or rip any out.</li>
            <li> just wish it also had a smaller head too ..but great unit.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap beard/stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Completely smooth, it doesn&#x27;t pull at all.</li>
            <li> just a great trimmer for keeping it short.....or very short.  </li>
            <li> Just a cheap product all around.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of body/face groomers and this one appears to have fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> They are also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> to try and keep my  stubble maintained in a comfortable</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Cuts smoothly and evenly</li>
            <li> I have a light stubble.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even turn on after 16 hr charge cheaply made, junk.</li>
            <li> It, like the iStubble is a precise electronic moving head with LCD display for length.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need very short stubble, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Great budget trimmer, after 2 years of daily use the plastic guide snapped so deducted a star for durability but besides that it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Advanced blade technology --</li>
            <li> I have not shaved in years based primarily on style choices but also because I can be prone to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> Extremely precise adjustment of length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The height adjustments are with a push of a button all with a precise cut and all the power you need  </li>
            <li> Does not feel cheap, cuts smooth.</li>
            <li> I primarily use it for body hair.</li>
            <li> The Conair GMT900 iStubble Facial Trimmer is a great product.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and effortless to use.</li>
            <li> It comes with a brush and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I knew what I wanted and could not achieve the precise look.  </li>
            <li> this is a fantastic trimmer when it works.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Because of the always attached guard you get very close without the blades even touching your skin, great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to clean it out so it won&#x27;t get clogged.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great idea but</li>
            <li> Putting a blade on my face every day is not something I enjoy.</li>
            <li> You can also remove the cover and use the guard free setting to trim up around your &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; or hairline.</li>
            <li> I prefer a light beard, maybe 6 days without shaving, and no trimmer I tried would do it.</li>
            <li> I actually really enjoy using this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Which is such great value...</li>
            <li> This trimmer will trim facial hair and gives a great haircut to boot.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t run or even light the LED display.</li>
            <li> I bought this facial trimmer, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> The device is cheaply made and the blades motor seems to be powerless.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Tried many different trimmers and the iStubble is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I get the light when its charging and it shows battery 100%.</li>
            <li> easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with a secure travel case, but putting it inside a shoe seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I just liked the trimmer so much that I decided to buy another one without even looking at the alternatives.</li>
            <li> this is great product which allow me now to control facial hair length on my face</li>
            <li> It is easy to adjust, cuts cleanly, and has been easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The shaver works great, however the charge cannot last through one shave, the warranty makes me cover shipping and takes 4-6 weeks and maybe longer.  </li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave, no nicks or hair tugging.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about how comfortable this thing was.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t throw hair all over the place which makes for easy clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a comfortable stubble.  </li>
            <li> faster if it had a bit more powerful battery.</li>
            <li> The trimming isn&#x27;t precise.  </li>
            <li> The conair also works great at the lowest setting when you push the trimmer guard all the way back.</li>
            <li> It is light and efficient.</li>
            <li> I tried it for 2 weeks now, it works great to trim facial hair and bet that stubble look.</li>
            <li> but it give an even shave hassle free out of the box.</li>
            <li> I actually really enjoy this device.</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Its quite smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect stubble every time, and no time wasted changing the plastic length pieces.</li>
            <li> It was not a violent drop, which the shaver should have survived.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> next day is my anniversary, and I&#x27;m ready to try it out as I want to have the perfect look for my anniversary dinner.</li>
            <li> So far, so good on the battery life.</li>
            <li> and I felt the iStubble was far superior.</li>
            <li> far this unit seems to be good.  </li>
            <li> So put this on the charge for 3 hrs unplug and Good for the next 7 times or more.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Downsides are the lack of a good way to do edging (I use the small-tip from my old Norelco for that), plus I think it would work better/</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> in all, this product is by far superior to the others I have tried on the market.</li>
            <li> With my Wahl I have to concentrate a lot more on holding the trimmer at the right angle to ensure even length and to avoid stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was dirt cheap compared to many others and it works exceptionally well if you are looking for the stubble look or for maintaining a proper beard.</li>
            <li> It is a very fun gadget for any guy to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The digital display is also very nice.</li>
            <li> Overall, works very nicely.</li>
            <li> But it is very useful for trimming.</li>
            <li> Its pretty good- anything below 2.5 mm is what I&#x27;d call a heavy 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and the 3, 3.5 and 4 are great for that scruffy look.</li>
            <li> I like this one it is well designed, good quality, doing a nice shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is not bad though i expected a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> battery has been pretty great so far.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to give it a good long charge (8 hours</li>
            <li> look a lot better than the normal shavers as it followed the contours of my face better</li>
            <li> It requires multiple passes in order to get a perfect trim, and be sure to remember the last setting used because every time you use it, the unit resets itself to 0.4mm, which is the shortest available option.</li>
            <li> The conair does this perfectly and is pretty precise and accurate down to a couple mm.  </li>
            <li> If you want to buy one of these it is worth a try but buy it somewhere that it can be returned easily if it breaks even under light use.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, comfortable and quick.</li>
            <li> It cuts cleanly, doesn&#x27;t pull / tug on hairs and is very easy to use straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> and he says that it works better than the first one he had.  </li>
            <li> So when I first started, I found that it seemed to take more effort than I thought it should.</li>
            <li> 2 min after I got out of bed, I was so excited.</li>
            <li> When originally asked about the delivery i explained it was received damaged.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely worth the money!</li>
            <li> figured there had to be a better way and started looking into higher quality trimmers.</li>
            <li> If I stick to .8mm or higher I am ok.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> adjustment is unique.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also super easy to clean and keep clean.</li>
            <li> I love it because it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Unique floating contouring head</li>
            <li> Be sure to charge overnight (16 hr) before using the first time.</li>
            <li> Even if I grow my facial hair out for more than 10 days, this only takes 5-7 minutes to perfect your stubble.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to see companies beginning to develop products that was specifically geared just for that.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull or snag, cordless (as long as its charged), fully adjustable, and creates the great 5 o clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> However, i&#x27;m really happy with this trimmer and hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I stick with my original assessment:</li>
            <li> Suppose that is not the fault of the product, but be sure this is exactly what you need before you buy it.</li>
            <li> These minor complaints aside, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The lengths are perfect for any length stubble to a small beard.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the battery instructions for first use.</li>
            <li> THE LCD LIGHT IS COOL TO LOOK AT.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth my money!</li>
            <li> AND the price is the most reasonable!</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time, has a scoop to catch some of your clippings, does a great job of trimming the stubbly and has provided me the shortest shave time.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is the lightest weighing electrical shaver I&#x27;ve ever used and it has diminished my hand joint pain remarkably, but I think the design could be improved upon.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> My Original Review:  </li>
            <li> It is also very effective in keeping my stubble just at the 5&#x27;o clock length which is pretty impressive since I have very coarse hair and have slightly chubby cheeks - and this device still gets the job done at the 0.4mm setting.</li>
            <li> So I figured the less sexy older trimmer is better than this beautiful looking one.</li>
            <li> Its very good if you like to keep a short beard or stubble and the razors are very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s NOT waterproof - don&#x27;t try to clean with water</li>
            <li> What I found is that hair gets all over the place in my bathroom, which becomes a challenge to clean.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and out of all the electric shavers I have found this is 100% my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a wall charging unit, a brush and oil to keep your trimmer blades clean and cared for.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve already spent way too much time online, reading reviews and forums trying to find the perfect trimmer.</li>
            <li> this is only one the is easy comfortable and perfect SHORT stubble.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s super light and 110 to 220 V</li>
            <li> /&gt;Minus: Pain to clean up Trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t remove the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; to clean it up.</li>
            <li> I think conair made a mistake resorting to this digital length setting, it looks nice, but is much more ocmplicated than needed -- I am now purchasing a trimmer with mechanical length setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve try several trimer and the iStubble is by far the best.</li>
            <li> And clean up couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
            <li> Just pop the guard up and wipe off, clean with Q-tip.</li>
            <li> cuts well and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Its not for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> But this is not for the man looking to be completely clean shaven every morning.</li>
            <li> If you want a perfectly clean shave, this might not be the one for you.  </li>
            <li> However if you&#x27;re looking for a clean shave after the trim (to line the stubble)</li>
            <li> the digital length gauge works flawlessly, and makes it very easy to get the exact same cut every time.</li>
            <li> I wish Con air put more time into researching ways to improve this product rather than spend money selling the \\&quot;Super Hot Model attracted to the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow guy\\</li>
            <li> I loved the old one but the new one is even better.</li>
            <li> I was mistaken, but it does the stubble look great, and cuts very clean with few passes, just not my style.</li>
            <li> Good, but it goes back to original setting every time you turn it on, instead of staying at the setting the was set up by user.</li>
            <li> Other than that, its a good product and I recommend it for buyers wanting the most out of a shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Conair over the years and they&#x27;ve certainly become a name that I&#x27;ve grown to know, love and trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Conair over the years and they&#x27;ve certainly become a name that I&#x27;ve grown to know, love and trust.    </li>
            <li> The front comb takes some time getting used to specially the area under the nose.</li>
            <li> i love to have certain hair length on my face.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t hold a cake to the top contender, but for specializing in stubble, it does the job.</li>
            <li> and I just received it right on time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quick, easy, and painless to use (do my whole face in say 30 seconds).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quick, easy, and painless to use (do my whole face in say 30 seconds).</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try it out, but</li>
            <li> The length control is incredibly granular, down to .4mm (in .2mm increments)!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a unique look that looks great and can&#x27;t be done with any other beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful in appearance, larger than it looks, sleekly designed, and very well built.</li>
            <li> First shave, took a few minutes to figure out the best angle to hold it.  </li>
            <li> First one was defective, however the 2nd one has worked great for over a year.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only good part.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair grows really fast, so in a day or two there is a lot of it, well, except up top.</li>
            <li> In addition, the floating head feels good and, contrary to some reviewers, I had no problem shaping the stubble under the nose, though it did require some back and forth movements and, as in all razor situations, making faces.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had a good enough reason to.</li>
            <li> It lights up and makes cool mechanical sounds as you adjust it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone that wants more options than 3 or 5 settings.</li>
            <li> I will try one more but it is a real gamble.</li>
            <li> You plug it in occasionally and you&#x27;re good to</li>
            <li> Despite the negative reviews I decided to give this a try... and to my delight it works GREAT!</li>
            <li> The cool color LED display makes the unit look like a work of art.  </li>
            <li> I think it took 15 min for a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should get a full refund on this ripoff of a product.</li>
            <li> LCD display shows selected length and charge level: This part is really cool -- that you can choose the length you want and read it on the screen.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even bother try using this with a full length beard.</li>
            <li> Works well for stubble, but not for full on beards.</li>
            <li> I got one full use out of it.</li>
            <li> But they seem to sacrifice function &amp; versatility, and opt for cool looking design (neon glow-in-dark display, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I just don&#x27;t want a drawer full of electronic grooming devices.</li>
            <li> But they seem to sacrifice function &amp; versatility, and opt for cool looking design (neon glow-in-dark display, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I just don&#x27;t want a drawer full of electronic grooming devices.</li>
            <li> Good overall trimming and range of options.</li>
            <li> Otherwise this is easy to clean, simple and nice for 5 o&#x27;clock shadows..</li>
            <li> Plus it looks cool.</li>
            <li> so I followed the directions and gave it a full 16 hour charge.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone needing a good beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I figured I would at least get a couple years out of the item, HUGE LETDOWN!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who likes the \\&quot;too cool to shave every day\\&quot; look...</li>
            <li> So I would say after two full uses, let it run and just let the battery die and recharge.  </li>
            <li> overall experience with this trimmer is good</li>
            <li> Received and immediately tried this since I have only heard good things.</li>
            <li> a full 16 hours per the directions.  </li>
            <li> will tell how it stands up... but initial impression is quite good.</li>
            <li> will tell how it stands up... but initial impression is quite good.</li>
            <li> I might hesitate to buy it because of the inability to trim near my nose and not doing a good job in getting consistent lengths all over.</li>
            <li> Most men do have trouble keeping up with the modern facial fashions and this has to be (according to my son) one of the best, if not the best trimmer on the market that he&#x27;s tried in a very long time!  </li>
            <li> he really likes that he can adjust the closeness and finds this razor comfortable to hold and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> Other wise its a great product for 4 months but a bit pricey for that short of a lifetime</li>
            <li> Easy to use and settings give exactly what&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> Easy to program for exactly the length of stubble you want.</li>
            <li> other great statements on the box:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 other stubble razors and both held up, but didn&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li> instructions clearly say to charge the trimmer for 16 hrs before its first use, this is a must, according to the manufacturer, to make sure you get the most out of the battery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, if you want the shadow look or the perfec stubble, look no further, the Conair GMT900 is not just the tool you need, but it is well made, simple to use a true stubble trimmer.er gave me the perfect shadow look, the way my beard looks a day or two after I shave, which is my favourite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will note, that I had about 10mm or so of growth at first use and it did fine.</li>
            <li> First time used was fine but has not held a charge since</li>
            <li> Lastly, the contoured shape of the actual trimming attachment is excellent.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a good amount of time, and the trimmer is really useful, especially on trips.</li>
            <li> No biggie, I keep a regular gilette Fusion for cleaning up my non stubble areas and the back razor on it is perfect for getting that bit under the nose.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the longest setting, 5 mm, would be too short, but the 4 mm setting works perfectly for the medium to short length that I like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to make a quick update on this item.</li>
            <li> up, it takes a while to charge, so don&#x27;t think when the battery dies you can just quickly charge and then continue shaving.</li>
            <li> The Wahl is super durable, so now I use the wahl just for shaping sideburns, and I use this for the stubble.  </li>
            <li> Vendor had quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to follow directions and charge completely before using and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I still use the trimmer two to three times a week for a quick trim in college.</li>
            <li> 6/24/16 - After using this for almost 3 years I wanted to give a quick update.</li>
            <li> so I can fade my sideburns into my hair without issues, but you may want to keep a trimmer or something along those lines for under your nose and your sideburns if you have a longer hairstyle, although I also find that probably overkill, as flipping up the guard for edging purposes is extraordinarily</li>
            <li> &quot; Luckily, I came across this product and took a chance on it.</li>
            <li> Tried super glues and Bondic without sucess.</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars because of how long I had my first one and how great it was.</li>
            <li> They warrantied it quickly and without issue.  </li>
            <li> and I like the fact I can quick charge if it runs out before I finish.</li>
            <li> Luckily after airing it out for a day it started working again.</li>
            <li> This is leaps and bounds better than anything I have been able to find at the big box stores.</li>
            <li> Works really well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> And it comes with a precision trimmer so you can clean up hairs on the edge of your lips and right underneath your nose.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that 0.4mm still seems like more than a day&#x27;s worth of growth, I&#x27;d love it if they could go even shorter</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with the iStubble trimmer overall.</li>
            <li> But some guys can rock the perpetual five-o-clock shadow and look great doing it, and they need a better answer than simply shaving every third day.</li>
            <li> may like a normal electric trimmer, with a plastic guide and metal blades, but the iStubble&#x27;s magic is its precision</li>
            <li> This is a great stubble trimmer, BUT after using it for 2 years now I have to say my only complaint is that the guard does not feel that great.</li>
            <li> ; look, with a very consistent hair length.</li>
            <li> Pros - Even shave, great for sensitive skin, digital readout of blade length, comfortable to use&lt;br</li>
            <li> when trimming the edges I want a pretty precise cut</li>
            <li> Not really a negative ractor, since I remember what I like my settings at, but more of an inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the trimmer did work, it was really nice; clean, uniform and simple to use.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 4 weeks, then the plastic that holds down the spring in the cutter assm.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is great and I highly recommend it for men who want the \\&quot;stubble look\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer,,, i use it maintain a good french beard,,, used it for a few weeks now,,, at the 0.4mm setting the beard is trimmed very fine,,,  has replaced my shaver for sure,,, also the ability to make sharp and neat shapes</li>
            <li> Worked great for one and a half years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was using a Toni and guy trimmer previously, and I am hAppy</li>
            <li> Odd shaped head, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Oddly, the comb isn&#x27;t user-replaceable, so you have to send it to Conair for replacement (they have great customer service though).</li>
            <li> You can go real close without the gaurs for a one day stubble look and the adjustments move easily up from there.</li>
            <li> The swivel head really makes it easy to contour to your face.  </li>
            <li> But having a trimmer that can adjust to different lengths without a drawer full of attachments is really nice.</li>
            <li> The way the guard flips up and the blade head pops off for easy cleaning was very well thought-out.</li>
            <li> Recently having stuble is a popular alternative to a full on shave.</li>
            <li> It really does glide easily over your skin as the video</li>
            <li> I researched for a long time to see what would be the best to maintain a constant stubble.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fast, easy,</li>
            <li> Last time it got a full soak, and that kind of did it.  </li>
            <li> The last trim was as good as the first.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen trimmers with much higher price tags that don&#x27;t do what the Conair Gmt900 does!    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it makes a mess at all, and the way the trimmer contours to your face is great.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Also, remember to charge the battery for 16H on the first charge to ensure maximum battery life!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a STUBBLE trimmer which does exactly that!</li>
            <li> They have a great warranty policy &amp; I ended getting a new one in the mail 7 days later!</li>
            <li> It has no thin blade to clean out the edges and corners, or clean out the neck area.</li>
            <li> He was in love, no complaints and over a year later, the trimmer is going strong.  </li>
            <li> It shaves quickly and efficiently while also being nice and quiet.</li>
            <li> It makes it very quick and easy to get a neat, even trim of my beard, much more so than other beard trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past.verall.</li>
            <li> Yes a clipper is great, but being able to see the setting of last use and in general is very help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I casually mentioned that I got a new trimmer at work and two guys at work chimed in that they also own it and think it&#x27;s the greatest trimmer they&#x27;ve ever used as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to use battery life is standard.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great, it&#x27;s quick, easy to use, has customizable size settings, and the battery lasts a ridiculous amount of time.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;trim/shave&amp;#34; this morning with the i-Stubble was quick, comfortable and allowed me to get much much closer than I was ever able to with my old beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this device and only wish I could return the other for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Works great for keeping that little bit of stubble that I like.</li>
            <li> Great product for maintaining stubble on different levels, quiet precise too.</li>
            <li> This was a great investment in my opinion, if you&#x27;re trying to get the after 5&#x27;oclock look or the few days without shaving look</li>
            <li> I wanted a fast and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used a friends prior to purchasing and just had to get my own.  </li>
            <li> Have had no cutting issues with it.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, you have to charge this puppy for 16 hours and it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> the Conair Gmt900 Istubble is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The i Stubble has been by far one of his (and my) favorite Christmas presents this year.</li>
            <li> all hairs have had a chance to come out, and even if all cut at 0.4 mm they do clearly form thicker and more pronounced stubble.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost perfect, but I still give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s not deserving of losing a whole star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as the price goes, this one looks even better in person and the simplicity of use makes it worth the money to me.  </li>
            <li> As far as the price goes, this one looks even better in person and the simplicity of use makes it worth the money to me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried regular razors, the $300 Philips Norelco 3D, the cheap versions of that, and many others.</li>
            <li> Some NiMH batteries suffer from short shelf lives, but the fact that this trimmer buzzed very well fresh out the package is good indication to me that it&#x27;s a quality battery.  </li>
            <li> digital display on the iStubble is also a nice touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also useful even if you&#x27;re clean-shaven or beardy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also useful even if you&#x27;re clean-shaven or beardy.</li>
            <li> The device works OK but after only 4 months of use maybe twice a week, the cheap plastic trimmer guide broke off.  </li>
            <li> I like the adjustable levels, and rarely cut my skin.</li>
            <li> but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> : this razor is truly worth the money.</li>
            <li> It rarely has to charge, and I think you can use it even while it is charging if needed.</li>
            <li> I felt it was worth pointing out for those who might not realize this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would be nice if you could simply rinse off the excess hair on the blade like my cruZer 6, but I like the way this one cuts and feels while trimming.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have the digital control over the length</li>
            <li> Throwing it in the garbage was worth one star.</li>
            <li> Gotta let it charge a full 24 hours before first use.</li>
            <li> so far i love it.</li>
            <li> does a good job, cuts even,  multiple length settings without  multiple  clips too attach, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have almost 2 weeks worth of growth</li>
            <li> but it is well worth it for the cut.</li>
            <li> So much easier than the straight blades I&#x27;ve used all my life, not to mention that a bit of stubble looks better.</li>
            <li> Swiveling head to make it more comfortable around facial</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> The head, blade, and comb are easy to clean with an old toothbrush and the directions suggest lubricating the blades with the included oil monthly.</li>
            <li> but it seems worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> This item is fantastic and I would recommend to anyone, it cuts well, one tiny thing I would say would be that make sure you lube it with the lube that comes with it</li>
            <li> Worth the $$$</li>
            <li> Its mono directional pivoting head glides over the surface of the skin easily / smoothly and I find that I only need 1 - 2 passes to collect most hair.</li>
            <li> Also, folding the comb back to use the blade to trim the neckline, around the ear, sideburns &amp; close shave is nice beause</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different buzzer trimmer things, ranging from your cheap $10 Wal-Mart Remmington trimmer to the $40 Wahl hair trimmer from Costco without the clip.</li>
            <li> The Wahl did a nice job, but this Conair \\&quot;iStubble\\&quot; (which may be the stupidest name for a product in human history) seems to rule</li>
            <li> The box also had kind of a white sticker on it, could be that this sticker is to denote that the item is used and has been returned.</li>
            <li> Pretty Sweet.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this a couple months ago, but I decided to wait to review it until I had some time with it to see how I liked it.</li>
            <li> I keep a very short stubble beard (slightly more filled in for the goatee area).</li>
            <li> For that sole purpose, it&#x27;s the most comfortable device I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have loved Amazon (I&#x27;ve been a Prime member for several years), but this has really soiled my impression of Amazon.</li>
            <li> For example, the Wahl razor this replaces, while not as nice of a tool overall</li>
            <li> That makes it worth it for me despite the annoyingness of charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps that phrase is inappropriate for a beard trimmer, but I found this product to be well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> motors are really powerful</li>
            <li> and I could use this for around 45 minutes after the first full charge of 16 hours</li>
            <li> But, it has the adjustable levels so that makes it more precise for what your personally want.</li>
            <li> but no other unit shave as close, easy and comfortable as this..</li>
            <li> There is no vacuum, but there is a catch that collects most of your stubble unless you are making a significant trim.</li>
            <li> Perfect for all facial and other needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike some of the other reviews that remove stars because they still need different trimmers for under nose, etc... this product works perfectly for my moustache and goatee</li>
            <li> /&gt;I came to like the iStubble pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I came to like the iStubble pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> very comfortable consistent soft shave.</li>
            <li> others, I bought this because it looks cool and received positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it cuts fairly well, and the maximum 5mm setting is just about right.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the most precise and easy to use facial trimmer I have ever used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable trimmer that hates the clean shaven look!</li>
            <li> A single pass and every single hair looks perfectly trimmed and even?</li>
            <li> I researched the hell out of beard trimmers before purchasing this one and I made the right decision.</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> I used it right out of the box</li>
            <li> &quot; right.</li>
            <li> As you know the clean-stubble look is in right now.</li>
            <li> It is all built right in.</li>
            <li> had issues with this right off the bat.</li>
            <li> ; rapid charging system - 90 minute charge provides 45 minutes use: That&#x27;s probably about right.</li>
            <li> just the right look you&#x27;ve been going for.</li>
            <li> For $45 US, it is in the right price bracket.   </li>
            <li> Right off the bat the trimmer didn&#x27;t hold charge</li>
            <li> I chose this trimmer watching the video review on youtube and tell you what the video gets it right on the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the 1.6 length is just about right for the half-beard that drives the fellas crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The settings and cut are right</li>
            <li> and no matter how you try to shape your face - there&#x27;s just not a way you can get those hairs right under your nose, so</li>
            <li> never, ever reaches the area right under my nose; I have to finish with scissors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have a non-movable trimmer right in there.</li>
            <li> Garbage did not work right out of box</li>
            <li> I do it with my old trimmer, and it works great - clean, sharp lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer about 1.5 years ago and was happy first few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product build seems fine, and it is easy enough to use.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Its great for the first few shaves.</li>
            <li> Once again I can only praise this product but make sure you give it the full 16 hour charge</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying the idea of getting this product came about as a simpler way to look clean in college without taking as much time to shave.</li>
            <li> It is surprisingly quiet and very easy to set the trim length.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to adjust settings for different heights, and the guard goes with the contour of your face.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has a digital length indicator which makes it very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to adjust for different lengths depending on your mood or needs.</li>
            <li> , the blade snaps out and back in very easily.</li>
            <li> This little guy is amazing!</li>
            <li> That said the way the height mechanism leverages makes it have a very large rear head (not shown in the product picture), which is tricky to get under a Roman nose like mine.  </li>
            <li> All in all, with this device it takes literally less than 5 minutes to have the perfect length of stubble or short beard every day.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly easy to use, allows very simple yet precise control of stubble length, and let&#x27;s me get my stubble to the length I want in about one</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a great stubble trimer for years now and really thought this would be the one, based on the previous reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily i was able to open it up and it started working again.</li>
            <li> Good quality razor, though I wish it could get slightly closer...leaves about 2 days worth of growth at the .4 length</li>
            <li> Lightweight, easy to use and operate, in my opinion, an excellent purchase ... now the only thing is to check how long it will last (:</li>
            <li> My husband has not been able to adjust the levels, so he&#x27;s still using his old shaver most days, and this one only 1-2x/week.  </li>
            <li> Humbly, long before &amp;#34;the look&amp;#34; became popular.  </li>
            <li> this one is really good value for money and provides and nice clean height to your beard, only problem is its hard shave around under your nose/top lip.</li>
            <li> He is extremely picky about having the perfect trim and has tried multiple trimmers ranging from high end items to practical ones and this is his favorite by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty good at assembling things, but I can&#x27;t currently figure out how the two blades and the spring fit back in Satan&#x27;s trimmer.</li>
            <li> Even trimming, fast, comfortable, digital display, self adjusting guard, looks great, long charge.  </li>
            <li> the spacer is a good 1/2 inch or more ahead of the cutter and that makes for problems... especially when the leading edges are so dang sharp.</li>
            <li> In addition, there are certain spots it just can&#x27;t get!  </li>
            <li> This is great for people with different styles of facial hair.  </li>
            <li> trimmer I had before this is probably 5 years old and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Using the iStubble one handed was easy and fairly natural, the weight and balance</li>
            <li> Using the iStubble one handed was easy and fairly natural, the weight and balance</li>
            <li> Sure, there is also a substantial price difference as well, about double, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it in the end given the ease of use and precision.</li>
            <li> The result is that a day or two \\&quot;natural\\&quot; stubble after a good shave will be less dense than the day after day use of the iStubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll happily give it back if the replacement works properly over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll happily give it back if the replacement works properly over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The length adjusting buttons are clearly marked and easy to manipulate, even while I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: after a few weeks of using this trimmer im on the lookout for a more powerfull machine with a better battery life.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very picky and has only amazing things to say about this.  </li>
            <li> Ergonomic design for easy control and complete comfort:</li>
            <li> Overall, I find this trimmer to be very convenient to use (no storage, losing and various length switching blade screens), easy to use with good battery life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not loud, easy to hold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great for facial hair, neck, back and everything</li>
            <li> Quite happy overall, but if 50% charge and you don&#x27;t oil the blades or regularly (oil provided), neck hair can be tugged and cause alot of discomfort and blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s great for keeping your beard, mustache &amp; hair short.</li>
            <li> It was a bit more expensive than others, but I must say it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say the pulling is NOT normal.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find the right position or positions to help you keep your facial hair the way you want it, or try something</li>
            <li> It is a little tough getting your stache right under your nose as some have mentioned, but still doable; honestly though I&#x27;ve yet to see a razor or trimmer with a guard get there perfectly anyway.</li>
            <li> They both love them, and I love their tame beards</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the battery used to be really good in the beginning (about 4-6 shaves worth) but after about a year or two really went down in quality (about 2 shaves-worth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads</li>
            <li> It also charges VERY fast.</li>
            <li> very fast 5oclock shadow shave which what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The battery wears down kind of quickly and it can&#x27;t be used while plugged in   </li>
            <li> While the trimmer works fine, it is completely non-water resistant.</li>
            <li> I found the unit very well built and very user friendly.</li>
            <li> Worked fine till just over a year old...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every stubble trimmer out there, and this is the most comfortable due to the plastic comb that glides along the face.</li>
            <li> I think Conair should continue with this line of trimmers, though I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve hit the sweet spot in this particular incarnation.  </li>
            <li> I really thought this would be the perfect facial hair trimmer for me... and it was... for less than 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the overall design, it would be nice if it came with a stand, like products that Phillips offer, which are neat and tidy and allow for the power supply cord to essentially be hidden.</li>
            <li> Has good adjustable settings, I would say its for those who like to keep a 5oclock shadow going or to trim it close but not clean shaven.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing some people glared over that little detail and it changed their view of how good the trimmer was in their opinion[s].  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing some people glared over that little detail and it changed their view of how good the trimmer was in their opinion[s].  </li>
            <li> so you may have to wait just a little, but eh still good</li>
            <li> Excellent product, wish the cutting blade was a little wider but otherwise great.  </li>
            <li> The length choices are good for people with longer facial hair needing to achieve a \\&quot;darker\\&quot; or more full look, but keep everything neat, clean and intentional stubbly is the name of the game here.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very surprised that it&#x27;s received so many positive reviews, but be warned that this trimmer may hurt a lot more than you ever expected.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> This razor does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and lasts long on a charge.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Trimmer and would not EVER use another different Trimmer AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> If its maximum length is the same as the minimum on most clippers..</li>
            <li> It is, after all, exactly for what it&#x27;s name implies.. stubble.. and stubble alone.  </li>
            <li> It does the job and gives a pretty close trim.</li>
            <li> If you purchase this trimmer, be sure to handle it with care because it&#x27;s fragile.</li>
            <li> Let me first start off by saying I&#x27;ve read the biggest portion of the reviews for this trimmer here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I charged mine for 3 days for 4 hours and maybe even an extra day for maybe another hour or so to be sure it would be fully functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I charged mine for 3 days for 4 hours and maybe even an extra day for maybe another hour or so to be sure it would be fully functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cut height returns to &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; each time, It doesn&#x27;t hold a memory of where you set the depth, so you have to adjust it first each time you use it.  </li>
            <li> I have a corded model, a cordless model, and my most recent purchase a Bald Fader.</li>
            <li> I flipped the guard back and used the included brush to sweep away the hair buildup on the blade and the shave was so much better.</li>
            <li> While giving it its first 16hr charge, I read over the instructions to familiarize myself with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first one died after the rechargeable battery gave up after 2 years of use.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Comfortable &amp; offers many lengths without multiple attachments</li>
            <li> I did follow the manual that charge it for 16 hrs at the first.</li>
            <li> I call the hot line telephone number, from the body of the trimmer, since it comes with a two year warranty.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well for just over four monthes</li>
            <li> I personally use it on the 1.4mm setting where the stubble is a bit more visible.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> This is the first stubble shaver I&#x27;ve used but in reviewing others I wanted one that looked like it would get the hairs that grow against the skin.</li>
            <li> So, as soon as it arrived, I handed it to him and he couldn&#x27;t believe just how low and precise the iStubble cut!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This came charged and ready to use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen trimmers with much higher price tags that don&#x27;t do what the Conair Gmt900 does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I broke my first one by dropping it...</li>
            <li> Guys if you are looking for a quality stubble shaver and more, this in my opinion is the ultimate.</li>
            <li> I can see this motorized length control as the first thing to break since you have to adjust the length on every use.    </li>
            <li> At first, I thought I would just use it at it&#x27;s lowest setting all the time, but after I saw how close it can get I will probably using a step or 2 higher.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I&#x27;ve been able to keep it alive by immediately drying it out with some heat after the occasional accident, but I don&#x27;t expect this to work</li>
            <li> Fortunately I&#x27;ve been able to keep it alive by immediately drying it out with some heat after the occasional accident, but I don&#x27;t expect this to work forever.</li>
            <li> You will have to oil it, as with many trimmers, but the numerous settings makes it so much easier to trim anything to need to trim!</li>
            <li> Sure, with the guard in place - you&#x27;ll be left looking like Hitler.</li>
            <li> The first was when I attempted to trim my sideburns.</li>
            <li> This one for variable length trimming, and my old hacksaw for precise lines.</li>
            <li> I bought this Trimmer for a friend and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> The Conair would be okay for short beards, but I found it rather &#x27;grabby&#x27; when using at its shortest setting (0.4 mm).  </li>
            <li> Plugs in (so no recharging), runs at a higher RPM, and cuts through like nothing.</li>
            <li> This will be the last one I ever purchase cuzz it doesnt get better than this.</li>
            <li> Product does exactly was it is meant to do with ease.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> The ONLY trimmer my husband has ever used more than once.  </li>
            <li> I thought for sure it would die at first contact with hair, but it is just that quiet.</li>
            <li> , even bleary-eyed first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I followed the recommendations for first charge and charging thereafter.</li>
            <li> I look so hot</li>
            <li> application for purpose make this a first rate trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and it will definitely be all of my buddies&#x27; christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li> so you can get a consistent trim each time you use it.</li>
            <li> is that the trimer guard is not removable, which means you can&#x27;t really do any edging with this device (if it does come off and someone knows how, please let me know!)</li>
            <li> Finally, it keeps losing its setting when it&#x27;s swtiched off for a more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I went with this one, and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I love the way that the blade adjusts through the buttons and has a digital display for the length setting.  </li>
            <li> You just have to get up in there and make a bit of a funny face.  </li>
            <li> Traditional blades were always harmful to me as they delivered too close of a shave and contributed to more razor bumps.</li>
            <li> and you have to pull the head up its pain and its slowwww compaired to old cheap norelco</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re cool with the downsides, you&#x27;ll likely really enjoy owning this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Read the instructions - charge it for 16 hours before first use.</li>
            <li> Did intense research and this seemed really worth it.</li>
            <li> It also cuts very short (way shorter than Philips) and gets a more consistent length cut.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> I must&#x27;ve convinced myself that this fancy adjustable digital display one was better, but it really just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> So, in mid-late December I asked for this as a present for Christmas and if I was to be honest it does everything necessary as a trimmer for a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li> You are even able to disconnect the razor attachment and get under there if deemed necessary.  </li>
            <li> MAKE SURE you follow the directions for the initial charge up (which is 11-12 hours), and that you hold the razor correctly.</li>
            <li> The first time I went to try this</li>
            <li> It really is a pleasure to use!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help resisting writing about the marketing folks that worked on this product first.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> the blade mechanism  malfunction since first use</li>
            <li> So when having some beard stubble became more acceptable and fashionable in recent years, I decided to try a stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li> I ordered it more than 6 months ago but used it in the last 4 months</li>
            <li> This trimmer is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> It says on the plug, &amp;#34;Charge 16 hours first time&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this one and was psyched the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> first time, the blades detached from the motor/actuator.</li>
            <li> The first had two issues.</li>
            <li> Make sure to trim multiple times to get consistent stubble (see the iStubble usage video, search on youtube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> if it could only fix the gray that is coming out in my beard.... :)</li>
            <li> , I first tried it at 1mm</li>
            <li> OK this is the second one I owned.</li>
            <li> I have concluded now that my first one died from over charging.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have written a review on a product I have purchased through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I bought one for my husband first and my son started to borrow it</li>
            <li> The first was a cheaper one I found in CVS.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to tailor my beard as it was a first time growing it out.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a all-in-one trimmer/groomer for goatee or stubble, I&#x27;d recommend something more versatile, such as ([[ASIN</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a all-in-one trimmer/groomer for goatee or stubble, I&#x27;d recommend something more versatile, such as ([[ASIN</li>
            <li> did exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li> No problems with this trimmer except my first one stopped working after 6 months.</li>
            <li> My last electric trimmer lasted for many years</li>
            <li> Granted, most of the trimmers I bought were on the low end, so I decided to invest in</li>
            <li> You must charge it for 16 hours the first time, and every once in a while thereafter.</li>
            <li> I wish it would not reset to the lowest setting every time, but I love how well it works at keeping my beard short.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Short story is, mine started malfunctioning after the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love that it is digital, and how the head bends with every arch of your face/head.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have never used a trimmer like this that has ever cut my skin... until now.</li>
            <li> It is smooth, soft on your face, doesn&#x27;t pull, and the trimmer and head unit glides over your face and cheek bones without pulling hair as it trims.</li>
            <li> first me</li>
            <li> I have to go over the same spots again to make sure it trims evenly.</li>
            <li> With the regular daily use, I think this should give me enough credibility to review this trimmer with excellent judgement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This device was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Followed all the instructions, charged for 16 hours before first use, cleaned after each use, kept away from water.</li>
            <li> pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The guard flips back allowing for even closer shaving and touching up.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Pros: Many levels of stubble are possible.</li>
            <li> And I have used many different styles and brands over the years.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> However, after using this (just used the blades straight on my hair/skin), my face no longer got shaving bumps!</li>
            <li> Blue LED light is cool which monitors the battery and the adjustable level for length.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and thought I would take my chances because I like the idea, so I ordered this trimmer and followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> I love the digital control to adjust the length.</li>
            <li> Still holding a charge pretty</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It worked fairly well and was pleased until i tried to use it the next day and was completely dead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While not perfect, this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned yet.  </li>
            <li> Even if it only lasts a year I will gladly but another at this price.</li>
            <li> That seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Hence the review ;)</li>
            <li> ,  it can give you a real close &amp;quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;quot; to a nice long stubble..  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still recommend this but just be aware of the battery issue..</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to charge it for 16 hours the first time before using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This trimmer trims my beard exactly as I want it trimmed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d even be willing to help if you need someone to test it.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I like all of the different settings and the fact that I can use it while plugged in and charging (unlike many electric razors).</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It fell apart the first week I had it</li>
            <li> It makes life that much easier so its worth it...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and light hair</li>
            <li> This is the first item I&#x27;ve ever been compelled to rate on Amazon after years of using prime.</li>
            <li> When I first got this trimmer, I followed the instructions and everything</li>
            <li> yet it broke within 5 min of me first using it.</li>
            <li> ... I love that it goes up in increments of .2 mm starting with from .4</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Sure you will get different trims depending on if you use your dominant hand vs. your none dominant hand.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s exactly the stubble length I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love the multiple length settings.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you very carefully wrap it in clothing (or better, ensure that the head can&#x27;t press against anything) you&#x27;d be ok, but I would advise against putting it in a suitcase unless you put it back in the original package.</li>
            <li> The design allows for easy maneuverability over the contours of your face and for easily lining up around sideburns or other close</li>
            <li> Super precise settings make this a must for anyone wanting to fine-tune facial hair.  </li>
            <li> worked for about a week or so, then started making loud noise and kept pinching me every time i shaved, do not buy!!!!</li>
            <li> you can shave fast, clean it fast, and it holds a charge for a long time (even when weaken) I love it, and would buy again.</li>
            <li> If your made of money and want to buy a new one every 6 months, then not a bad product.  </li>
            <li> For more meticulous people you may want to go a little more high end.</li>
            <li> But there are a lot of shortcomings - most importantly the fact that a little bit of water can kill it and because I need to carry a 2nd trimmer with me most of the time.</li>
            <li> It measures in millimeters, and gives you that nice short, rugged, yet professional shave every time!</li>
            <li> However, it does cut very smoothly and cleanly, and with less irritation than any trimmer I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> In fact I plugged it in before I left for work around 7am and didnt use it for the first time until the following morning giving it a good first charge.  </li>
            <li> This would be handy for trimming hair in other places.  </li>
            <li> The floating head and sharp blades give nice even results.</li>
            <li> Glad to report this one does the job and seems to be worth what I spent on it.  </li>
            <li> Glad to report this one does the job and seems to be worth what I spent on it.  </li>
            <li> My main goal was to look for something that could maintain a stubble look of about a 3-5 days worth of growth.  </li>
            <li> I hope this is the last review, because I have tried several trimmers and none as good as this one.</li>
            <li> and it has many settings, including  a 0.4 setting that gives you a really CLOSE trim, yet leaves just enough there to give you &amp;#34;that look&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Simply flip the guide to the back, grab the included brush and give it a good swipe accross the trimming head, then, apply a drop or two of the included oil</li>
            <li> Simply flip the guide to the back, grab the included brush and give it a good swipe accross the trimming head, then, apply a drop or two of the included oil</li>
            <li> quick, clean, short.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant when purchasing this trimmer, but I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Amazing little shaver, great battery life once broken in, easy to clean and cuts very short.</li>
            <li> so the first charge should be a full sixteen hours followed by three complete cycles of completely discharging the battery and recharging it to full capacity to achieve maximum battery performance.</li>
            <li> I have owned easily a dozen clippers/trimmers of all kinds; however, this guy has convinced me that this is truly the FIRST facial hair trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Taking apart the head and cleaning the blades is pretty simple and easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cool looking, with digital programmable adjustable length (from .4 mm to 5 mm).</li>
            <li> However, I was under no obligation whatsoever to give it a positive review, and in fact I found some flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep the charger handy as it will run low after a few (3-5) uses.</li>
            <li> I generally use it on the longest setting (5.0) because the shorter ones make a light beard invisible but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> Sure, there is also a substantial price difference as well, about double, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it in the end given the ease of use and precision.he guide was removed and the head contacted skin directly.  </li>
            <li> But within its operational range this thing works very well and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> My almost tireless search pretty much ended when I found the ~$24 Gillette Proglide Trimmer System.</li>
            <li> This trimmer really seems like a great idea, but ultimately fails to be as precise as it tricks you into thinking it is.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning could not be easier, the blade (and all the hair) is accessible by popping off the top guard, run the included brush through a few times and your done.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts an extremely long time and will provide many uses.  </li>
            <li> have used this every other day for the last year, and it still works great.</li>
            <li> I first bought the BabyLiss i-stuble trimmer (which really looks identical by the way), and it did not work (just didn&#x27;t charge), so I had to return it.  </li>
            <li> The head pivots-extremely cool for precision and for those like me with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> 3: It is sturdy and the design is cool but definitely not a heavy duty trimmer that you will hand over to your son someday...</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long (so long as you charge it the full 16 hours before you first use it), it is easy to use, it comfortably glides over your face and neck.  </li>
            <li> causing me to seriously question why so many people seem to have so many issues.  </li>
            <li> My main issue with most of the trimmers have been their ability to get the hairs without having to go back and forth a hundred times.</li>
            <li> For the price, honestly, I&#x27;m a bit let down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it has to be so large, but it does feel good in the hand.</li>
            <li> The built in trim guard can easily be flipped back so that you can use just the bare cutters - this is great for getting around tight spots like around your nose.  </li>
            <li> The length adjustments are smooth and accurate; I&#x27;ve used multiple trimmers and most have trouble getting an even length around my neck area, but the iStubble got the length I prefer spot on.  </li>
            <li> sure to charge for a full day before using and use the first (and second and third) charge fully, before recharging.  </li>
            <li> This new trimmer is the same as the old trimmer and works great with a sharp trimmer to comfortably cut beard hair.  </li>
            <li> He loves the digital screen and the easy controls.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*It is easy enough to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades come un-oiled and the trimmer head seemed jammed when I first turned it on ,like many have said.</li>
            <li> So if you want a non irritating and non-adjustable shave, check out the Styliner, but if you&#x27;d like an adjustable trimmer, the iStubble is pretty great ignoring the battery life.</li>
            <li> The shaver is easy to use and maintain and relatively quiet for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have no problem saying that I believe this could take a daily use easily.</li>
            <li> While its not as easy, its still relatively simple to reach that spot.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is it can break easily if dropped.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t easily be replaced, and now the *only* thing I can use it for is close shave (you can&#x27;t adjust it *</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t nick me, didn&#x27;t make me red, and it&#x27;s easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> Although this is a current Conair product and the comb is easily replaceable, Conair does not have replacement parts.</li>
            <li> Apparently rims beard nice and short</li>
            <li> This was to replace a previous i-Stubble that my son really liked.  </li>
            <li> That is a minor complaint for an awesome product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The digital display is easy to read, and the way the guard is designed it moves across my face with ease.</li>
            <li> This is pure nonsense.</li>
            <li> have always wanted to keep my stubble beard at one certain length each and every day for decades.  </li>
            <li> : The comb is gentle on the skin, it holds a charge for a long time (I use it once to twice a week and have only had to charge it about 9 times in the 18 months), and it is quick and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a little more time if I want precise trimming around my nose, but I find this is true of any trimmer with a guard; your nose is simply too close to your mustache!</li>
            <li> : work your way down to progressively shorter lengths until you&#x27;re sure you have the right length.</li>
            <li> It cuts my facial hair to a fine stubble.</li>
            <li> After the initial 16 hour charge everything is fine.</li>
            <li> They also include a handy little brush for cleaning it after use and mineral oil for lubricating the blades.</li>
            <li> It is not perfect but it is very good.</li>
            <li> you can get past those two minor issues then buy this product, it does a very good job maintaining that stubble look.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;first, this thing is fast and cuts so good, it&#x27;s hard to believe how well it really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every beard/mustache trimmer on the market with a few exceptions[mostly the Braun cruzers, Phillips &#x27;perfect stubble&#x27;, and a few others].  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every beard/mustache trimmer on the market with a few exceptions[mostly the Braun cruzers, Phillips &#x27;perfect stubble&#x27;, and a few others].  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re trying to make your mustache the same length as your beard, you won&#x27;t have an accurate length unless you use scissors.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li> He has even left it off the charger for a few days and it held a great charge.  </li>
            <li> Until I bought and used the Conair GMT900, I had no idea how much difference in appearance would result from a trimmer that precisely cut all bristles to the same length.  </li>
            <li> so I cant comment on the battery life that a few people have mentioned, but overall this is a great product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much</li>
            <li> The comb stayed in place the whole time the trimmer was in use and didn&#x27;t tug or pull whatso</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have plenty of hair on the side of my head that grows insanely fast.</li>
            <li> So I found that Bald Fader was REALLY close</li>
            <li> Holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li> to its marketing, the iStubble worked very well when used as intended.  </li>
            <li> it works fast anyway.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too.      </li>
            <li> Considering my boyfriend is BEYOND VERY picky, that is a feat in itself.</li>
            <li> would recommend this trimmer if you are not concerned with longevity of your product and an amenable customer service department.</li>
            <li> The real test will be when he shaves his head with it.</li>
            <li> And it does seem to cut hair to .4 mm, which seems to be a much closer cut than the competition.</li>
            <li> I really like the electronic mechanism that raises the the trimmer to your desired setting.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t want that half-trimmed look haha).</li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> Performs as advertised, simple to use and is hassle free.</li>
            <li> That means I can FINALLY get rid of the pile that I have in my closet in the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swiveling head flips up and open so that you can clean it easily with the oil and brush that comes with the Conair iStubble itself.  </li>
            <li> It comes highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> It comes highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon and IStuble.</li>
            <li> I have very &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> What seems to happen is that an opening on the height-adjustment for the blade causes the softer skin on your face to fill the opening more than the harder skin leaving inconsistent stubble length.  </li>
            <li> I really like stubble beards.</li>
            <li> The Wahl trimmer I recently purchased feels cheap in comparison.</li>
            <li> iStubble trims very neatly even for medium length beards.</li>
            <li> I really like this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not so much with the GMT900.</li>
            <li> He says it is really gentle on his skin</li>
            <li> and it gives him the effect that he wants when shaving.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to using it as my primary trimmer for several years to come.</li>
            <li> I really like these clippers</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this trimmer to all men in the market for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> This item is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It seems like this part is not designed very well.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the closest shave available for a facial trimmer.</li>
            <li> Never could&#x27;ve expected better.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, even to Hawaii.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well on your mustache area</li>
            <li> A very close shave also if needed.</li>
            <li> Overall, it works well and it works comfortably.</li>
            <li> Does a very even job, but you have to go over your beard in a couple of directions.</li>
            <li> I feel like I can trim with just a couple passes in a very controlled manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> does not shave VERY close</li>
            <li> From day one this trimmer was a pain to use and gave a very inconsistent length trim.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to try a &#x27;stubble&#x27; approach and found this product to really stand out.  </li>
            <li> This has been proven to increase alertness in the morning using intense agony to really wake you</li>
            <li> The manual has a diagram of the device, but said diagram doesn&#x27;t show the blades or how they fit back in.</li>
            <li> I just want to trim my &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34;, thanks.</li>
            <li> The lowest setting did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> This one has a floating head, which means it moves to the contours of your face and makes the whole process a lot easier.</li>
            <li> It work really well.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast .  </li>
            <li> once you find the proper length , its smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> Feels like it should cost three times as much as it does.</li>
            <li> Works really well ...</li>
            <li> Thanks, Tom   EDIT:</li>
            <li> I have found this product to be even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I really like the razor</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really get my mustache area as well as I can get everything else</li>
            <li> really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> It shaves really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I paid roughly $50 for it, so I&#x27;m not going to just stop using it, and I hope it (maybe?) gets better, but</li>
            <li> I really like this trimer with one exception.</li>
            <li> It absolutely does not hold a charge for longer than one use.</li>
            <li> It cuts fast and without pulling&lt;br</li>
            <li> have a moustache and goatee and really don&#x27;t like to blade</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really use electric shavers (norelco, braun, etc.)</li>
            <li> really like how it goes in increments</li>
            <li> Plus the battery holds a charge really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only downside is (and I&#x27;m being very picky since I haven&#x27;t come across one that does it) is when changing sizes (i.e. from 0.4 to 0.6) it powers off.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this one by Conair!</li>
            <li> This is my whole head shaver, face and hair (shaved head).  </li>
            <li> So the product works really well for its intended purpose.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it is straight forward to use and automatically switches off after a minute or so of non-use.   </li>
            <li> what so ever compared to shaving, and is much happier.</li>
            <li> Adjusts better than expected.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the logic of Conair.</li>
            <li> It cuts very well.</li>
            <li> These things take much longer to use that hair clippers.  </li>
            <li> And it really does --</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t to much to it.</li>
            <li> so you cant really complain about</li>
            <li> It feels like a very well put together unit and the motor driven adjustment system</li>
            <li> works really</li>
            <li> A friggin&#x27; shame really.</li>
            <li> Very even trim on my head and face.</li>
            <li> It seems very well engineered.</li>
            <li> I also get a really close trim with this iStubble making it look like I had shaved my face a day ago.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s adjustable but it still doesn&#x27;t add much variety in length.  </li>
            <li> thing really works and is really helpful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> But the real kicker is my face is a lot happier since I stopped shaving.</li>
            <li> This is not seen same as others which I bought from the stores that available outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From the specs and features, I really like it</li>
            <li> : The blade broke after three months, had to toss the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I did the whole charging thing and</li>
            <li> Too much</li>
            <li> Theres like 8 different settings so it will create a smooth fade.</li>
            <li> (it makes that much of a difference).</li>
            <li> I really like the way this one cuts.</li>
            <li> holds the charge reasonably well</li>
            <li> Gives a much closer trim than my Philips-Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great idea, poor execution.</li>
            <li> The Istubble is a much easier system for us grooming at home.</li>
            <li> I have found it very reliable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being 21, I&#x27;ve not had much experience with beards.  </li>
            <li> This product is absolute garbage.</li>
            <li> and I really like when he has the &amp;#34;hasn&#x27;t shaved in 2 days&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> He loves that he can set it on whatever length he wants.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I use the shaver for about 2 minutes in the morning and done; so much easier than shaving every day for work.</li>
            <li> Noisy, does not work straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my goatee and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the micro adjustments that can be made, it is used for all the hair on my body.</li>
            <li> The clipper is also wide so gets more done in each pass.</li>
            <li> Does not work on side burns very well.  </li>
            <li> much do I like this thing?</li>
            <li> People have been reporting that theirs go out much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides, you can have a very close shave if you use the device without the comb head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent way too many hours reading reviews, looking on the internet, watching videos to pick a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I can&#x27;t see any way to really improve on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, this is for someone who wants a stubble type beard.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, this is for someone who wants a stubble type beard.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li> Always room for improvement, but this felt like just a tad too much room.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has nice features but is pinches the skin around the lip area and cannot  trim close under the nose leaving an uneven trim</li>
            <li> With full charge for the first 4 months, it lasted about 20 to 30 mins (non-stop), after 6 months to a year, fully charged battery life can only sustain about 15 to 20mins...</li>
            <li> if I could give this a negative review I would, bought this and straight out of the box, I knew it couldn&#x27;t be good</li>
            <li> I liked the iStubble a lot but only very briefly.  </li>
            <li> It makes it very quick and easy to get a neat, even trim of my beard, much more so than other beard trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> This is a great stubble/beard trimmer so long as you do not need to shave down to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Also, I participated in Movember and grew a full beard this time and this trimmer was fantastic when I shaved down into my mustache of choice to end the month.  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as intended and is not hard to operate.</li>
            <li> I have very dense, thick facial hair and this one is able to managed it easily to maintain it at a true stubble length (1mm and shorter).&lt;br</li>
            <li> then this item will most certainly NOT replace what you&#x27;re already using.  </li>
            <li> Oddly large head, but works better than other options tried.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m really into new age technology and was the first to buy a CD player on my block)  </li>
            <li> I received this facial hair trimmer through the Amazon Vine program and it really does a great job of trimming my beard down to very light stubble without looking patchy or uneven.  </li>
            <li> Thank you conair, you&#x27;ve finally put my endless hours spent shopping for and trying for the perfect trimmer to rest.!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone who wants to keep sideburns or a short goatee trimmed and nice looking, but for beards of ANY length it is just too messy and it takes longer to clean up everything</li>
            <li> However, I ordered a new one because my first one would no longer charge.</li>
            <li> The head adjusts easily and the batter lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It usually (like above) takes about 2-3 minutes of just making sure I went over every area to have a complete shave and its cleanup is rather easy by just blowing the hairs off of the trimmer and using the provided brush to clean underneath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best hands down.</li>
            <li> He loves the digital length settings which made this item unique to him.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does create a stubble and which is why you will buy this, anything more than 5mm you have to look for other options like Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed many other reviews say this,</li>
            <li> So now my first use of the i-Stubble might be a little more slippery than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> You have to be creative around your nose but other than that it has served its purpose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used any other stubble trimmers to compare this unit to, but I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Love this thing lots of length settings and hold a charge for about a month with my every other day of shaving my stubble.</li>
            <li> It trims great but is hard to clean due t</li>
            <li> Where I wish it would do more, I am not willing to pay the price.</li>
            <li> Other than some better grip on the unit, I can&#x27;t think of anything I could tell the mfr to change.</li>
            <li> Other than some better grip on the unit, I can&#x27;t think of anything I could tell the mfr to change.</li>
            <li> Both original item and replacement did not hold charge after 16 hours of constant charging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can flip the spacer off to use it for trimming along the edge of your beard, but I didn&#x27;t find this as nice because it was hard to see exactly where I was holding it and</li>
            <li> I actually prefer a clean shaven face, but for those who don&#x27;t this is what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a shaver, it won&#x27;t work if you want clean shaven, it is for stubble lengths only.  </li>
            <li> The guard flips open and rinses clean in just one pass under the sink.</li>
            <li> The shaver works well, and is fairly quiet, but I found that any setting lower than 2.5 basically came close to a clean cut look.</li>
            <li> The only way I knew to get it was to shave clean and wait three days, so I started researching beard trimmers online.  </li>
            <li> some small improvements would result in a far superior product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also consider this a true stubble trimmer whereas the other device was more of a short beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Some spots, specially on my neck and the corner of my mouth, required some skin stretching and different approach angles, but the results were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Finally made the right purchase!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I see very little difference between these settings even though they&#x27;re 5 steps away.</li>
            <li> Get used to using short, quick, gentle strokes and this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cuts very accurate with less fuss like the others.  </li>
            <li> First off, if you read the guide book that comes with the trimmer, it clearly tells you to charge the trimmer for 4 hours, 3 days.  </li>
            <li> First off, if you read the guide book that comes with the trimmer, it clearly tells you to charge the trimmer for 4 hours, 3 days.  </li>
            <li> the first pass over my face, I&#x27;m surprised as how it leaves a trail of...well, perfectness.</li>
            <li> Actually does trim close enough to give a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, shaved stubble never looks quite as good as actually grown stubble - but it is as close as I have yet found.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like going through contacting the seller or Conair and paying to ship it back and hoping the next one works better.</li>
            <li> I also have difficulty trimming by my nose, as the design doesn&#x27;t allow the blades to get close enough to the bottom of my nose to do a full job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> As far as those who say they can&#x27;t hit the area between the nose and the upper-lip, that&#x27;s funny.   </li>
            <li> , I think this thing may have been designed to shave a woman&#x27;s beard because it can&#x27;t cut through real stubble even when it appears to be working normally.  </li>
            <li> Although it is cool, and electrically operated, the issue that I have with it makes me wish that it was just a regular comb.</li>
            <li> Only thing is the battery technology is not that great, takes a long time to charge and doesn&#x27;t hold charge long.</li>
            <li> the body is made with very nice hard plastic, however the very edge trimmer, especially the adjustable comb, is made with soft plastic which can easily break over extensive amount of usage.&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:</li>
            <li> You have to store the trimmer lying down which means it takes up more counter space than it would with a stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trimming under the nose is also difficult, but I was willing to live with that because while it worked, the trimmer did a great job.</li>
            <li> This trimmer offers a very reliable shave for those going for a certain look, or a range of looks.</li>
            <li> All in all this is a good choice but be careful how you set it, test it by going high first and take it down in increments.</li>
            <li> It looks as though they did a little re-design of the comb, which is good because I broke 2 using the prior model.  </li>
            <li> It also makes a big mess in your sink, although this is probably true for most beard/facial hair trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Luckily for me, my old trimmer still works, so I trim my mustache with my old trimmer, and the rest with the new one.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading many reviews; good and bad.  </li>
            <li> Then my better half wanted to manscape my chest hair.</li>
            <li> Much more discrete than previous trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Charging is easy and the LCD display gives a rough estimate of battery charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Norelco that could less and performed much better than this unit.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with minimal risk of &#x27;user error&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a previous trimmer, looking for a closer &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; result than I was able to get from the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK product, but it lasted less than 1 year.</li>
            <li> &quot; look that kinda looks like a five o&#x27;clock shadow and most trimmers do not work at properly capturing that specific look.  </li>
            <li> The shortest length of cut (.4mm) left a near smooth surface in its wake.  </li>
            <li> The shortest length of cut (.4mm) left a near smooth surface in its wake.  </li>
            <li> It performs very well and gets VERY close, even closer than my old conair trimmer without no guard.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was decent when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The depression subsides quickly as I continue trimming my stubble and realize 2 minutes later that I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Istubble because it seemed to have decent reviews</li>
            <li> The digital length setting is nothing short than magical.</li>
            <li> and this one did even more than I expected (by far)</li>
            <li> It simply cuts your facial hair better than the Phillips.</li>
            <li> a battery life indicator, which is such a basic feature but lacking on most trimmers</li>
            <li> The i-Stubble is able to cut my facial hair very short and give me the &amp;#34;one-day look&amp;#34; without any problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides the above complaint, this trimmer really is great still.</li>
            <li> I do know that he&#x27;s tried many different electric facial trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Different isn&#x27;t always necessarily better (especially in this case).</li>
            <li> If you want the close shave then pop top off (guard) and it folds back and clips on back of razor.</li>
            <li> My main problem was that after a month of using it, it just died.</li>
            <li> I tried several more times and got about 1/5 of a second run time and all out...</li>
            <li> Gift for son - didn&#x27;t use it much before he started having issues with it not cutting properly</li>
            <li> : It can be messy, and it is only fair in the mustache area.</li>
            <li> I have to do that especially when trying to trim above your top lip and below the lip.</li>
            <li> There is seriously no razor burn when I use this thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At 0.6mm the actual trimmer sits proud of the plastic attachment so not sure how it could be 0.6mm?!  </li>
            <li> so overall, its very consistent and it wont pull or cut you, even with the guide off.</li>
            <li> The battery life is good - you can use it for weeks without a recharge, and the digital display helps alot when determining how long you want your facial hair to be.  </li>
            <li> was cool enough to do the refund thing and send me a new one.</li>
            <li> If I was single and had my own apartment no big deal, but with a wife who wants clean bathrooms I am constantly being asked to clean up the mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trimmer trim the hair at the temples, making it even better than my tight beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, the main things other people gripe at are definitely true.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need a high end product.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended for beard, mustache and head trimming usage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, the adjustment method is near genius, the battery lasts a long time, it has a backlight, I don&#x27;t have to fool with a bag full of different size clip-on spacers...</li>
            <li> Used often and high quality...works well</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone looking for this type of shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to add.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews for this and made the purchase given the high rankings.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I end up with needing to go over the same areas many times and ending up with uneven lengths compared with my old, cheap trimmer.</li>
            <li> I still would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was a tad high</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is a high quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> and it started working again, have only had this a few months and only used about 1 time a week for basic trimming and it is now completely crapped out, I got a new one today that im very happy with and is very sleek and come charged straight out of the box</li>
            <li> liked the digital setting on the trimmer because with other clippers, the point at which we would hold it was where the settings were</li>
            <li> The head of the trimmer is so large it does not allow you to trim the hair directly under the nose.</li>
            <li> negatives about the Conair is that it is a little more flimsy than the Phillips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this little guy.</li>
            <li> Will spend a little more for a Philips now.</li>
            <li> Cons:  Slightly more difficult to use right under the nose, but not impossible.  </li>
            <li> It trims extremely well, the length settings (in mm) are intuitive so getting the look you want is relatively easy after just a bit of experimentation.  </li>
            <li> Be sure and start on the longest settings (3.0 or 3.5) and work your way down!</li>
            <li> Also the flip top to produce a straight line trimmer is hard to gauge when trying to cut a straight line for sideburns.</li>
            <li> Decent product when new.</li>
            <li> In this age of immediate gratification waiting nearly two days to try the device is too much.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m just shocked it is made by conair (Not the best reputation).</li>
            <li> Not a good ideal to wet electronics.</li>
            <li> My skin is rather sensitive to a straight razor, but I havent had to use one since getting the iStubble.  </li>
            <li> so far it has work very good,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really miss my old Panasonic trimmer (edit - just saw my review for the er-203 trimmer.</li>
            <li> read the reviews saying this isn&#x27;t what you want for a long beard, I &amp;#34;thought&amp;#34;... it would be ok because I only trimmed with a normal 2-3 size guide anyway.</li>
            <li> It was only alleviated when I pressed back the faceguard as far as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One explanation is that .4 mm is still not short enough for the ideal stubble if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> So, in a few words, if you have thick face hair or a lot of it your iStubble will work, but the stubble will not be that \\&quot;ideal\\&quot; light stubble that develops after a good shave</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery, The top flips over you can line up your edges, and it electronically changes the guard size.</li>
            <li> definitely think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> While reading the instructions it noted that you may experience pulling and that it is completely normal.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s adjustable and all, but I&#x27;ve owned it for just over a month and the battery is COMPLETELY dead.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Buy the trimmer, it&#x27;s worth it because of how low it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> would REBUY following the success I have had.</li>
            <li> Just happened to me, trimmed normally at 4.0 this morning</li>
            <li> Most of the time, the problem lies with the plastic guard that creates an uneven trim.</li>
            <li> In normal use, a weekly recharge is sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been someone who has had stubble long before it was a cool thing</li>
            <li> , I definitely think I get my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li> I dont normally write reviews</li>
            <li> - let&#x27;s hope I have better luck on round 2.</li>
            <li> I waited to write a review for a few reasons, I read some that were so strange to me, then I read some that sounded too good to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product EXCEPT it&#x27;s extremely difficult for me to get the hair under my nose.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t reaaly vouch too much for the various settings, but using ti with the guard off produces exactly the look I want.</li>
            <li> Still kind of annoyed at the first ones DOA.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after reading the poor and good reviews.</li>
            <li> , other sellers might sell the older version GMT900 (new one is pretty much same but mostly with some fixed quality issues).</li>
            <li> The other one was fine.</li>
            <li> You will have to package and ship the item yourself and pay for them $5.00 to ship out a new one (wtf lol?).</li>
            <li> He thought it was easy to adjust to different settings and try different styles.  </li>
            <li> The different length settings definitely work and I can easily tell a difference just adjusting it a couple clicks.  </li>
            <li> Had beard growth at about 3 days and the .4mm setting does the trick, subject to your own personal growth rate.   </li>
            <li> But overall very decent - it certainly does what &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; 1mm trimmers don&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Firstly, let me start out saying that I am a guy that has very sensitive skin - in general - and my intended purpose for this shaver is for my face.</li>
            <li> it charging right before you use to ensure it will last!</li>
            <li> So this is the right price for a next step up.</li>
            <li> facial hair grows right up to within about 1/8 of an inch of my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of trimmers to get just the right stubble look, and I&#x27;ve finally found one that works!  </li>
            <li> I guess I should consider myself lucky that it lasted as long as it did.</li>
            <li> I just had to charge it for a very long time at first just like most of the other electric devices.</li>
            <li> It does a good job with producing even hair length although it may be necessary to go over an area multiple times in different directions and not only against the growth as directed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although, the battery does seem to wear down easily.  </li>
            <li> My current trimmer takes out too much hair and the attachment was too large for it cut any hair at all.</li>
            <li> it looking cheap and patchy like with other beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> At first is quiet but gets loud in like the third use and after the first two times using it you have to use it connected all the time because the battery doesn&#x27;t last more than 5 min. and gets low power if not connected.</li>
            <li> used it once, and liked the length I had, but then wanted to go just a little shorter the next day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially if it&#x27;ll be your first beard trimmer (as it was for me).</li>
            <li> The power is very good, especially when plugged in to an outlet, needless to say it still gets the job done when it is used without the cord plugged.</li>
            <li> and i dont even live in usa</li>
            <li> It does take some maintenance to keep it working well, but its work it as it still works like its brand new.</li>
            <li> I can live with it.  </li>
            <li> a new owner</li>
            <li> on 10/7/13: I received my replacement and haven&#x27;t had any new issues since.</li>

            <li> So now I am stuck with an almost brand new trimmer that won&#x27;t work because I can&#x27;t replace a 20c plastic piece.</li>
            <li> In a week I had a brand new trimmer.</li>
            <li> I contacted Conair and they replaced it with a new unit immediately.</li>
            <li> The new one is like being touched by an angel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s brand new still.</li>
            <li> This is why I may need to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> They expect me to include money with the trimmer to they can use the money to pay to send me a new one if they choose</li>
            <li> The amount of time for them to choose to send me a new one is 6 weeks&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Their return policy is a joke: the customer pays shipping both ways and has to wait for weeks to receive a new one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear</li>
            <li> Had to return it for a new one...</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ll get a brand new one.</li>
            <li> I contacted con-air and they sent me a brand new one.</li>
            <li> As we all know, it is something we have to live with for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would give it 4 simply because its not easier to clean then my Cruzer which requires a simple rinse under running water and a little oil from time to time, but after trimming with it I love the way my stubble looks and feels so</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with the brush given and glides very smoothly no matter how big your beard gets</li>
            <li> So this one hurts, it&#x27;s very loud when compared to other trimmers, the blade has two parts and one comes off which takes me a while to fit in.</li>
            <li> I had seen a commercial for this and the whole iPhone, iPod, and now \\&quot;iStubble\\&quot; thing really sold me.  </li>
            <li> So if your unit seems DOA , don&#x27;t fret the blades are most likely initially jammed like mine.</li>
            <li> most reasonable complaint</li>
            <li> Really the price for this facial trimmer is quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> and it is big so good look getting at your philtrum (stache) without alot of wonky manipulation.  </li>
            <li> The components and action all seem high quality.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it a cool techie feature, but you actually get to know the exact length of your facial hair and at the same time this allows you to be more picky in terms of how long you exactly want your facial hair.</li>
            <li> Again, I am very surprised at how well this works and</li>
            <li> I think I figured out why I had that original issue - this little trimmer is VERY susceptible to moisture/water getting in to it.</li>
            <li> I think I figured out why I had that original issue - this little trimmer is VERY susceptible to moisture/water getting in to it.</li>
            <li> I found the trimmer to be similar to rough grading, i.e. after going over my face several times and then inspecting, I found many facial hairs still there at the original length.</li>
            <li> I had searched the net for countless of hours looking for a true stubble trimmer, before ending up buying this one in particular.</li>
            <li> They work great for a few months and then the adjustable trimmer breaks, the charger stops charging, and ultimately they whole trimmer shuts down.  </li>
            <li> Its neat, tight design fits easily in one&#x27;s hands.  </li>
            <li> It can get stuck or suddenly slip, and the result is that I can never be sure to get the right length, and now I have a few bare spots where it cut to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what its said to do - trip your hair at intervals of 0.2, starting at 0.4mm.</li>
            <li> First reason isn&#x27;t necessarily the razor&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m more inclined to do it every day, which means far less mess to clean up and no clogged drains.</li>
            <li> First one, the digital display just melted could not see the numbers.</li>
            <li> My first use I tried it with the guard clipped back.</li>
            <li> (Pretty damn short!)</li>
            <li> it trims your hair to fairly consistent lengths if you want very short hair on your goatee, and even shorter stubble elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and so far he likes it!  </li>
            <li> and it gets everything either the first or second time.</li>
            <li> did try a different brand stubble razor after I broke my first Conair iStubble</li>
            <li> the head has many small plastic pieces that can break.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> Well, I actually think it holds the trimmings a lot better than other trimmers I used.</li>
            <li> charge lasts a long time rarely needs a charge.</li>
            <li> I had read the instructions and followed them for the charging prior to the first use.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased that they stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> Initial &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; this morning was EXACTLY what I was hoping it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My old trimmer still works!</li>
            <li> GMT900R instruction manual will have GMT900 written on it, just check the back of the trimmer to know exact model.</li>
            <li> First, one of my pet peeves are product reviews written before a user has had a sufficient amount of time to actually learn all they should about a product before writing a review.  </li>
            <li> Oil is included to lubricate the blade, and it is recommended doing so before shaving for the first time, but upon inspection mine seemed sufficiently oiled so I didn&#x27;t oil mine before starting shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t allow the short &#x27;5 O&#x27;clock&#x27; shadow to be consistent.  </li>
            <li> (Although some kids have beards at 15 years old!).  </li>
            <li> The bummer is that if the first charge runs out in the middle of use, you canNOT use it while the charger is hooked up.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t exactly shopping around looking for &#x27;The Ultimate Shaver&#x27; or something like that.</li>
            <li> After the first super-charge, you just need 4 hours for the subsequent chargings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been a good trimmer, the only complaint I have is that there is no hair trap for the shaved hair.</li>
            <li> Other than a waste of money, it felt good to throw the thing away.</li>
            <li> Everything works fine, but when it comes time to trim the Chin or Go T area, the closeness of the razor Buzzes it to a near 0.5 Looking at the LCD Screen, it still says 3.0, but when you get close to the actual chin area, it definitely without a doubt buzzes it to a near 0 or 0.5</li>
            <li> Press the up or down buttons and the guide moves into the precise position.</li>
            <li> I have a collection of 4 other trimmers and none come close to how even and clean the trim looks with the I-Stubble.</li>
            <li> So, I get one of those $9.99 stick trimmers that you see on TV and in stores, and carefully clean up right under my nose, it&#x27;s not that hard to do.</li>
            <li> It took over a week to get in, and I live out in the country where the nearest FedEx and UPS drop boxes are an hour and a half away (costing me more in gas to return it than I&#x27;ll be getting back when I return it).  </li>
            <li> So it is a trade off, if you want a quick even trim with minimum strokes you have to have a wide trimming blade</li>
            <li> Regular clippers don&#x27;t trim precisely enough to keep that stubble in the \\&quot;sweet spot.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually fixed the second one from a part from the first and that gave me 6 months.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; guards for this thing as I seem to have collected/lost mismatching guards from other trimmers that I keep around for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> For instance, I use 1.0 mm on my face, but under my chin, I drop it to 0.6 mm because, obviously, you have a true shadow under your chin, and if it is cut the same length, it looks like you forgot to trim under your chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, if you want the shadow look or the perfec stubble, look no further, the Conair GMT900 is not just the tool you need, but it is well made, simple to use a true stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have had a number of trimmers over the years and this is the first one that gives you the ability to adjust the cut to the right length every single time since it is digital.  </li>
            <li> After I charge it, the battery indicator will go down to 1/3 power within one or two uses, but it still works well for weeks and many subsequent uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After oiling and working the blades a little with a toothpick the trimmer began to run just fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased the i-Stubble following a reasonable amount of research on the web for a trimming device that would allow for detailed trimming as my current clippers leave something to be desired for facial trimming, i.e. I would either be very closely trimmed or have a short beard.   </li>
            <li> I read up on multiple reviews about it that were mainly positive.</li>
            <li> Earlier this year, I started getting positive feedback about how I look with three-day-scruff.  </li>
            <li> I then decided to test further and at the 2mm setting it is pretty much the same effect as clippers with no attachment on.</li>
            <li> It would have been sweet if I was into other peoples hair trimmings.</li>
            <li> If you live and work where you can have a stubble appearance without consequence, then this is the trimmer for you and you will look just like your favorite movie stars who appear on the late night</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it is so easy to adjust the cutting height.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that you can&#x27;t shave super close to your face, that is the only limitation</li>
            <li> It worked good while it was working, but it broke down within a year of purchase with only minimal use.</li>
            <li> I knock my original review down from a 3-star to a 2-star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very powerful and hasn&#x27;t slowed down and actually seems like it trims much closer.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a trimmer that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the open design of the top, where there&#x27;s space between the unit and the shaving head, reduces the mess a bit.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take him long to have a nice clean trimmed beard (about 4 mins) which he said he hasn&#x27;t gotten from any other trimmer in the past.</li>
            <li> Any stubble trimmer will take a little bit of practice to get a perfectly even shave, you&#x27;ll notice that some areas of your face you&#x27;ll have to shave in a different direction, and some areas a little harder push than others.  </li>
            <li> oiling of blades and has a few nooks and crannies that are tricky to clean (I used compressed air which makes it easy, but not clean around my sink!)&lt;br /&gt;-Has</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get all worked up over a beard trimmer, but this one is ok.  </li>
            <li> it shaved ok while it worked, it also turned off every time you switch the mode, it&#x27;s not worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver, sharp enough to cut but not bite.</li>
            <li> The plastic top which glides over your skin is soft and won&#x27;t create rashes even if you press it hard against your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE PUSH BOTTON ADJUSTABLE COMB IS GREAT and precise!!!(except if you don&#x27;t push too hard against your face which can cause the soft comb trimmer plastic to bend, and that will lead to uneven trim).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with the clippers cutting ability.  </li>
            <li> Had to watch a video on how to use it because of the awkward design but was happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Great cutting experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received the product that would not charge and was clearly used.</li>
            <li> Directions on usage, cleaning, and maintenance are clear and explained well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave me with a handful of \\&quot;heads\\&quot; to toggle on the device, and it gives me clear options as to how close I&#x27;d like my shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I went back to my old trimmer, one I had for 8 years and that one cuts very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, when you flip back the head, you get a much shorter (uneven) finish, and the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; part is huge and bulky so you can&#x27;t really get too close to the upper lip, etc.</li>
            <li> It cuts much closer than I expected and very evenly too.</li>
            <li> Clearly a faulty battery that needed to be returned.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is set to the same 1.6mm as my old one, it gives a MUCH closer shave.</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and will need to find a case to protect it in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> It darn near cuts as close as a razor.</li>
            <li> The iStubble makes it a breeze to keep my head close (nearly) every day.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer actually works, and it works really well.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, these aren&#x27;t lengths, just a number.  </li>
            <li> I always had to plan my stubble if I wanted it to be present when I went out, so having stubble was really like a 3 or 4 day process.</li>
            <li> It works, like clockwork so far.</li>
            <li> It really molds to your face and reduces irritation even further.  </li>
            <li> Some people have also said that the advertisement video is misleading and that it doesn&#x27;t really trim as short as in the advertisement video,</li>
            <li> and it shaves my head to the bone and that was an unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li> Second, it really should keep the length setting.  </li>
            <li> I decided to stick with my old trimmer for this area.</li>
            <li> I decided to stick with my old trimmer for this area.</li>
            <li> While it does include an ad-on razor, I only used the trimmer part on my face to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how well this product works.  </li>
            <li> I use (even those for sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> but so far no luck.</li>
            <li> have a sensitive skin and fear to shave with both Gillette Mach3 and electric Shavers for cuts and acne problems.</li>
            <li> This item was a Christmas gift for my son-in-law, as far as I know he likes it.  </li>
            <li> I now look forward to grooming when before it was real drudgery, and I avoided it until it was completely necessary.  </li>
            <li> Finally got around to unscrewing everything to replace battery, but it was very glued in, including the connectors which ripped when I pulled out.</li>
            <li> really like this shaver, and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> result is that you have to go over the same spot over and over again so it takes ages to trim your whole</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m actually surprised that I went out and bought another.</li>
            <li> YOU CHARGE THE BATTERY COMPLETELY, THEN USE IT TILL IT DIES, THEN CHARGE IT AGAIN, DO NOT LEAVE IT ON THE CHARGER</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, but using it every day has not bothered my skin at all.</li>
            <li> As far as I know</li>
            <li> I was surprised</li>
            <li> I can not as soft beard, but it is growing at a millimeter a day and every two days this razor saves me from irritation of the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cut some, but that doesn&#x27;t matter if it snags a dozen hair every time and feels like they&#x27;re being ripped out at the root (unexpectedly).  </li>
            <li> By far, the end all-be all for trimming stubble.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that&#x27;d replace my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> it is, though it&#x27;s definitely far from blowing its competition out of the water.</li>
            <li> Old one lasted about 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I just wish the trimmer had higher setting for long beards.</li>
            <li> The clippers made a loud noise and were seized up.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s a couple years old</li>
            <li> 10 year old trimmer was dying, so I tried this and the [[ASIN:B003U8ESI4</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked a trimmer or a trim better.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really the only downside though.  </li>
            <li> The idea of a trim taking about a maximum of only 1-2 minutes in a shared dormitory really appealed to me.</li>
            <li> So far no nicks or jams.    </li>
            <li> My old one died and I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement anywhere</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I haven&#x27;t used a razor in years.</li>
            <li> i \\&quot;Old</li>
            <li> Stop attempting to use it straight up only.   </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use this as a beard or facial hair trimmer b/c I can&#x27;t grow a bear.</li>
            <li> , so you can adjust how much stubble is left.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be a replacement for the identical one I purchased nearly 5 yrs ago.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is a stubble trimmer and it is not meant for long beards.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints so far about this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works really well for shaping my beard, and experimenting with different lengths.</li>
            <li> You should know, the comb part isn&#x27;t really meant to fold like that on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> His stubble is 0.2 to 0.3 mm ... to get that close, you need to flip back the comb head, and trim with just the metal blades against the skin - much like using [[ASIN:B000JNQSIQ Wahl Hair Clippers]]</li>
            <li> I still have to use my old trimmer for my mustache and sideburns.</li>
            <li> so far no issues.  </li>
            <li> The stubble trimmer lets me cut my hair much shorter than a regular hair trimmer, and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the product gets the job done, but leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> I could not do this with my old razor.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I always keep the day old stubble</li>
            <li> I set it at 1.8 for what I wanted, 1.6 was really too low</li>
            <li> (i.e. why would I want something that doesn&#x27;t completely shave?)but</li>
            <li> so I often use my old plug-in trimmer for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesnt even work while plugged into the wall directly</li>
            <li> I have zero complaints so far and am recommending it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> For a complete shave I use this for 90 percent and then a precision</li>
            <li> Not as versatile as my old Norelco</li>
            <li> Far from stubble look, it did not even cut my beard with 1.0mm setting, so I returned it and bought Con air I-stubble.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, this wasn&#x27;t from a third-party vendor, but from Amazon directly.</li>
            <li> The only one that they should really fix.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Naturally I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> WOW ..</li>
            <li> Has control, power, ease of use, flexibility for the short beard/stubble beard guyay to really improve on it.</li>
            <li> WOW ..</li>
            <li> I wanted a shaver that holds its charge and indicated how much charge it had left.  </li>
            <li> I expected with a week&#x27;s worth of beard</li>
            <li> It would have been vastly more functional with a few extra combs, so I&#x27;m docking a star for that.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s fun to watch the motorized guide move back and forth, I wish the iStubble could just remain at the last</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s fun to watch the motorized guide move back and forth, I wish the iStubble could just remain at the last setting.    </li>
            <li> There were many uneven spots left after trimming.  </li>
            <li> If you hate shaving as much as I do but want to keep your facial hair close, this is probably your best option.</li>
            <li> Nice concept, poorly executed</li>
            <li> He has very fine hair and in the past, some of the trimmers would just glide over the hair and not give a close enough cut until it grew out too far</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it does not give an extremely close shave, which is fine for me.</li>
            <li> Only draw back is right under the nares, for that I freehand,  </li>
            <li> After trying several different trimmers, this item does manage to provide the right closeness I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Sure you can take out the attachment comb but that empty blade is not thin or sharp enough.</li>
            <li> I also used it to clean up around his ears and it worked well in that tight area.  </li>
            <li> This razor not only gives a very smooth shave, but you can adjust lengths with a small push of a button (and see what setting you are on via its digital display, which is very convenient).</li>
            <li> The Istubble is also small, lightweight, and cordless which makes is really easy to use.    </li>
            <li> Some other things I really like about it is that you really don&#x27;t need a rechargeable stand.</li>
            <li> When cutting under the nose you have to turn the shaver side ways, but other than that excellent product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that gave me enough control to either trim a beard, make some short stubble, or just some clean up work with the facial hair and</li>
            <li> In addition, the battery life is fantastic as I only have to to charge it once every couple of weeks (I shave with the i-Stubble every other day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use; small learning curve to get the feel of letting the trimmer glide across the face.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several other cheap battery operated beard trimmers.  </li>
            <li> His favorite part is that the trimmer has a wide range of lengths and that the gaps between the different lengths are very small, so he can get exactly the length he wants.</li>
            <li> This may not sound very short, but its about the equivalent of the SHORTEST length available on my normal clippers/trimmers while the guard is still on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an iStubble trimmer for a couple years (bought at KMart) and it is far and away better than any other other beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, including Norelco and Wahl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have long facial hair (it&#x27;s more bum fluff)</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would add a whole new dimension to lengths I could go to while trimming up and shaping my facial hair, while at the same time replacing my old trimmers/clippers.  </li>
            <li> I went to the dry cleaners yesterday with the sole intention of dropping off my suits, exchanging witty banter with the Japanese lady who cleans them followed by a trip to the local Wal-Marts for a Panasonic trimmer.  </li>
            <li> London Drugs is actually $95 CAN which I would consider far too high.</li>
            <li> I loved the adjust on the fly feature for different beard lengths, hated having all the attachemnts floating around in the drawer from my previous trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably as even of a &amp;#34;stubble shave&amp;#34; as possible, and true it is hard to get to the area right below the nostrils.</li>
            <li> A bit of trial an error followed on some body areas not typically visible to others, and I had it worked out.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer worked fine while it lasted, which was only about a year and half after being used once a week.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Beard &amp;amp; Head trimmer Series 5100 has sharper blades and cuts a little closer if you want a true 0.4 MM</li>
            <li> The fact is, All-in One groomers like the Norelco G370 won&#x27;t give a decent stubble look because it isn&#x27;t for that purpose, plus you can&#x27;t really get 0.2mm or 0.3mm that other people are claiming.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for a face shaver.</li>
            <li> The only thing to be careful of is that every time you turn the trimmer on, it goes back to the shortest setting, so make sure to adjust or else you&#x27;ll have a very short stubble!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The highest setting is a 5 which may not be high enough for someone with a longer beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few different types of shaver that claim to offer a genuine stubble grooming solution and this is the only one that works REALLY well.</li>
            <li> The only negative is there is no way to catch the hair which just means a little more clean up</li>
            <li> One small thing can make huge difference.</li>
            <li> Combined with the fact that it takes a long time to get your whole face done this results in the battery</li>
            <li> I would usually hit this area lightly with a razor and problem solved.</li>
            <li> those really are minor points...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t normally grow my facial hair grow out.</li>
            <li> Not exactly an even cut (but better than your average beard trimmer).</li>
            <li> With a tilted angle you will be able to do so, but the hairs very close to your nostrils will be left behind.</li>
            <li> Went from a full charge to dead and hasn&#x27;t worked since.</li>
            <li> course if it had a less slippery grip, I wouldn&#x27;t have dropped the first one and had to replace it with this one!</li>
            <li> Not impossible for me, but it takes a little contorting of the face.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it--I won&#x27;t use any other trimmer!</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s surprisingly hard to find a trimmer that can cut evenly, quickly, and comfortably at lengths down to .4mm.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s surprisingly hard to find a trimmer that can cut evenly, quickly, and comfortably at lengths down to .4mm.</li>
            <li> If youdecide to buy this trimmer or any other one...Be SMART!</li>
            <li> This Trimmer works very well and holds a charge for a long time!</li>
            <li> and I have to decide if I buy a new one or move to a different brand.</li>
            <li> I am new to facial hair and had never used a trimmer before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The claim to fame for the iStubble is the lack of multiple attachments for trimming hair to different lengths, thanks to its motorized head which adjusts to the length you want at the touch of a button.  </li>
            <li> I got this to maintain a really low look because I don&#x27;t like facial hair much, so this did what I want.  </li>
            <li> Even though it was on the more expensive side of a lot of the electric trimmers I looked at, I think you really get what you pay for with the iStubble.  </li>
            <li> Being able to adjust the length of the trimmer, and having the comb guard, helps me get close to my skin with the least irritation possible.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure, because there were a lot of mixed and negative reviews, but took the chance</li>
            <li> Following this research, the i-Stubble appeared to be the obvious solution at a reasonable price to boot.</li>
            <li> If I have it set to 1.5mm, trim, and return the next day to trim again, it defaults back to .4mm, causing me to shave much shorter than I intended.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts through multiple shaves, the LCD screen is very helpful, and trimming facial hair is now a breeze!</li>
            <li> This is by far the most frustrating trimmer I have every used.</li>
            <li> TRYM II - The Rechargeable Modern Hair Clipper Kit - Ultra-sleek Hair, Body, Mustache, and Beard Trimmer Looks Great in Any Bathroom - AC Adapter, Base Dock, and Trimming Attachments</li>
            <li> gave it a quick, few hour, charge.</li>
            <li> The razor is very powerful and the flexible head had no trouble taking 5 days of beard down to .5mm in a single pass.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> There seems to be less hair trapped in the shaver, and the flip-up head makes cleaning very easy.</li>
            <li> I like trimming by facial hair rather than shaving it, because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> but it is limited to how much it can trim.</li>
            <li> A couple of things I might want changed but nothing major.</li>
            <li> and this thing holds a charge like no other trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> no real big deal..you will see what I mean when you purchase one :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it does a job that no other razor has done for me.  </li>
            <li> just isn&#x27;t right for this trimmer, but it hurts like crazy and snags way too many hairs.  </li>
            <li> The unit seems to arbitrarily reset back to .4mm if it sits for 5-10 minutes (not on the charger - on the charger it resets right away after a cut).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they didn&#x27;t include an option for 0mm to completely get rid of my facial hair, but that&#x27;s okay because the razor wasn&#x27;t designed to do that.</li>
            <li> The hardest part was deciding on the right setting, seeing as how my previous trimmer just had the numbers 1-5.</li>
            <li> This is MUCH better than the typical plastic clips that you get with other trimmers and that sometimes change while you&#x27;re shaving!  </li>
            <li> Very even shave and does not irritate sensitive skin (other units have caused redness).  </li>
            <li> (at least for me this is the case, it works fine).</li>
            <li> I have been using an older Conair product for a long time and decided it was time for a change.  </li>
            <li> And while most reviews were positive, there were quite a few negative as well.  </li>
            <li> The top white piece will start making a wicked ridiculous noise....</li>
            <li> /&gt;1.) The trimmer head is a bit big and kind of painful to use around your mustache/under nose area (as many other reviewers have noted).</li>
            <li> /&gt;1.) The trimmer head is a bit big and kind of painful to use around your mustache/under nose area (as many other reviewers have noted).</li>
            <li> Many other trimmers don&#x27;t go down as low as the 0.4 setting.  </li>
            <li> I had used an identical trimmer for my beard for 5 years until the battery died and the clipper became too dull to comfortably cut hair.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use it everyday the battery doesn&#x27;t really die that quick as I read in some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> I purchased the iStubble due to all the positive reviews and have not been dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Generally a charge lasts me about 4 weeks</li>
            <li> In general, this trimmer gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Therefore, I generally stick to .4mm-1mm settings.&lt;br /&gt;-Requires</li>
            <li> does not fling hair everywhere in the bathroom like others report, but generally collects in the trimmer and comes out with a shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful with my items and everything else about this item is in great shape, but the plastic guard is very thin and after enough normal use it finally gave in and broke.</li>
            <li> I really like how simple it is to adjust the razor and also how long the charge holds for.</li>
            <li> Even though we followed the directions, the battery was nearly wiped out after only 15 minutes of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t deliver as well as my old trimmer with the traditional attachments.</li>
            <li> Apparently this issue was reported in 2013...</li>
            <li> owned one of these left it on my bathroom counter near my sink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it, but so far I&#x27;ve had mixed</li>
            <li> No regrets.  </li>
            <li> Another (hidden) feature that I really like is the quick charge feature, which allows you to charge for only a few minutes on those days where you need a quick shave with a low or empty battery.     </li>
            <li> So quiet that the first time I turned it on, I thought I hadn&#x27;t charged it long enough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d to keep going back to my old trimmer to finish the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s fool proof, barely requires any set up or instructions to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this one for my stubble now, instead of an old Wahl that has the plastic trimmed low to achieve stubble.  </li>
            <li> and it would barely cut and just pulled out my hair.</li>
            <li> My old beard trimmer dies on my a short while ago.</li>
            <li> So far that&#x27;s my only gripe.  </li>
            <li> I did see that several people had this same complaint, but many others did not.</li>
            <li> I am going back to the old one.</li>
            <li> For those of you old enough to remember it gives allows you to trim your beard to the \\&quot;Miami Vice\\&quot; style.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After doing much research through the years, using one after another, trying a few different stubble beard trimmers (not all recommended, though several),  I couldn&#x27;t get it to be exactly what I longed for daily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :-O-:</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I talked through the guy that cuts my hair, and we figured out the different settings of the istubble are equivalent to a professional trimmer (e.g., Wahl) with something like 12 removable guards.</li>
            <li> I would buy again and would upgrade if they fixed the above 2 problems.</li>
            <li> You really have to be careful when you&#x27;re trimming, too, because you will get scraped.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is how sensitive it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd one of these now as they break frequently...</li>
            <li> I still have my old shaver for about 4 yrs now, however the battery can only do one shave on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;thats understandable, after</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on the lowest setting of my old trimmer, which that manufacturer reports as 1.6mm, I initially set the Conair to 1mm.</li>
            <li> The resulting trim was MUCH shorter than I expected, almost a shave.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a bare blade against my face.  </li>
            <li> , I would have bought it a long time ago for the normal price.  </li>
            <li> I arbitrarily decided to go for 1.4mm (although in retrospect I should have started at a higher number and just gone with multiple passes, lowering as I went</li>
            <li> However, the latest one I bought was made rather poorly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It usually takes me around 6 days to have an absolutely full 37th hour beard, so I like to keep it around a number 3 or 2.5.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but not great, and then after just two months it broke.</li>
            <li> After the initial charge, the unit will take from 2 to 4 hours for a full charge from a completely dead battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was also getting tired of my electric razor and have been skipping more days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times a week for several weeks and the battery is at 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> (Sounds like a little but this trimmer makes quick work of facial hair)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several less expensive razors and they either didn&#x27;t cut very smoothly or were just a pain to use (coming, as they did, with their several plastic attachments that take up space and aren&#x27;t that easy to change).</li>
            <li> My advice would be to start much higher than you think, and work down.</li>
            <li> The other negative is that the power button on the unit is very easy to press.</li>
            <li> Trims right down to the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow!</li>
            <li> that despite what the instructions say it doesn&#x27;t work very well plugged into an electrical outlet when the battery is dead, meaning that once the battery has reached the end of life I&#x27;ll have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> It has the attachment comb on the trimmer which also has adjustable lengths for up &amp; down right above the power button.  </li>
            <li> You will also get different results if you try and trim while hanging upside down from your bed rather than standing right side up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 y.o. black male and as you know, most black guys have curly hair</li>
            <li> Yes, pretty odd request which is why this still gets 5/5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Thus is my second one, first one had battery charge issues out of the box, I&#x27;ve tried all sort of other units</li>
            <li> I started at 3mm and actually took off most of my &#x27;short beard&#x27; which I thought was no more than 3mm long, the result being a lot shorter than 3mm.</li>
            <li> Little difficult on the head, but works great for the face and the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow</li>
            <li> Unlike some other comments here, I find .4mm very short--shorter than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> The floating head is really helpful for those tricky parts under the neck, my other trimmers could never reach those parts evenly.</li>
            <li> Other than that, works very well.</li>
            <li> Too much of hassle with charging it and charge does not last long enough.</li>
            <li> Because of this I usually do not end up shaving since the hair is already too long by the time I get around to it.</li>
            <li> One thing to be careful of, is that when you first turn it on, it doesn&#x27;t save your settings from last time, so you could potentially shave off your mustache by accident.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have found this a long time ago because I used to hate shaving and then waiting for my hair to grow back to look perfect and then having to shave it all off again.</li>
            <li> and he really likes how it works it shaves his face down far enough where he never has to shave with a razor and get ingrown hairs anymore or bumps.</li>
            <li> Not a single pulled hair, no straining of the</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t live in USA, so it would be more expensive to send the item back to Amazon</li>
            <li> negative reviews were complaints about the guide comb not being secure enough or not getting problematic areas[such as under the lip, soul patch, etc].  </li>
            <li> I was very unsatisfied with the product and it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Currently, we have an old standard clipper/trimmer from Wahl and a Remington cordless clipper/trimmer.  </li>
            <li> They typically last me a couple of years and get the job done, but I usually spent way too much time trying to get the \\&quot;look\\</li>
            <li> However, I expected it to last much longer than it did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because the guide folds back completely, you can use the naked blades to shape your beard or sideburns, trim your neck hairs between haircuts, and even clip stray body hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li> For the price, I did get value from it, although I expected it to last for much longer.</li>
            <li> For sensitive skins with potential risk of stubs leading to shaving bumps, I will only recommend this trimmer if you are using it to maintain a beard (preferably a five o&#x27;clock shadow).&lt;br /&gt;Fact 2:</li>
            <li> I only wish that they had some type of smaller adapter to allow for easier trimming directly under your nose.</li>
            <li> , the only downside (so far) is that you can&#x27;t properly trim your mustache.</li>
            <li> To my surprised, they weren&#x27;t much more expensive and after reading a ton of reviews, I settled on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still like it to cut a little closer, though this is one of the (or maybe *the*) closest of the consumer-grade trimmers.</li>
            <li> major caveat I have is that the head unit is relatively fragile -</li>
            <li> the various length settings may as well all be the same - there isn&#x27;t much variance, and the minor point changes are in no way noticeable at all - between 0.4 and like 3.0, probably noticeable - but anything smaller increments than that, may as well be the same&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades and motor are powerful enough to cut your bead and even shave your head, but the digital adjuster was broken when I first removed the iStubble from the box.  </li>
            <li> This has a solid motor that cuts beard hair smoothly with no bogging down like some other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very skilled, and even I get a consistent trim every time.  </li>
            <li> I can get close enough without looking sloppy, and I don&#x27;t irritate my skin, so my skin looks healthy and stays ingrown hair-free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It comfortably has enough battery life to last at least 2 sessions of trimming.  </li>
            <li> This is so the battery is primed and will potentially have a longer life in general.</li>
            <li> ; I generally use it 1-2x/week and go several weeks between charges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it works as much as any other trimmer with the exception of the digital settings for the length, and the rotating head is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li> /&gt;This does make a pretty big mess.  </li>
            <li> other minor thing is that you have to charge the device for 16 hours before you use it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I use the bare clipper (fold back guard) on face and neck for that &amp;#34;Perfect Stubble&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I like stubble, but not long stubble...</li>
            <li> You will need to pull the comb back and use the bare metal blade to trim around the lips and under the nose.</li>
            <li> and it runs at full steam - if it&#x27;s not plugged in for at least a day before I use it</li>
            <li> bought my first one a few years ago 2011?).</li>
            <li> The battery runs down as fast as it can -- as if I was using it continuously, even though the power is off</li>
            <li> Also does a decent job shaving other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son who was recently in the market for a facial trimmer, but didn&#x27;t know which one to buy and well, to say the least, I really wasn&#x27;t much help.  </li>
            <li> It is not easy to use for detailed trimming, due to the design of the head of the device.  </li>
            <li> If you prefer a slightly less intense shave, I would look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anything less really doesnt look like you have stubble</li>
            <li> The battery holds a charge for a long time and has never died on me mid trim (my old trimmer didn&#x27;t have a battery indicator and would leave me hanging all the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was quite loud and my facial hair wasn&#x27;t long at all</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well until it started draining battery after 1 shave.&lt;br /&gt;Right now, I use it once and by the time i need a 2nd shave in a few days, the battery is drained by then.</li>
            <li> but personally I would of spent my money on another normal trimmer with the clip on adjustments.</li>
            <li> And while it pivots open for cleaning, I found a large amount of hair got under the blades, too, which is difficult to clean out (especially since it didn&#x27;t come with a cleaning brush).  </li>
            <li> : Can really trim down to short lengths.</li>
            <li> The only thing that kinda annoys me is that it holds so much hair, so every time he sets it down hair falls out of it</li>
            <li> It was fine, but it wasn&#x27;t as close as the Bald Fader, and it seemed to be a bit tough to do on my head.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t really make a mess at all like some others here</li>
            <li> As a black male with ingrown hair issues, these trimmer really help.</li>
            <li> Luckily, that&#x27;s all I use it for as the battery usually dies before I&#x27;m done with one arm!</li>
            <li> The other trimmers I used left different lengths depending on the angle  the trimmer was held and the location of the hair on the chin or face whether it be on a flat, convex or concave surface.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t miss hairs, it doesn&#x27;t have a hard time cutting (I have thick hair), the battery lasts (I&#x27;m still on my first charge weeks later), and the best thing for me is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all.</li>
            <li> I decided to get the trimmer with the built in vacuum, because using this every other day left a constant mess of stubble around the sink, and I could never quite clean it all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really find this trimmer makes a big mess</li>
            <li> I hate shaving for many reasons, but the iStubble makes it a quick simple task.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a little bottle of oil which I applied to the blades as directed, but to really get that wake-up call in the morning</li>
            <li> The device has a much safer trimmer guard which allows you to glide the device across your skin with little risk of nicking yourself.</li>
            <li> That is some over-the-top language, but it feels fine in your hand (I don&#x27;t know about complete</li>
            <li> The head did need a little bit more pressure than I expected to get it to pivot around curves, but not a bald patch or uneven length was to be had.  </li>
            <li> Bought on 12/20/2011, used very little until weather started getting to hot for longer stubble</li>
            <li> disappointed with product specially considering that I order it from Amazon US and got it delivered in Singapore, so huge wastage of money.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that complained about it not being strong enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this if you don&#x27;t care about the price, and want that stubble look badly, and have a back-up good trimmer/razor to do the clean-up job.</li>
            <li> this product is FANTASTIC at leaving random patches of longer hair without warning - you have to go over multiple times, and then frequently revisit it later in the day when realizing you still missed something - they should advertise it as &amp;</li>
            <li> Additionally, not sure the sizes are entirely accurate, and I wish it could go down to .2mm.</li>
            <li> Initially I bought a Norelco vacuum stubble and beard trimmer for only one reason: stubble beard.</li>
            <li> For just about the same price you can buy another trimmer with a built in vacuum to collect all the hair...</li>
            <li> /&gt;After less then 2 months of normal use the trimmer died while I was traveling.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are correct that the design of the tip does not allow the blades to reach the upper part of the mustache, near the nose.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro]].</li>
            <li> I tried both the Philips Norelco Vacuum stubble trimmer and the Conair iStubble</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer because it can shave stubble shorter than my norelco vacuum trimmer.</li>
            <li> but:   It does not catch your hair so you need a vacuum nearby    </li>
            <li> The &amp;quot;super&amp;quot; model has a neat new display that counts down the remaining battery time in minutes.  </li>
            <li> This device is digitally set to a length and as long as you apply a constant low pressure, the length is constant.  </li>
            <li> After owning quite a few facial trimmers, I was eager to purchase this particular one.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t seem to get the area directly under your nose due to the size of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> He likes very short stubble, and this one seems to be a big on the long side for stubble, definitely not as close as the wahl used to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Only issue I have is that it is pretty hard to maneuver in the mustache area.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the item is fantastic, and the price is literally less than half of what you can buy it for in AUS..</li>
            <li> Right out of the box there was a dark blotch on the lighted display and the battery will not hold a charge long enough for one trim (less than 3 minutes).</li>
            <li> My second i-Stubble does not cut properly and makes a strange noise.</li>
            <li> Definitely feels like it wouldn&#x27;t last long in that environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only variable, to me, is how long will the battery last..</li>
            <li> only variable, to me, is how long will the battery last..</li>
            <li> By the time I was done I had blood dripping down my neck, and I had to finish with my regular old Wahl hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> First, its hard to trim under the nose.  </li>
            <li> Trimming under nose pretty hard for this trimmer, almost need another for mustach</li>
            <li> Also the guard has to be moved to a higher setting to get some of the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the comb (the part between the cutters and the skin, that determines the length of the cut) rests on really tiny plastic hinges, that brake easily.</li>
            <li> At least it is easy to set the length with a few presses of the button.</li>
            <li> The blades were oiled properly, the trimmer was charged sufficiently, I tried different lengths and it made me swear every single time I used it from the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could keep my facial hair at a same length &amp;#34;every single day of the week!&amp;#34; as it advertised.</li>
            <li> single blade is long enough for necks and cheeks yet maneuverable enough to get to \\&quot;thinner\\&quot; areas such as sideburns and moustaches.</li>
            <li> Worked great (for about a month) then terrible grating sound and never would trim unless I held the guard down half way with a finger.</li>
            <li> Here is one more bad thing I did not mention before: it cannot reach/cut the mustache hair near the nose!</li>
            <li> (or other areas a bit shorter in general, not necessarily JUST what I grow)</li>
            <li> At least, a real \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; trimmer!</li>
            <li> No more skin irritation, no irritating hair pulling.</li>
            <li> This is my first negative review for any product.</li>
            <li> Long story short, get this razor.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to guess at the correct angle in which to hold the iStubble: just press the guide flat against your</li>
            <li> It seems counterintuitive given the relative simplicity of the iStubble&#x27;s design: one long blade attachment with an automatic length adjuster.</li>
            <li> As a dude who never completely shaves his face, I&#x27;m constantly balancing a variety of trimmers, edgers, etc.</li>
            <li> It would not hold a charge long enough to use.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s been some complaints about it taking a long time for adjusting to whatever measurement is necessary to shave</li>
            <li> Flat out.  </li>
            <li> Battery last for a long time (days).</li>
            <li> This razor worked well for about 2 months, then the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough for a shave.  </li>
            <li> The question is, how long will it last...</li>
            <li> When I retired I stopped the daily shaving but when the hair started to get long</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got to live a little, you know?</li>
            <li> It can bring your facial hair down to the very bare minimum but not &amp;#34;baby bottom&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> not for tight places -- right under your nose gets tricky and I pull out another trimmer for those few hairs</li>
            <li> of the things he was looking for in a trimmer was that it would go down low enough to keep his goatee short enough.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is very long, and the length changes are simple and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery doesnt last very long even after charging overnight.</li>
            <li> I note that it was used on dry facial hair, as per the instructions.   </li>
            <li> My routine would usually be to completely shave, let my facial hair grow up, and use my trimmer to touch up every few days.</li>
            <li> It definitely has it&#x27;s short coming, though it&#x27;s definitely expected with</li>
            <li> I had the old model (which I finally broke after a few years of use).</li>
            <li> so there is absolutely no way of knowing when it actually needs to be charged until it dies mid trim.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go long enough for long beards.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> And the other complaint is doesnt get right under the nose, so have to just pull back the guard and trim it up with the razor.</li>
            <li> Good razors/trimmers, I&#x27;ve used in the past have lasted at least a couple of years, based on plenty of hard use I give them.  </li>
            <li> But you will not get a long life out of these POS&#x27;s, I bought mine back in early Jan. and it is already totally dead and does not work at all.</li>
            <li> It looked like an internal component worked itself loose.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s rather hard to follow the contours of a face since the extension is rather large and cumbersome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was surprised at this early failure.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made, doesnt last very long, unable to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s seriously quite stellar at spewing those trimmed whiskers into the furthest reaches of your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this little gem for almost a year now, and so far, haven&#x27;t had any issues.  </li>
            <li> of course I lost all those little spacer guides and only had the one short one that was actually to short for my moustache.</li>
            <li> that said, there are some strong points as well as a few weak points to consider before buying this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I used the product for about two weeks and it failed to adjust trim length accurately.</li>
            <li> At least, a real \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; trimmer!d].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> brilliant idea, but terrible execution here.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that something that is made to be used in a bathroom is not better protected to last longer in that environment.</li>
            <li> I only noticed this when I plugged it in and noticed it wasn&#x27;t charging so looked a bit harder at the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li> Does not take long charge up.</li>
            <li> Conair didn&#x27;t design enough rubber grip onto the handle section, which makes it prone to slipping out of hand during the trim process.  </li>

            <li> I would not suggest you immediately start trimming your eyebrows, unless you know just how you long</li>
            <li> how long you want  your stubble to be.  </li>
            <li> Be careful if you leave it off after setting a length you will have to change it back to the desired length as it resets.</li>
            <li> The charge only took about 4 hours v. the  roughly 16 hours mentioned on the directions.     </li>
            <li> Just bend that puppy back into it&#x27;s \\&quot;relaxed position\\&quot;, and you can carefully trim in those confined spaces.</li>
            <li> EVER SINCE that one time, no matter how long I charge it or leave it out for, if pull it off the charging cord it dies within seconds.</li>
            <li> I have been using this device for a year following instructions carefully and by the book.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s in a toiletry bag with a wet toothbrush, it may not work the next time you use it.</li>
            <li> you want a short length and can&#x27;t find anything else, go with this - but do not get ANYTHING wet besides the blade.  </li>
            <li> To solve this, simply flip the guard off and just do a careful trim using the blade.  </li>
            <li> Long battery life.</li>
            <li> I used it for too long to even bother trying to return it or get a replacement.</li>
            <li> The trimmer doesn&#x27;t remember your length setting between uses, but that&#x27;s a minor inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> Minor detail but one that I wouldn&#x27;t mind being added.  </li>
            <li> The charge still holds for an extremely long time before I have to recharge.</li>
            <li> Time will tell on it&#x27;s long term durability.  </li>
            <li> Minor annoyance</li>
            <li> Product I received had already been used and not even cleaned; there were grey hairs all over the blade and comb.</li>
            <li> They can choice how long they want to leave the hair.</li>
            <li> Not versatile enough for me.ompartment to empty.</li>
            <li> The comb teeth are too long</li>
            <li> Its not a &#x27;complete&#x27; shaver system.&lt;br</li>
            <li> minor gripe would be that yes it doesn&#x27;t collect your hair as you shave....</li>
            <li> Too long</li>
            <li> This item provided my brother with the close, attention detail shave he was craving while maintaining a long battery life and comfort.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time so no need to recharge too often.</li>
            <li> Batter lasts surprisingly long.</li>
            <li> So far the battery life has not been an issue and goes a couple weeks without recharging with everyday use from me.</li>
            <li> If you finish up the edges of your beard with a few swipes of your disposable razor, it will naturally grow in in two days and your stubble look will be on point.</li>
            <li> Every week or so, I have to pull the guard back and carefully trim up that area.  </li>
            <li> but that is a minor complaint.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery lasts as long as I need.</li>
            <li> It keeps the beard from getting too long and is adjustable to 5mm.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit long because of the guard, but its somewhat manageable.  </li>
            <li> i have a few spots on my faces where its uneven not the same length because i dug too much into my skin</li>
            <li> You have a long beard, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> You have a long beard, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Sensitive areas\\&quot; were well cut and no rash or bumps were left behind, even then the guide was removed and the head contacted skin directly.  </li>
            <li> You do have to open it up and get the hair it has collected out if you have a long beard, I can empty it at the end of a trim.</li>
            <li> So the fact that this one comes with such high marks from him must mean something.</li>
            <li> when I bought it I had grew out my beard for only a day that the 0.4mm actually trimmed anything down but it did.</li>
            <li> and I guess it needs battery power as soon as I pushed the power button same thing, less than a second run time then lights out.</li>
            <li> only issue, which I expected was the battery was  pretty weak after about 6 months, and I couldn&#x27;t finish trimming before the battery needed to be charged.</li>
            <li> I frequently stop and empty the hair which minimizes the mess.</li>
            <li> With the trimmer out of commission, my face has stopped violently shaking for the first time since I originally laid the fiery hand of Satan that is the iStubble against my cheek.</li>
            <li> The comb can also be flipped back for edge shaping and cutting hair under 0.4mm but it will not remove all the hair to leave smooth, bald skin so this function is not completely</li>
            <li> I was a little worried because my facial hair grows in different directions, but it cut them.</li>
            <li> However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the maximum length of the iStubble is 5 mm which is just too short for my beard.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;2- cant reach the mustache due to the big comb.&lt;br /&gt;3- work cordless</li>
            <li> In performance it is head and shoulders above any other trimmer I have ever seen or used.  </li>
            <li> The two literally sat next to each other but the Conair just didn&#x27;t survive.</li>
            <li> other reviewers here are having the same problem, so I know it isn&#x27;t just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I still have to keep my other trimmer for upper lip, sideburns, neckline, eyebrows, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend the iStubble to someone with a longer goatee, who has other products for the rest of the face (i.e., if you shave with a razor, but want to keep a short or medium goatee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> First off, it&#x27;s difficult to trim your beard, especially the hairs below your nose, as the unit is just too big.</li>
            <li> Conair customer service was of little help, and requires the entire unit to be shipped back to be repaired.</li>
            <li> This is my second one after my first one is slowly dying after three years of almost everyday use.</li>
            <li> the blades thing is kind of annoying, but I appreciate them telling me how to make this long lasting.</li>
            <li> My old Conair also caused my skin to turn red and was hard to use.  </li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a very long charge otherwise.</li>
            <li> It stays charged for a very very long time between uses.  </li>
            <li> If I pay to send it in and pay five dollars they will send me a new one, not a very good warranty.</li>
            <li> He had been searching for a better trimmer because the one he had, the gaps in between the different setting were too big, it would trim unevenly and it just made his beard look bad, enough for him to shave it all off.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve owned several less expensive razors, but always ended up less than satisfied.</li>
            <li> Half the time, the blade part falls out (hopefully it lands on the floor or in the sink, not into the toilet or something like that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, and after about 30 uses (less than one year), the comb part snapped &amp; broke completely.</li>
            <li> device is slightly difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Basically, if I have the trimmer sitting next to my sink, and I wash my hands and shake them dry and a few drops land on the buttons of the trimmer - the water seems to just get sucked into the electronics and the device starts acting up</li>

            <li> /&gt;There is much to be desired in battery life, it&#x27;ll last approximately 12 minutes on a charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Difficult areas such as rear jaw line (between neck and ear) might need a few more passes and a shaving mirror, but this is the case for all but a few shavers that have multi-adapting / contour following, flexible heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even then, when it hasn&#x27;t been plugged for long enough, it just shuts down.</li>
            <li> All the other trimmers he has used in the past has been really loud and this one was so quiet.</li>
            <li> So why the single star?  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned it is impossible to get your upper lip ... which I thought I would be able to get around or manage another way but with no luck this trimmer is headed to the trash.</li>
            <li> ONLY thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s hard to trim above your upper lip close to your nose because of the design of the guard.  </li>
            <li> but I also dont use it everyday but generally</li>
            <li> Plus, there is no real way to shave your mustache at the same length due to the size of the head attachment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thin to start with.</li>
            <li> No built in vacuum which means it&#x27;s very messy, a bit expensive, difficult to clean completely, hair goes evrywhere while your trimming, very close settings actually scrap skin, no bag or way to store it.</li>
            <li> the connection for the charger is getting loose</li>
            <li> can until all loose hairs are off of it and then sticking it in his bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> It only happened once to me, but, if you don&#x27;t accidently hit the up or down button to adjust the length</li>
            <li> It only happened once to me, but, if you don&#x27;t accidently hit the up or down button to adjust the length</li>
            <li> Start off at the larger settings and work you way down to the desired look.       </li>
            <li> It helps you cut your stubble down to various lengths.</li>
            <li> increments all the way down to a ridiculously low ,8.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get him to actually sit down and write a review.  </li>
            <li> You can take your beard down to a five o&#x27;clock shadow or to several days growth, it&#x27;s all in the powered adjustments, your choice.</li>
            <li> I am amazed how short I can get my beard, it is almost down to a 5 oclock shadow.</li>
            <li> It goes down to .4mm with the guard which is plenty close enough.</li>
            <li> I personally have never once never cut myself with this machine, even with the guide off, upside down</li>
            <li> so if you pick it up and it starts to run down and die in the middle of use</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other trimmers but none could get as close, until I found this!</li>
            <li> It was a little bit difficult to get to the moustache area due to the size of the head, but I was able to manage.  </li>
            <li> flashy light, the digital screen and hardly flexible neck are all gimmicks and I feel like it costs extra for those.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one because my first one the blade and spring assembly just completely popped out and it was nearly impossible to replace myself.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this guy, but it turned out to be an epic fail.  </li>
            <li> then your choices for various lengths are going to be: barely there, hardly anything, and shadow.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull or leave any nicks (and I have very sensitive skin), and I have yet to find any hard to reach places with this thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not ideal right under the nose, but nothing is.</li>
            <li> it gives me an even, uniform trim in half the time as the aforementioned trimmers.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, I wrongfully assumed it had stored my previous setting which ended up with me shaving off a swath of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;</li>
            <li> I tend to go for a less manicured look in my beard, so I don&#x27;t mind the elongated blade, which inevitably leaves some thinner areas untended to.</li>
            <li> I charged the trimmer about three weeks ago and still have half of the battery charge left.  </li>
            <li> Issue started with blade working only on extreme end of blade size range i.e on 0.4 mm and 5 mm, all other in between sizes were not settable as blade movement is machine driven.</li>
            <li> So not really realistic to travel with i-Stubble in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought mine at a different retailer for about $4-5 less than listed now.</li>
            <li> Outwardly it looks the same, but the small blade system is slightly different.</li>
            <li> Eventually, after less than 18 months of ownership, it simply was unusable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the unit stopped holding a charge after two weeks and would only come on for less than a minute.</li>
            <li> Now, less than a year after buying the product, the battery has totally quit and the shaver does not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> In all, it does what it promises, no more no less.</li>
            <li> but be warned the battery tends to fail on these units fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> is not wide enough and the guard is too thick to be usable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t slow me down that much (still done in 5 minutes or so).</li>
            <li> No big mess as was som of the concern.</li>
            <li> Would not even want to plug it in, since it was such a (smelly) mess.</li>
            <li> , what I found with the first 2 was that I could not get the cutting low enough.</li>
            <li> I always like to keep a bit of a stubble on and this trimmer keeps it really short and tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least half a dozen beard trimmers that claim to go down to 1mm or less, but this is the first one that actually does it well!  </li>
            <li> Adjustable guide worked fine, but cutting motor wouldn&#x27;t activate.</li>
            <li> There is only 1 thing that bothers me a little</li>
            <li> but it is possible with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i am not really accessible to customer care to ship the product back.</li>
            <li> My husband is military and this little trimmer is just the thing to trim up around his ears and the back of his neck so the hair will be off of his collar and neat.</li>
            <li> The only thing I notice is that longer than about 1mm makes it hard to catch all the hairs growing in different directions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to go ahead and say, its always hard to shave the upper lip, no matter what product you use, especially if you need to shave against the grain.</li>
            <li> The only complaints i have are: there is no place for the hair to go, so it leaves your sink a mess, and it is difficult to get the hair right under your nose.</li>
            <li> worked great for 4 months now makes a horrible noise and wont cut</li>
            <li> Eventually my trimmer would fail to give me the look I wanted (uneven or too much time required), so I&#x27;d completely shave and start the process over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Surprised anyone would have a negative review for this.   </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the adjustble comb on the head doesn&#x27;t allow one to work the upper lip area below the nose....</li>
            <li> but it sucks to have to shave my entire face + possibly deal with hair bumps just to maintain my \\&quot;look.\\</li>
            <li> iStubble does the job, just don&#x27;t get it wet.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a poor purchase if you are looking for fully functional beard trimmer or a trimmer that is capable of detail trimming.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot of difference between what it needs and the Wahl, just a brush and some lubricating oil.  </li>
            <li> The lack of a cord was a boon as well, as it didn&#x27;t drag all over the place while the iStubble was being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lack of a cord was a boon as well, as it didn&#x27;t drag all over the place while the iStubble was being used.     </li>
            <li> When the battery dies, it just needs to be plugged for a few minutes to get enough juice to finish off your lawn mowing.  </li>
            <li> It allows you to carefully adjust with precision</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my mistake, but I got is wet and it damaged the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real hairy</li>
            <li> The display pannel is not glowing in fancy blue, the lcd display is missing the bottom</li>
            <li> So, after asking around he was going to go with a much cheaper model because he was tired of spending money on \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; trimmers that claimed to do the job but didn&#x27;t and got used once or twice and are now sitting in the cabinet.</li>
            <li> Depression sets in as I realize I&#x27;ve wasted countless hours of my life with crappy trimmers.</li>
            <li> PS: I have used this for a few months now, several times a week.</li>
            <li> I am changing my review to 3 stars as the razor has stopped working after only using a few times per week for about 7 months.  </li>
            <li> For something that boasts 0.1mm precision, that&#x27;s not very</li>
            <li> If Conair could flatten the rounded sides of the guide, the iStubble could pass under my nose with minimal contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I just have to wet shave</li>
            <li> sometimes being empty when your about 90% done (this is when it was fully charged when i started).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now looking back the purchase seems like a waste of money.</li>
            <li> &quot; \\&quot;maintain your look, everyday with the next generation in stubble control</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked, but it never really got &amp;#34;that&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - I got what I expected</li>
            <li> Also, this trimmer is not meant to be used with wet hairs and it isn&#x27;t washable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing much included, just the trimmer itself, a small cleaning brush that has two brush heads, one wide and one small; a power cord, a \\&quot;sample\\&quot; size tube of trimmer/cliper oil and an instructions</li>
            <li> I did have to get it wet</li>
            <li> No compartment to empty.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It is not for wet use by the way.</li>
            <li> If there was one downside, you have to reset the desired length every time you star up the razor, only takes a few seconds though.</li>
            <li> The one con I do have is cleaning the trimmer, but that&#x27;s really not a problem if you learn how to use the brush provided in the packaging.</li>
            <li> Whether it does or not, I&#x27;m not really 100%</li>
            <li> you are after a &#x27;stubble look&#x27; and want to try out a few different lengths and styles there</li>
            <li> Only thing missing is a shavings catcher.</li>
            <li> Be careful when shaving, if you are prone to nicking yourself.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> very short cut don&#x27;t not buy waste of money..</li>
            <li> And its not waterproof, so dont get it wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few different brands and run the price range on them.</li>
            <li> The battery is soldered on and must be removed carefully, but you can find a replacement at Radio Shack for under $7 bucks.</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The Battery Life is not much.</li>
            <li> After taking it apart, I realized that the sharpest blade is held on by a small piece of metal that barely holds it on.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time as you will just end up returning it for your money back.</li>
            <li> So beware of the reported settings; they&#x27;re not very accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do nothing, it will turn off a few seconds later but &amp;#34;remember&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for approximately one month, and now that my hair has had a chance to grow back and get cut again a few times, I&#x27;m ready to do my review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really thick facial hair that grows back quicker than I would like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to be careful to hold it parallel to whatever surface of your face/neck you are working on, or you will get an uneven trim.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is a bit messy because of how the guard is attached to the unit, so tiny hairs go everywhere if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> (if it doesn&#x27;t lock into place on its own, which can be really annoying).  </li>
            <li> Right under the nose it is hard to clip with so you will need a secondary clipper.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much impossible to get all the hair on your upper lip, just under your nose because the trimmer guard is so big.</li>
            <li> I have used several other electric shavers but they just never did the trick because they have a hard time getting the hairs against the skin and actually make my skin irritated afterwords.</li>
            <li> im hoping to see how long it will last  its  a little hard to trim nose hair and upper lip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking to replace this trimmer, but I&#x27;m not impressed with the others that I see on Amazon right now (was hoping for a newer model, but doesn&#x27;t seem to exist yet), so I may just buy this one again.</li>
            <li> This one went all the way down to .4mm where my previous one only went to 1mm.  </li>
            <li> While technically you could still use it to mow your yard and then go back around with some push mower or weed eater, I&#x27;d prefer to have one precision mower instead of having to come back in with some other tool to get the weeds that this thing (due to poor design) can&#x27;t handle.....</li>
            <li> I agree with other posts that it is messy but knowing that you are prepared and it is not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> The other bad part is that you only are limited to certain hight which in the longest still cut the hair very short (5mm)</li>
            <li> If you think you will look shabby and dirty in your office without a clean shaven face, then this is notfor you.</li>
            <li> only complaint is minor; the handle is too slippery.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is minor; the handle is too slippery.  </li>
            <li> Confused as to why the battery didn&#x27;t last longer than a single use, I plugged it in and a white screen came up on the display.</li>
            <li> only place where it is not unbelievably awesome is directly under the nose, because (as you see in other reviews), it can&#x27;t get all the way up to the bottom of your nose - the guard is a little to big for that.</li>
            <li> The pieces are not interchangeable, and this new one seriously broke in less than 5 uses.</li>
            <li> Although i have gotten it wet a few times and it will dry out in like 2 days, and it keeps kicking just like before.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t charge sometime, other time it charge</li>
            <li> In other words, it does not function at all.  </li>
            <li> Granted, yes this should have been a clue, but when the item description, other reviewers, and even the packaging it comes in claims it can be used to trim your goatee and mustache as well..</li>
            <li> Maybe those people got punched in the nose for sticking it into other people&#x27;s business?  </li>
            <li> I purchased the trimmer as a gift, it was received with a scratch, I did not give the trimmer as a gift due to the damage.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*It&#x27;s just as messy and takes just as long to use as any other trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, the cost is similar to other trimmers we have tried in the past, but we probably wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> the battery as shipped requires 16 hours of charge... something not competitive compared to other products that are pre-charged, or that fully chargde in an hour or two.</li>
            <li> I often get acne due to irritation when I shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp on the ends.</li>
            <li> A bit sloppy with disposing of your hair, but decent razor.</li>
            <li> The issue people talk about on other reviews, that you cant trim under the nose, is non existent for  me.</li>
            <li> She said the other razor made me &#x27;prickly or scratchy&#x27;...</li>
            <li> almost like the way it cut produced sharp stubble.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, you can use the trimmer while it is charging, which some other trimmers lack.  </li>
            <li> I have not had a closer trim with other products.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers pointed out, you have to do some circus to trim your mustache hairs.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other reviewers, I don&#x27;t do anything fancy with my shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure how they engineered something that only lasts about 8 minutes after sixteen hours of charging, but Conair did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stop looking at other trimmers this is the alpha dog</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ll think you&#x27;ll find a lot of other folks think as well of this unit as I.  </li>
            <li> I bought this model because it seemed to cut shorter (4mm) than any other beard/stubble trimmer I could find at the time - and it DOES do that.</li>
            <li> With other trimmers I had the problem of my whiskers \\&quot;laying down\\&quot; and the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t trim it.  </li>
            <li> The battery hold extremely well.</li>
            <li> I would never buy this product again and would avoid any Conair product due to the lack of quality in design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have no had any of the battery issues that other consumers have had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews, and I agree the price could be a tad cheaper.  </li>
            <li> electro-chemically formed blades for extreme sharpness, durability and accuracy:</li>
            <li> Other than that no complains whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The other button is the power</li>
            <li> Never able to, because one day it would look one way, other days a number of various lengths.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other reviewers are correct about the features, quality of trim, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> -- I&#x27;ve done it with every other shaver I&#x27;ve owned without any issues, but you might want to research it.  </li>
            <li> I have never cut myself with any other trimmer that I have owned.</li>
            <li> I only need a really small trimmer for nose hair and for around the ears.</li>
            <li> Pretty useless if you want to use it cordless.</li>
            <li> While other reviews say that the settings are not true to what length the blade actually cuts your beard to, well maybe, but just experiment with it a few times and youll find a length that you like.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about it&#x27;s usefulness</li>
            <li> that I got a DOA unit, or should I just go with the other option (QT4070).</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Norelco is an extremely even trim.</li>
            <li> A lot of complaints on other reviews revolved around the difficulty in shaving the moustache area with this shaver, and I must say I had no problem with that.</li>
            <li> It has a couple of weaknesses but that is mainly due to the fact that it is not meant to be an all in one.  </li>
            <li> , my face fills up with rashes from the harshness of other mechanical razors and I end up with something that looks like a goatee and whispy stubble on the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It had to be turned on and off repeatedly to get it to move to other settings.</li>
            <li> Unless you are very careful, you will end up</li>
            <li> He said he does like the removable guards for hair, but the shortest length removable guards often slip so even the pros have to be very careful using removable guards when doing stubble.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions very carefully yet it still broke.</li>
            <li> The Gillette trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long, as they get clogged or something and slow down.</li>
            <li> The tight spot in the upper lip might find it hard for some people, but to me I just flip the comb back a little bit and have no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Most of them leave you looking uneven and dirty[in the bad kinda way].  </li>
            <li> Most of them leave you looking uneven and dirty[in the bad kinda way].  </li>
            <li> I found this product to work perfectly as expected, even with my thick facial hair, and I like the range of cut lengths!</li>
            <li> It is also difficult to trim hair on your upper lip near your nose because the guard gets in the way.</li>
            <li> Its not suitable for longer beards (0.4mm - 5.0mm is its total</li>
            <li> Other than that, my only other complaint is that the device resets the length setting after every use.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m fairly disappointed in the trimmer in general right now.</li>
            <li> Also, after a few weeks the movable head started to feel really loose and flimsy.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers who claim it cannot get under their noses are not trying hard enough.</li>
            <li> No need to snap on all those little guides you loose anyway!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really not THAT bad to have to clean up after for a couple minutes)</li>
            <li> is that its hard to shave the upper lip.</li>
            <li> It is hard to trim the upper mustache part given the design.</li>
            <li> only downside is that it can&#x27;t get those hard to reach places like the crease under the nose.</li>
            <li> It give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t so hard to use on your upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Hard to go back and forth without the guide locked into place</li>
            <li> No matter how hard you try to angle it, you&#x27;ll be left with a Hitler-stache.</li>
            <li> Only complaint would be that it&#x27;s really hard to EVENLY trim as it sometimes required you to go over the same section repeatedly</li>
            <li> As an asian person it is hard finding a shaver to make me look like I have really thick facial hair.  </li>
            <li> You do have to go over the same spot a few times to get the cut you want if your beard is thick like mine, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of non-Apple products using names that start with \\&quot;i-\\&quot;, but this one has earned at least a pass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of non-Apple products using names that start with \\&quot;i-\\&quot;, but this one has earned at least a pass.</li>
            <li> Just not worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not worth paying $50 just for one blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> Never ran past 60 seconds no matter how long it was charged.</li>
            <li> *sort of* put edges on your sideburns if you want (this feature is an obvious afterthought, but at least it&#x27;s included)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not overtly expensive and has a flexible head that really hugs the contours of a face.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that you have to reset the height every time you turn it off.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint is that the comb is big and you have to take it off to shave close quarters like under the nose.</li>
            <li> Mine was too late to send back via Amazon Prime and the Conair return policy, or I would have.</li>
            <li> but frankly it&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;tl;dr - two separate trimmers, both defective batteries, not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really worth</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone buy such a shoddy product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea, just terrible execution.</li>
            <li> I have a love- hate relationship with the iStubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the floating system is more annoying than helpful.</li>
            <li> I am changing my rating to 5 stars to 1 star (love or hate and nothing in between).</li>
            <li> That i-Stubble was the BOMB; made short work of my thick beard.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get that area about a 1/4&amp;#34; under your nose because of the guide, you have to trim that yourself with a few snips of the scissors, but not really an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> though li-ion batteries dont need it) and within a few months the battery would just die after minimal use.</li>
            <li> only con for this one is that the odd shape of the head does make it hard to shave under your nose.  </li>
            <li> nice work but very bad quality and no spear parts.</li>
            <li> , as pointed out already, it&#x27;s quite impossible to trim below the nose area since the guard is too big (and even taking it out doesn&#x27;t really allow you to trim as desired).&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> And after all this it was down to two bars.    </li>
            <li> you can lay it down and it supports itself.</li>
            <li> trimmer let me down in a couple of ways.</li>
            <li> All the shavings drop down, and get stuck in the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I purchased this to shave down the hair on my arms.</li>
            <li> On/Off, Up, and Down.</li>
            <li> The ability to move the cutters up or down rather that changing plastic guards puts this trimmer in a class all by itself.  </li>
            <li> When it came time to use it, I turned it on, dialed it down to 0.4mm, and started running it against the grain on my face, as the manual recommends.</li>
            <li> I held it upside down and thought this was a bust.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all brands of trimmers and this is hands down the beat for beard maintenance.</li>
            <li> I put down a towel and shave over it which  works</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t use a razor after a weeks growth without trimming the hairs down to size would you?  </li>
            <li> DOWN THERE MAINTENANCE</li>
            <li> As you adjust the height the head moves up or down.  </li>
            <li> I had to use my clippers to trim my moustache area down.   </li>
            <li> Also, it resets itself to 0.4 on power down.  </li>
            <li> Switch the unit on, push up / down using the buttons on the shaver to adjust the stubble cut length (0.2mm increments, as displayed on the LCD screen) and start shaving, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> and this beats them all hands down.</li>
            <li> When I press the &#x27;down&#x27; button, it goes to the minimum setting.</li>
            <li> You can flip the guard down to reach under the nose area.  </li>
            <li> it cause I end up taking my index finger and holding it down while I trim my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you hold the power button down for a couple of seconds to turn the unit off manually, it will lower the blade to the lowest setting before turning off.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY this for other purposes!  </li>
            <li> I mean really really short.</li>
            <li> last point - be wary of other stubble trimmers that don&#x27;t get as short as this one.  </li>
            <li> are saying that the hair spreads all over your shirt or in the floor, that&#x27;s false because I&#x27;ve tried it and no mess in my shirt or in the floor.</li>
            <li> I always end up coming back later to snip a few awkward ones that I missed earlier.</li>
            <li> few other misc things:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave every other day and a charge lasts a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> plus I have found a few other things that can be done with it as well ...</li>
            <li> it comes to shaving, I&#x27;ve been trying to get this look for the last few years, but I&#x27;ve failed miserably due to genetics and total incompetence with razors.</li>
            <li> I had used it the previous two times just to shave my head.</li>
            <li> Typically, I know which number attachment to use for the Wahl.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it looked slightly even shorter than the advertisement video.</li>
            <li> Just after less than 4 month the trimming head just broke, the plastic holding the spring is gone.</li>
            <li> and you have to compromise on trimming corners and slightly unreachable areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> It now wont charge enough to use and is useless after just 6-7 months of occasional use.</li>
            <li> but with less and less life each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However the trim size automated adjuster stopped working after almost half a years usage.</li>
            <li> This product broke after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> The bottom blade broke off in less than than two months.</li>
            <li> My previous razor died and I saw this one.  </li>
            <li> Previously I had a Remington MB4550.  </li>
            <li> The battery has lasted over years of use, but can notice a slight decrease in the number of times I can use it on one charge.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it has multiple length settings so you can get</li>
            <li> Just comb it through your beard against the grain and you are done in about a minute or less.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a less than a year</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously been using a Panasonic ES8103S (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DNE3KQ) and a Philips Norelco BG2030 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E0C9LI).  </li>
            <li> (Previously have used Wahl x1, Norelco x3, and Remington x1.)  </li>
            <li> My previous shaver had that</li>
            <li> I like a less than close shave.  </li>
            <li> Only small problem is sometimes its hard to reach the hairs under my nose due to the design.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I get a major breakout every single time I use these types of shavers.</li>
            <li> It is a little &#x27;messy&#x27; as other reviewers have said (but I was expecting it</li>
            <li> I would give it a full five stars, but it does have one bad side to it.</li>
            <li> I used a cheap Conair trimmer years ago and was disappointed, expecting this Conair trimmer to be no</li>
            <li> It makes a mess of the counter but having a sponge on hand takes care of that.</li>
            <li> does make a mess</li>
            <li> This did not work out of the box, and the lubricant had spilled out of its container and all over the package, making a mess.</li>
            <li> Yes, you WILL make a mess.</li>
            <li> Makes a mess every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes a mess every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> Two complaints that takes it from a 5 to a 4 star is the mess it makes.</li>
            <li> and it saved a lot of mess on the sink.</li>
            <li> (Of course, you&#x27;ll need to shave over the sink or in the tub/shower to avoid a mess all over the counter in any case.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has difficulty around my mustache area and in tight spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, just how long is .4mm anyhow?  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stop me from ordering a new one, just unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the pair I received does not hold a charge long enough to get through one trim session.  </li>
            <li> I was told it was very hard to keep the hair from flying everywhere and makes a big mess.</li>
            <li> very careful with the length you choose as there&#x27;s very little noticeable difference from 0.5mm to 2mm.</li>
            <li> The LCD looks like it got a little moisture in there from checking my luggage, but how can a trimmer like this not be water resistant?</li>
            <li> And I said I&#x27;d wait a little bit</li>
            <li> To me, that seemed a little bit unforgiving on my head.</li>
            <li> You would think they would last at least 2 trimming sessions!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this product :(</li>
            <li> I use it on my little soul patch these days - 10 seconds</li>
            <li> It picked up a bit of vibration but nothing a little tightening of two screws couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> The LCD display was a nifty little feature and my husband likes it because he&#x27;s so techy that way.  </li>
            <li> I found a little bag for it, but now I have nothing to put my synthetic urine in.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s always a little longer.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone looking to keep a little or a lot of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish the price was just a little lower, otherwise would have gave 5 stars.</li>
            <li> and you look like a bum, and too little you look like you just didnt shave.</li>
            <li> I put it on the .4mm setting for a little bit of stubble</li>
            <li> Mine lasted a little under a year before it just stopped charging or powering up at all.</li>
            <li> After a while I get them little squirts anyway.</li>
            <li> I believe Conair has developed some new shaving technology whereby hairs are violently ripped from your face rather than being cut.</li>
            <li> My beard was fairly long for me, and it is very thick, often stopped other trimmers in their tracks, even when plugged in.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little messy, and it requires a lot of care (no water, cleaning everytime, oiling, etc)</li>
            <li> It has allowed me to shave every few days but keep a little stubble and that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.  </li>
            <li> Just little bit trouble with trimming mustache and bit with neck hair.</li>
            <li> I have Mediterranean, North African, and Turkic genes to thank for my very thick beard.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when looking in the mirror it is hard to see where the tip of the blades are do to design.</li>
            <li> -- What you have left is a disappointing ruined shave, and for men that take a lot longer to grow beards, it is definitely a momentum</li>
            <li> Now for the negative parts/recommendations: The only negative thing I have to say is this trimmer excels at cleaning 85% of your face if used correctly, but struggles at getting the hairs even under the nose because of the bulky head.</li>
            <li> a cutting the hairs evenly and without much effort.</li>
            <li> Those plastic nubs broke off rendering my shaver useless unless you are okay with the minimum cutting length and a floppy floating</li>
            <li> It seems insane to put any kind of &amp;#34;brain&amp;#34; inside a trimmer just to tell you what length it&#x27;s set at.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s completely dead even with the cord plugged in.</li>
            <li> but otherwise is all dead.</li>
            <li> Today is 5/02/2012 and the trimmer is totally dead.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using the iStubble</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace my el cheapo trimmer that I use to groom my stubble every few days.  </li>
            <li> The Wahl comes with a poor quality cleaning brush that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> - we aren&#x27;t talking Tony Stark here</li>
            <li> waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Just a few times you get de 110% of what is promised...</li>
            <li> and it was dead.</li>
            <li> , I use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> When I turned it on the battery immediately went dead,  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After few months i cant control ultra-precise length settings .</li>
            <li> But alas, the 3rd time using the iStubble, I couldn&#x27;t finish my shave because the battery died halfway through (about 5 minutes).</li>
            <li> caught on hairs around my chin area on a few occasions.</li>
            <li> Even worse, these feature names appear to be individually trademarked.</li>
            <li> There are a ton of settings, but I personally use a .4 or .6 because it takes longer for unnecessary stubble to grow in the trimmed hairs place.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that I use this everyday but 1-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> That is why one star is missing.  </li>
            <li> It tends to miss a few hairs here and there.</li>
            <li> In the morning it was dead and won&#x27;t turn on.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave everyday anymore.  </li>
            <li> I will update this in a few months.</li>
            <li> , my unit had battery trouble from the start.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Battery would die after a few minutes of use.</li>
            <li> If the button gets pressed your battery will be dead.</li>
            <li> I use this for 3 days( 3-5 min sessions) and its almost dead.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> Then, a few days ago, no juice even when plugged in.  </li>
            <li> In addition to this, it is poor for trimming facial hair beneath your nose, again based on the design of the head of the device.</li>
            <li> Being a man shaving everyday is something I have had to do for years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money with this.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t collect trimmings as you shave, so could be described as a &#x27;messy&#x27; shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> looks like you have shaved for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and you are firmly in the &#x27;beard&#x27; category and this is not the shaver for</li>
            <li> Otherwise you&#x27;ll need to let it grow for a few days and in our impatient, \\&quot;me</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my face, but the trim tended to be a bit uneven, though.  </li>
            <li> Went dead before the 4th.</li>
            <li> Checked with amazon and was just a few days from a refund.</li>
            <li> And also keep it maintained and drop a few drops of oil on the blade every 5 times you shave.</li>
            <li> My brother used it to shave his head and thought it was going to be too narrow.  </li>
            <li> I shave over a trash can to catch the excess, since it was a bit messy in the sink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now</li>
            <li> I purchased this from amazon a few days ago and it died after one use.</li>
            <li> so uneven trimming</li>
            <li> Also heavy to hold.</li>
            <li> so it gets difficult to trim near the ears.</li>
            <li> Dropped in the sink into water a few times.  </li>
            <li> bought for christmas, was used a few times- made grinding noises and wouldn&#x27;t cut.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any razor from any brand that held a charge for so few shaves.  </li>
            <li> So the product works, but its not comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> It will work but its going to take some time and the cut is not comfortable.</li>
            <li> It worked alright, stopped holding a charge after a few months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make things worse, the battery life span seems to be short as it has to be recharged sooner and sooner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I think it sometimes results in the head losing contact, and you may notice some uneven patches when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a few oddities with the on/off switch:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived dead to the world and won&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li> and they told me that parts are not available for it.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t use it everyday).</li>
            <li> Find something else and don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
            <li> well that&#x27;s false because it did looked the same when I have used the 0.4mm setting on me.</li>
            <li> Again, not a huge issue</li>
            <li> For starters, the measurement increments (0.4mm, 0.6mm, 0.8mm, 1mm, 1.5mm, 2mm, 2.5mm etc up to 5mm) are not accurate.</li>
            <li> Less clutter!  </li>
            <li> Less clutter!  </li>
            <li> two times that it worked, it worked well, be wary for I saw other reviews with people experiencing the same problem.</li>
            <li> , something is wrong with the inner spring that move the blade, making the two blades to hit each other</li>
            <li> Some other reviews complained about the amount of hair that falls out of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> THe other complaint are valid.</li>
            <li> No more accidentally clicking the guard a notch too far and shaving a path in the wrong length.</li>
            <li> It is not possible to trim just below my nose, leaving a small patch of longer stubble, which I find frustrating.</li>
            <li> I hate having a clean baby faced look.</li>
            <li> Also, annoying to clean out every time.</li>
            <li> Some of the bad reviews come from people that want to have like an hour of stubble showing, other bad reviews form people that set this too low (easy to do) and then had no beard.</li>
            <li> I used this shaver and because I have a pretty thick beard it ended up cutting my neck up pretty bad.</li>
            <li> it is so difficult that it may as well be impossible when it comes to tiny spots like up right under the nostrils</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard and this little powerhouse never pulls, tugs or cuts me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides this, the battery is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> My first i-Stubble had a bad battery and died within a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to toss it in my travel case like I would a normal razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: as long as you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer that will leave behind hair, this will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Tough for hard to reach places and the mustache area, so you have to go over it several times.  </li>
            <li> but then after some time the motor will slow down &#x27;till it stops.</li>
            <li> something about the shape, just feels odd with rather hard edges.</li>
            <li> From all the reviews, this looked like the shaver to beat; but unfortunately after trying this on a few different settings I was mistaken.</li>
            <li> with that slight negative comment, I still give it 5 stars for it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical before purchasing after reading some reviews about how it is difficult to hold, but it is not difficult to hold.  </li>
            <li> For the 3 minutes it did operate, it was not very consistent with its trimming and it was very hard to trim areas under the nose and sideburns.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to trim under the nose, but if you come in from the sides, you can reach it.</li>
            <li> The head is just too big to go under your nose, so you get left with a very awkward little patch (think mini-Hitler stach).</li>
            <li> problem-ish is that I think the charger sucks and the battery is a little wonky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I found out that it cannot be used plugged in to an outlet if the battery has little or no charge (at least with the one I have).</li>
            <li> of the negative reviews here seemed a bit weak, or was not a big negative to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve clumsily dropped it a few times and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet worked out the warranty service with Conair yet, but you know how these things usually go - by the time you pay for all of the shipping costs you might as well have bought another trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like I usually do with both the Wahl and Remington.  </li>

            <li> I purchased this trimmer for my boyfriend for Christmas this past year.</li>
            <li> and that is when shaving around my upper lip near my nose I have a difficult time cutting the hairs because the hair guide gets in the way</li>
            <li> , when I read that this trimmer had a digital display that went from a mere .04mm to 5 mm.</li>
            <li> Â£44 purchase price was a small price to pay for this stubble shaver.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Today I went to use it and ran into a weird issue with the trimmer only allowing me to choose between .4 and 5mm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update on 02/10/14: Sadly I&#x27;ve had to drop my review back to three stars.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Update on 02/10/14: Sadly I&#x27;ve had to drop my review back to three stars.</li>
            <li> battery usually lasts a couple weeks before i need to recharge.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the iStubble&#x27;s guide bumps my nose and makes it a bit of a task to trim the stubble on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> The blade can be run under water, but the rest of the model (especially around the electronic display) is highly vulnerable to water -</li>
            <li> I usually turn it to 3.5mm for the length I want.</li>
            <li> A charge usually lasts me 5-6 shaves if not more.</li>
            <li> No more guessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also it is recommended to charge the product for 16 hours before initial use which disappointed upon initial opening of the product.</li>
            <li> Only people leading boring, sedentary lives want a facial trimmer without that extra stimulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yet I need it and there&#x27;s no better one out there</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Get quite a few trims (at LEAST 5) between charges</li>
            <li> Not sure if this one was just a dud or there is a problem with the batteries in all of them.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> Plugged it in for the night as usual.</li>
            <li> Also, no more guessing as to whether it is fully charges or almost dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use a separate electric shaver for my moustache area because it seems like the skin can take it without breaking out.</li>
            <li> second time, the adjustment stopped working and now it&#x27;s stuck on 5mm - the furthest adjustment - and useless for all intents and purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some don&#x27;t go as low as this one, thus rendering them useless.</li>
            <li> No more shaving every day and</li>
            <li> Arrived in a box, fully covered in oil which presumably would have belonged in the small bottle accompanying it.</li>
            <li> I usually use a 3.5 - 4 setting, and then detail with</li>
            <li> it ever fails, I will definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> :-S-:</li>
            <li> Like under the chin, I usually need to shave 2/3 times before it works.</li>
            <li> really is no better shaver on the market than this one at the moment.</li>
            <li> I find .6mm is closer to what I usually</li>
            <li> but I accidentally plugged the wrong A/C charger into it and now it won&#x27;t charge at all, so it&#x27;s essentially bricked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only downside as of now is that it is difficult to use in between the lip and nose area.</li>
            <li> Well, it usually takes &lt;10mins to use.</li>
            <li> I usually use the lowest just to shave any growth off.</li>
            <li> Do Not use the trimmer while your wet, if the smallest amount of water gets behind the display it will fog up and not work.  </li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s usually whiskers all over the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> This thing is totally useless and the moving head does not help at all as it does not mold to your face and it can only do its work by removing the guard out of the blades to reach the skin.  </li>
            <li> Like the adjustability, but I usually just leave it on one setting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure how.</li>
            <li> You just hit the up or down button and the digital screen says what length it&#x27;s now cutting at.</li>
            <li> The iStubble barely deserves 3 stars due to the absolutely atrocious battery life.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT for grooming a beard, goatee, mustache, etcâ€¦ but for keeping stubble that is impossible with a razor or normal trimmers.</li>
            <li> You have to charge usually after three or four shaves, which isn&#x27;t bad at all if you&#x27;re only shaving down stubble a few times a week.</li>
            <li> The thing has already broken due to water 6 weeks after I started using it.</li>
            <li> If you are having trouble cutting under the nose I suggest watching the instructional videos on the website, it clears things up on proper use!  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s not very good quality after all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t mean you have 35 minutes left on the charge.</li>
            <li> I have gone through countless trimmers and have been disappointed every single time</li>
            <li> My only complaint after a month of use is that the battery life is really rather terrible.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT use to try and thin down your mustache.</li>
            <li> but if you push to hard onto your face the blades will be closer than the pre-set length.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get a stubble look there.</li>
            <li> Some people think it&#x27;s hard to get under your nose, but I don&#x27;t think so.  </li>
            <li> it is hard to do under the nose</li>
            <li> Hard to do under my nose as well</li>
            <li> Cleaning it is no that hard</li>
            <li> This one is hard to use all over, not well designed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit tricky under the nose, and sometimes it can be hard to figure out just what length you need</li>
            <li> This is so hard to do.</li>
            <li> Really hard to keep a charge on it</li>
            <li> Its a bit hard to work around your nose</li>
            <li> Terrible at getting the angles on sideburns and as far as shaving my upper lip, it&#x27;s near impossible to get it all.</li>
            <li> I did find that the guard can get in the way a little when getting behind the ears and under the nose.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS: The cut hair gets all over &amp; starts to fail if it gets wet</li>
            <li> and I have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this negative stars if I could.</li>
            <li> the battery life sucks.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that it would at least work while it was connected to the outlet, but</li>
            <li> Every time I turn it on after it has been off for at least 10 minutes (i.e. every morning)</li>
            <li> can confirm the battery sucks as others have stated.  </li>
            <li> sucks.  </li>
            <li> The battery sucks, so it stays plugged in, but that doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me.</li>
            <li> Responses to common complaints:  -The</li>
            <li> - I had  two units and both stopped cutting for the same reason.</li>
            <li> So technically speaking, the moving (cutting) mechanism needs to be redesigned.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 4-5 stars if it lasted, oh say, at least 6 months?</li>
            <li> Just a clumsy design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (duh)</li>
            <li> It just simply does not do the job of cutting hair.</li>
            <li> The digital meter is frankly a silly and unnecessary gadget.</li>
            <li> The $5 shipping/handling fee sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked shaving, as it always irritates my face (both handheld &amp; electric).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least I thought I found my shaver until that fateful day when I dropped it in the sink.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to let people know not to buy it if you have a thick \\&quot;russian\\&quot; hair folicles.   </li>
            <li> Wish it came with a thin and narrow blade attachment, then I&#x27;d have kept it.</li>
            <li> one I&#x27;ve seen is that this product isn&#x27;t for thick beards.</li>
            <li> The hair on my face is thick</li>
            <li> some negative reviews about power on thick beards.</li>
            <li> I tried taking it with me on a trip and the second trip it knocked the adjustment out and despite very carefully disassembling and reassembling that part, I could see that it was not perfectly aligned and was no longer cutting evenly or at the height specified.</li>
            <li> , they mean it.</li>
            <li> It restarts at the lowest setting every time, and you have to push the button to increase it by 1 step at a time, which could mean a lot of button presses before you even get started.  </li>
            <li> I mean, that&#x27;s they way</li>
            <li> IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extremely disappointed by how uneven the trim is (I tried using at 2 and 2.5mm), leaving patches of lighter beard on the middle of my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Norelco (Phillips) and a Remington trimmer in the past, and those have run out of battery while I was using them, which was frustrating.</li>
            <li> awkward to use,bad for long beard plugs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been very difficult for me to find a beard trimmer that can allow me to get the short level of stubble I want.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Amazon shipped it to me and included all the previous owners hair trimmings still in and all over the trimmers, and all over the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately mine died after less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> trimmer seriously lacks power so even when i trim off like 1 or 2 mm and set it to 2 mm, it still struggles to get through.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted a serious product</li>
            <li> the maneuver is freaking ridiculous</li>
            <li> The other issue is that the head seems awkwardly attached, and fairly delicate.</li>
            <li> so I was a little skeptical about this working as well for me as it has for others.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is just not meant for people with thick tough hair.</li>
            <li> Too bad it lasted only a year and then started falling apart.</li>
            <li> I feel bad spending $50 on a groomer but this definitely delivers.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this trimmer, is that you can not remove the upper part of razor to skin type trimming, it is always going to have the blade on it which will have a minim of couple of mm length.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good look for me.</li>
            <li> , just looks like you are not a good</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, a product that you can not use on your entire face is just a poor product and is useless.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Not good at all for mustache.</li>
            <li> Buying mens razors and shaving gel every few weeks gets expensive.  </li>
            <li> which is every time I use it, I&#x27;m thinking about taking something and cutting the sharp leading edges off of it to see if I can do it without affecting the way the thing works.</li>
            <li> I tried cutting with my hair, against my hair, across my hair, every other direction and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> This sounds like crazy marketing language again, but maybe someone can explain why it is extreme.</li>
            <li> The cutting head mows thru thick hair with little effort and without pulling.</li>
            <li> Learned the hard way, I guess!</li>
            <li> My mustache sauce is weak</li>
            <li> The second one would turn off randomly which is borderline terrifying in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li> After having Conair and sporting a stubble, the problem of skin irritation, rashness, razor bumps, acne is gone and also it helps my budget by cutting down the expense of after shave &amp; before shave lotions, Shaving cream, replacement blades , scissors, and what ever expense you associate to shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving with a razor and shave cream was always very hard on my face and electric razors never worked for me.</li>
            <li> now\\&quot; society that can be a tough one.</li>
            <li> The design allows me to finish the job in a quicker time, and the parts seem tough.  </li>
            <li> It is a very delicate flower.</li>
            <li> However I keep making mistakes as the comb design is very clumsy.  </li>
            <li> a product that is meant to be used in the bathroom, you&#x27;d expect it to be water proof, or at the very least, water resistant.</li>
            <li> On a side note, I have very thick beard hair</li>
            <li> that I could tell) and it almost immediately had a terrible sound like its cutting through a hedge while not even shaving my face.</li>
            <li> There was hair all over the edge and was straight up disgusting.</li>
            <li> I feel its rather poor advertising.  </li>
            <li> Not happy about that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is acceptable but not great.</li>
            <li> even worse customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But two broken in a row.</li>
            <li> This may be the only trimmer/clipper you need - even if you hate chronic</li>
            <li> all in all really not a great item.....</li>
            <li> This seems to be a poor design.  </li>
            <li> the plastic pieces that was holding the metal blades was broken.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you like to keep that short stubble look but hate shaving once or twice a week</li>
            <li> I purchased two of the Conair i-Stubbles and BOTH have broken.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s poor quality.</li>
            <li> The plastic hinged &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; has broken.</li>
            <li> it took almost everything away, leaving behind, you guessed it, just-barely-shaved stubble.</li>
            <li> I would still use it, it works but the plastic cap that controls the cutting hight has a tooth missing and no replacements in sight.</li>
            <li> It is not really a great body trimmer</li>
            <li> BUT the surface area of the hair is not really great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blade has broken on my unit, so I call Conair to get a replacement blade</li>
            <li> Not really happy with their customer service.</li>
            <li> It is quite nimble despite the poor marketing material</li>
            <li> and I look like a sloppy homeless man or a 1950s beat poet.</li>
            <li> The plastic piece holding the spring that enables the cutting motion of the blades broke within a couple of uses and Conair was not able to replace the part.</li>
            <li> The removable clip broke during the normal cleaning process, support (generally horrible as well) refused to help saying I somehow voided the warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get bad razor bumps and ingrown hairs when blade shaving, so I typically use an electric shaver, or go for the stubbled look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had at least a couple of mornings where I trimmed too short because of this horrible feature.</li>
            <li> I usually just read the reviews rated 1 star and choose the product that has the least hate.</li>
            <li> This trimmer feels like it is slowly tweezing your face instead of cutting anything.</li>
            <li> I had to shave, daily, for 25 years and hated it.</li>
            <li> but I hate that it automatically goes down to 0.4mm when you turn it off for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> AND when I&#x27;m using it, it&#x27;s a very weak</li>
            <li> bad - it is the LEAST waterproof grooming device I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I was WRONG.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you it&#x27;s difficult to shave around your nose, because you can.  </li>
            <li> It is also difficult to shape my mustache as the blade is too wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am stuck with a useless shaver..</li>
            <li> The electronic adjustment fails and the blades permanently disassemble.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would deliver without being too expensive.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s obsessed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it just failed in the adjustment.</li>
            <li> By the way, it failed after 9 months of use, using it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has stopped working within just 4 months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The least painful way to trim with this device is to move it at a snail&#x27;s pace.</li>
            <li> This thing makes me sad.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Couple of downsides: no mechanism to catch all the hair and trimming the satche is a tad difficult.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately both Philips and Amazon make it a hassle</li>
            <li> and both of them have fails in about 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li> Might be slightly difficult to keep length on the chin/jaw line.</li>
            <li> It just jams up the cutting blades until it falls on the floor (or worse, all over your shirt).</li>
            <li> Sorry i bought it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t store the length setting after you use it, so you have to set the length every time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;ll be useless</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my wife threw my receipt and box that it came in out, so I couldn&#x27;t call the company.</li>
            <li> But this one is a dud -- it makes a horrible noise and pulled at his facial hair, injuring his face.  </li>
            <li> Of all the silly things in life, all I wanted was to maintain my &#x27;stubble&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They should pay for the shipping if their product fails.</li>
            <li> It will not charge or turn on or anything, and am stuck with a useless paperweight.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t take a charge and is now a useless paper weight.  </li>
            <li> used twice and didn&#x27;t cut and basically was useless.</li>
            <li> Useless Trimmer.</li>
            <li> But this LCD version is over-engineered, with an electronic motor that can and has failed.</li>
            <li> Always difficult trimming mustache.</li>
            <li> It just randomly died.</li>
            <li> any trimmer with a raised blade guard, it&#x27;s not perfect at getting under your nose, etc.</li>
            <li> Also, the battery indicator is totally useless.</li>
            <li> False!  </li>
            <li> and my wife hated the other razor.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Crazy, but it seemed to work well for that too.</li>
            <li> The head also pivots, allowing it to be used on curved surfaces without loss of precision in cutting length.  </li>
            <li> Screen is flashing like crazy</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> On the shortest level it starts cutting into your skin.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of dropping 50 bucks on this</li>
            <li> Pulls and cuts face at lowest cutting level.  </li>
            <li> Likes:&lt;br /&gt;-electronic cutting control&lt;br /&gt;-wireless&lt;br /&gt;-affordable</li>
            <li> As it is, this product stinks.  </li>
            <li> anyone has any questions about this please don&#x27;t be afraid to ask me.</li>
            <li> and it does not say what the cutting heights on that one are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve no problems with it cutting me whatsoever.</li>
            <li> With the guard removed it gives some precision cutting</li>
            <li> The head is attached to flimsy plastic pins/nubs which adjust the beard cutting length.  </li>
            <li> -- utterly useless!</li>
            <li> so you might just brush off this review, but you will be sorry if you buy this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always very skeptical when purchasing products from Amazon.</li>
            <li> very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Replacement parts seem to be impossible to find.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really bad at detail work - the floating head can&#x27;t get into a lot of spots (like close to your ears or nose).</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> on to the bad stuff.....</li>
            <li> I like the trimmer and would buy another one if this ever went bad.</li>
            <li> i know you can find bad reviews about almost everything,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two go bad on me in a six month</li>
            <li> Bad Battery.  </li>
            <li> (bad choice?)</li>
            <li> It hurt so bad I threw it across the bathroom.</li>
            <li> My guess is that there&#x27;s a bad connection within the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li> Terrible packaging with no protection, arrived BROKEN.  </li>
            <li> And a crude shave at that.</li>
            <li> The iStubble is also a stupid name, but not quite as bad.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> Every product had disappointed until the iStubble.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The rectangular/black buttons are for increasing/decreasing the cutting length, the smallest setting is a wopping .4mm!</li>
            <li> If this sounds like you pick up the i-Stubble you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> the razor part pulls on my hair :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited, and tried everything</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conair, products have not yet disappointed me.</li>
            <li> Was very much disappointed to find pieces of somebodies beard on my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; device.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s an annoying &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> By the time you&#x27;re done you&#x27;ll be sweating profusely and shaking violently in trepidation - this method reduces but does not eliminate the number of pulled hairs.</li>
            <li> I hate it because I&#x27;ve gone though 5 in a year that have just stopped working.</li>
            <li> This is a product is crap.</li>
            <li> yourself some grief.  </li>
            <li> , I found sometimes it catches on the skin or pulls out a hair which can be annoying..</li>
            <li> I really hate shaving and have not used a blade in years.  </li>
            <li> Since you cannot use it when plugged in, that makes it worthless.</li>
            <li> This makes the use of the device very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I used to shave with a 4 blade razor, but I hated my baby face</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a very bad record.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> dont know what to do, im very disappointed</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be very, very disappointed if this trimmer wears out.</li>
            <li> I received a defective item and am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this item.</li>
            <li> i bought this based on reviews but was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Holy crap!</li>
            <li> When using it, it now makes an awful noise and does not work at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst.</li>
            <li> Spoiled in 3 months, worst product.</li>
            <li> I read and charged the product according to directions and it is horrible.  </li>
            <li> horrible customer service...do not buy</li>
            <li> Leaves horrible patches as it can&#x27;t get to a lot of spots.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> Worst design ever.</li>
            <li> Disgusting and unacceptable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The worst feature on the iStubble (design oversight) is there is no \\&quot;catch\\&quot; for the hair.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving!</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;adjusting&amp;#34; slide stopped working altogether.&lt;br /&gt;After that, it continue to degrade until it ended up in the bin, terrible product.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> I HATE that!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I want to review this product, it was great....but even the moist from the shower...had this thing stopped working. Now I can&#x27;t change the size, and it doesn&#x27;t work....it wouldn&#x27;t charge sometime, other time it charge but I can&#x27;t change the size of cut. It&#x27;s just laying in the bathroom for nothing. :-( only after two months of use, it stopped working.</li>
            <li> We had gotten my husband one of these a couple of years ago and couldn&#x27;t find another one when it stopped working. So I ordered my husband this one and he says that it works better than the first one he had.  So I don&#x27;t know if they upgraded it and made it better or what.  But he loves it.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first three months.  Like others have said, it began making a grinding noise and pulled my hair instead of cut it.  It looked like an internal component worked itself loose.  This is a five-star shaver when it does work.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. It keeps my beard trimmed perfectly, and I can even &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; my neck with out it looking cheap and patchy like with other beard trimmers. I casually mentioned that I got a new trimmer at work and two guys at work chimed in that they also own it and think it&#x27;s the greatest trimmer they&#x27;ve ever used as well.</li>
            <li> worked great for 4 months now makes a horrible noise and wont cut</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.  It&#x27;s easy to use and gives you that perpetual unshaven look.  It&#x27;s only been a couple of months but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what its said to do - trip your hair at intervals of 0.2, starting at 0.4mm. Make sure to keep the charger handy as it will run low after a few (3-5) uses.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one. I thought my 1st one (after 5+ yrs and one dousing in water) had died, when in fact it was the charger that died! So, niw I have 2! I keep one charging at all times for backup!  I bought a 3rd one also and sent to my brother. After he tried mine some years ago we tried to go purchase one, but no one had them in stock or was no longer carrying them!  This is a Dream Shaver, as it allows control of various lengths for a variety of designs! I use the bare clipper (fold back guard) on face and neck for that &amp;#34;Perfect Stubble&amp;#34;! And then, with guard on I set at 2.5 for my mustache!  Only draw back is right under the nares, for that I freehand,  otherwise you can&#x27;t get close enough!!!  Did I mention I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Shaver!??? HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!  5+ STARS, if Available!</li>
            <li> iStubble does the job, just don&#x27;t get it wet. The Philips Norelco Beard &amp;amp; Head trimmer Series 5100 has sharper blades and cuts a little closer if you want a true 0.4 MM trim.&lt;br /&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017YNUH9E/ref&#x3D;pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p&#x3D;1944687742&amp;amp;pf_rd_s&#x3D;lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;amp;pf_rd_t&#x3D;201&amp;amp;pf_rd_i&#x3D;B00HB2ARDU&amp;amp;pf_rd_m&#x3D;ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_r&#x3D;QDD09E6QGPSG3XQZRHNC</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. I was looking for a great &amp;#34;manscaper&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s what I got!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean. Does the job nicely. Best part is the fact that it leaves little to no irritation.</li>
            <li> I researched products that would keep a stubble beard.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much cause I thought well it shouldn&#x27;t be a close shave so I don&#x27;t need a high end product.  Plus, it came with a warranty so I figured I was covered.  1st shave was good and I was happy but 3 days later when I went to use it again it did not run the trimmer blades or adjust the level of trim.  The LCD screen comes on and shows a charge but it will not run and it will not adjust the level of trim.  In other words, it does not function at all.  Best part is, to utilize the warranty, you must send in the product with $5.99 and wait 6-8 weeks for a determination if they will fix it!!!  I paid $38.99 delivered so why would I pay $5.99 plus postage both ways?&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT NO MATTER WHAT YOU SEE ONLINE!!!!  Want more information?  Just ask me!</li>
            <li> This is the  best trimmer I have found for a consistent length. I am definitely happy with the purchase. I travel frequently and will need to find a case to protect it in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> This razor does exactly what it says. I&#x27;ve tried all of the settings below 3mm and they all work flawlessly. My only complaint is that they didn&#x27;t include an option for 0mm to completely get rid of my facial hair, but that&#x27;s okay because the razor wasn&#x27;t designed to do that.</li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews saying this isn&#x27;t what you want for a long beard, I &amp;#34;thought&amp;#34;... it would be ok because I only trimmed with a normal 2-3 size guide anyway. I was mistaken, but it does the stubble look great, and cuts very clean with few passes, just not my style.</li>
            <li> Love this thing. Have been using it for more than six months. The only thing is that it does not give an extremely close shave, which is fine for me. But it does shave close enough, I have a constant 5 o&#x27;clock shadow - which is the look I was going for any way. Easy to clean and lasts long on a charge. Very happy with the purchase and the price.</li>
            <li> Best beard trimmer. Used a friends prior to purchasing and just had to get my own.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> 1 star for a 2 reasons. First reason isn&#x27;t necessarily the razor&#x27;s fault. I received the product that would not charge and was clearly used. There was hair all over the edge and was straight up disgusting. I only noticed this when I plugged it in and noticed it wasn&#x27;t charging so looked a bit harder at the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon was cool enough to do the refund thing and send me a new one. Awesome! Well...I let the guy charge for 16 hours like it said, then started shaving (this one wasn&#x27;t used before...that I could tell) and it almost immediately had a terrible sound like its cutting through a hedge while not even shaving my face. It was only alleviated when I pressed back the faceguard as far as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy/recommend again unless proven otherwise.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the iStubble quite a lot, and the control of length is fantastic for inexpensive clippers.  That said the way the height mechanism leverages makes it have a very large rear head (not shown in the product picture), which is tricky to get under a Roman nose like mine.  And while it pivots open for cleaning, I found a large amount of hair got under the blades, too, which is difficult to clean out (especially since it didn&#x27;t come with a cleaning brush).  For a comparable price, the [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips-Norelco BG2040]] is as good (if not a little better), and easier to use.</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of Trimmers in my Drawer, but none even come close to the istubble. Conair made one heck of a trimmer. I have NEVER had a trimmer that cuts so close and smooth. I even use it after I take the Hair Cutters to my head to get a closer cut. Does not take long charge up. I LOVE this Trimmer and would not EVER use another different Trimmer AGAIN!!! It darn near cuts as close as a razor. When they say. 4, they mean it. Amazing :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked around for a while for a stubble trimmer that gave the look of a day or two after shaving.  Every product had disappointed until the iStubble.  I&#x27;ve just used it once but it worked perfectly.  It might take one or two tries to get the perfect size you want to shave at, but I tried 0.6 mm and it worked great. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable trimmer that hates the clean shaven look!</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would add a whole new dimension to lengths I could go to while trimming up and shaping my facial hair, while at the same time replacing my old trimmers/clippers.  I was WRONG.  Yes, it can go to short lengths that are incredibly short..  but its MAXIMUM LENGTH is 5mm.  This may not sound very short, but its about the equivalent of the SHORTEST length available on my normal clippers/trimmers while the guard is still on.  If you&#x27;re like me, keeping your goatee one length, with the chin strap and side burns a bit shorter.. (or other areas a bit shorter in general, not necessarily JUST what I grow) then this item will most certainly NOT replace what you&#x27;re already using.  If its maximum length is the same as the minimum on most clippers.. then your choices for various lengths are going to be: barely there, hardly anything, and shadow.  It is, after all, exactly for what it&#x27;s name implies.. stubble.. and stubble alone.  Granted, yes this should have been a clue, but when the item description, other reviewers, and even the packaging it comes in claims it can be used to trim your goatee and mustache as well.. I feel its rather poor advertising.  It took over a week to get in, and I live out in the country where the nearest FedEx and UPS drop boxes are an hour and a half away (costing me more in gas to return it than I&#x27;ll be getting back when I return it).  Otherwise, I would be attempting to send this thing back in one way or another. -- utterly useless!</li>
            <li> The iStubble makes it a breeze to keep my head close (nearly) every day.  It&#x27;s as easy as shaving with an electric razor so I&#x27;m more inclined to do it every day, which means far less mess to clean up and no clogged drains.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good trimmer. It does the job and gives a pretty close trim. I would give it a full five stars, but it does have one bad side to it. If you purchase this trimmer, be sure to handle it with care because it&#x27;s fragile. I&#x27;ve clumsily dropped it a few times and it stopped working. Luckily i was able to open it up and it started working again.</li>
            <li> Be careful. When it turns off the setting goes back to 0. This morning I was trimming my beard and it died so I plugged it into the wall and turned it back on and started shaving and bam it took all the hair off of a part of my face. Not happy about that. Battery life isn&#x27;t great either. I had a Remington I only had to charge twice a year. This one needs charged once a month. This goes give a really great shave, but if you want a longer beard this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always very skeptical when purchasing products from Amazon. The reviews are mostly created by users who are incentivized to use and review the product. I usually just read the reviews rated 1 star and choose the product that has the least hate. This trimmer actually works, and it works really well. Get this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product is great, and works exactly as advertised.  The battery life is good - you can use it for weeks without a recharge, and the digital display helps alot when determining how long you want your facial hair to be.  The only complaints i have are: there is no place for the hair to go, so it leaves your sink a mess, and it is difficult to get the hair right under your nose.</li>
            <li> This is a great stubble/beard trimmer so long as you do not need to shave down to the skin.  Its very good if you like to keep a short beard or stubble and the razors are very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a poor purchase if you are looking for fully functional beard trimmer or a trimmer that is capable of detail trimming.</li>
            <li> I debated which shaver to get, and this was definitely a great pick. I have been using it for some time now, without any issues. Battery still holds a great charge and it makes getting an even trim very easy.</li>
            <li> Let me first start off by saying I&#x27;ve read the biggest portion of the reviews for this trimmer here on Amazon.  And while most reviews were positive, there were quite a few negative as well.  So, I didn&#x27;t know whether I should invest alot of money into yet ANOTHER trimmer that wouldn&#x27;t work as well as it is marketed to be.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried alot of name brand trimmers to try and get the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; look that kinda looks like a five o&#x27;clock shadow and most trimmers do not work at properly capturing that specific look.  I used a cheap Conair trimmer years ago and was disappointed, expecting this Conair trimmer to be no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this trimmer once, but, what I can tell is alot initially;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1}The i-stubble has a great setup.  It has the attachment comb on the trimmer which also has adjustable lengths for up &amp; down right above the power button.  With this, you can go from 0.4 to 5.0.  This is great for people with different styles of facial hair.  You can be longer length at 5.0 or short as you can get with 0.4, which is basically the above mentioned \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; or \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; look.  You can even unattach the attachment comb and flip it back and go even closer if you are wanting the one-day stubble look[which is what I did to see how close it would go].  If you wanted shorter than that, you&#x27;d have to involve a razor and cream.  Which should tell ya alot about how close you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2}Most negative reviews were complaints about the guide comb not being secure enough or not getting problematic areas[such as under the lip, soul patch, etc].  I can tell you this was not the case for me.  Even before I flipped the comb back and used the blade to get closer, the comb went all the way under the nose/mustache and even obliterated the soul patch area of mine that grows thickest.  The comb stayed in place the whole time the trimmer was in use and didn&#x27;t tug or pull whatso ever[which I expected with a week&#x27;s worth of beard already lined].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3}The battery charge is a big issue.  I seen some complaining about the battery life/lack of power in the i-stubble.  First off, if you read the guide book that comes with the trimmer, it clearly tells you to charge the trimmer for 4 hours, 3 days.  Which means it has to be charged for 12 total hours before you can properly have enough power to trim.  I&#x27;m guessing some people glared over that little detail and it changed their view of how good the trimmer was in their opinion[s].  I charged mine for 3 days for 4 hours and maybe even an extra day for maybe another hour or so to be sure it would be fully functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4}My only complaint is minor; the handle is too slippery.  Conair didn&#x27;t design enough rubber grip onto the handle section, which makes it prone to slipping out of hand during the trim process.  It only happened once to me, but, if you don&#x27;t accidently hit the up or down button to adjust the length it&#x27;s still not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every beard/mustache trimmer on the market with a few exceptions[mostly the Braun cruzers, Phillips &#x27;perfect stubble&#x27;, and a few others].  I&#x27;ve owned conair, the cheaper phillips&#x27;, remington, and the wahl line of trimmers[including the lithium ion].  None of them came close to giving me the type of smooth, even finish of stubble that this trimmer did.  Most of them leave you looking uneven and dirty[in the bad kinda way].  Glad to report this one does the job and seems to be worth what I spent on it.  At least, a real \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; trimmer!d].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3}The battery charge is a big issue.

            <li> This trimmer is great for trimming your beard and getting your face ready for closer shaving. One of the best features is that it you have so easy to adjust the trimmer to get the exact right shave. Best of all, it&#x27;s comfortable to use and gives you a comfortable shave. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic. The best electric razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I researched the hell out of beard trimmers before purchasing this one and I made the right decision. Works great and always gives fast, comfortable and perfect shave. I played around with the lengths in the beginning, but have now settled in. You can go real close without the gaurs for a one day stubble look and the adjustments move easily up from there. No big mess as was som of the concern. There is no vacuum, but there is a catch that collects most of your stubble unless you are making a significant trim. Even then, it is manageable, you jurist need to tap it out once or twice during your shave. Long story short, get this razor.</li>
            <li> It  arrived and it would not charge we now have to send it back to Conair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get all worked up over a beard trimmer, but this one is ok.  Cut height returns to &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; each time, It doesn&#x27;t hold a memory of where you set the depth, so you have to adjust it first each time you use it.  And it&#x27;s NOT waterproof - don&#x27;t try to clean with water (wonder why they didn&#x27;t waterproof this, oh well).  Other than that it cuts fairly well, and the maximum 5mm setting is just about right.  If you want longer than that this one isn&#x27;t the one you want.  But it works for us.  Overall good build quality, excellent batteries</li>
            <li> Does a great job, until it breaks. I am at my third one in three years. First one, the digital display just melted could not see the numbers. The second one broke at the charge plug-hole. The manual version is just too frail, so bought the third, as I have not found another brand that does the work I expect.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my husband.  He really enjoyed using it.  He loves the digital screen and the easy controls.  He thought it was easy to adjust to different settings and try different styles.  It is a very fun gadget for any guy to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, the battery does seem to wear down easily.  Even though we followed the directions, the battery was nearly wiped out after only 15 minutes of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it charging right before you use to ensure it will last!</li>
            <li> Have had this for over a year and no complaints at all. Comes out even every time no matter what the length selected. Easy to clean, easy to use battery life is standard.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is truly amazing. I&#x27;ve tried a number of different settings and have to admit... it works! I actually prefer a clean shaven face, but for those who don&#x27;t this is what you are looking for. You can find your preferred setting and be assured it will keep it there. Easy to maneuver, sharp enough to cut but not bite. Doesn&#x27;t leave irritated skin. Great job conair!</li>
            <li> Just want too tell anyone who is interested in getting one of these, that these are really great shaving razors. But you will not get a long life out of these POS&#x27;s, I bought mine back in early Jan. and it is already totally dead and does not work at all. Don&#x27;t give into all of the features of it and just go out and buy you a $20 Norielco Razor that will last longer than 5 months</li>
            <li> I try and maintain the stubble look, and this trimmer does a very good job of it. That&#x27;s the only good part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really bad at detail work - the floating head can&#x27;t get into a lot of spots (like close to your ears or nose). So in order to use this I have to have another trimmer on hand. The design would be much better if you could easily take the floating head off or if there was some kind of detail attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is acceptable but not great. If I shave quick I might be able to get 4-5 shaves out of it without recharging. The $20 trimmer I was using before this could easily get twice that many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After less then 2 months of normal use the trimmer died while I was traveling. The LCD looks like it got a little moisture in there from checking my luggage, but how can a trimmer like this not be water resistant? It seems insane to put any kind of &amp;#34;brain&amp;#34; inside a trimmer just to tell you what length it&#x27;s set at. I&#x27;d be perfectly fine with adjusting that manually and getting a trimmer that lasts more than 2 months. The $20 &amp;#34;dumb&amp;#34; trimmer I had before this is probably 5 years old and still going strong. I haven&#x27;t yet worked out the warranty service with Conair yet, but you know how these things usually go - by the time you pay for all of the shipping costs you might as well have bought another trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the bottom line is you need to spend more than $20 to get the close shave. So this is the right price for a next step up. But there are a lot of shortcomings - most importantly the fact that a little bit of water can kill it and because I need to carry a 2nd trimmer with me most of the time. So I&#x27;m fairly disappointed in the trimmer in general right now.</li>
            <li> it wont work.... it does not start . i charged it for 16 hours as it says and nothing... it wont start or do anything..... dont know what to do, im very disappointed and i dont even live in usa so i can not even return it.. so i lost my money. great.</li>
            <li> OK, I bought this to shave my head. I&#x27;m becoming follicly challenged on the top of my head and have been shaving my head once a week. I have several Wahl trimmers and have been very happy with all of them. I have a corded model, a cordless model, and my most recent purchase a Bald Fader. They are all great. I wanted a better routine though.    So I got this. And I said I&#x27;d wait a little bit so I could get a real good feel for the product. I wanted an easier routine for keeping my head shaved. I have plenty of hair on the side of my head that grows insanely fast. The heat from it growing so fast, or the incredible power of my brain seems to have worn our the follicles on the top of my head. So I found that Bald Fader was REALLY close and I liked the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look of a day or two after using it.    This seemed to be the perfect answer. My first use I tried it with the guard clipped back. To me, that seemed a little bit unforgiving on my head. It was fine, but it wasn&#x27;t as close as the Bald Fader, and it seemed to be a bit tough to do on my head. So I moved to using the guard and keeping it at the 0.4 setting.    I have found that this works great. The key is to keep cleaning the blade. My hair grows really fast, so in a day or two there is a lot of it, well, except up top. So when I first started, I found that it seemed to take more effort than I thought it should. So, it was my fault. Today I tried a different approach. I found that it was indeed \\&quot;clogging\\&quot; up with hair. I flipped the guard back and used the included brush to sweep away the hair buildup on the blade and the shave was so much better. The key for what I was using it for, was just to keep cleaning at a pace that was quicker than you would think would be needed. I have a schedule of shaving my head with this about every two days and am very pleased with it.    Battery life. It&#x27;s insanely good. I didn&#x27;t time myself, but this time I shaved my eye brows. Then my better half wanted to manscape my chest hair. And I shaved my head. I had used it the previous two times just to shave my head. And after all this it was down to two bars.    As for the height adjustments. It worked well on the eye brows. For my taste, I think it was too close at the highest setting for my chest though. Your mileage may vary.    Oh, and yeah I tried it for my face too. Crazy, but it seemed to work well for that too. Go figure.</li>
            <li> This is a a rechargable, portable \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; trimmer.  What that means is that it will only trim a short amount...up to 4mm I think.  It is rather fancy with an LCD and push button motorized depth control.  The components and action all seem high quality.  Holds a charge very well.  Have had no cutting issues with it.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that there are no interchangable combs for trimming longer lengths.  This would be handy for trimming hair in other places.  This is strictly for maintaining a very short beard, hence the name \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; trimmer.  It would have been vastly more functional with a few extra combs, so I&#x27;m docking a star for that.  If you just want this to maintain a stubbly look then it gets 5 stars for you.</li>
            <li> I went to the dry cleaners yesterday with the sole intention of dropping off my suits, exchanging witty banter with the Japanese lady who cleans them followed by a trip to the local Wal-Marts for a Panasonic trimmer.  After reading reviews of the $25 piece, I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting a &#x27;grade A, top choice trimmer.&#x27;  For some reason, I never made it Wal-Marts, I did a break-dance right over to Happy Harry&#x27;s a.k.a Walgreens and saw the iStubble for $60.  Since I work in the bond market, I figured I could afford it.  I had seen a commercial for this and the whole iPhone, iPod, and now \\&quot;iStubble\\&quot; thing really sold me.  (I&#x27;m really into new age technology and was the first to buy a CD player on my block)  Anyway, you have to charge this puppy for 16 hours and it was worth the wait.  I have the best &#x27;stache &amp; beard I have ever had.  This thing rocks.  You can detach the head and get an even closer shave.  I&#x27;ve had Norelco&#x27;s before but this Conair iStubble rules.  It purrs like a DeLorean.  Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you it&#x27;s difficult to shave around your nose, because you can.  Maybe those people got punched in the nose for sticking it into other people&#x27;s business?  I&#x27;ve only used it once but I&#x27;m assuming the battery life is good so go get it!</li>
            <li> Currently, we have an old standard clipper/trimmer from Wahl and a Remington cordless clipper/trimmer.  These are what I will be comparing the iStubble against for this review.  I&#x27;ve had this for approximately one month, and now that my hair has had a chance to grow back and get cut again a few times, I&#x27;m ready to do my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim to fame for the iStubble is the lack of multiple attachments for trimming hair to different lengths, thanks to its motorized head which adjusts to the length you want at the touch of a button.  The head also pivots, allowing it to be used on curved surfaces without loss of precision in cutting length.  Sure, it&#x27;s cordless too, but that isn&#x27;t anything new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iStubble comes well packaged, with multiple accessories for keeping it maintained and directions for its use.  Not a whole lot of difference between what it needs and the Wahl, just a brush and some lubricating oil.  Directions on usage, cleaning, and maintenance are clear and explained well.  While giving it its first 16hr charge, I read over the instructions to familiarize myself with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest trick to using the iStubble was knowing what length I wanted and where.  Typically, I know which number attachment to use for the Wahl.  As far as I know, these aren&#x27;t lengths, just a number.  For the iStubble, I had to do a bit of conversion and thinking.  I mean, just how long is .4mm anyhow?  (Pretty damn short!) A bit of trial an error followed on some body areas not typically visible to others, and I had it worked out.  I would not suggest you immediately start trimming your eyebrows, unless you know just how you long you want them, in metric measurement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True to its marketing, the iStubble worked very well when used as intended.  The head did need a little bit more pressure than I expected to get it to pivot around curves, but not a bald patch or uneven length was to be had.  \\&quot;Sensitive areas\\&quot; were well cut and no rash or bumps were left behind, even then the guide was removed and the head contacted skin directly.  With the guide on, no skin was pinched or accidentally cut.  The shortest length of cut (.4mm) left a near smooth surface in its wake.  Using the iStubble one handed was easy and fairly natural, the weight and balance just right.  The lack of a cord was a boon as well, as it didn&#x27;t drag all over the place while the iStubble was being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to like the iStubble pretty quickly.  While the cut it makes is narrower than the Wahl or Remington, that&#x27;s a plus in several body areas.  The lack of guide attachments was rather helpful, as I didn&#x27;t have to go digging around in my bathroom drawer for them like I usually do with both the Wahl and Remington.  Less clutter!  Woohoo!  While it&#x27;s not as versatile as the Wahl or Remington, both of which can be used for hairstyling/haircuts, that&#x27;s quite ok with me. Sure, there is also a substantial price difference as well, about double, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it in the end given the ease of use and precision.he guide was removed and the head contacted skin directly.

            <li> This I-stubble is amazing, it&#x27;s Sunday a day before Memorial Day and I just received it right on time! I used it right out of the box 2 min after I got out of bed, I was so excited. It shaved so well better than I thought it got really close to a nice one day length. I was a little worried because my facial hair grows in different directions, but it cut them. I got this to maintain a really low look because I don&#x27;t like facial hair much, so this did what I want.  Only thing is I believe you can&#x27;t use it, if it&#x27;s completely dead even with the cord plugged in. so you may have to wait just a little, but eh still good it works fast anyway.</li>
            <li> I purchased the trimmer as a gift, it was received with a scratch, I did not give the trimmer as a gift due to the damage. When originally asked about the delivery i explained it was received damaged. No one replied.</li>
            <li> Not too bad. Kept my facial hair neat, though I think I&#x27;ll stick to my electric shaver. It&#x27;s like that one guy on the Food network says about buying things that only serve one purpose. That said, it serves it&#x27;s purpose rather well.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Conair trimmer my husband has bought. The first one died after the rechargeable battery gave up after 2 years of use. The second one, I threw the charger away by accident and you can&#x27;t but any accessories from Conair to replace it. And after having weekly head shaves with it, and the results being second to none, my husband refused to settle for anything else. HIGHLY recommended for beard, mustache and head trimming usage.</li>
            <li> I was looking around for a reliable and flexible shaving machine and settled on this device and I must say I am very impressed with the device. Is is very easy to use and adjusting the levels on the blade is as easy as pressing a button. Makes for a very clean shave every time. I am very happy with this machine and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that you can&#x27;t shave super close to your face, that is the only limitation</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have ever had.  The battery lasts long (so long as you charge it the full 16 hours before you first use it), it is easy to use, it comfortably glides over your face and neck.  It is absolutely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Very nice product so far! I&#x27;ve used it for like a month now and I love this trimmer. It&#x27;s perfect to choose how long you want your beard to be.     Fast shipping too.      Thanks!</li>
            <li> The trimmer works extremely well.  I would have given it 5 stars if it remembered the depth setting.  It defaults to 4mm, which is too short for me.  I reset it to 1.2mm, use the trimmer, and then shut it off.  The next time I turn it on, the setting is reset to 4mm.  This is not acceptable.</li>
            <li> I use this as a beard/goatee/stubble trimmer very successfully.  it trims your hair to fairly consistent lengths if you want very short hair on your goatee, and even shorter stubble elsewhere.  DON&#x27;T BUY this for other purposes!  It is not a shaver, goatee trimmer for longer goatees (5MM is very short), or sideburn trimmer.  As the name implies, its purpose is to get the Don Johnson look.  In all, it does what it promises, no more no less.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a great job creating that look that the ladies are loving up these days.  It does take some maintenance to keep it working well, but its work it as it still works like its brand new.</li>
            <li> Just used the trimmer for the first time and it works perfect! Happy I bought this product and would recommend it to anyone if it performs as good for a while.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, easy to use and operate, in my opinion, an excellent purchase ... now the only thing is to check how long it will last (:</li>
            <li> One of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought! The head adjusts easily and the batter lasts a long time. When the battery dies, it just needs to be plugged for a few minutes to get enough juice to finish off your lawn mowing.  Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Well priced and no nonsense. Using it for more than 1 year and never faced any issues.</li>
            <li> I got this item for my dad and he loves it. He says it&#x27;s the best trimmer that he has used. He loves the digital length settings which made this item unique to him. The trimmer holds a really good charge to the point he used it right out of the box without having to charge it. It didn&#x27;t take him long to have a nice clean trimmed beard (about 4 mins) which he said he hasn&#x27;t gotten from any other trimmer in the past. No one in the family could believe how quiet this trimmer was. All the other trimmers he has used in the past has been really loud and this one was so quiet. The Istubble is also small, lightweight, and cordless which makes is really easy to use.    Overall the Conair Gmt900 Istubble is well worth the price. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you live and work where you can have a stubble appearance without consequence, then this is the trimmer for you and you will look just like your favorite movie stars who appear on the late night talk shows looking like they just forgot to shave but actually did shave with a product like this!  It allows you to carefully adjust with precision how long you want  your stubble to be.  It isn&#x27;t a shaver, it won&#x27;t work if you want clean shaven, it is for stubble lengths only.  Conair makes excellent products and this stubble trimmer has a lot of extras with removable head and easy to clean and adjust.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer for my boyfriend for Christmas this past year. He had been searching for a better trimmer because the one he had, the gaps in between the different setting were too big, it would trim unevenly and it just made his beard look bad, enough for him to shave it all off. Since he has received the iStubble he has just been raving about it. Considering my boyfriend is BEYOND VERY picky, that is a feat in itself. His favorite part is that the trimmer has a wide range of lengths and that the gaps between the different lengths are very small, so he can get exactly the length he wants. The battery life on it seems to be good too and it has not died on him in the middle of a shaving. The i Stubble has been by far one of his (and my) favorite Christmas presents this year.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have a beard, I asked my husband to try this stubble trimmer. He provided the following feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The floating head is comfortable, and I didn&#x27;t feel any pulling or receive any nicks. I did not have any fear of it doing any harm.&lt;br /&gt;*It is easy enough to handle.&lt;br /&gt;*However, I did not find it very precise for the mustache area under the nose and at the edge of the sideburns. The issue there is that it&#x27;s a matter of getting the trimmer close enough to the beard. It feels like it wasn&#x27;t made to do that.&lt;br /&gt;*Although you can turn the guide piece around, all you are doing is exposing the blades, so you no longer have the digital setting of the hair line. So if you&#x27;re trying to make your mustache the same length as your beard, you won&#x27;t have an accurate length unless you use scissors.&lt;br /&gt;*I liked the digital setting on the trimmer because with other clippers, the point at which we would hold it was where the settings were and they would change if we held the trimmer normally.&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s just as messy and takes just as long to use as any other trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;*Overall, it works as much as any other trimmer with the exception of the digital settings for the length, and the rotating head is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;*I don&#x27;t recommend it for body trimming at all, just the face, because the settings don&#x27;t have enough variety and the design isn&#x27;t made for that.&lt;br /&gt;*I would like it better if it were waterproof and could be used in the shower to prevent the mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the cost is similar to other trimmers we have tried in the past, but we probably wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> PROS: Comfortable &amp; offers many lengths without multiple attachments&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The cut hair gets all over &amp; starts to fail if it gets wet&lt;br /&gt;BEST USE: Trimming hair, not shaping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others, I bought this because it looks cool and received positive reviews.  What I found is that hair gets all over the place in my bathroom, which becomes a challenge to clean.  It is also difficult to shape my mustache as the blade is too wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my mistake, but I got is wet and it damaged the trimmer.  Now, it will only adjust from .4 to 5.0 and nothing in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like is the comfort.  It really is a comfortable tool and has a great weight and feel.  It just doesn&#x27;t deliver as well as my old trimmer with the traditional attachments.</li>
            <li> Surprised anyone would have a negative review for this.   I&#x27;m not real hairy and it takes me about 2 days to get that 5&#x27;oclock shadow look. After growing it an extra day I used this product to maintain the stubble...exactly what this product is supposed to do. The different length settings definitely work and I can easily tell a difference just adjusting it a couple clicks.  If you&#x27;re looking for a stubble or close trimmer than you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well until it started draining battery after 1 shave.&lt;br /&gt;Right now, I use it once and by the time i need a 2nd shave in a few days, the battery is drained by then. It is supposed to automatically turn off but it supposedly doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on february. It breaks after 2 mons. I did follow the manual that charge it for 16 hrs at the first. The display pannel is not glowing in fancy blue, the lcd display is missing the bottom, I even can&#x27;t readjust the Length anymore.&lt;br /&gt;The blade still moving but otherwise is all dead.</li>
            <li> Great adjustability, great battery life. Easy to clean after use. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a great beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Bought on 12/20/2011, used very little until weather started getting to hot for longer stubble so I started trimming a couple times a week in April. Today is 5/02/2012 and the trimmer is totally dead. I used it Monday cleaned it , sat it on a shelf until this A.M. When I tried the trimmer it made one growling sound and nothing since. I call the hot line telephone number, from the body of the trimmer, since it comes with a two year warranty. If I pay to send it in and pay five dollars they will send me a new one, not a very good warranty. Guess my days of trimming with the Conair GMT900 iStubble trimmer are over, they were ended by an inferior product and even worse customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this trimmer if you are not concerned with longevity of your product and an amenable customer service department. It worked pretty well for just over four monthes and that&#x27;s probably one of the real good ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and so far he likes it!  He has course hair and it cuts his beard great.  He has even left it off the charger for a few days and it held a great charge.  The real test will be when he shaves his head with it.</li>
            <li> I always had to plan my stubble if I wanted it to be present when I went out, so having stubble was really like a 3 or 4 day process. I used my I-Stubble today and about 45 seconds later I had that three day look. The .4 mm length is perfect for me, and since it adjusts with the push of a button, I can style down to the look I want. Now I just hope the stubble look doesn&#x27;t go out of style any time soon!</li>
            <li> First, the unit is well made and feels good on the hand. And it does seem to cut hair to .4 mm, which seems to be a much closer cut than the competition. In addition, the floating head feels good and, contrary to some reviewers, I had no problem shaping the stubble under the nose, though it did require some back and forth movements and, as in all razor situations, making faces. No skin irritation to report as well.    Now, the not so impressive but still a tad inconsequential: the battery as shipped requires 16 hours of charge... something not competitive compared to other products that are pre-charged, or that fully chargde in an hour or two. Conair needs to address this. In this age of immediate gratification waiting nearly two days to try the device is too much. Secondly, the trimmer requires application of oil to the blades.    Yet what might be something to think about is that the stubble cut by the device is, in many ways, not the \\&quot;ideal\\&quot; stubble grown in a day or two after a good traditional shave with a good blade (or safety blade). One explanation is that .4 mm is still not short enough for the ideal stubble if you have thick hair. I suspect something like .1 mm would be more like it.    The second factor is that not all of our beard hair grows out at once... some hairs grow faster than others. The result is that a day or two \\&quot;natural\\&quot; stubble after a good shave will be less dense than the day after day use of the iStubble. After a few days of using the iStubble all hairs have had a chance to come out, and even if all cut at 0.4 mm they do clearly form thicker and more pronounced stubble.    So, in a few words, if you have thick face hair or a lot of it your iStubble will work, but the stubble will not be that \\&quot;ideal\\&quot; light stubble that develops after a good shave --it will be thicker and more pronounced.    Still, I am happy with the iStubble as I do not need to shave every day, and do like the stubble look more than a clean shave look. Perhaps the best out there, but, as in many things, it could be even better.    ** 2013 **    Continues to go on strong, and works fine! No oiling over a year and still no problems. Once you get used to a bit thicker stubble, no complaints at all!    ** 2014 **     Continues still to go on strong. Have not used it as much as in prior years, but keep it plugged in. It still holds a charge.</li>
            <li> It works, like clockwork so far. My only issue is that 0.4mm still seems like more than a day&#x27;s worth of growth, I&#x27;d love it if they could go even shorter to, say, 0.3 or 0.2. But within its operational range this thing works very well and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. I haven&#x27;t put a razor to my face in 3 months now...</li>
            <li> This trimmer is perfect for my needs. I like trimming by facial hair rather than shaving it, because my skin is very sensitive. I often get acne due to irritation when I shave. With this trimmer, I get great results without the irritation. On it&#x27;s lowest setting, the trimmer cuts hair very close to your skin and gives you a very light stubble look, which is nice. I personally use it on the 1.4mm setting where the stubble is a bit more visible. I really like the electronic mechanism that raises the the trimmer to your desired setting. Not only is it a cool techie feature, but you actually get to know the exact length of your facial hair and at the same time this allows you to be more picky in terms of how long you exactly want your facial hair. In other words, the traditional manual adjustments with other trimmers usually won&#x27;t give you as many adjustments as this one (in terms of the different mm settings).  The battery life on this is great as well. I&#x27;ve had a Norelco (Phillips) and a Remington trimmer in the past, and those have run out of battery while I was using them, which was frustrating. You would think they would last at least 2 trimming sessions! I had to wait for them to charge before I could go out (I didn&#x27;t want that half-trimmed look haha). With this trimmer, I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore. It comfortably has enough battery life to last at least 2 sessions of trimming.  Lastly, the contoured shape of the actual trimming attachment is excellent. It really molds to your face and reduces irritation even further.  I got this trimmer on a lighting deal for around $26-$30, but had I known it was this good, I would have bought it a long time ago for the normal price.  Thanks.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> My dad bought this for me because of it worked well for him.  The blades and motor are powerful enough to cut your bead and even shave your head, but the digital adjuster was broken when I first removed the iStubble from the box.  It only goes to 3.0mm instead of 4.0mm.  It&#x27;s not a big deal, because I always use it on the lowest setting, but if you want the longer setting you might have to worry about it breaking on you.</li>
            <li> Very precise blade setting but if you push to hard onto your face the blades will be closer than the pre-set length. Very good battery life, easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Ive gone through a lot of different kinds of trimmers from the wahls to the norelcos and everything in between. My main issue with most of the trimmers have been their ability to get the hairs without having to go back and forth a hundred times. The design on this trimmer is top notch and it gets everything either the first or second time. Very easy to use and no worries of getting nicked! I like keeping a trimmed beard and this trimmer gives superb flexibility in lengths. A MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for about a month now. So far it&#x27;s been a good trimmer, the only complaint I have is that there is no hair trap for the shaved hair. It makes a mess of the counter but having a sponge on hand takes care of that. Be careful if you leave it off after setting a length you will have to change it back to the desired length as it resets. I used it before I showered and then afterwards, I think it was longer than 5 mins that I left it. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> This is an awesome stubble clipper!  The 0.4 mm setting cuts my beard to the perfect length of about 1-2 days after a clean shave, which is exactly the maximum length of beard I want to keep.  You do have to go over the same spot a few times to get the cut you want if your beard is thick like mine, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  The only drawback to this unit is that despite what the instructions say it doesn&#x27;t work very well plugged into an electrical outlet when the battery is dead, meaning that once the battery has reached the end of life I&#x27;ll have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a shaver that has a multitude of settings then this is for you.  This device is digitally set to a length and as long as you apply a constant low pressure, the length is constant.  This is for stubble and will not suit your needs if you are looking for a close shave.  I have been using this for over 3 months with no problems and feel comfortable recommending it.</li>
            <li> After about a dozen &#x27;shaves&#x27;, the battery would not hold a charge.  Conveniently for Amazon, this occurred 2 weeks after the return window so I am stuck with a useless shaver..</li>
            <li> Do not buy this or the manual model.  I like the performance, but they do not last.  The electronic adjustment fails and the blades permanently disassemble.  I&#x27;ve owned three.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for clean looking scruff.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea, but the first one broke within weeks. One of the plastic pegs pushing the adjustable blade snapped. I got a replacement, and a different part broke within a month. While they worked, they were great, and got the job done. But two broken in a row. So now I&#x27;ll find another brand.</li>
            <li> over the years, i&#x27;ve used remington, norelco, and wahl beard trimmers to mixed results. i was apprehensive about purchasing yet another trimmer because of this. however, i recently made the jump and purchased the conair gmt900 and it&#x27;s by far the best trimmer i&#x27;ve ever used. it gives me an even, uniform trim in half the time as the aforementioned trimmers. it&#x27;s the only trimmer i&#x27;ve used in which i don&#x27;t have to make repeated passes to get an even cut and then go back with tweezers and scissors to take care of what wasn&#x27;t trimmed on the repeated passes. cleaning and maintenance are also a breeze. parts and construction are solid. if i ever buy another trimmer it will be the same one or a newer model.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this thing works beautifully in all respects except one. That leads me to the 3 star rating because it&#x27;s a  big deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;first, this thing is fast and cuts so good, it&#x27;s hard to believe how well it really works. It&#x27;s smooth, the adjustment method is near genius, the battery lasts a long time, it has a backlight, I don&#x27;t have to fool with a bag full of different size clip-on spacers... Everything about it is great... except...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spacer. It&#x27;s sharp on the ends. When I trim my mustache, the $%@$#% thing stabs the inside of my nose while I&#x27;m tying to get all the hairs. It&#x27;s not just bothersome, it sends me into a cursing rant every time it happens... which is every time I use it, I&#x27;m thinking about taking something and cutting the sharp leading edges off of it to see if I can do it without affecting the way the thing works. the spacer is a good 1/2 inch or more ahead of the cutter and that makes for problems... especially when the leading edges are so dang sharp.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. A bit sloppy with disposing of your hair, but decent razor.</li>
            <li> The tight spot in the upper lip might find it hard for some people, but to me I just flip the comb back a little bit and have no problems whatsoever. Also, it doesn&#x27;t really make a mess at all like some others here are saying that the hair spreads all over your shirt or in the floor, that&#x27;s false because I&#x27;ve tried it and no mess in my shirt or in the floor. Some people have also said that the advertisement video is misleading and that it doesn&#x27;t really trim as short as in the advertisement video, well that&#x27;s false because it did looked the same when I have used the 0.4mm setting on me. In fact, it looked slightly even shorter than the advertisement video. This trimmer isn&#x27;t an all-in one groomer, but it gets the stubble look that I&#x27;m looking for. The fact is, All-in One groomers like the Norelco G370 won&#x27;t give a decent stubble look because it isn&#x27;t for that purpose, plus you can&#x27;t really get 0.2mm or 0.3mm that other people are claiming. I have it myself and it doesn&#x27;t trim as short as the iStubble. Overall this product is great and I highly recommend it for men who want the \\&quot;stubble look\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this trimmer. It works exactly as advertised and I have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this trimmer.  Super precise settings make this a must for anyone wanting to fine-tune facial hair.  I think it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Terrible packaging with no protection, arrived BROKEN.  NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO USE IT.  DESPITE THE BOX IT CAME IN BEING DAMAGED I THOUGHT THE TRIMMER MADE IT OK.  THREW THE BOX AND SOME OF THE EXTRA SUPPLIES AND INSTRUCTIONS THAT CAME WITH IT AWAY AND NOW CAN NOT RETURN IT SO I HAD TO LITERALLY THROW MONEY AWAY.  DO NOT ORDER THIS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mostly bald man with a beard and I&#x27;ve been using an adjustable length beard trimmer for several years on my head and beard, with the shortest length on my head and increasing the length to my beard and goatee.  When that trimmer started failing, I bought the iStubble and at 0.4 mm it cuts my hair shorter than anything besides an actual razor (electric or manual).   However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the maximum length of the iStubble is 5 mm which is just too short for my beard. In addition, the head is too big and unwieldy for trimming my moustache without the guard on.   Thus, I&#x27;ll be turning to an additional solution for trimming my beard rather than the all-in-one I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to.  Using to cut hair on my head: 5 stars.  For stubble look: 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost perfect, but I still give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s not deserving of losing a whole star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only place where it is not unbelievably awesome is directly under the nose, because (as you see in other reviews), it can&#x27;t get all the way up to the bottom of your nose - the guard is a little to big for that. So, I get one of those $9.99 stick trimmers that you see on TV and in stores, and carefully clean up right under my nose, it&#x27;s not that hard to do. Get this product if you want great stubble in minutes, without the hassle of shaving.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a while for the perfect stubble trim and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found. Performs as advertised, simple to use and is hassle free.</li>
            <li> I have ZERO complaints. The issue people talk about on other reviews, that you cant trim under the nose, is non existent for  me. Just trim that area on a side to side motion! I use it for my head and face, and love it!</li>
            <li> .... you wont regret!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first stubble shaver I&#x27;ve used but in reviewing others I wanted one that looked like it would get the hairs that grow against the skin. I have used several other electric shavers but they just never did the trick because they have a hard time getting the hairs against the skin and actually make my skin irritated afterwords. This, on the other hand, is wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t miss hairs, it doesn&#x27;t have a hard time cutting (I have thick hair), the battery lasts (I&#x27;m still on my first charge weeks later), and the best thing for me is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all. Some other things I really like about it is that you really don&#x27;t need a rechargeable stand. The way it&#x27;s designed you can lay it down and it supports itself. Another super great feature is the automatic adjustments. You just hit the up or down button and the digital screen says what length it&#x27;s now cutting at. I absolutely love this and out of all the electric shavers I have found this is 100% my favorite so far. There is only 1 thing that bothers me a little and that is when shaving around my upper lip near my nose I have a difficult time cutting the hairs because the hair guide gets in the way but I believe this can be removed if needed but I haven&#x27;t had a good enough reason to. Hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son who was recently in the market for a facial trimmer, but didn&#x27;t know which one to buy and well, to say the least, I really wasn&#x27;t much help.  So, after asking around he was going to go with a much cheaper model because he was tired of spending money on \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; trimmers that claimed to do the job but didn&#x27;t and got used once or twice and are now sitting in the cabinet. That was until I got the opportunity to have him try the Conair Gmt900 iStubble Facial Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the things he was looking for in a trimmer was that it would go down low enough to keep his goatee short enough.  He has very fine hair and in the past, some of the trimmers would just glide over the hair and not give a close enough cut until it grew out too far and then it would pull.  He also likes to trim the back of his neck in between visits to the barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, when I read that this trimmer had a digital display that went from a mere .04mm to 5 mm. I thought that this HAD to be it!  So, as soon as it arrived, I handed it to him and he couldn&#x27;t believe just how low and precise the iStubble cut! There are also 15 different positions in between. So, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find the right position or positions to help you keep your facial hair the way you want it, or try something new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came charged and ready to use! It also comes with a wall charging unit, a brush and oil to keep your trimmer blades clean and cared for.  With proper use and cleaning, I can see this trimmer lasting years. That means I can FINALLY get rid of the pile that I have in my closet in the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swiveling head flips up and open so that you can clean it easily with the oil and brush that comes with the Conair iStubble itself.  Most men do have trouble keeping up with the modern facial fashions and this has to be (according to my son) one of the best, if not the best trimmer on the market that he&#x27;s tried in a very long time!  Oh, as for what used to take him about twenty to twenty-five minutes, now takes him about five minutes! His words are that it comes out perfect everytime! I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I&#x27;ve used Conair over the years and they&#x27;ve certainly become a name that I&#x27;ve grown to know, love and trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the price goes, this one looks even better in person and the simplicity of use makes it worth the money to me.  I&#x27;ve seen trimmers with much higher price tags that don&#x27;t do what the Conair Gmt900 does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re on the fence about purchasing the iStubble for yourself or for someone you love, I say go for it! It comes highly recommended!  It&#x27;s a great way to keep the man or men in your life perfectly groomed!nty-five minutes, now takes him about five minutes!

            <li> Great product for maintaining stubble on different levels, quiet precise too.</li>
            <li> My husband is military and this little trimmer is just the thing to trim up around his ears and the back of his neck so the hair will be off of his collar and neat. It&#x27;s come in very handy when a trip to the barber isn&#x27;t convenient. The charge lasts a good amount of time, and the trimmer is really useful, especially on trips. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Just received it 10 minutes ago. Plugged it in. Screen is flashing like crazy which is not supposed to happen. And no I didn&#x27;t turn it on. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Blinking stopped. Blank screen.  I unplugged it and plugged it in. Said it was charging! Walked away. Came back in 10 minutes. Claims to be fully charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh this is going to be a doozy! And why is this product JUST now under review? Apparently this issue was reported in 2013...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: After 16 hours of charging, I used it today just to buffer the case. It died as soon as I unplugged it. So I plugged it back in. Worked just fine. Turned it on. Started to shave. Then in the middle of shaving it shut off and snagged my hair. I unplugged it and turned in on. And while UNPLUGGED it showed that it was charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame! I was so excited to use this product :( Back to the warehouse you go!</li>
            <li> Was pretty pumped about using this product, I&#x27;ve heard great things about it.  Unfortunately, Amazon shipped it to me and included all the previous owners hair trimmings still in and all over the trimmers, and all over the packaging.  It would have been sweet if I was into other peoples hair trimmings.</li>
            <li> I have had two of these and they work great.  I broke my first one by dropping it...I&#x27;m not going to blame them for me being an idiot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try a different brand stubble razor after I broke my first Conair iStubble and my wife hated the other razor.  Why?  She said the other razor made me &#x27;prickly or scratchy&#x27;...almost like the way it cut produced sharp stubble.  She made me chuck that one and buy another one of these Conair iStubble razors.  This is the only wife approved stubble product I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con for this one is that the odd shape of the head does make it hard to shave under your nose.  No biggie, I keep a regular gilette Fusion for cleaning up my non stubble areas and the back razor on it is perfect for getting that bit under the nose.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and worked great but broke in my luggage while going through the airport, so make sure you pack it correctly bc the head has many small plastic pieces that can break.</li>
            <li> Over the moon with this product. Â£44 purchase price was a small price to pay for this stubble shaver. This is a quality product that gives an excellent performance. Flick the comb back and it shaves my head to the bone and that was an unexpected bonus. When you hold this you can feel the quality. Guys if you are looking for a quality stubble shaver and more, this in my opinion is the ultimate. Got it from Amazon .com for Â£44 including import fees. The UK website was Â£90 so forget the .co.uk and go for .com. The delivery was 3 days befor the quoted date. Once again I can only praise this product but make sure you give it the full 16 hour charge befor you use it to make sure the duel battery&#x27;s function well.</li>
            <li> Yes it did thank you for the service</li>
            <li> Used often and high quality...works well</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace my el cheapo trimmer that I use to groom my stubble every few days.  First of all, the main things other people gripe at are definitely true.  First, its hard to trim under the nose.  Not impossible for me, but it takes a little contorting of the face.  I can live with it.  Second, it really should keep the length setting.  It restarts at the lowest setting every time, and you have to push the button to increase it by 1 step at a time, which could mean a lot of button presses before you even get started.  I&#x27;m fine with this since I use the lower settings, but take note that to reach 5mm you have to push the button 14 times!  I can see this motorized length control as the first thing to break since you have to adjust the length on every use.    Overall for me, I&#x27;m happy with it. It performs very well and gets VERY close, even closer than my old conair trimmer without no guard. At first, I thought I would just use it at it&#x27;s lowest setting all the time, but after I saw how close it can get I will probably using a step or 2 higher.</li>
            <li> Bought it to keep a five o&#x27;clock Goatee look and this product works great! Be sure and start on the longest settings (3.0 or 3.5) and work your way down!</li>
            <li> Just received the IStuble from Amazon.  The charge only took about 4 hours v. the  roughly 16 hours mentioned on the directions.     Had beard growth at about 3 days and the .4mm setting does the trick, subject to your own personal growth rate.   Start off at the larger settings and work you way down to the desired look.       Thanks Amazon and IStuble.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was decent when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned one of these left it on my bathroom counter near my sink. It appears moisture seeped in and destroyed the insides. It no longer works. :/</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been buying those \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; trimmers at my local superstore. They typically last me a couple of years and get the job done, but I usually spent way too much time trying to get the \\&quot;look\\&quot; right. My routine would usually be to completely shave, let my facial hair grow up, and use my trimmer to touch up every few days. Eventually my trimmer would fail to give me the look I wanted (uneven or too much time required), so I&#x27;d completely shave and start the process over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured there had to be a better way and started looking into higher quality trimmers. To my surprised, they weren&#x27;t much more expensive and after reading a ton of reviews, I settled on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a gadget guy I was super excited to try it out, but as someone with lots of battery powered gadgets, I know the damage you can cause to a battery if you don&#x27;t condition it properly. I left it charging for the 16 hours initially required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day is my anniversary, and I&#x27;m ready to try it out as I want to have the perfect look for my anniversary dinner. The hardest part was deciding on the right setting, seeing as how my previous trimmer just had the numbers 1-5. I arbitrarily decided to go for 1.4mm (although in retrospect I should have started at a higher number and just gone with multiple passes, lowering as I went along.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first pass over my face, I&#x27;m surprised as how it leaves a trail of...well, perfectness. Holy crap! A single pass and every single hair looks perfectly trimmed and even? Depression sets in as I realize I&#x27;ve wasted countless hours of my life with crappy trimmers. The depression subsides quickly as I continue trimming my stubble and realize 2 minutes later that I&#x27;m done. It just seems way too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I call my girlfriend over and she approves. Okay, so what am I supposed to do with the 7 minutes I&#x27;ve just saved? Oh, the trash needs to be taken out? The dishwasher unloaded? Great, now I have the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a new owner but I&#x27;m already in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so now the bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) The trimmer head is a bit big and kind of painful to use around your mustache/under nose area (as many other reviewers have noted). I decided to stick with my old trimmer for this area. -1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Today I went to use it and ran into a weird issue with the trimmer only allowing me to choose between .4 and 5mm. There&#x27;s no in-between. I took a video of the issue: http://youtu.be/PiFJ3ELVZxk I&#x27;ve ordered a replacement and we&#x27;ll see if this happens again. -1 star for now, but I&#x27;ll happily give it back if the replacement works properly over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will highly recommend it if the replacement arrives and works without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit on 10/7/13: I received my replacement and haven&#x27;t had any new issues since. Back to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on 02/10/14: Sadly I&#x27;ve had to drop my review back to three stars. I think I figured out why I had that original issue - this little trimmer is VERY susceptible to moisture/water getting in to it. Basically, if I have the trimmer sitting next to my sink, and I wash my hands and shake them dry and a few drops land on the buttons of the trimmer - the water seems to just get sucked into the electronics and the device starts acting up (buttons become non-responsive). I&#x27;m not talking about immersing the device - it&#x27;s literally malfunctioning just from the collateral water splash of using the sink. A huge design flaw for a device that&#x27;s primarily used in a bathroom. Fortunately I&#x27;ve been able to keep it alive by immediately drying it out with some heat after the occasional accident, but I don&#x27;t expect this to work forever.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a new owner but I&#x27;m already in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so now the bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)

            <li> have had this for about a year. this thing is great!!! i recommend this to every one of my friends. i use it daily. battery usually lasts a couple weeks before i need to recharge.</li>
            <li> Firstly, let me start out saying that I am a guy that has very sensitive skin - in general - and my intended purpose for this shaver is for my face. I have searched high and low for a face shaver. I have tried regular razors, the $300 Philips Norelco 3D, the cheap versions of that, and many others. Unfortunately, I get a major breakout every single time I use these types of shavers. My almost tireless search pretty much ended when I found the ~$24 Gillette Proglide Trimmer System. While it does include an ad-on razor, I only used the trimmer part on my face to get a very close shave. I have tried numerous other trimmers but none could get as close, until I found this! I picked this up as an Amazon deal of the day, and am so glad I did. The Gillette trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long, as they get clogged or something and slow down. This trimmer is very powerful and hasn&#x27;t slowed down and actually seems like it trims much closer. It comes with everything you need to get going. You will have to oil it, as with many trimmers, but the numerous settings makes it so much easier to trim anything to need to trim! Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy this one today. PS: I have used this for a few months now, several times a week. I can&#x27;t say how this will last over the course of years, but it does seem solid. I did accidentally drop it on my tile floor and I thought it was a goner. Nope! Not a scratch on it, and still functioning great.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how well this product works.  I have been using an older Conair product for a long time and decided it was time for a change.  The I-Stubble was very easy to unpack and has easy instructions.  After charging for the specified time, Oiling the blades as suggested in the directions, I gave it a try.  It is surprisingly quiet and very easy to set the trim length.  I set it for 0.4 and was very pleased with how well and fast it cut.  The swivel head really makes it easy to contour to your face.  Again, I am very surprised at how well this works and how easy it is to use.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for this type of shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to add.  I have very &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; skin.  When shaving with a razor, no matter what shaving cream I use (even those for sensitive skin) I get a rash and my face is itchy.  Sort of like &amp;#34;Road Burn&amp;#34;!.  Thus I like the electric shavers.  My old Conair also caused my skin to turn red and was hard to use.  This product does not cause my face any discomfort plus it provides a very nice shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 10/06/2016 - I am changing my review to 3 stars as the razor has stopped working after only using a few times per week for about 7 months.  When using it, it now makes an awful noise and does not work at all.  When it worked, it did work well.  However, I expected it to last much longer than it did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this now for over a year and it&#x27;s holding up great. It cuts my facial hair to a fine stubble. It has tons of length adjustments and only needs a charge every 10 uses or so. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This trimmer really seems like a great idea, but ultimately fails to be as precise as it tricks you into thinking it is.  I&#x27;m still using it, but so far I&#x27;ve had mixed results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On it&#x27;s face, this looks like a winner: No attachments. LCD display with battery indicator.  Height adjustments in 0.1mm increments.  NiMH battery.  Flexing head for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In practice, however, the trimmer does not seem to perform so well.  My guess is that it&#x27;s a fatal flaw in the design of the head.  What seems to happen is that an opening on the height-adjustment for the blade causes the softer skin on your face to fill the opening more than the harder skin leaving inconsistent stubble length.  For something that boasts 0.1mm precision, that&#x27;s not very precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery has been pretty great so far.  Some NiMH batteries suffer from short shelf lives, but the fact that this trimmer buzzed very well fresh out the package is good indication to me that it&#x27;s a quality battery.  Additionally, you can use the trimmer while it is charging, which some other trimmers lack.  This feature comes in handy immediately as you are told to charge the battery for 16 hours before using it cordlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the idea of this trimmer to be much better than the implementation.  I think Conair should continue with this line of trimmers, though I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve hit the sweet spot in this particular incarnation.  Plus, it&#x27;s not waterproof.</li>
            <li> I really like stubble beards. I often wondered how men keep them  short. It seems like it&#x27;d be easier to either let their beard  grow  or to shave it off.  Well, this trimmer is the answer. It needed a man&#x27;s review...and here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS with some comparison to a Wahl trimmer&lt;br /&gt;The iStubble trimmer gives the appearance of quality and comes with a nice cleaning brush. The Wahl trimmer I recently purchased feels cheap in comparison. The Wahl comes with a poor quality cleaning brush that doesn&#x27;t last. Of course the Wahl trimmer IS about $20 cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The digital display on the iStubble is also a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer&#x27;s design allows you to change length settings without fiddling around with attachments as with most trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iStubble trims very neatly even for medium length beards. I was worried that the longest setting, 5 mm, would be too short, but the 4 mm setting works perfectly for the medium to short length that I like. This trimmer wouldn&#x27;t work for those with longer length beards, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tilting head of the trimmer seems to work well for allowing it to follow the contours of your face, contributing to an even trim. The iStubble thus seems to do a much better job than the cheaper trimmers in this regard. With my Wahl I have to concentrate a lot more on holding the trimmer at the right angle to ensure even length and to avoid stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;No storage/charging stand. You have to store the trimmer lying down which means it takes up more counter space than it would with a stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer doesn&#x27;t store the length setting when you turn it off. Since the trimmer defaults to 0.4mm, the shortest setting, this means if you use the longer settings, you have to cycle through all the lower settings sequentially each time you use the trimmer. The second time I used it, I wrongfully assumed it had stored my previous setting which ended up with me shaving off a swath of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with the iStubble trimmer overall. It makes it very quick and easy to get a neat, even trim of my beard, much more so than other beard trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past.verall.

            <li> Have tried lots of trimmers and shavers over the years.  I really like this one.  A couple of things I might want changed but nothing major.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve already spent way too much time online, reading reviews and forums trying to find the perfect trimmer. Like Jimmy Hoffa&#x27;s body - it doesn&#x27;t exist. This product is pretty good though. It helps you cut your stubble down to various lengths. It lights up and makes cool mechanical sounds as you adjust it. And it&#x27;s seriously quite stellar at spewing those trimmed whiskers into the furthest reaches of your bathroom. With the competition, you&#x27;d have to go over the same area four or five times, then shake the trimmer like a martini to get the same effect. With the GMT900, one pass... maybe two and your done. (And why didn&#x27;t they name this the GMT9 THOUSAND?! talk about a lost marketing opportunity!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I digress. Some will criticize it&#x27;s inability to trim below your nose. Sure, with the guard in place - you&#x27;ll be left looking like Hitler. Just bend that puppy back into it&#x27;s \\&quot;relaxed position\\&quot;, and you can carefully trim in those confined spaces. It&#x27;s not like you need a surgeon&#x27;s hand when trimming without the guard, but those with over caffeinated nervous systems should take pause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer let me down in a couple of ways. Ways which led me to quarantine myself from society until my facial hair grew back. The first was when I attempted to trim my sideburns. I&#x27;m thinking... hey, I&#x27;ll just keep on mowing upwards until I feel/hear the extra resistance. When I hit my eyebrow, I knew I had made a grave mistake. Following that - I decide that it&#x27;s time to shape my goatee. Look - we aren&#x27;t talking Tony Stark here, I just don&#x27;t appreciate looking like a fat gerbil sat on my face and died. I&#x27;ll just bend this here guard back, hit my line, and shave upwards. I mean, that&#x27;s they way I do it with my old trimmer, and it works great - clean, sharp lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so much with the GMT900. In fact, not at all. But whatever. Now I know why it didn&#x27;t get the vaunted \\&quot;GMT9 THOOOOOOOOOUSAND\\&quot; designation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - it takes two trimmers to get the desired effect. This one for variable length trimming, and my old hacksaw for precise lines. It&#x27;s not like you only have ONE screwdriver in your toolbox, yeesh. Just buy this already. Your face will thank you and you can rain stubble all over the wife&#x27;s side of the bathroom from eight feet away.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does an excellent job at delivering what it says.  I have not had a closer trim with other products.</li>
            <li> Best facial hair trimmer on the market! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this. I own two just to have one as a backup, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> The new Conair Gmt900 I-Stubble is great for anyone that likes to customize their unique look.  My husband has had a trimmer for years that only gave him 3 settings.  The I-Stubble&#x27;s 15 settings allow him to create and maintain his own unique look.  It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.  I recommend it to anyone that wants more options than 3 or 5 settings.</li>
            <li> Could not be more happy with this trimmer.  Bought it just over a month ago and cannot believe how good a job it does at trimming my beard.  Great buy!!</li>
            <li> I loved this unit. Cuts very accurate with less fuss like the others.  I had to return this one because the LCD went completely white. I went to bed bath and beyond, bought another one. No regrets.  Still a great product</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this razor - he loves it!</li>
            <li> Fist off, even though I am an Amazon Prime member the package got sent trough Parcel Pool. Then the package was delayed for a week. When it finally arrived, I let it charge for 16 hrs. like it says and used it for 10 min. The secod time I was going to use it cordless it had no batterry allready. At first is quiet but gets loud in like the third use and after the first two times using it you have to use it connected all the time because the battery doesn&#x27;t last more than 5 min. and gets low power if not connected.</li>
            <li> I bought this Trimmer for a friend and he absolutely loves it! He says it is really gentle on his skin and it gives him the effect that he wants when shaving.  Even though it was on the more expensive side of a lot of the electric trimmers I looked at, I think you really get what you pay for with the iStubble.  For you ladies out there, it is an awesome gift for your boyfriend, husband or friend!</li>
            <li> Just after less than 4 month the trimming head just broke, the plastic holding the spring is gone. I&#x27;m trying to find a replacement but so far no luck. In addition the use time is way below the advertised and the trimmer just stops all of a sudden without any warning.</li>
            <li> 3 stars ONLY because the .4mm and the .6mm settings actually cut my face. If I stick to .8mm or higher I am ok.</li>
            <li> It is better than Philips Norelco Qt4022/41 Stubble Trimmer Pro. The plastic top which glides over your skin is soft and won&#x27;t create rashes even if you press it hard against your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It does create a stubble and which is why you will buy this, anything more than 5mm you have to look for other options like Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer. Also don&#x27;t get fooled by the video, you cannot have your stubble so close. If you bend the top-plastic with help of your thumb and trim, you get amazingly shorter stubble, still it is not as close as the one which is shown in the advertising video. The stubble sported by Jason Statham in Crank-2 is very much possible with this one.&lt;br /&gt;The wider top helps you to have an even trim all over your face, neck and jaw line. As other reviewers pointed out, you have to do some circus to trim your mustache hairs. I am not saying you cannot trim your mustache. With a tilted angle you will be able to do so, but the hairs very close to your nostrils will be left behind. It depends on your creativity and the engineering angles you create with this one will help you to trim those hairs. Norcelo did a good job of trimming mustache hairs. So it is a trade off, if you want a quick even trim with minimum strokes you have to have a wide trimming blade and you have to compromise on trimming corners and slightly unreachable areas.&lt;br /&gt;I have a sensitive skin and fear to shave with both Gillette Mach3 and electric Shavers for cuts and acne problems. After having Conair and sporting a stubble, the problem of skin irritation, rashness, razor bumps, acne is gone and also it helps my budget by cutting down the expense of after shave &amp; before shave lotions, Shaving cream, replacement blades , scissors, and what ever expense you associate to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a good product and buy it if you want to sport a stubble. If you think you will look shabby and dirty in your office without a clean shaven face, then this is notfor you.</li>
            <li> This thing is great!  Very easy to use and smooth all while saving me plenty of money on blades.</li>
            <li> best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever seen. Long lasting battery, The top flips over you can line up your edges, and it electronically changes the guard size. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I so wanted this to work and it did for about 1-2 min. However then I had ALL THE PROBLEMS MENTIONED under all one star reviews ie battery, inability to adjust etc. Conair should be ashamed. I will try one more but it is a real gamble.</li>
            <li> Only lasted for about a year and then the level broke. Now I just use it as a trimmer/edger without the guard.</li>
            <li> Worked great,only once. Second time it was buzzing like a mini lawnmower. Removed the blade cleaned it (the internals of the blade are a pain to put them back in). Oiled the blades a bit. It was quiet again, for a short amount of time and it started buzzing again. The best part it doesn&#x27;t cut good when buzzing it stops only when the head of the trimmer is bent back or you hold it back beck. It would of been a great product if it would have been reliable. Now I have to play with it and go over a lot until it trims the beard. DO NOT RECOMAND!</li>
            <li> This may be the only trimmer/clipper you need - even if you hate chronic stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I&#x27;m a blogger who was offered a trial of the iStubble. However, I was under no obligation whatsoever to give it a positive review, and in fact I found some flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally grow my facial hair grow out. It&#x27;s not a good look for me. But some guys can rock the perpetual five-o-clock shadow and look great doing it, and they need a better answer than simply shaving every third day. Regular clippers don&#x27;t trim precisely enough to keep that stubble in the \\&quot;sweet spot.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the iStubble, which does just that, and a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may like a normal electric trimmer, with a plastic guide and metal blades, but the iStubble&#x27;s magic is its precision: it&#x27;s adjustable in 0.2 mm increments, from 0.4 mm all the way up to 5 mm. Press the up or down buttons and the guide moves into the precise position. You don&#x27;t have to guess at the correct angle in which to hold the iStubble: just press the guide flat against your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction sheet recommends shaving against the grain for best results, and I agree. For the neck and chin, I found it necessary to go over the area another time or two in a different direction - I later found that the instructions recommend that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got more than just stubble, that 5mm setting can keep your beard, mustache or goatee from fuzzing out. I use it on my little soul patch these days - 10 seconds and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the guide folds back completely, you can use the naked blades to shape your beard or sideburns, trim your neck hairs between haircuts, and even clip stray body hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My facial hair grows right up to within about 1/8 of an inch of my nose. Unfortunately, the iStubble&#x27;s guide bumps my nose and makes it a bit of a task to trim the stubble on my upper lip. If Conair could flatten the rounded sides of the guide, the iStubble could pass under my nose with minimal contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the trim length resets each time I turn the iStubble on. While it&#x27;s fun to watch the motorized guide move back and forth, I wish the iStubble could just remain at the last setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a stubble farmer, the iStubble should be your implement of choice. It&#x27;s also useful even if you&#x27;re clean-shaven or beardy. I&#x27;m not a big fan of non-Apple products using names that start with \\&quot;i-\\&quot;, but this one has earned at least a pass., the trim length resets each time I turn the iStubble on.

            <li> I ordered the Istubble because it seemed to have decent reviews and I wanted an accurate beard trimmer. When I got it I plugged it in and, started to shave. By the time I was done I had blood dripping down my neck, and I had to finish with my regular old Wahl hair trimmer. The trimmer is just not meant for people with thick tough hair. Then I returned the trimmer via post and never recieved a refund, so all in all the purchase was a loss for me. I just wanted to let people know not to buy it if you have a thick \\&quot;russian\\&quot; hair folicles.   Good luck   -Eric</li>
            <li> Shaving too close irritaes my skin.  This product works great!  Trims my stubble just close enough that I don&#x27;t have to acutally shave.  My face loves it!</li>
            <li> The Conair would be okay for short beards, but I found it rather &#x27;grabby&#x27; when using at its shortest setting (0.4 mm).  If you want to maintain 1-2 days of growth (&#x27;stubble&#x27;, in my book), I&#x27;ve found the Wahl Super Taper II, with no comb attached, to be a much better choice.  Plugs in (so no recharging), runs at a higher RPM, and cuts through like nothing.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most precise and easy to use facial trimmer I have ever used and I have gone through many of them.  This will be the last one I ever purchase cuzz it doesnt get better than this.</li>
            <li> Didnt work.  Wouldnt hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I bought this in September from Store2door, on Amazon. The device works OK but after only 4 months of use maybe twice a week, the cheap plastic trimmer guide broke off.  Despite the claim of a one year warranty, Amazon tells me that it cannot be returned.  If you want to buy one of these it is worth a try but buy it somewhere that it can be returned easily if it breaks even under light use.  Replacement parts seem to be impossible to find.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair also.</li>
            <li> A great trimmer while it lasted. Much better than ones I&#x27;ve used previously. Unfortunately mine died after less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using beard trimmers for about 5 years. Out of the several brands I&#x27;ve tried -- Norelco, Remington, etc. -- this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across so far. It seems counterintuitive given the relative simplicity of the iStubble&#x27;s design: one long blade attachment with an automatic length adjuster. But it&#x27;s that simplicity I like about the product. It doesn&#x27;t leave me with a handful of \\&quot;heads\\&quot; to toggle on the device, and it gives me clear options as to how close I&#x27;d like my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The automatic length adjuster is one of the best features of the product. Because it&#x27;s built into the device, I don&#x27;t have to use a thumb measurement to mark out how close I want the blade to be to my skin. Your length options are .4mm to 5.0mm, so, again, this is a device for BEARD or MOUSTACHE wearers, not those who want a close shave. The length adjusting buttons are clearly marked and easy to manipulate, even while I&#x27;m shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single blade is long enough for necks and cheeks yet maneuverable enough to get to \\&quot;thinner\\&quot; areas such as sideburns and moustaches. I tend to go for a less manicured look in my beard, so I don&#x27;t mind the elongated blade, which inevitably leaves some thinner areas untended to. If you do want a short, compact blade to tend to all areas, you might want to check out a different device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my preferred look, the iStubble was a good purchase. I look forward to using it as my primary trimmer for several years to come.</li>
            <li> Decent product when new. I like the adjustable levels, and rarely cut my skin. However, the battery lifespan is too short, and now it won&#x27;t keep a charge and I need to keep it plugged in for it to work. Even then, when it hasn&#x27;t been plugged for long enough, it just shuts down. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer. Only difficulty is trimming mustache under nose. I like the variety of levels that can be chosen.</li>
            <li> The best beard trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li> I really like these clippers but there&#x27;s an annoying &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t like. Every time you turn them on they set to 0.4 and if you adjust them to a longer setting the clippers turn off and you then need to turn them on again. This happens every time you use them.</li>
            <li> If you want that designer stubble or that eternal 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, this is the product to buy. Yes, it is a little messy, and it requires a lot of care (no water, cleaning everytime, oiling, etc) but it is totally worth it. Now I just have to wet shave once every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> After 1 week this thing dosnt charge anymore. I shaved twice with it... waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;The two times that it worked, it worked well, be wary for I saw other reviews with people experiencing the same problem.</li>
            <li> Should support longer trim lengths but otherwise nice!</li>
            <li> Cheap and effective stubble trimmer. The blades come un-oiled and the trimmer head seemed jammed when I first turned it on ,like many have said. After oiling and working the blades a little with a toothpick the trimmer began to run just fine. So if your unit seems DOA , don&#x27;t fret the blades are most likely initially jammed like mine. Keep the blades well oiled and your unit charged for the cleanest trim.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work. defective.</li>
            <li> Does the job as advertised</li>
            <li> This item was a Christmas gift for my son-in-law, as far as I know he likes it.  I feel you can always trust Conair products.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how smoothly it trimmed my whiskers, and the efficient functionality of this fine trimmer.  After using it one time I found myself wondering how I ever got along without it.  I now look forward to grooming when before it was real drudgery, and I avoided it until it was completely necessary.  I absolutely recommend this trimmer to all men in the market for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Best thing I have ever purchased.  This literally has improved my life because I never spend money on razors and I can get a nice clean looking stubble quickly whenever I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem-ish is that I think the charger sucks and the battery is a little wonky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would repeat buy and would buy as a gift.</li>
            <li> I had no complaints. In fact, I really enjoyed it. Too bad it lasted only a year and then started falling apart. The plastic guard (that protects your face from the vibrating blades) is flimsy. I&#x27;m very careful with my items and everything else about this item is in great shape, but the plastic guard is very thin and after enough normal use it finally gave in and broke. I tried supergluing it, which prolong its use about another month until it broke again in the same place. Too bad.</li>
            <li> I have generally been very happy with Conair iStubble and this is the 3rd iStubble that I bought and have been using this for 4 years. However, the latest one I bought was made rather poorly. The plastic piece holding the spring that enables the cutting motion of the blades broke within a couple of uses and Conair was not able to replace the part. So now I am stuck with an almost brand new trimmer that won&#x27;t work because I can&#x27;t replace a 20c plastic piece.</li>
            <li> battery died after 4 - 6 months (didn&#x27;t get around to returning). Does not run plugged in, so if you are in a hurry you are out of luck. Finally got around to unscrewing everything to replace battery, but it was very glued in, including the connectors which ripped when I pulled out. Just not worth it</li>
            <li> I gave this to my son as a gift so I can only go by his reaction - he really liked it</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading many reviews; good and bad.  It works great.  I have had no issues with charging, holding a charge, shaving, trimming etc etc etc. causing me to seriously question why so many people seem to have so many issues.  Have used it daily for over 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of trimmers to get just the right stubble look, and I&#x27;ve finally found one that works!  This trimmer will shave as close as you could possibly want to (and still call it stubble).  I wish it had .1 increments between 2.0mm and 2.5mm, but nothings perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does make a pretty big mess.  All the shavings drop down, and get stuck in the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this shaver, and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It worked well for 1 day. After I charged it for 16 hours like it says, I pulled it out and tried it and was happy with the result. EVER SINCE that one time, no matter how long I charge it or leave it out for, if pull it off the charging cord it dies within seconds. It&#x27;s the worst. Do not buy this.</li>
            <li> Close and even grooming. Easy to clean and holds a charge. It picked up a bit of vibration but nothing a little tightening of two screws couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I bought it awhile back and never posted a review but this think just continues to perform without any hiccups. I would definetley recommend this. Buy it</li>
            <li> Product does exactly was it is meant to do with ease.  When cutting under the nose you have to turn the shaver side ways, but other than that excellent product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to shave down the hair on my arms. Luckily, that&#x27;s all I use it for as the battery usually dies before I&#x27;m done with one arm!</li>
            <li> Very good trimmer. I use the .4mm setting and it leaves a perfect amount of stubble. The cleaning could not be easier, the blade (and all the hair) is accessible by popping off the top guard, run the included brush through a few times and your done. Great product!</li>
            <li> I like the variability of the height and quality of the cut.  However, after 9 months the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge and won&#x27;t recharge when plugged in.  Still waiting to see how the return will be handled.  I&#x27;ll update, but at this point I couldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this device for a year following instructions carefully and by the book. One comment only: it is great!!! You take care of it and it will take care of you, is that simple. Just a few times you get de 110% of what is promised... this product is a 150%!</li>
            <li> I picked this up for my hubby to trim his beard.  It provided a nice even cut on his face.  I also used it to clean up around his ears and it worked well in that tight area.  The LCD display was a nifty little feature and my husband likes it because he&#x27;s so techy that way.  One feature that I preferred the most is that you are able to use it while it is charging.  So far, so good on the battery life.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other reviewers, I don&#x27;t do anything fancy with my shave. I just need a good, efficient, razor to give me a \\&quot;slightly more than stubble\\&quot; shave. So, the question: is this razor worth the money for those of us who just want a good, efficient, razor?    Don&#x27;t let the bells and whistles (which ARE VERY nice, by the way) fool you: this razor is truly worth the money. I&#x27;ve had several less expensive razors and they either didn&#x27;t cut very smoothly or were just a pain to use (coming, as they did, with their several plastic attachments that take up space and aren&#x27;t that easy to change). This razor not only gives a very smooth shave, but you can adjust lengths with a small push of a button (and see what setting you are on via its digital display, which is very convenient). Another (hidden) feature that I really like is the quick charge feature, which allows you to charge for only a few minutes on those days where you need a quick shave with a low or empty battery.     So, I&#x27;ve owned several less expensive razors, but always ended up less than satisfied. I&#x27;ve used this for about three weeks now and can easily say it is the best razor I&#x27;ve owned. The Conair istubble definitely gives you what you pay for! Great razor!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because of the good reviews wich said it was very smooth on the skin. Also the electronic length adjustment seemed nice.&lt;br /&gt;Looking at these things its perfect. Very smooth on the skin and the length adjustment works flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the bad stuff.....&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer seriously lacks power so even when i trim off like 1 or 2 mm and set it to 2 mm, it still struggles to get through.&lt;br /&gt;The result is that you have to go over the same spot over and over again so it takes ages to trim your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;Besides this, the battery is pretty bad. Combined with the fact that it takes a long time to get your whole face done this results in the battery sometimes being empty when your about 90% done (this is when it was fully charged when i started).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: after a few weeks of using this trimmer im on the lookout for a more powerfull machine with a better battery life.</li>
            <li> This item is the real deal. I have really thick facial hair that grows back quicker than I would like. Because of this I usually do not end up shaving since the hair is already too long by the time I get around to it. I have gone through countless trimmers and have been disappointed every single time, I&#x27;m actually surprised that I went out and bought another. I ran across the iStubble, read some reviews, and decided to try it. This trimmer is great, it&#x27;s quick, easy to use, has customizable size settings, and the battery lasts a ridiculous amount of time. MAKE SURE YOU CHARGE THE BATTERY COMPLETELY, THEN USE IT TILL IT DIES, THEN CHARGE IT AGAIN, DO NOT LEAVE IT ON THE CHARGER 24/7. And that is not advice for this trimmer in particular, it just promotes good battery health.</li>
            <li> This is a really great item and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t wait around to buy it. It does exactly what it says. I don&#x27;t find it makes a mess at all, and the way the trimmer contours to your face is great. I also have sensitive skin, but using it every day has not bothered my skin at all. The digital display is also very nice. It rarely has to charge, and I think you can use it even while it is charging if needed. All in all, with this device it takes literally less than 5 minutes to have the perfect length of stubble or short beard every day.</li>
            <li> The blade broke off the shaft that goes into the motor the second time it was used. It seems like this part is not designed very well.</li>
            <li> If you want controlled stubble.. Look no further</li>
            <li> the i stubble is a very good razor. The adjustable head make it easy to shave at every length. this product was recommended to me by a frien d and now I recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> Finally made the right purchase! I&#x27;ve been trimming my head for years now and have gone thru some trimmers. None of them I was really that impressed with until now. This one feels like it&#x27;s well built. Not all that plastic junk. What I love most about it is how close the shave is. .04mm As far as I know that&#x27;s the closest shave available for a facial trimmer. Love the LCD screen too.</li>
            <li> The ONLY trimmer my husband has ever used more than once.  He&#x27;s very picky and has only amazing things to say about this.  Did wish it held the length setting but it&#x27;s an awesome trimmer.</li>
            <li> Thus is my second one, first one had battery charge issues out of the box, I&#x27;ve tried all sort of other units this is only one the is easy comfortable and perfect SHORT stubble. Hopefully the battery on this one holds out longer then last but no other unit shave as close, easy and comfortable as this..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with the clippers cutting ability.  Unfortunately the pair I received does not hold a charge long enough to get through one trim session.  I have to use it while it&#x27;s plugged into an outlet.</li>
            <li> The iStubble barely deserves 3 stars due to the absolutely atrocious battery life. I&#x27;m still not sure how they engineered something that only lasts about 8 minutes after sixteen hours of charging, but Conair did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the battery life, the iStubble is pretty neat and does a great job with adjustable trimming. I wish it would have been a bit shorter - 0.4 was a bit longer than what I was looking for, but I ended up exchanging it for a Andis Styliner II that trims at .1mm. So if you want a non irritating and non-adjustable shave, check out the Styliner, but if you&#x27;d like an adjustable trimmer, the iStubble is pretty great ignoring the battery life.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m sure you can see from my reviews, we&#x27;ve owned our fair share of cordless trimmers over the years. What can I say? We use them a lot and wear them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be very, very disappointed if this trimmer wears out. Ever. It&#x27;s that nice.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quiet. So quiet that the first time I turned it on, I thought I hadn&#x27;t charged it long enough and it was dead. I thought for sure it would die at first contact with hair, but it is just that quiet. Much more discrete than previous trimmers I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;m convinced that the neighbors know when someone is shaving here in the summer with the windows open. Not a problem with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The adjustment is unique. You dial in the length you want, and it automatically raises the guard to the correct hair length. No more accidentally clicking the guard a notch too far and shaving a path in the wrong length. The display lights up, making it easy to read and adjust, even bleary-eyed first thing in the morning. It&#x27;s basically fool-proof. It has 3 buttons: On/Off, Up, and Down. You plug it in occasionally and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BEST feature, however, is the rinse-clean head. The guard flips open and rinses clean in just one pass under the sink. Then you snap the guard back shut and continue. You don&#x27;t have to worry about the depth changing mid-shave because you aren&#x27;t moving anything, just flipping the guard open to let the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;One caveat: Pay close attention to it&#x27;s name. It is the I-STUBBLE trimmer. The lowest the guard goes is .4, so if you want a close shave, this won&#x27;t do it. Not a deal-breaker for me, but I felt it was worth pointing out for those who might not realize this.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: as long as you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer that will leave behind hair, this will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> This product works great, the settings allow you to create a nice trim.&lt;br /&gt;Product allows you to do many styles of facial hair, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. I followed the recommendations for first charge and charging thereafter. But its life got noticeably shorter after just a month of so of maybe once a week use. It now wont charge enough to use and is useless after just 6-7 months of occasional use.</li>
            <li> I look much better with a 5&#x27;oclocker than I do with a full beard. I was looking for something that would deliver without being too expensive. I feel bad spending $50 on a groomer but this definitely delivers. I was surprised when I bought it I had grew out my beard for only a day that the 0.4mm actually trimmed anything down but it did. This is definitely a must buy for all who like to rock a 5&#x27;oclock shadow. When I started trimming against my face I noticed no tugging or pulling at all. Just smooth all over. I even have real fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love this thing where have you been all my life!!! This is the perfect tool for trimming your beard and the electric lift for the guard works great. Never could&#x27;ve expected better. Stop looking at other trimmers this is the alpha dog</li>
            <li> The shaver is easy to use and maintain and relatively quiet for an electric shaver. 4 stars rather than 5 because the battery doesn&#x27;t seem to hold its charge well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll need more time to evaluate this.</li>
            <li> Working good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend 4 times the beard to shave off all the hair. I can not as soft beard, but it is growing at a millimeter a day and every two days this razor saves me from irritation of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery holds about 40 minutes of continuous operation.&lt;br /&gt;Hair Trimmer leaves about 0.4 mm without cap and about 0.7 mm nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer trim the hair at the temples, making it even better than my tight beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removable blade. Each month there drip oil, which in the set. I do not know how durable it is. They write that the self-sharpening. But time will tell. That would be a complement to the trimmer some would put them! And stand for trimmer made â€‹â€‹normal. A power to the trimmer from the USB port.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought USA/EURO adapter only.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s obsessed. Cannot stop talking about how smooth it is - doesn&#x27;t catch his hair or rip any out. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> This was by far the best stubbler I have owned. No skin irritation and easy adjustments to trim my goatee, and leave a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on the rest of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it just failed in the adjustment. Now it jumps from .4mm to 5mm. It no longer serves its purpose and I have to decide if I buy a new one or move to a different brand. Maybe the GMT880 with manual adjustment would be better. By the way, it failed after 9 months of use, using it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to make a quick update on this item. Customer service from Conair was excelent. It took me only one phone call, and they sent me instructions on how to return. In a week I had a brand new trimmer. I hope this is the last review, because I have tried several trimmers and none as good as this one. I am still not putting five stars for the inconvenience of having to return it.</li>
            <li> My fiancÃ© has tried many trimmers, and couldn&#x27;t seem to find just what he wanted in one shaver, this one he love it had just about everything.. ..just wish it also had a smaller head too ..but great unit.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed many other reviews say this, so maybe I got a defective product or my beard just isn&#x27;t right for this trimmer, but it hurts like crazy and snags way too many hairs.  It cut some, but that doesn&#x27;t matter if it snags a dozen hair every time and feels like they&#x27;re being ripped out at the root (unexpectedly).  I tried cutting with my hair, against my hair, across my hair, every other direction and nothing worked.  The blades were oiled properly, the trimmer was charged sufficiently, I tried different lengths and it made me swear every single time I used it from the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very surprised that it&#x27;s received so many positive reviews, but be warned that this trimmer may hurt a lot more than you ever expected.  It&#x27;s going back and I never want to see it again.</li>
            <li> This is my second one after my first one is slowly dying after three years of almost everyday use. Adjustment height is made buy pushing the buttons and then it moves from point4 to 3point0 range. The guard pops up for easy cleaning, screen shows battery life and height. This has a solid motor that cuts beard hair smoothly with no bogging down like some other brands.</li>
            <li> By far, the end all-be all for trimming stubble. Very happy with this purchase- I look so hot now- wow! You gotta buy it.</li>
            <li> Works great, cuts very even and allows me to play with more lengths! starts at 0.4mm and goes up in increments of 0.2mm so you have more looks to play with.  My cruZer 6 goes from 1 to 3 and no in between.. all though the add shows 1-2-3-4-5-6mm settings...   If you are having trouble cutting under the nose I suggest watching the instructional videos on the website, it clears things up on proper use!  Would be nice if you could simply rinse off the excess hair on the blade like my cruZer 6, but I like the way this one cuts and feels while trimming.   The finish is cut more evenly, specially at lower lengths and for me thats a plus!  I would give it 4 simply because its not easier to clean then my Cruzer which requires a simple rinse under running water and a little oil from time to time, but after trimming with it I love the way my stubble looks and feels so I&#x27;ll give it a 5.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer,,, i use it maintain a good french beard,,, used it for a few weeks now,,, at the 0.4mm setting the beard is trimmed very fine,,,  has replaced my shaver for sure,,, also the ability to make sharp and neat shapes it just great</li>
            <li> I had used an identical trimmer for my beard for 5 years until the battery died and the clipper became too dull to comfortably cut hair. This new trimmer is the same as the old trimmer and works great with a sharp trimmer to comfortably cut beard hair.  Makes a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;The length adjustment is both easy to set and stays at the chosen length during usage.</li>
            <li> Use every day.  Good product.</li>
            <li> DOA. Showed as charging, did this for over recommended time, and voila...a dud. Nothing, literally nothing. Back to the scrap yard with this one.</li>
            <li> Despite the negative reviews I decided to give this a try... and to my delight it works GREAT! It does take some practice to get used to this trimmer and to cut evenly but it is possible with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addition after 4 years:&lt;br /&gt;After 4 years this trimmer is still going strong! Cuts well, battery still holds a charge and I&#x27;m still completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these, one for my hubby and one for my brother.  They both love them, and I love their tame beards lol! Win win!</li>
            <li> This is the best beard trimmer I have owned.  The ability to move the cutters up or down rather that changing plastic guards puts this trimmer in a class all by itself.  There may be others out there that do something like that but I haven&#x27;t seen them. The built in trim guard can easily be flipped back so that you can use just the bare cutters - this is great for getting around tight spots like around your nose.  The cool color LED display makes the unit look like a work of art.  I charged the trimmer about three weeks ago and still have half of the battery charge left.  Look, feel, application for purpose make this a first rate trimmer.  Do some research - I&#x27;ll think you&#x27;ll find a lot of other folks think as well of this unit as I.  The price is really good too!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to maintain my &#x27;longer than stubble but shorter than a beard&#x27; look. The digital length setting is nothing short than magical. Once you figure out what setting works best for your look, just keep going to it! I found it easy to trim my face, moustache and neck. I also find it very easy to clean. Some other reviews complained about the amount of hair that falls out of the trimmer. Well, I actually think it holds the trimmings a lot better than other trimmers I used.</li>
            <li> I bought this model because it seemed to cut shorter (4mm) than any other beard/stubble trimmer I could find at the time - and it DOES do that. I&#x27;ve had it for two years, I use it a few times a week and it&#x27;s still going. That&#x27;s the good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad - it is the LEAST waterproof grooming device I&#x27;ve ever owned. The blade can be run under water, but the rest of the model (especially around the electronic display) is highly vulnerable to water - I&#x27;m not talking about, running it under water or leaving it in a puddle of water on the sink - I&#x27;m talking about, if it&#x27;s in a toiletry bag with a wet toothbrush, it may not work the next time you use it. I&#x27;ve been on vacations, and wondered if this thing was fried because it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, or stopped mid-cut, and I didn&#x27;t have the charger with me. It does come back to life when it dries out - but with less and less life each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery on my model holds almost no charge - and it&#x27;s not designed so that, it can be unplugged, and then plugged in during use and it runs at full steam - if it&#x27;s not plugged in for at least a day before I use it AND when I&#x27;m using it, it&#x27;s a very weak cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a short length and can&#x27;t find anything else, go with this - but do not get ANYTHING wet besides the blade.  It is a very delicate flower.</li>
            <li> This was a great investment in my opinion, if you&#x27;re trying to get the after 5&#x27;oclock look or the few days without shaving look you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome.  It has very fine adjustments and keeps an even trim all over.  With other trimmers I had the problem of my whiskers \\&quot;laying down\\&quot; and the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t trim it.  This one works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s hard to trim above your upper lip close to your nose because of the design of the guard.  To solve this, simply flip the guard off and just do a careful trim using the blade.  I&#x27;m not very skilled, and even I get a consistent trim every time.  When you flip the guard off, there is a convenient notch so it \\&quot;locks\\&quot; in that position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with that slight negative comment, I still give it 5 stars for it&#x27;s performance.  Very good unit, and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> This product is truly great. It cuts through my coarse facial hair with ease.  the digital length gauge works flawlessly, and makes it very easy to get the exact same cut every time. The battery hold extremely well. I love this product and it will definitely be all of my buddies&#x27; christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li> As you know the clean-stubble look is in right now. I wanted a trimmer that would to give me that look. My current trimmer takes out too much hair and the attachment was too large for it cut any hair at all. I wanted something that&#x27;d replace my old trimmer. So in that sense Conair GMT900 iStubble Facial Trimmer was perfect. It has several settings between .02 to 5.00. I really liked the lengths between 1.60-2.00. I could keep my facial hair at a same length &amp;#34;every single day of the week!&amp;#34; as it advertised. But that&#x27;s where all the good things ended. It has no thin blade to clean out the edges and corners, or clean out the neck area. I&#x27;d to keep going back to my old trimmer to finish the job. Sure you can take out the attachment comb but that empty blade is not thin or sharp enough. Wish it came with a thin and narrow blade attachment, then I&#x27;d have kept it. It&#x27;s definitely not worth paying $50 just for one blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others here mentioned, it comes with a very specific first-time charging instructions. I followed it words for words. Even then the battery only lasted about 2 shave. By the 3rd one it was done. It&#x27;s not like it was running through a cat. I have very light hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flashy light, the digital screen and hardly flexible neck are all gimmicks and I feel like it costs extra for those. I&#x27;d recommend this if you don&#x27;t care about the price, and want that stubble look badly, and have a back-up good trimmer/razor to do the clean-up job.</li>
            <li> and this thing holds a charge like no other trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  somehow doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like others have.  I love the flip up blade cover that allows for mustache trimming.  does make a mess but that&#x27;s easy to deal with; I just shake the whiskers out in trash after each use.  a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a week and it&#x27;s probably the best shaving investment I ever made. Highly recommended, especially if it&#x27;ll be your first beard trimmer (as it was for me).</li>
            <li> 1- the battery lasts for 45 only as it take 3 hours to fill charge&lt;br /&gt;2- cant reach the mustache due to the big comb.&lt;br /&gt;3- work cordless only.&lt;br /&gt;4- the length adjust back to 0.4 if you leave the trimmer turned off for a minute or so. Make sure to check the length every time you turn off the trimmer or you will end up losing your beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 years since I bought the thing. Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t shave stubble that evenly. Furthermore, the battery used to be really good in the beginning (about 4-6 shaves worth) but after about a year or two really went down in quality (about 2 shaves-worth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads up, it takes a while to charge, so don&#x27;t think when the battery dies you can just quickly charge and then continue shaving.</li>
            <li> Great product.. Fast shipping, even to Hawaii. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I shaved my head when I retired for the easy care. Finding the right &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; for the job was not that easy! Purchasing conair was the perfect solution. Easy to use and settings give exactly what&#x27;s needed. Love it!</li>
            <li> So this was the perfect stubble trimmer you can find in the market and by far even is one. However the trim size automated adjuster stopped working after almost half a years usage. Its either 0.4mm or 5mm. Hence of no use anymore and i am not really accessible to customer care to ship the product back.</li>
            <li> Lots of reviews criticizing the battery life.  I did what the setup said and plugged it in prior to use.  In fact I plugged it in before I left for work around 7am and didnt use it for the first time until the following morning giving it a good first charge.  Has worked flawlessly since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life seems great to me. Generally a charge lasts me about 4 weeks but I also dont use it everyday but generally every other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant comment on the mustache problems.  My mustache sauce is weak therefore I havent had the issues others have had.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for 6 whole months - and then it stopped working.  Great new profit scheme by the wizards at Conair.</li>
            <li> Still going strong after 2 years. With regular maintenance and cleanings this thing is a work horse. This trimmer offers a very reliable shave for those going for a certain look, or a range of looks. It took me a few weeks to really get the hang of it and find what I like, but I haven&#x27;t looked back since.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works awesome! I was looking for something that gave me enough control to either trim a beard, make some short stubble, or just some clean up work with the facial hair and this trimmer does it all! It&#x27;s nice to have the digital control over the length so you can get a consistent trim each time you use it. The only thing to be careful of is that every time you turn the trimmer on, it goes back to the shortest setting, so make sure to adjust or else you&#x27;ll have a very short stubble!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also super easy to clean and keep clean.</li>
            <li> This item worked as advertised for a month. Unfortunately the comb (the part between the cutters and the skin, that determines the length of the cut) rests on really tiny plastic hinges, that brake easily. Currently I can still use this trimmer but only for the shortest setting (0.4mm).</li>
            <li> I think this is the best trimmer I have had. I am going for the &amp;#34;sexy stubble&amp;#34; look, and I like all the different height settings on this device. I usually turn it to 3.5mm for the length I want. The battery holds a charge for a long time and has never died on me mid trim (my old trimmer didn&#x27;t have a battery indicator and would leave me hanging all the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have about this device is that the trimer guard is not removable, which means you can&#x27;t really do any edging with this device (if it does come off and someone knows how, please let me know!)</li>
            <li> The trimmer was great, infact the best trimmer I ever used. Unfortunately it has stopped working within just 4 months. Now looking back the purchase seems like a waste of money.</li>
            <li> In general, this trimmer gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be careful to hold it parallel to whatever surface of your face/neck you are working on, or you will get an uneven trim.  Unless you are very careful, you will end up \\&quot;scalping\\&quot; areas like your chin and jaw line.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well on your mustache area and it&#x27;s hard to get a stubble look there. Finally, it keeps losing its setting when it&#x27;s swtiched off for a more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this negative stars if I could. I received a defective item and am very disappointed. It would not turn off after charging, and once fully charged, I could only get it to operate for about 3 minutes before it died. I definitely received a dud. For the 3 minutes it did operate, it was not very consistent with its trimming and it was very hard to trim areas under the nose and sideburns. Cleaning is a bit messy because of how the guard is attached to the unit, so tiny hairs go everywhere if you aren&#x27;t careful. To add insult to injury, travel precluded me from returning this within the policy window so I&#x27;m out $40. It&#x27;s a good idea, just terrible execution.</li>
            <li> It does what it needs to do. It definitely has it&#x27;s short coming, though it&#x27;s definitely expected with it&#x27;s price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Has a good weight in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t need different length extensions, you can automatically set the trimmer to the length you want.&lt;br /&gt;Has a bright LCD display with the length of the extension and the battery life.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fool proof, barely requires any set up or instructions to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;There is much to be desired in battery life, it&#x27;ll last approximately 12 minutes on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rather hard to follow the contours of a face since the extension is rather large and cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning of the trimmer is somewhat of a pain since the extension doesn&#x27;t come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the price it is, though it&#x27;s definitely far from blowing its competition out of the water. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap beard/stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li> After a bunch of researching Men&#x27;s mags and sites...I went with this one, and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. A very close shave also if needed. I like stubble, but not long stubble...and this one did even more than I expected (by far) the first time I used it. It also charges VERY fast. I think it took 15 min for a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one definitely had the shortest length I could find. In fact, it&#x27;s shortest setting is even too short for me.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!!.....a trimmer that does what it says. Extremely satisfied with the product. Gives a clean, easy, and even trim every time, leaving me with the perfect stubble. Thank you conair, you&#x27;ve finally put my endless hours spent shopping for and trying for the perfect trimmer to rest.!</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about. All it does is cut your beard to a desired length, and that is it.  You cannot trim your beard with it nor shape it, you need a different type of trimmer to do that.  Again all you get with this is the desired length. And that is it.</li>
            <li> I like the idea, but it just does not work as the advertisement would like you to believe. I wish Con air put more time into researching ways to improve this product rather than spend money selling the \\&quot;Super Hot Model attracted to the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow guy\\&quot; that you see on the advertisements for this product.&lt;br /&gt;It usually takes me around 6 days to have an absolutely full 37th hour beard, so I like to keep it around a number 3 or 2.5. Everything works fine, but when it comes time to trim the Chin or Go T area, the closeness of the razor Buzzes it to a near 0.5 Looking at the LCD Screen, it still says 3.0, but when you get close to the actual chin area, it definitely without a doubt buzzes it to a near 0 or 0.5 -- What you have left is a disappointing ruined shave, and for men that take a lot longer to grow beards, it is definitely a momentum killer.&lt;br /&gt;If anybody has advice on how to avoid this problem please let me know, but I thought the Length setting should make this a mistake that should never happen.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this item. It was listed as a facial trimmer, but it should of said hair trimmer. Work okay on most of my face I can&#x27;t use it under my nose since it has a plastic guard. If you are looking for a beard/ facial trimmer I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This product broke after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on my stubble.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this trimmer, is that you can not remove the upper part of razor to skin type trimming, it is always going to have the blade on it which will have a minim of couple of mm length. The other bad part is that you only are limited to certain hight which in the longest still cut the hair very short (5mm)</li>
            <li> I love the way that the blade adjusts through the buttons and has a digital display for the length setting.  This is MUCH better than the typical plastic clips that you get with other trimmers and that sometimes change while you&#x27;re shaving!  The razor is very powerful and the flexible head had no trouble taking 5 days of beard down to .5mm in a single pass.&lt;br /&gt;If this is as durable as it appears, it could be my best beard trimmer purchased over the last 20+ years.</li>
            <li> This thing is perfect for me. I used one already until if crapped out and then bought a second. I like that there are no separate attachments. It is all built right in. Good adjustability for length.</li>
            <li> This is a great stubble trimmer.  Battery life is very long, and the length changes are simple and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside is that it is not an all-in-one trimmer.  It has difficulty around my mustache area and in tight spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a stubble trimmer, buy it.  If you&#x27;re looking for one shaver that will replace all your others, then this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a wonderful trimmer that had many length settings. After I followed the instructions about charging it properly, I tested it out. While reading the instructions it noted that you may experience pulling and that it is completely normal. I can honestly say the pulling is NOT normal. I was very unsatisfied with the product and it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> No complaints. Long battery life. Ability to leave very short stubble. No pain, no skin irritation, no hair pulling. I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a stubble expert, I&#x27;ve been wearing one for almost a decade, having tried numerous trimmers.  This one is actually very good, it glides along easily, and gives a consistent shave once you get the hang of it.  Some people think it&#x27;s hard to get under your nose, but I don&#x27;t think so.  You just have to get up in there and make a bit of a funny face.  I use this one for my stubble now, instead of an old Wahl that has the plastic trimmed low to achieve stubble.  The Wahl is super durable, so now I use the wahl just for shaping sideburns, and I use this for the stubble.  One thing to be careful of, is that when you first turn it on, it doesn&#x27;t save your settings from last time, so you could potentially shave off your mustache by accident.  Also, the millimeter settings are not going to give you an actual length of beard in millimeters.  I find that the 1.6 setting is what actually gives me the desired look.  Then I switch to 1.4 along the edges of the stubble, to give it a bit of a fade.  The thing is great.  Any stubble trimmer will take a little bit of practice to get a perfectly even shave, you&#x27;ll notice that some areas of your face you&#x27;ll have to shave in a different direction, and some areas a little harder push than others.  Overall, it works well and it works comfortably.</li>
            <li> They stopped selling this trimmer in stores, so I had to buy online. But it&#x27;s worth it--I won&#x27;t use any other trimmer!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS! It works okay, but not great, and then after just two months it broke. What a waste of money. I should get a full refund on this ripoff of a product.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever had.  Works great for stubble and to trim.</li>
            <li> This is my second i-Stubble.  Old one lasted about 2 years.  I think its the best one out there.</li>
            <li> Spoiled in 3 months, worst product. Issue started with blade working only on extreme end of blade size range i.e on 0.4 mm and 5 mm, all other in between sizes were not settable as blade movement is machine driven. Second issue started when machine was not even charging. Tried everything but it was dead.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed with product specially considering that I order it from Amazon US and got it delivered in Singapore, so huge wastage of money.</li>
            <li> This works quite well when the battery is good.&lt;br /&gt;My iStubble&#x27;s battery lasted for 3 months and then went dead.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a headache to get them to change it in Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a corded form of operation, then you&#x27;d better have a hell of good battery, not one that dies in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Works well. I have a short beard and the 5mm setting is perfect. If you want a longer beard this razer is not for you.</li>
            <li> It Stunk with a capital &amp;#34;S&amp;#34;.  Dud batt.  Never ran past 60 seconds no matter how long it was charged. Throwing it in the garbage was worth one star. You must have had this in your inventory since invented. R. Martin</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s adjustable and all, but I&#x27;ve owned it for just over a month and the battery is COMPLETELY dead. Won&#x27;t hold a charge, and won&#x27;t even work while plugged into the wall. And I guess it&#x27;s also non-refundable. I will never buy another one. And I DO NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to fight off razor bumps for 6-7 years using a variety of different electric razors. Traditional blades were always harmful to me as they delivered too close of a shave and contributed to more razor bumps. Rotary razors did not help either for similar reasons. Dermatologists recommended against those close shaves. However, I had difficulty finding an electric razor that would shave evenly at specific lengths, and at an affordable price. After I stumbled upon a online video review of the Conair, I opted to give it a shot. It works great, just as advertised. Fantastic product. I look forward to using it for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have used. Worth the extra money. Gotta let it charge a full 24 hours before first use.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer to happen to me. I have a collection of 4 other trimmers and none come close to how even and clean the trim looks with the I-Stubble. Iâ€™ve only had it for a day so I can&#x27;t vouch for the battery or product longevity. so far its great!!</li>
            <li> had issues with this right off the bat. I felt like it wasn&#x27;t trimming at the measurements it said and then had problems getting the guide comb to stay in place. I used it for too long to even bother trying to return it or get a replacement. The search continues......</li>
            <li> Amazing. State of the art!</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t grow a beard and your about to give up ever trying again, give this one a shot before you decide. It&#x27;s nice for that sexy stubble.</li>
            <li> awkward to use,bad for long beard plugs and you have to pull the head up its pain and its slowwww compaired to old cheap norelco</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use. Does a very even job, but you have to go over your beard in a couple of directions. Only knock I&#x27;d give is that it doesn&#x27;t retain the last height setting from previoius use. It goes to the closest setting by default.</li>
            <li> After three years (almost to the day), I can no longer charge my shaver. The connections inside the unit will not make the connection.</li>
            <li> I researched a LOT of &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; type of beard shavers that would give that perfect scruff, 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.  I decided on this one and have been using it ever since.  Got it last year at some (?) point.  I use it every 2-3 days and it has many settings, including  a 0.4 setting that gives you a really CLOSE trim, yet leaves just enough there to give you &amp;#34;that look&amp;#34;.  Many other trimmers don&#x27;t go down as low as the 0.4 setting.  A charge usually lasts me 5-6 shaves if not more. Durable.  Affordable. Vendor had quick delivery.  Buy one, as I tried many others first, and am pleased with this one</li>
            <li> Actually does trim close enough to give a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, shaved stubble never looks quite as good as actually grown stubble - but it is as close as I have yet found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now.  Works surprisingly well.  Probably the best stubble razor on the market.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. I wind up using it between 2.0 and 3.0 but you can take it in .2 increments all the way down to a ridiculously low ,8. Completely smooth, it doesn&#x27;t pull at all. Very comfortable and accurate.</li>
            <li> This is a comparison of Conair i-Stubble vs Philips Norelco QT4014/42. I have both. Conair is a better trimmer from perspective of trimming dynamics. It simply cuts your facial hair better than the Phillips. I feel like I can trim with just a couple passes in a very controlled manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives about the Conair is that it is a little more flimsy than the Phillips. My first i-Stubble had a bad battery and died within a week. I contacted Conair and they replaced it with a new unit immediately. Since then I had ZERO issues with i-Stubble. The other negative is that the power button on the unit is very easy to press. So not really realistic to travel with i-Stubble in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros of the Phillips is that it is sturdier than Conair. Better for traveling. No way to accidentally bump the slide switch on the Phillips. The battery also lasts for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, use Conair for at home. Take Phillips on the road. However, if I were to have just one, I would stick with the Conair. Just trim before you travel and don&#x27;t pack a trimmer, or pack the charger for the Conair in case you activate the power button by accident inside your luggage.</li>
            <li> You press a button and the screen tells you the length in millimeters your facial stubble will be.  No more guessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s super light and 110 to 220 V so I can bring it with me international.</li>
            <li> I like the trimmer and would buy another one if this ever went bad. I just wish the trimmer had higher setting for long beards.</li>
            <li> so far i love it. very comfortable consistent soft shave. doesnt ever pull or pinch me. does not shave VERY close but i dont want it to anyway</li>
            <li> This trimmer is AWESOME!  I bought it for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it!  I recommend it highly if you&#x27;re looking for a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> I charged the trimmer for 16 hours as soon as I took it out of the package.  When I turned it on the battery immediately went dead,  so I plugged it in and turned it on. The clippers made a loud noise and were seized up. Don&#x27;t buy!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good, but it goes back to original setting every time you turn it on, instead of staying at the setting the was set up by user.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the product and its ease of use. It works exactly as intended and is not hard to operate. The only flaw is that the product does not come initially charged and takes around 1 hour of charging before it can be used. Also it is recommended to charge the product for 16 hours before initial use which disappointed upon initial opening of the product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay charged and won&#x27;t even work plugged in. I read and charged the product according to directions and it is horrible.  I would never buy this product again and would avoid any Conair product due to the lack of quality in design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing doesn&#x27;t even work!</li>
            <li> On the shortest level it starts cutting into your skin. This makes the use of the device very unpleasant. Additionally I think that the battery life is a joke. I definitely made a mistake buying this device.</li>
            <li> After the initial 16 hour charge everything is fine.</li>
            <li> No complaints with this product.  does a good job, cuts even,  multiple length settings without  multiple  clips too attach, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> From day one this trimmer was a pain to use and gave a very inconsistent length trim.  It took way too many passes to get a good look. The bottom blade broke off in less than than two months. Other than a waste of money, it felt good to throw the thing away.</li>
            <li> This razor glides smoother than any razor I&#x27;ve owned.  The description, \\&quot;Its floating, contoured head tracks the curves of your face for exceptional accuracy and comfort\\&quot; is an understatement.  The length control is incredibly granular, down to .4mm (in .2mm increments)!  The trimmer doesn&#x27;t remember your length setting between uses, but that&#x27;s a minor inconvenience.  Even at the lowest setting, it has no issues or snags when trimming the normally-difficult areas around the upper lip or chin.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.This was the second one i&#x27;ve bought.&lt;br /&gt;If there was a rubberized grip of some sort I would give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Of course if it had a less slippery grip, I wouldn&#x27;t have dropped the first one and had to replace it with this one!</li>
            <li> Wanted to try a &#x27;stubble&#x27; approach and found this product to really stand out.  It&#x27;s awesome for quick shaves in the morning and provides some detailer settings to get more involved beard / facial hair styles.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price, very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an iStubble trimmer for a couple years (bought at KMart) and it is far and away better than any other other beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, including Norelco and Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference between this and everything else is how you select the length.  No pile of attachments for each length; just select the length on the screen and go.  The ability to select lengths in 0.2 to 0.5mm increments is incredible.  That&#x27;s millimeters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently use 4.5mm on my mustache and 3.5mm for the rest of the beard.  It&#x27;s a unique look that looks great and can&#x27;t be done with any other beard trimmer.  Nothing else is that precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that it&#x27;s a couple years old the connection for the charger is getting loose so I have to play with it to get it to charge the battery.  I think I&#x27;ll just get another one in case this one dies.</li>
            <li> horrible customer service...do not buy</li>
            <li> I shaved my head almost 10 years ago and have been searching for a good electric face &amp; head razor ever since. I HAVE FOUND IT! This product is excellent. I used it this morning for the first time and shaved my head and face in 5 minutes leaving a perfect 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I was beginning to think this would never be possible without taking 30 minutes and leaving patches all over my face. Make sure to follow directions and charge completely before using and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Very good trimer with long time batteries!!! Good for body shave and all!! Best trimer i ever have with low price</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer about 1.5 years ago and was happy first few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After few months i cant control ultra-precise length settings . But its ok i still used it choose between 0.2 or 5. (only 2 options)&lt;br /&gt;After 1y need to charged the trimmer once i want to use it, because the battery is discharged. but it still ok..i shave only once for a week.&lt;br /&gt;Now... the razor mechanism is spoiled. The spring which hold two parts of razor together is broken.&lt;br /&gt; I regret that i bought this trimmer now.</li>
            <li> just a great trimmer for keeping it short.....or very short.  excellent range of lengths.  good battery.  stays charged even when not used for a week or so</li>
            <li> Update 6/3: I sent the trimmer back in exchange for a replacement. The new one is like being touched by an angel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you like to inflict pain upon your face as form of trichotillomania? If so, this is the trimmer for you. If you prefer a slightly less intense shave, I would look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this trimmer I plugged it in and let it charge for 18 hours as per the manual. When it came time to use it, I turned it on, dialed it down to 0.4mm, and started running it against the grain on my face, as the manual recommends. Holy **** that hurts! I believe Conair has developed some new shaving technology whereby hairs are violently ripped from your face rather than being cut. This has been proven to increase alertness in the morning using intense agony to really wake you up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The least painful way to trim with this device is to move it at a snail&#x27;s pace. By the time you&#x27;re done you&#x27;ll be sweating profusely and shaking violently in trepidation - this method reduces but does not eliminate the number of pulled hairs. You&#x27;ve got to live a little, you know? Only people leading boring, sedentary lives want a facial trimmer without that extra stimulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a little bottle of oil which I applied to the blades as directed, but to really get that wake-up call in the morning I&#x27;m considering leaving them out in the elements to get them nice and rusty. That&#x27;s what they feel like already, and I think they should look the part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual states the comb part can be snapped back to allow for easier cleaning of the blades. When I did this the blades fell out along with a spring. The manual has a diagram of the device, but said diagram doesn&#x27;t show the blades or how they fit back in. I&#x27;m usually pretty good at assembling things, but I can&#x27;t currently figure out how the two blades and the spring fit back in Satan&#x27;s trimmer. With the trimmer out of commission, my face has stopped violently shaking for the first time since I originally laid the fiery hand of Satan that is the iStubble against my cheek.</li>
            <li> I have a love- hate relationship with the iStubble. I love it because it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Without any question. I hate it because I&#x27;ve gone though 5 in a year that have just stopped working. Yet I need it and there&#x27;s no better one out there</li>
            <li> Perfect for all facial and other needs. 20 out of 10 from this person.</li>
            <li> battery never charged</li>
            <li> Not flexible to use at all.  Leaves horrible patches as it can&#x27;t get to a lot of spots.  Just a cheap product all around.  So disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> the spring holding the break broke. did not even last 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of body/face groomers and this one appears to have fit the bill.  My main goal was to look for something that could maintain a stubble look of about a 3-5 days worth of growth.  The conair does this perfectly and is pretty precise and accurate down to a couple mm.  You can choose different length increments on the led screen and the head shelf adjusts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would have received 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for two issues.  1. It doesn&#x27;t save your last shave setting.  I wish it would keep that in some sort of memory on the device so that I don&#x27;t have to remember what length it was when I last used it.  Minor detail but one that I wouldn&#x27;t mind being added.  2.  the battery life sucks.  You can get 2, maybe 3 shaves out of it and then you need to charge it up.  Again, not a huge issue but if I&#x27;ve had it die on me in the middle of a shave a couple times and its just annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get past those two minor issues then buy this product, it does a very good job maintaining that stubble look.</li>
            <li> Does a good job trimming my beard. I am new to facial hair and had never used a trimmer before. I decided to buy theConair because of the name. I have used their clippers for my hair before and like them. So I bought these and am satisfied. I have used them a handful of times and they work. They are also easy to clean. The highest setting is a 5 which may not be high enough for someone with a longer beard. I have almost 2 weeks worth of growth and I use 4.5.</li>
            <li> Had to watch a video on how to use it because of the awkward design but was happy with the results. But alas, the 3rd time using the iStubble, I couldn&#x27;t finish my shave because the battery died halfway through (about 5 minutes). This was after it charged for two days. I read alot of good reviews on this product so I decided to try it and it does give a good shave so maybe I just got a faulty one. It doesn&#x27;t matter how good though, if it can&#x27;t hold a charge or be plugged in during operating. I don&#x27;t really feel like going through contacting the seller or Conair and paying to ship it back and hoping the next one works better. I thought this one was a winner but it looks like my search continues..</li>
            <li> As a dude who never completely shaves his face, I&#x27;m constantly balancing a variety of trimmers, edgers, etc. to try and keep my  stubble maintained in a comfortable fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 10 year old trimmer was dying, so I tried this and the [[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro]]. I was so impressed with this one, I returned the Norelco before ever opening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, there are some strong points as well as a few weak points to consider before buying this trimmer. If you&#x27;re cool with the downsides, you&#x27;ll likely really enjoy owning this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;+Cuts smoothly and evenly&lt;br /&gt;+Super easy to adjust length setting&lt;br /&gt;+Can *sort of* put edges on your sideburns if you want (this feature is an obvious afterthought, but at least it&#x27;s included)&lt;br /&gt;+Get quite a few trims (at LEAST 5) between charges&lt;br /&gt;+Has a battery life indicator, which is such a basic feature but lacking on most trimmers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;-Definitely not for tight places -- right under your nose gets tricky and I pull out another trimmer for those few hairs&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve only used the length settings between .4mm and 1.4mm. Honestly, I see very little difference between these settings even though they&#x27;re 5 steps away. The only thing I notice is that longer than about 1mm makes it hard to catch all the hairs growing in different directions. I always end up coming back later to snip a few awkward ones that I missed earlier. Therefore, I generally stick to .4mm-1mm settings.&lt;br /&gt;-Requires oiling of blades and has a few nooks and crannies that are tricky to clean (I used compressed air which makes it easy, but not clean around my sink!)&lt;br /&gt;-Has caught on hairs around my chin area on a few occasions. Get used to using short, quick, gentle strokes and this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, there are some negatives. But having a trimmer that can adjust to different lengths without a drawer full of attachments is really nice. Plus, it&#x27;s surprisingly hard to find a trimmer that can cut evenly, quickly, and comfortably at lengths down to .4mm. For me, these features made it a keeper.ttachments is really nice.

            <li> Good trimmer. Beware though if you want that stubble look you are probably going to want to be in the 1.4-2mm range. Anything less really doesnt look like you have stubble, just looks like you are not a good shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus: Pain to clean up Trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;Plus: Can really trim down to short lengths. I mean really really short.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least half a dozen beard trimmers that claim to go down to 1mm or less, but this is the first one that actually does it well!  I can get a great 5 o&#x27;clock shadow without patchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They advise you start long and go shorter till you reach a length you&#x27;re happy with, and this is good advice.</li>
            <li> This thing makes me sad. When it works, it delivers as promised. I&#x27;ve never liked a trimmer or a trim better. But damn! It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge; need to be plugged in for hours on end every time I want to use it! Also, YOU CANT USE IT PLUGGED IN. You must recharge it for it to work. I was hoping that it would at least work while it was connected to the outlet, but no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a grandiose promise that teeters on edge.</li>
            <li> The trim is great, but it won&#x27;t make you breakfast... I bought this product because the alternative is the &amp;#34;Mangroomer&amp;#34; which has features named &amp;#34;Scruff Sculptor&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Whisker Belly&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Power Burst&amp;#34;. Even worse, these feature names appear to be individually trademarked. I just want to trim my &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34;, thanks. The iStubble is also a stupid name, but not quite as bad. It works great for my patchy face, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a lumberjack. Read the instructions - charge it for 16 hours before first use. I have yet to experience any battery or reliability issues. It&#x27;s not ideal right under the nose, but nothing is. A travel bag would be nice. I found a little bag for it, but now I have nothing to put my synthetic urine in. Buy it.</li>
            <li> My husband had one of these before a really liked it. After about a year the battery stopped charging. We found this one at a good price and once it arrived we charged it for 24 hours. It would not hold a charge long enough to use. Had to send it back. Not sure if this one was just a dud or there is a problem with the batteries in all of them. My husband liked how it worked but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I had the old model (which I finally broke after a few years of use). I loved the old one but the new one is even better. Nothing else compares.</li>
            <li> i bought this based on reviews but was very disappointed. was quite loud and my facial hair wasn&#x27;t long at all and it would barely cut and just pulled out my hair. very uncomfortable. all in all really not a great item.....</li>
            <li> I have a light stubble.  The lowest setting did absolutely nothing.  Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Bought this for my bf and he loves it. Did intense research and this seemed really worth it. Not overtly expensive and has a flexible head that really hugs the contours of a face. You can remove the case to reveal a sideburn trimmer. Couple of downsides: no mechanism to catch all the hair and trimming the satche is a tad difficult.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even use the clippers yet.. but when the box got here the oil was opened inside and spilled all over everything. So now my first use of the i-Stubble might be a little more slippery than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> I tried both the Philips Norelco Vacuum stubble trimmer and the Conair iStubble and I felt the iStubble was far superior. The device has a much safer trimmer guard which allows you to glide the device across your skin with little risk of nicking yourself. It also cuts very short (way shorter than Philips) and gets a more consistent length cut. I&#x27;d also consider this a true stubble trimmer whereas the other device was more of a short beard trimmer. This one has a floating head, which means it moves to the contours of your face and makes the whole process a lot easier. They also include a handy little brush for cleaning it after use and mineral oil for lubricating the blades. The iStubble charges very quickly and keeps its charge longer than the Philips device. I have very dense, thick facial hair and this one is able to managed it easily to maintain it at a true stubble length (1mm and shorter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this device and only wish I could return the other for a full refund. Unfortunately both Philips and Amazon make it a hassle so I&#x27;ll just give it away.</li>
            <li> It work really well. The shipping was fast .  This is exactly what i was looking for. im hoping to see how long it will last  its  a little hard to trim nose hair and upper lip</li>
            <li> it is good but it is limited to how much it can trim. it is hard to do under the nose</li>
            <li> Its the best trimmer i have used till date. Very easy to calibrate to ones specific need, gives a good finish.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that you have to reset the height every time you turn it off.  Trimming under nose pretty hard for this trimmer, almost need another for mustach</li>
            <li> As a black male with ingrown hair issues, these trimmer really help. Being able to adjust the length of the trimmer, and having the comb guard, helps me get close to my skin with the least irritation possible. once you find the proper length , its smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> This did not work out of the box, and the lubricant had spilled out of its container and all over the package, making a mess. I do not recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> This product has been great so far. Very easy to adjust settings for different heights, and the guard goes with the contour of your face.</li>
            <li> My husband has not been able to adjust the levels, so he&#x27;s still using his old shaver most days, and this one only 1-2x/week.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This device is impressive!  Beautiful in appearance, larger than it looks, sleekly designed, and very well built. In performance it is head and shoulders above any other trimmer I have ever seen or used.  Feels like it should cost three times as much as it does. I recommend without reservation.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer and I have had it for about 3 months and no problems whatsoever! I love how easy it is to change the settings. Who ever invented this is awesome. Exactly what I was looking for! I think people don&#x27;t like it because they don&#x27;t know how to use it!. Ive never been cut or even close, you have to be a douche bag if you ever cut yourself!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even turn on after 16 hr charge cheaply made, junk.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a couple of months, using it weekly. The removable clip broke during the normal cleaning process, support (generally horrible as well) refused to help saying I somehow voided the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to an older/cheaper/simpler electric razor and I actually prefer it. I must&#x27;ve convinced myself that this fancy adjustable digital display one was better, but it really just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a week and then did not function anymore. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Seems to be a great stubble trimmer but I couldn&#x27;t seem to get it at short as I wanted it.</li>
            <li> Works great, even trim</li>
            <li> Conair makes a good product.  I&#x27;ve been using this little gem for almost a year now, and so far, haven&#x27;t had any issues.  Yes, you WILL make a mess. There&#x27;s nothing to catch all the shavings, so you have to wipe the sink off every time you shave.  That&#x27;s really the only downside though.  I&#x27;m pleased with this little guy.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most frustrating trimmer I have every used. Every time I turn it on after it has been off for at least 10 minutes (i.e. every morning) it resets to 0.4mm trim length and has to be changed back to the correct setting. I&#x27;ve had at least a couple of mornings where I trimmed too short because of this horrible feature. The battery icon just scrolls continuously between no charge and fully charged while in operation (and unplugged) so there is absolutely no way of knowing when it actually needs to be charged until it dies mid trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It trims fine but it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works really well ...but ...it will not hold any charge for cordless shaving.  I have to plug it in every time I shave.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying the idea of getting this product came about as a simpler way to look clean in college without taking as much time to shave. The idea of a trim taking about a maximum of only 1-2 minutes in a shared dormitory really appealed to me. So, in mid-late December I asked for this as a present for Christmas and if I was to be honest it does everything necessary as a trimmer for a fantastic price.  There are a ton of settings, but I personally use a .4 or .6 because it takes longer for unnecessary stubble to grow in the trimmed hairs place. It usually (like above) takes about 2-3 minutes of just making sure I went over every area to have a complete shave and its cleanup is rather easy by just blowing the hairs off of the trimmer and using the provided brush to clean underneath. You are even able to disconnect the razor attachment and get under there if deemed necessary.  After over three months, it is still holding up well. I cannot say that I use this everyday but 1-3 times a week. I have no problem saying that I believe this could take a daily use easily. The charge lasts an extremely long time and will provide many uses.  Now for the negative parts/recommendations: The only negative thing I have to say is this trimmer excels at cleaning 85% of your face if used correctly, but struggles at getting the hairs even under the nose because of the bulky head. You can flick the trimmer up and use it like an electric razor but it has no guide to guarantee length. That is why one star is missing.  Recommendation: Buy the trimmer, it&#x27;s worth it because of how low it&#x27;s price is. I bought mine at a different retailer for about $4-5 less than listed now. MAKE SURE you follow the directions for the initial charge up (which is 11-12 hours), and that you hold the razor correctly. The first time I went to try this I held it upside down and thought this was a bust. The LED part of the razor should be facing up if going against the grain.  Thanks, Tom   EDIT: 3/8/15- I still use the trimmer two to three times a week for a quick trim in college. The charge still holds for an extremely long time before I have to recharge. There&#x27;s been some complaints about it taking a long time for adjusting to whatever measurement is necessary to shave... let me tell you, it takes a maximum of 3 seconds to adjust to your desired level. At this point people are being nitpicky. I hope to have this for quite a while and would REBUY following the success I have had. -Tom</li>
            <li> It works ok.  Wish I didn&#x27;t have to run it over the same spots over and over again.  Hard to do under my nose as well</li>
            <li> One of the best beard trimmers you will buy.</li>
            <li> Great item.  My previous razor died and I saw this one.  I was trying to find a razor that would give a good scruff look but I didn&#x27;t have a lot of luck.  This one went all the way down to .4mm where my previous one only went to 1mm.  This goes even shorter than I was looking for.  It is a very smooth cut and glides over the face.  The only negative is there is no way to catch the hair which just means a little more clean up but it is well worth it for the cut.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews for this and made the purchase given the high rankings.  I need precision with a trimmer for my stubble look and most \\&quot;manual\\&quot; trimmers so not offer the level of lengths I need.  Previously I had a Remington MB4550.  It, like the iStubble is a precise electronic moving head with LCD display for length. I used it for 1 year before it totally malfunctioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this unit seems to be good.  One problem.  The unit seems to arbitrarily reset back to .4mm if it sits for 5-10 minutes (not on the charger - on the charger it resets right away after a cut). Is this unit supposed to do that?  I would think this would remember your last setting.  This seems to be a poor design.  Has anyone else experienced this?</li>
            <li> This trimmer does all it promises. Just watch out when, it will jump to it&#x27;s lowest setting (0.4mm) each time you start it up again, after charging. Just happened to me, trimmed normally at 4.0 this morning started trimming with setting 0.4 and of course had to do the rest that way. Learned the hard way, I guess!</li>
            <li> Amazing little shaver, great battery life once broken in, easy to clean and cuts very short. I also love the fact that it is so easy to adjust the cutting height. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband on father&#x27;s day hoping it would be a good replacement for his dying wahl beard trimmer.  It does have a lot of nice features and does work well to give a nice even shave, however it doesn&#x27;t seem to get very close, even on the lowest setting.  He likes very short stubble, and this one seems to be a big on the long side for stubble, definitely not as close as the wahl used to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price range it has a lot of nice features, and looks great with good battery power, but it just seems to be a bit dissapointing that for the one reason I bought it, it does not perform as great as we would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t need very short stubble, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have found this product to be even better than I expected. The i-Stubble is able to cut my facial hair very short and give me the &amp;#34;one-day look&amp;#34; without any problem. I have never been cut after months of usage. In addition, the battery life is fantastic as I only have to to charge it once every couple of weeks (I shave with the i-Stubble every other day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no had any of the battery issues that other consumers have had. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Does what it is meant to do. Takes patience if you have coarse hair like i do. It tends to miss a few hairs here and there.</li>
            <li> Good razor, but doesn&#x27;t work great on longer beards.</li>
            <li> I have lost this razor 3 times now in hotels, airport security lines (fell out of my bag). I really like the razor but I can&#x27;t justify another purchase. It&#x27;s all digital, it let&#x27;s you choose the the adjustments by milometer and it&#x27;s usable for just about everywhere hair grows with a couple exceptions. I can&#x27;t really get my mustache area as well as I can get everything else, it&#x27;s always a little longer. and the neck it&#x27;s always that easy either but still the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Great budget trimmer, after 2 years of daily use the plastic guide snapped so deducted a star for durability but besides that it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!  I HAVE ORDERED THREE (3) OF THESE AND NONE OF THEM HAS HELD A CHARGE - AFTER THE REQUIRED INITIAL 16 HOUR CHARGE PERIOD.  UNLESS YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO WITH YOUR TIME THAN ORDER AND RETURN NON-WORKING RAZORS, FIND AN ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;THREE NON-WORKING UNITS, KARL!!!</li>
            <li> My old beard trimmer dies on my a short while ago. This was a welcome replacement. Awesome battery life (and charges swiftly). Great level of length control and doesn&#x27;t tear my face apart. It really is a pleasure to use!</li>
            <li> This Conair trimmer works well.  Its neat, tight design fits easily in one&#x27;s hands.  Light weight and easy to use, I find it a great asset for us bearded, stubble minded dudes.    I&#x27;ve read the other reviews, and I agree the price could be a tad cheaper.  So far that&#x27;s my only gripe.  The pluses may out weigh that depending on your needs. It is portable and cordless with a digital readout; moreover, I haven&#x27;t notice any problems with the battery or maintaining a charge.  The varying length of trim is great, and it flows easily, in my opinion, over facial contours.  So far no nicks or jams.    I&#x27;ve yet to drop it or accidently submerge it. It&#x27;s very easy to clean.  Time will tell on it&#x27;s long term durability.  Good razors/trimmers, I&#x27;ve used in the past have lasted at least a couple of years, based on plenty of hard use I give them.  We&#x27;ll see. 4-5 Stars because of price.</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard and this little powerhouse never pulls, tugs or cuts me. The adjustable head and ease of use make it so versatile.</li>
            <li> This is a really great trimmer, I use it almost every day. Love it. It&#x27;s very precise and comfy.&lt;br /&gt;But it stopped working after 1 month. Not sure why. Plugged it in for the night as usual. In the morning it was dead and won&#x27;t turn on.&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered another one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help resisting writing about the marketing folks that worked on this product first. To start, they call it the \\&quot;i-Stubble,\\&quot; how creative! I&#x27;m going to write some of the claims on the packaging and rate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Unique floating contouring head/tracks the curves of your face for exceptional accuracy and comfort: I haven&#x27;t been very impressed with the these claims. I&#x27;ve found that the floating system is more annoying than helpful. I end up with needing to go over the same areas many times and ending up with uneven lengths compared with my old, cheap trimmer. I also have difficulty trimming by my nose, as the design doesn&#x27;t allow the blades to get close enough to the bottom of my nose to do a full job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Long-lasting rechargeable dual battery system for reliable trimming; rapid charging system - 90 minute charge provides 45 minutes use: That&#x27;s probably about right. After I charge it, the battery indicator will go down to 1/3 power within one or two uses, but it still works well for weeks and many subsequent uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Ergonomic design for easy control and complete comfort: That is some over-the-top language, but it feels fine in your hand (I don&#x27;t know about complete comfort).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. LCD display shows selected length and charge level: This part is really cool -- that you can choose the length you want and read it on the screen. Also, no more guessing as to whether it is fully charges or almost dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Advanced blade technology -- electro-chemically formed blades for extreme sharpness, durability and accuracy: This sounds like crazy marketing language again, but maybe someone can explain why it is extreme. It cuts just fine and hasn&#x27;t pulled my hair so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other great statements on the box: \\&quot;the ultimate in stubble control,\\&quot; \\&quot;maintain your look, everyday with the next generation in stubble control technology.\\&quot; These folks must have gone to the same training courses with Schick and Gillette marketing teams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, enough marketing pet-peeve commentary... Overall, I find this trimmer to be very convenient to use (no storage, losing and various length switching blade screens), easy to use with good battery life. I might hesitate to buy it because of the inability to trim near my nose and not doing a good job in getting consistent lengths all over. With those two caveats, I am still using this trimmer as my regular.</li>
            <li> What a great razor. So much easier than the straight blades I&#x27;ve used all my life, not to mention that a bit of stubble looks better. Shipped to Alaska faster than anticipated as well. Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> This is a great stubble trimmer, BUT after using it for 2 years now I have to say my only complaint is that the guard does not feel that great. It&#x27;s also too bulky to trim under the nose.. so shaving the &#x27;stache area is more of a process. I have a smaller trimmer that I always have to use to finish off what this thing cannot get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the above complaint, this trimmer really is great still. The way the guard flips up and the blade head pops off for easy cleaning was very well thought-out. Love it. It also has a great display indicating the trimmer adjustment setting. And it&#x27;s lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would make this better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Swiveling head to make it more comfortable around facial contours.&lt;br /&gt;2. Better grip... something about the shape, just feels odd with rather hard edges.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer if you want a really short trimmed beard.  Runs great does not pull very happy.  You have to be creative around your nose but other than that it has served its purpose</li>
            <li> The perfect shaver for keeping my face trimmed at just the right length. Had the thing for almost a year and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> works fantastic very easy to clean. charge lasts a long time rarely needs a charge. great for every morning touch ups.</li>
            <li> really like this shaver.  It shaves really well.&lt;br /&gt;I can confirm the battery sucks as others have stated.  Don&#x27;t know why&lt;br /&gt;they make power powered shavers, I&#x27;ve never seen a bathroom with an&lt;br /&gt;electrical outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I still think its 5 stars even though battery&lt;br /&gt;kinda sucks.  Shaves better than everything else I have</li>
            <li> Great product! Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all brands of trimmers and this is hands down the beat for beard maintenance. My old one died and I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement anywhere but online so get it while you still can!</li>
            <li> Little difficult on the head, but works great for the face and the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow</li>
            <li> Works great - just as touted</li>
            <li> I got this forums husband he likes to cut his hair at 0.5 mm and it was the hardest thing fir him to find and this US the perfect gift it works wonders on his head face and body I&#x27;ve over seen him with sign many looks that r amazing get it for a picky razer guy he&#x27;ll absolutely love it</li>
            <li> the blade mechanism  malfunction since first use, something is wrong with the inner spring that move the blade, making the two blades to hit each other</li>
            <li> This little guy is amazing! I have not shaved in years based primarily on style choices but also because I can be prone to ingrown hairs. I have owned easily a dozen clippers/trimmers of all kinds; however, this guy has convinced me that this is truly the FIRST facial hair trimmer I have ever owned. I had no idea it could be this good!. Really remarkable.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a razor and shave cream was always very hard on my face and electric razors never worked for me. So when having some beard stubble became more acceptable and fashionable in recent years, I decided to try a stubble trimmer. I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for close to a year now and it still works well. I set it to the lowest setting it has to keep my stubble as short as possible. I&#x27;ve not used any other stubble trimmers to compare this unit to, but I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> worked for about a week or so, then started making loud noise and kept pinching me every time i shaved, do not buy!!!! it shaved ok while it worked, it also turned off every time you switch the mode, it&#x27;s not worth it!!! i know you can find bad reviews about almost everything, so you might just brush off this review, but you will be sorry if you buy this!</li>
            <li> I ordered it more than 6 months ago but used it in the last 4 months and it was wonderful. but last time it makes a noisy sound and when opened the shaving blade it was broken. the plastic pieces that was holding the metal blades was broken. and there is no spear part for that. nice work but very bad quality and no spear parts. only one star.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost a year, good one to have</li>
            <li> This trimmer is exactly what I wanted.  Being retired I don&#x27;t shave everyday anymore.  I like a short stubble and not shaving unless I want to go out.  I was shaving every 4 to 6 days or so and the razor gets plugged with 2-3 mm hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a Braun for my moustache....of course I lost all those little spacer guides and only had the one short one that was actually to short for my moustache. The battery finally died on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is great!  It automatically adjusts the trim length electro/mechanical from 0.4 to 5.0 mm with a digital readout!  No need to snap on all those little guides you loose anyway!  You can flip the guide off to use the razor up close. The blades pop out for easy cleaning and oiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I trim my beard stubble to about 0.6 mm and my moustache at about 4.0 mm and its a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t comment yet on the battery life but it looks solid with a two stage battery and digital readout for battery level.  Be sure to charge overnight (16 hr) before using the first time.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant when purchasing this trimmer, but I&#x27;m very pleased. It does an excellent job giving the &amp;#34;I shaved two days ago&amp;#34; look, with a very consistent hair length. Adjustability is actually more than needed, but there&#x27;s really nothing to complain about, excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for a year now and it is still working fine. Does a good job.</li>
            <li> I still would highly recommend it. Good poop.. good poop... What more do I have to say to fill the word requirement.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I haven&#x27;t used a razor in years. I can get close enough without looking sloppy, and I don&#x27;t irritate my skin, so my skin looks healthy and stays ingrown hair-free. I usually use a separate electric shaver for my moustache area because it seems like the skin can take it without breaking out. The battery sucks, so it stays plugged in, but that doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me.</li>
            <li> I think people simply don&#x27;t read labels or manuals anymore and then lash out.  It says on the plug, &amp;#34;Charge 16 hours first time&amp;#34;.  I did and the unit functions beautifully.  The head pivots-extremely cool for precision and for those like me with sensitive skin.  Best trimmer I have ever used.  Flat out.  No BS.  The extra nose trimmer for $3 more bucks is aweful but who cares.  This unit is unmatched when it comes to managing the &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; look.  I &#x27;m just shocked it is made by conair (Not the best reputation).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of these things. Most of the time, the problem lies with the plastic guard that creates an uneven trim. Not the case this time. This trimmer feels like it is slowly tweezing your face instead of cutting anything. It&#x27;s terrible. I paid roughly $50 for it, so I&#x27;m not going to just stop using it, and I hope it (maybe?) gets better, but ow.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on all of the stubble trimmers that I could find and this one rated the best by far. I had a struggle with the price, but decided to just dive in and get it. I really like this trimer with one exception. It absolutely does not hold a charge for longer than one use. It is easy to use, cuts well, does not pull hair, easy to clean, but I have to charge it over night before using it. If I do not plug it back in, it will not even power up for the next use. I had read the instructions and followed them for the charging prior to the first use. I did see that several people had this same complaint, but many others did not. I took a chance and must have gotten a lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on this - I contacted Conair and this product has a 5 year warranty. I am able to exchange it. On the adapter plug is a 4 digit number which is the month and year produced. If you do not ahve a receipt they will use this date. I had to ship it back and give them $5.00 for return postage. Well worth it. I am very pleased that they stand behind their products. Now we will see what trimmer #2 does!</li>
            <li> Even if I grow my facial hair out for more than 10 days, this only takes 5-7 minutes to perfect your stubble. Easy to clean and maintain. And it comes with a precision trimmer so you can clean up hairs on the edge of your lips and right underneath your nose. Amazing.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;. Great cutting experience.&lt;br /&gt;. Extremely precise adjustment of length.&lt;br /&gt;. LCD display showing battery and length.&lt;br /&gt;. Comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;. You can&#x27;t remove the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; to clean it up.</li>
            <li> Or so says my husband.  I couldn&#x27;t get him to actually sit down and write a review.  I do know that he&#x27;s tried many different electric facial trimmers.  So the fact that this one comes with such high marks from him must mean something.</li>
            <li> The i-stubble is a quality hair trimmer with a pivoting head that does indeed conform to facial and body curves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging is easy and the LCD display gives a rough estimate of battery charge. It has a NiMH (nickel-metal hydride) battery so the first charge should be a full sixteen hours followed by three complete cycles of completely discharging the battery and recharging it to full capacity to achieve maximum battery performance. In normal use, a weekly recharge is sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The i-stubble cuts hair to between 0.4 and 5mm with automatic adjustment of the distance from blade to comb by pushing a button with the setting displayed on the LCD screen. It does a good job with producing even hair length although it may be necessary to go over an area multiple times in different directions and not only against the growth as directed. The length can be set at 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, or 5.0mm. The comb can also be flipped back for edge shaping and cutting hair under 0.4mm but it will not remove all the hair to leave smooth, bald skin so this function is not completely satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is easy to hold and handle and the blade can be rinsed. The head, blade, and comb are easy to clean with an old toothbrush and the directions suggest lubricating the blades with the included oil monthly.</li>
            <li> It is a little &#x27;messy&#x27; as other reviewers have said (but I was expecting it and it&#x27;s really not THAT bad to have to clean up after for a couple minutes) but besides that it&#x27;s GREAT. I love it! Now I can keep my stubble. I&#x27;ve had it for quite a while now and use it once or twice a week and it&#x27;s just perfect.  UPDATE 6/24/16 - After using this for almost 3 years I wanted to give a quick update. Still 5/5 stars! The battery life is still just as good as before, it cuts just as well and even as new. It&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s brand new still. Very, very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked fine while it lasted, which was only about a year and half after being used once a week.  Don&#x27;t get too attached.</li>
            <li> Love the simplicity of design and the usage. It is also very effective in keeping my stubble just at the 5&#x27;o clock length which is pretty impressive since I have very coarse hair and have slightly chubby cheeks - and this device still gets the job done at the 0.4mm setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 other stubble razors and both held up, but didn&#x27;t do a great job. I decided to try this one and was psyched the first time I used it. When this one dies I will buy another without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Awesome price&lt;br /&gt;2. It cuts fast and without pulling&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;4. Lots of settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Stubble everywhere. I put down a towel and shave over it which  works well.&lt;br /&gt;2. Minor annoyance but I wish it would save your last setting instead of reverting to 0.4</li>
            <li> Initial &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; this morning was EXACTLY what I was hoping it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a moustache and goatee and really don&#x27;t like to blade shave more than once a week.  I can&#x27;t really use electric shavers (norelco, braun, etc.) because all of them end up giving me ingrown hairs.  So basically I&#x27;ve been blade shaving with an old-school safety razor (only way to go IMHO) and then using beard trimmers to try to reduce the substantial growth beginning around T+3 days.  It&#x27;s worked, but it never really got &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the i-Stubble.  My &amp;#34;trim/shave&amp;#34; this morning with the i-Stubble was quick, comfortable and allowed me to get much much closer than I was ever able to with my old beard trimmer.  Basically it looks like I blade shaved 18 hours ago or perhaps a day ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some of the other reviews that remove stars because they still need different trimmers for under nose, etc... this product works perfectly for my moustache and goatee setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t speak for longevity or persistent quality, I can tell you my initial impression is 5-star.  I will update this in a few months.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has a digital length indicator which makes it very easy to use. It works excellent except under the nose. The head of the trimmer is so large it does not allow you to trim the hair directly under the nose. Battery life seems just ok.</li>
            <li> I bought this once and it would not hold a charge. I returned it and was sent another, and it still seems to not be holding a charge properly. I am following all the rules of a 16+ hour initial charge, but the product just seems faulty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two go bad on me in a six month span.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time, the blades detached from the motor/actuator. You could hear it run but the blades were not moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time, the adjustment stopped working and now it&#x27;s stuck on 5mm - the furthest adjustment - and useless for all intents and purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always taken care of my trimmers but this one is junk. I have a corded Wahl clipper that is over 10 years old and works perfectly. The two literally sat next to each other but the Conair just didn&#x27;t survive.</li>
            <li> Great product, just what i have wanted for years a designer stubble razor. Smooth , pain free, easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I bought the GMT 900 and have used it now several times.  It has a good cutter and no trouble catching the hair.  However I keep making mistakes as the comb design is very clumsy.  It can get stuck or suddenly slip, and the result is that I can never be sure to get the right length, and now I have a few bare spots where it cut to the skin.  And the cutter scratches the skin.  I think conair made a mistake resorting to this digital length setting, it looks nice, but is much more ocmplicated than needed -- I am now purchasing a trimmer with mechanical length setting.</li>
            <li> One of the best on the market. The height adjustments are with a push of a button all with a precise cut and all the power you need  a must have</li>
            <li> Great product - I use 0.4 to 0.6 mm - excellent no need to shave smooth in the winter  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start it off easy:  Pros:  Easily Adjusts  Strong Blades that can cut through my thicker beard  Easy to Use  Good Battery Life  Cons:  Slightly more difficult to use right under the nose, but not impossible.  Responses to common complaints:  -The most reasonable complaint I&#x27;ve seen on this product is that its hard to shave the upper lip. I&#x27;d like to go ahead and say, its always hard to shave the upper lip, no matter what product you use, especially if you need to shave against the grain. While its not as easy, its still relatively simple to reach that spot.  -Another one I&#x27;ve seen is that this product isn&#x27;t for thick beards. This is pure nonsense. I have Mediterranean, North African, and Turkic genes to thank for my very thick beard. The shaver cut through perfectly. I will note, that I had about 10mm or so of growth at first use and it did fine. I wouldn&#x27;t even bother try using this with a full length beard. Use a beard trimmer then use this. Its called the iStubble not the i \\&quot;Old Dutch\\&quot;. You wouldn&#x27;t use a razor after a weeks growth without trimming the hairs down to size would you?  Be smart about the product and it will work great for you. I was afraid of dropping 50 bucks on this but it seems worth the investment. My wife likes the look it leaves.  Also, remember to charge the battery for 16H on the first charge to ensure maximum battery life!</li>
            <li> Finally. Problem solved.   This product works incredibly well.   As far as those who say they can&#x27;t hit the area between the nose and the upper-lip, that&#x27;s funny.   It&#x27;s easily manipulated to any angle. Stop attempting to use it straight up only.   If you&#x27;ve been looking for this type of grooming tool, pull the trigger.   You&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li> I have been someone who has had stubble long before it was a cool thing and I was excited to see companies beginning to develop products that was specifically geared just for that. Unfortunately, a product that you can not use on your entire face is just a poor product and is useless. As other reviewers mentioned it is impossible to get your upper lip ... which I thought I would be able to get around or manage another way but with no luck this trimmer is headed to the trash. It is a great idea but save your money and wait until some major improvements take place.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave, but not like a razor. I like it as a trimmer. It is very accurate and gives a uniform shave. Battery last for a long time (days). Only problem is it can break easily if dropped. The top will break and that will be the end of it. This is why I may need to buy a new one.  I am changing my rating to 5 stars to 1 star (love or hate and nothing in between). Reason: My second i-Stubble does not cut properly and makes a strange noise. It hurts as it cuts, ouch! I oiled and checked it out with no avail... So I went back to my old trimmer, one I had for 8 years and that one cuts very well. So I figured the less sexy older trimmer is better than this beautiful looking one. So that&#x27;s it I am not staying with this model. I am going back to the old one. Here is one more bad thing I did not mention before: it cannot reach/cut the mustache hair near the nose! Update Nov 15, 2016 - I had  two units and both stopped cutting for the same reason. Avg lifetime is 1 year. My old trimmer still works! The first had two issues. I actually fixed the second one from a part from the first and that gave me 6 months. Then the second one had the same blad problem and now both are throwaway. So technically speaking, the moving (cutting) mechanism needs to be redesigned. It is nice and smooth while it works.</li>
            <li> It worked good while it was working, but it broke down within a year of purchase with only minimal use.</li>
            <li> The best stubble/shadow trimmer there is..</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use, full charge gives about 50minutes of usage. Works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not loud, easy to hold. Make sure to trim multiple times to get consistent stubble (see the iStubble usage video, search on youtube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;I bought the GMT900R (newer version) from the seller Gourmet Kitchen Gallery (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aag/main/ref&#x3D;olp_merch_name_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;asin&#x3D;B004PXIR1W&amp;isAmazonFulfilled&#x3D;0&amp;seller&#x3D;A2HITL9SNBEQ85), they are selling GMT900R, other sellers might sell the older version GMT900 (new one is pretty much same but mostly with some fixed quality issues). Get the GMT900R from Gourmet Kitchen Gallery (Free shipping and no-sales-tax for most states), and they have good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing GMT900R instruction manual will have GMT900 written on it, just check the back of the trimmer to know exact model.</li>
            <li> Worked great for one and a half years. Probably as even of a &amp;#34;stubble shave&amp;#34; as possible, and true it is hard to get to the area right below the nostrils. I would usually hit this area lightly with a razor and problem solved. Battery life was also pretty good. However, the unit finally stopped working. These types or products simply do not last like they used to. For the price, I did get value from it, although I expected it to last for much longer. I only used the item approx once per week.</li>
            <li> Just like so many reviews here, my unit had battery trouble from the start.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think this thing may have been designed to shave a woman&#x27;s beard because it can&#x27;t cut through real stubble even when it appears to be working normally.  It does not trim as close as it should either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for years...works great for that stubble look. Adjusting the length is electronic and is very accurate with the lit display. I love that I don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; guards for this thing as I seem to have collected/lost mismatching guards from other trimmers that I keep around for no apparent reason. The battery has lasted over years of use, but can notice a slight decrease in the number of times I can use it on one charge. I&#x27;m looking to replace this trimmer, but I&#x27;m not impressed with the others that I see on Amazon right now (was hoping for a newer model, but doesn&#x27;t seem to exist yet), so I may just buy this one again. We&#x27;ll see, I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love this thing lots of length settings and hold a charge for about a month with my every other day of shaving my stubble.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week, and it makes my beard look great.</li>
            <li> Best all around cordless trimmer you can buy for the money.  There are some reviews stating that you cannot get close to your nose, but you can flip up the plastic guard to trim.  Does not feel cheap, cuts smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve try several trimer and the iStubble is by far the best. You ony need one or two pass to achived a stubble look.</li>
            <li> The blade control is excellent, a very easy to use machine. Be sure to give it a good long charge (8 hours plus) before you start. Overall, I liked it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use this as a beard or facial hair trimmer b/c I can&#x27;t grow a bear. I primarily use it for body hair. For that purpose, it does the job. I can dictate the length and closeness of shave. I love the battery indicator and I&#x27;ve had it for years now, and it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a product is crap. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best beard and mustache trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Worst design ever. That&#x27;s all you need to know. Different isn&#x27;t always necessarily better (especially in this case).</li>
            <li> I love this shaver and use it every day. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the iStubble.&lt;br /&gt;In the several times I used it since I got it the results were fine, it didn&#x27;t scratch or irritate my face in any way, it was easy to clean and the quality of the build seems excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - I got what I expected</li>
            <li> Excellent product does everything it says.The front comb takes some time getting used to specially the area under the nose. Other than that no complains whatsoever. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Battery would die after a few minutes of use. I might have gotten a lemon but I wouldn&#x27;t try this one again.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good trimmer and does a good job of maintaining the &amp;#34;stubble look&amp;#34;. Taking apart the head and cleaning the blades is pretty simple and easy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going for the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look, which seems to be popular, this is THE razor.&lt;br /&gt;I really like how it goes in increments, so you can adjust how much stubble is left. For instance, I use 1.0 mm on my face, but under my chin, I drop it to 0.6 mm because, obviously, you have a true shadow under your chin, and if it is cut the same length, it looks like you forgot to trim under your chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if it could only fix the gray that is coming out in my beard.... :)</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used thus far. Doesn&#x27;t pull or snag, cordless (as long as its charged), fully adjustable, and creates the great 5 o clock shadow look. It is a little tough getting your stache right under your nose as some have mentioned, but still doable; honestly though I&#x27;ve yet to see a razor or trimmer with a guard get there perfectly anyway.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box there was a dark blotch on the lighted display and the battery will not hold a charge long enough for one trim (less than 3 minutes). It does trim nicely but it has to be plugged in just to use it.</li>
            <li> So bummed! This was supposed to be a replacement for the identical one I purchased nearly 5 yrs ago. That i-Stubble was the BOMB; made short work of my thick beard. This replacement looks to be identical, but is not. Outwardly it looks the same, but the small blade system is slightly different. The pieces are not interchangeable, and this new one seriously broke in less than 5 uses. It began buzzing something fierce, then I heard a snap during my last and noticed the blades wouldn&#x27;t move. Tried my best to fix it, even replace it with my old trimming part, but to no avail. The &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; I-Stubble is a fraud...</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s charge as well after a year or so of use, but it&#x27;s a solid trimmer otherwise.  I haven&#x27;t found a better trimmer for keeping a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  If you hate shaving as much as I do but want to keep your facial hair close, this is probably your best option.</li>
            <li> Great price, super fast shipping, awesome product! If you&#x27;re like me and you like to keep that short stubble look but hate shaving once or twice a week then this is the trimmer for you! Seriously, it has multiple length settings so you can get just the right look you&#x27;ve been going for. Plus the battery holds a charge really well. And clean up couldn&#x27;t be easier. I had been thinking about picking one of these up for a while and I only wish I had gotten one sooner!</li>
            <li> While the trimmer works fine, it is completely non-water resistant. The thing has already broken due to water 6 weeks after I started using it. Its not like I was using it in  shower or anything either. This is from water it collected while lying on the sink. I am surprised that something that is made to be used in a bathroom is not better protected to last longer in that environment.</li>
            <li> Pros - Even shave, great for sensitive skin, digital readout of blade length, comfortable to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Powers off when changing blade length&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this unit.  Some have said it&#x27;s a bit slippery and while it doesn&#x27;t have a rubberized grip, it is very comfortable and easy to use.  Very even shave and does not irritate sensitive skin (other units have caused redness).  The best part of it besides for the trimming has to be digital readout of the blade length.  Yes a clipper is great, but being able to see the setting of last use and in general is very help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is (and I&#x27;m being very picky since I haven&#x27;t come across one that does it) is when changing sizes (i.e. from 0.4 to 0.6) it powers off.  Was thinking about making a fade without removing it from my face.  Yes, pretty odd request which is why this still gets 5/5 stars.  Would recommend this to anyone looking to keep a little or a lot of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last point - be wary of other stubble trimmers that don&#x27;t get as short as this one.  You are looking to trim stubble not shape your beard.  Some don&#x27;t go as low as this one, thus rendering them useless.</li>
            <li> I had searched the net for countless of hours looking for a true stubble trimmer, before ending up buying this one in particular. I wasn&#x27;t sure, because there were a lot of mixed and negative reviews, but took the chance and I&#x27;m glad I did. First of all, this is a stubble trimmer and it is not meant for long beards. Also, this trimmer is not meant to be used with wet hairs and it isn&#x27;t washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes in a standard retail package. Nothing much included, just the trimmer itself, a small cleaning brush that has two brush heads, one wide and one small; a power cord, a \\&quot;sample\\&quot; size tube of trimmer/cliper oil and an instructions booklet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions clearly say to charge the trimmer for 16 hrs before its first use, this is a must, according to the manufacturer, to make sure you get the most out of the battery. After the initial charge, the unit will take from 2 to 4 hours for a full charge from a completely dead battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s only 3 buttons on this trimmer. The rectangular/black buttons are for increasing/decreasing the cutting length, the smallest setting is a wopping .4mm! which is perfect for the \\&quot;5 O&#x27;clock shadow look\\&quot;, which I tried and it worked. The other button is the power button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the screen, you get the trimming level/number and the battery status, which will flash as you use the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer can be used with or without the guide, but the guide itself can&#x27;t be removed; it just flips onto the back of the trimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the performance, this thing did what I was expecting, I first tried it at 1mm and I had fantastic results, the trimmer did a great job a cutting the hairs evenly and without much effort. Some spots, specially on my neck and the corner of my mouth, required some skin stretching and different approach angles, but the results were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried the lowest setting, which is .4mm and I was blown away. The trimmer gave me the perfect shadow look, the way my beard looks a day or two after I shave, which is my favourite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer&#x27;s head moves as you slide it accross your face, so when you reach the chin, jaw, etc, you don&#x27;t need to adjust the position of the trimmer. I didn&#x27;t experience any hair pulling or pinching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide, as I said before, can&#x27;t be taken off of the trimmer, but it can be flipped to the back of the trimmer, which is perfect for when trimming sideburns, etc. I didn&#x27;t need to remove it when I was trimming my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the trimmer is easy. Simply flip the guide to the back, grab the included brush and give it a good swipe accross the trimming head, then, apply a drop or two of the included oil and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you want the shadow look or the perfec stubble, look no further, the Conair GMT900 is not just the tool you need, but it is well made, simple to use a true stubble trimmer.er gave me the perfect shadow look, the way my beard looks a day or two after I shave, which is my favourite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer&#x27;s head moves as you slide it accross your face, so when you reach the chin, jaw, etc, you don&#x27;t need to adjust the position of the trimmer.

            <li> The Conair GMT900 iStubble Facial Trimmer is a great product. I do like that you can adjust the blade height setting to the desired length you want your beard stubble to be. For those of you old enough to remember it gives allows you to trim your beard to the \\&quot;Miami Vice\\&quot; style. It is smooth and effortless to use. If you by this product you will be happy.</li>
            <li> Product I received had already been used and not even cleaned; there were grey hairs all over the blade and comb. Disgusting and unacceptable.</li>
            <li> OK this is the second one I owned. So I waited until over 3 months before reviewing this. This Razor is alsome, that is why I had to give it a second chance. I have concluded now that my first one died from over charging. So put this on the charge for 3 hrs unplug and Good for the next 7 times or more. So charge it like once a month. I did have to get it wet which I wouldn&#x27;t do again because it weaken the battery. Not a good ideal to wet electronics. It comes with a brush and is easy to clean. Just pop the guard up and wipe off, clean with Q-tip. If you want the close shave then pop top off (guard) and it folds back and clips on back of razor. This razor is great you can shave fast, clean it fast, and it holds a charge for a long time (even when weaken) I love it, and would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have written a review on a product I have purchased through Amazon.  I have for CDs, audio books and books, however, not a product.  This time it was a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always wanted to keep my stubble beard at one certain length each and every day for decades.  Humbly, long before &amp;#34;the look&amp;#34; became popular.  I knew what I wanted and could not achieve the precise look.  Never able to, because one day it would look one way, other days a number of various lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing much research through the years, using one after another, trying a few different stubble beard trimmers (not all recommended, though several),  I couldn&#x27;t get it to be exactly what I longed for daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have, indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair i-Stubble &amp;#34;The Ultimate&amp;#34; was &amp;#34;the Best&amp;#34; with a capital &amp;#34;B&amp;#34;.  Also, at a most excellent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If 5 stars is the highest, I am providing a 5 star plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyday, after all these decades, I have found the one that &amp;#34;gets it done in the Getting It Done Department&amp;#34; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your are looking for the essence of a stubble beard, you have it here with the Conair i-Stubble &amp;#34;The Ultimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> The product build seems fine, and it is easy enough to use.&lt;br /&gt;But the three things that stand out every time I use it:&lt;br /&gt;1) the various length settings may as well all be the same - there isn&#x27;t much variance, and the minor point changes are in no way noticeable at all - between 0.4 and like 3.0, probably noticeable - but anything smaller increments than that, may as well be the same&lt;br /&gt;2) this product is FANTASTIC at leaving random patches of longer hair without warning - you have to go over multiple times, and then frequently revisit it later in the day when realizing you still missed something - they should advertise it as &amp;#34;leave your face a patchy shambles&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;3) it is so difficult that it may as well be impossible when it comes to tiny spots like up right under the nostrils</li>
            <li> Im going to keep this short.  this is a fantastic trimmer when it works.  Other reviewers are correct about the features, quality of trim, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot however recommend this product.  I have bought 2 (two!) and both of them have fails in about 2-3 months.  That&#x27;s a very bad record.  other reviewers here are having the same problem, so I know it isn&#x27;t just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself some grief.  Look for something else that will last longer.  I called Conair and they said they discontinued this model.  I think I know why!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints so far about this trimmer. Its perfect for giving you the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look thats popular. Just leave the setting at 0.4mm and this thing is a breeze. Just comb it through your beard against the grain and you are done in about a minute or less. It doesn&#x27;t pull or leave any nicks (and I have very sensitive skin), and I have yet to find any hard to reach places with this thing. If you happen to have one, just flip the comb guide back and use the blade. This thing is so easy to use and works great. I wish I would have found this a long time ago because I used to hate shaving and then waiting for my hair to grow back to look perfect and then having to shave it all off again. If this sounds like you pick up the i-Stubble you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Over here in Australia we have a similar item called a VS Sassoon, it costs about $110AUD, it&#x27;s actually the same item, obviously they have been given the rights to use the same model. This item is fantastic and I would recommend to anyone, it cuts well, one tiny thing I would say would be that make sure you lube it with the lube that comes with it, I found sometimes it catches on the skin or pulls out a hair which can be annoying.. Other than that the item is fantastic, and the price is literally less than half of what you can buy it for in AUS..</li>
            <li> I have bought many clippers in the past and this is the best one so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great for facial hair, neck, back and everything else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very powerful, lightweight and charges very quickly.</li>
            <li> this is a great product. It is very easy to use and to take care of. It is the best ive found out there yet.</li>
            <li> Quite happy overall, but if 50% charge and you don&#x27;t oil the blades or regularly (oil provided), neck hair can be tugged and cause alot of discomfort and blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of used correctly, and you tale you&#x27;re time, you should have better luck than me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> This is the second I-Stubble that we have purchased. I bought one for my husband first and my son started to borrow it so I bought a second one for him. They both love it. I also love the look it gives. They can choice how long they want to leave the hair. You just plug it in and charge it up. Highly recommend this one by Conair! No more shaving every day and the stubble looks groomed!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic trimmer.  This is my whole head shaver, face and hair (shaved head).  On the shortest setting people can&#x27;t believe I don&#x27;t use a razor.  I have owned a couple and they have each worked great through a year + of use.  One did get stepped on and it broke but that wasn&#x27;t the razors fault.  Because of the always attached guard you get very close without the blades even touching your skin, great for sensitive skin.  I did find that the guard can get in the way a little when getting behind the ears and under the nose.  A nose/ear trimmer works for touching those areas up.  Another guy who &#x27;shaves&#x27; his head recommended this and glad he did!</li>
            <li> I really thought this would be the perfect facial hair trimmer for me... and it was... for less than 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be very careful with the length you choose as there&#x27;s very little noticeable difference from 0.5mm to 2mm. I tend to choose 3, 4 or 5. Well, I did tend to choose that when the trimmer worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the trimmer did work, it was really nice; clean, uniform and simple to use. However, after about my 5th use, it stopped holding a charge. I guess it&#x27;s not very good quality after all. And of course, my return/exchange window expired just days before it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from ConAir I guess. I would have given it 4-5 stars if it lasted, oh say, at least 6 months?</li>
            <li> Arrived in a box, fully covered in oil which presumably would have belonged in the small bottle accompanying it. Would not even want to plug it in, since it was such a (smelly) mess.</li>
            <li> Works well for stubble, but not for full on beards.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews, I finally purchased the Conair GMT900 iSTubble.  I&#x27;ve only had it for about 2 weeks now, but it has worked flawlessly. The .4mm is perfect for the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a perfect trimmer for someone who wants that look. If you are looking for a longer beard then I can&#x27;t quite comment on that. Might be slightly difficult to keep length on the chin/jaw line. But for me being .4mm is prefect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flipping the head to trim right under nose or side burns seems to work good. My only complaint is that when looking in the mirror it is hard to see where the tip of the blades are do to design. I don&#x27;t think I would trust doing my neck by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall its a 4.5 Star out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update if anything changes</li>
            <li> I purchased two of the Conair i-Stubbles and BOTH have broken.  They work great for a few months and then the adjustable trimmer breaks, the charger stops charging, and ultimately they whole trimmer shuts down.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Pulls and cuts face at lowest cutting level.  I have a better $10 trimmer that has worked better than this.  Also the flip top to produce a straight line trimmer is hard to gauge when trying to cut a straight line for sideburns.</li>
            <li> Received as a XMas gift. It will not hold a charge. I charged it according to directions (16 hours initially). I got one full use out of it. I let the battery charge for 2 days and it only works for 1 minute of use. Charged it for 3 days and still only 1 minute of use. I contacted the manufacturer for guidance. I&#x27;ll update when I hear from them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this trimmer.  The length adjustments are smooth and accurate; I&#x27;ve used multiple trimmers and most have trouble getting an even length around my neck area, but the iStubble got the length I prefer spot on.  It was a little bit difficult to get to the moustache area due to the size of the head, but I was able to manage.  Great purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve only had this about a month but so far it has been great. Iâ€™m able to keep a 5 oâ€™clock shadow to a scruffy look at all times. This product is NOT for grooming a beard, goatee, mustache, etcâ€¦ but for keeping stubble that is impossible with a razor or normal trimmers.</li>
            <li> As described, awesome product. Recommend it to all. It has good build quality , and good feel in d hand.</li>
            <li> Works great for keeping that little bit of stubble that I like. I used to shave with a 4 blade razor, but I hated my baby face after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never pulls hairs, cleans easy and has good battery life. I can get 5-6 trims out of it before needing to recharge.</li>
            <li> Likes:&lt;br /&gt;-electronic cutting control&lt;br /&gt;-wireless&lt;br /&gt;-affordable&lt;br /&gt;-attractive&lt;br /&gt;-Does an excellent job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;-battery life&lt;br /&gt;-more challenging to clean&lt;br /&gt;-no lock button?&lt;br /&gt;-no travel case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd trimmer I purchased. The first was a cheaper one I found in CVS. I wanted something to tailor my beard as it was a first time growing it out.  This trimmer works really well for shaping my beard, and experimenting with different lengths. No complaints on the actually functionality. Cleaning it is no that hard but the hairs find themselves all over the place and deep in the unit. Make sure you use the brush every day to free them. Why this doesn&#x27;t have a lock for when you travel puzzles me. If the button gets pressed your battery will be dead. Also no case to put it in.  The battery life isn&#x27;t that great. I use this for 3 days( 3-5 min sessions) and its almost dead. However, i&#x27;m really happy with this trimmer and hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of discussion about the comb part - you have to unsnap it &amp; fold it back to get a close stubble shave (like the guy in the ad). You should know, the comb part isn&#x27;t really meant to fold like that on a regular basis. Half the time, the blade part falls out (hopefully it lands on the floor or in the sink, not into the toilet or something like that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, and after about 30 uses (less than one year), the comb part snapped &amp; broke completely. It&#x27;s pretty thin to start with. It can&#x27;t easily be replaced, and now the *only* thing I can use it for is close shave (you can&#x27;t adjust it *at all* without the comb). I stick with my original assessment: This model has multiple problems. I knock my original review down from a 3-star to a 2-star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this would be a fully adjustable trimmer. It&#x27;s very cool looking, with digital programmable adjustable length (from .4 mm to 5 mm). Trimmer functions great out the box, &amp; very cool-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t replace *anything* in my medicine cabinet because the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; is not functional. I still have to keep my other trimmer for upper lip, sideburns, neckline, eyebrows, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is just too big. With the comb feature, you can&#x27;t get stubble as short as in the video (which is a bit misleading). His stubble is 0.2 to 0.3 mm ... to get that close, you need to flip back the comb head, and trim with just the metal blades against the skin - much like using [[ASIN:B000JNQSIQ Wahl Hair Clippers]] (or similar) to shave, without the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, when you flip back the head, you get a much shorter (uneven) finish, and the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; part is huge and bulky so you can&#x27;t really get too close to the upper lip, etc. Just a clumsy design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst feature on the iStubble (design oversight) is there is no \\&quot;catch\\&quot; for the hair. It just jams up the cutting blades until it falls on the floor (or worse, all over your shirt). No compartment to empty. Makes a mess every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does have it&#x27;s perks - the comb head doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin AT ALL. No need for soothing aftershave lotions. It&#x27;s very quick, easy, and painless to use (do my whole face in say 30 seconds). But they seem to sacrifice function &amp; versatility, and opt for cool looking design (neon glow-in-dark display, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend the iStubble to someone with a longer goatee, who has other products for the rest of the face (i.e., if you shave with a razor, but want to keep a short or medium goatee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a all-in-one trimmer/groomer for goatee or stubble, I&#x27;d recommend something more versatile, such as ([[ASIN:B000FED5DU Norelco All-in-1 Grooming System]] (I&#x27;ve owned for years, and works great). No digital glow-in-the-dark display, though. But it comes with about 10 attachments for everything you need, including nose hair trimmer. For stubble, simply use it without any attachments for a perfect .2mm to .3mm stubble. The [[ASIN:B00009RF1E Wahl Groomsman Trimmer]] is similar, also for around $15, and probably just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iStubble looks cool, and it works great for trimming chin &amp; cheeks. But I just don&#x27;t want a drawer full of electronic grooming devices. Not versatile enough for me.ompartment to empty.

            <li> Overall this is the best product that I have tried to date for stubble management!  It&#x27;s multiple settings are great!      My only complaint is that the adjustble comb on the head doesn&#x27;t allow one to work the upper lip area below the nose.... The comb teeth are too long</li>
            <li> Not a beard trimmer.  Didn&#x27;t do what I expected.  Suppose that is not the fault of the product, but be sure this is exactly what you need before you buy it.</li>
            <li> First, one of my pet peeves are product reviews written before a user has had a sufficient amount of time to actually learn all they should about a product before writing a review.  I have had this trimmer for a few months now.  First, the good: it trims well and trims close for a nice stubble look.  So the product works really well for its intended purpose.  So why the single star?  Well, the product doesn&#x27;t hold a charge.  I followed the instructions.  It worked fine for a few days.  Then one day, despite having the darn thing continually plugged in and charging, it just did not have a charge.  After that, some days it would work, some days it had no juice.  So I took to leaving it plugged in all the time.  That did the trick.  I used the product as a corded machine for a month or so. Then, a few days ago, no juice even when plugged in.  I would love this product if either the battery kept a charge or if it was corded and worked plugged in.  As it is, this product stinks.  Avoid.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS BUT THERE ARE BETTER TRIMMERS OUT THERE...  THIS CUTS YOU FOR DOWN THERE MAINTENANCE IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN</li>
            <li> did exactly what it said it would. Good overall trimming and range of options. Highly recommended and good value for money</li>
            <li> I was in search of the best stubble trimmer.  I wanted to maintain some stubble but not a beard.  THis has a nice swivel head.  Its easy to clean it out so it won&#x27;t get clogged.  As you adjust the height the head moves up or down.  It has a digital control so you can pick your shave number and stick with it.  THe battery life is is good.  No complaints about this.  It is not for wet use by the way.</li>
            <li> Finally a trimmer that I can use and not make a mistake on my beard. I wish it had a stand for charging and accessory storage but still a great product.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has nice features but is pinches the skin around the lip area and cannot  trim close under the nose leaving an uneven trim</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer.  I have had a number of trimmers over the years and this is the first one that gives you the ability to adjust the cut to the right length every single time since it is digital.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased the i-Stubble following a reasonable amount of research on the web for a trimming device that would allow for detailed trimming as my current clippers leave something to be desired for facial trimming, i.e. I would either be very closely trimmed or have a short beard.   Following this research, the i-Stubble appeared to be the obvious solution at a reasonable price to boot. I paid $45 US.   However, upon using the i-Stubble, after not shaving for a week, I was not overly impressed...  For starters, the measurement increments (0.4mm, 0.6mm, 0.8mm, 1mm, 1.5mm, 2mm, 2.5mm etc up to 5mm) are not accurate. I started at 3mm and actually took off most of my &#x27;short beard&#x27; which I thought was no more than 3mm long, the result being a lot shorter than 3mm. I then decided to test further and at the 2mm setting it is pretty much the same effect as clippers with no attachment on. At 0.6mm the actual trimmer sits proud of the plastic attachment so not sure how it could be 0.6mm?!  I found the trimmer to be similar to rough grading, i.e. after going over my face several times and then inspecting, I found many facial hairs still there at the original length. I note that it was used on dry facial hair, as per the instructions.   It is not easy to use for detailed trimming, due to the design of the head of the device.  In addition to this, it is poor for trimming facial hair beneath your nose, again based on the design of the head of the device. And no, I do not have some sort of huge crow like nose like the Wicked Witch of the North. I had to use my clippers to trim my moustache area down.   As for the overall design, it would be nice if it came with a stand, like products that Phillips offer, which are neat and tidy and allow for the power supply cord to essentially be hidden. Otherwise it is straight forward to use and automatically switches off after a minute or so of non-use.   For this price on Amazon, it is an OK deal. I am in Canada, and this product at the likesof London Drugs is actually $95 CAN which I would consider far too high. For $45 US, it is in the right price bracket.   Overall, a great idea but some small improvements would result in a far superior product. B-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend a lot of products but I would recommend this one. It works well and has a good build quality.</li>
            <li> No problems with this trimmer except my first one stopped working after 6 months. They have a great warranty policy &amp; I ended getting a new one in the mail 7 days later!</li>
            <li> This razor is great and does a wonderful job.  The only thing I am not a fan of with it is that it will not have the settings that you use for the head.  So you always have to reset the height of the head each time of use.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as awesome as some people would have you believe. You can&#x27;t properly trim all areas of your face. I still have to use my old trimmer for my mustache and sideburns. This one is hard to use all over, not well designed.</li>
            <li> I used this shaver and because I have a pretty thick beard it ended up cutting my neck up pretty bad. In one shave I would have 5-10 cuts along my neck.</li>
            <li> Perfect for getting the stubble nice and even.</li>
            <li> Works well, but it does create a shower of whiskers on the sink. Also, it resets itself to 0.4 on power down.  These minor complaints aside, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> my skin gets irritated by most shavers, however this istubble is perfect for me because it does leave a little stubble that works much better for me. very fast 5oclock shadow shave which what I was looking for. only problem is you can not cut all spots like mustache hairs under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This no longer works after 6 months of use. I will go back to wahl</li>
            <li> The floating head works well, it trimmed my stubble look a lot better than the normal shavers as it followed the contours of my face better</li>
            <li> Awesome product.... Until it breaks... And it will.  The top white piece will start making a wicked ridiculous noise....</li>
            <li> I hate shaving! Putting a blade on my face every day is not something I enjoy. With the i-stubble you&#x27;re barely touching the skin. You can take your beard down to a five o&#x27;clock shadow or to several days growth, it&#x27;s all in the powered adjustments, your choice. I found the unit very well built and very user friendly. Hope this review helps on your decision.</li>
            <li> Good quality razor, though I wish it could get slightly closer...leaves about 2 days worth of growth at the .4 length</li>
            <li> This razor only lasted about 2 months and the head fell apart and it was yanking on my whiskers and would not cut.  Then I contacted Conair and I have to pay for shipping of the unit back to them, plus include a 5 dollar check for them to send it back.  My last electric trimmer lasted for many years so I was surprised at this early failure.  Now all of the messing around with warranty, returning, wasting my time.</li>
            <li> I SAY THIS BECAUSE I WANTED A SHAVER NOT A STUBBLE SHAVER. FROM WILLIAM MCGRAW.I DONT KNOW FIVE MORE WORDS.THE BOX WAS SEALED SO THAT I HAD TO TEAR IT APART.SO I COULD NOT SEND IT BACK.</li>
            <li> Being a man shaving everyday is something I have had to do for years. Recently having stuble is a popular alternative to a full on shave. I purchased the iStubble due to all the positive reviews and have not been dissapointed. The lengths are perfect for any length stubble to a small beard. You can also remove the cover and use the guard free setting to trim up around your &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; or hairline. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> First shave, took a few minutes to figure out the best angle to hold it.  Once I figured that out, it works incredibly.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After going through 5 or 6 buzzers within 6 years. This one is the best fit. Great LED display to get the best beard trim every time. Easy to clean with the brush given and glides very smoothly no matter how big your beard gets</li>
            <li> Works well.... Worth the $$$</li>
            <li> Love it.  Easy to use; small learning curve to get the feel of letting the trimmer glide across the face.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Worked fine till just over a year old... then the battery stopped holding a charge longer than about 2 minutes. I could keep using it, while plugged into the wall, for another 3 months, then even plugged in it started stuttering and would not remain on. Eventually, after less than 18 months of ownership, it simply was unusable.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat the trimmer didn&#x27;t hold charge well&lt;br /&gt;Tough to trim under nose and into sideburns. Rather not need multiple tools for one face.</li>
            <li> Dude! This thing is awesome. i can shave in no time and get a CLOSE shave.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait some time to review this, to see how it held up, and this trimmer is by far the best I have had in terms of being able to get the correct amount of stubble. I prefer a light beard, maybe 6 days without shaving, and no trimmer I tried would do it. Granted, most of the trimmers I bought were on the low end, so I decided to invest in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this every other day for the last year, and it still works great. I usually use a 3.5 - 4 setting, and then detail with the guard pulled back. I&#x27;ve even traveled with it in luggage, and still great. The shorter settings give a great stubble look as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue, which I expected was the battery was  pretty weak after about 6 months, and I couldn&#x27;t finish trimming before the battery needed to be charged. So under a minute. Ever since then, I just keep it plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it ever fails, I will definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> -:Â¦:-A-:Â¦:-W-:Â¦:-E-:Â¦:-S-:Â¦:-O-:Â¦:-M-:Â¦:-E-:Â¦:-</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer 3-5 times a week in lieu of shaving. My face no longer has razor bumps what so ever compared to shaving, and is much happier. It has adjustable settings that are very handy. Also the trimmer is pain free and trims quite effectively. You must charge it for 16 hours the first time, and every once in a while thereafter. I find the battery life to be pretty good. I wish the price was just a little lower, otherwise would have gave 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This shaver works wonders on my growing stubble beard. I haven&#x27;t tried to grow one before and this seems to be doing the job. Make sure you follow the battery instructions for first use. The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a very long charge otherwise.</li>
            <li> I wish it would not reset to the lowest setting every time, but I love how well it works at keeping my beard short.  I am amazed how short I can get my beard, it is almost down to a 5 oclock shadow.</li>
            <li> This is the best beard trimmer ever period. No more skin irritation, no irritating hair pulling. Just set the length you want in it&#x27;s magnificent LCD display and you&#x27;ll get a uniform length trimmed beard within a couple of minutes and that too without going over and over again at the same place. I read about a 100 reviews when I was looking for a beard trimmer. I chose this trimmer watching the video review on youtube and tell you what the video gets it right on the money. It&#x27;s that simple. Only con, if I have to point one, would be that you can set the length you want in multiples of 0.2mm only. So you&#x27;ll get 0.4mm to 0.6mm and so on and so forth. For me it does not matter a lot. It&#x27;s a stubble trimmer so dont expect it to be a all in one trimmer. It does what it meant to be and does is the best way possible.</li>
            <li> Adjusts better than expected.  Retains charge well.  Easy to use.  Highly recommended.  so far no issues.  The trimmer looks kool too.</li>
            <li> the hubby loves this product but it just broke and it&#x27;s a less than a year old.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad Amazon will let me returned it but it&#x27;s poor quality.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the logic of Conair. They have built a product that a lot of people want to use. But their build quality is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short story is, mine started malfunctioning after the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a product that is meant to be used in the bathroom, you&#x27;d expect it to be water proof, or at the very least, water resistant. This trimmer is neither. Water gets into it even if you do nothing that would be considered submerging it or taking a shower with it. Just by rinsing off the blade water can get inside the electronics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called customer service and here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;1. They expect me to pay the shipping to send it back&lt;br /&gt;2. They expect me to include money with the trimmer to they can use the money to pay to send me a new one if they choose&lt;br /&gt;3. The amount of time for them to choose to send me a new one is 6 weeks&lt;br /&gt;4. The serial number is not printed on the trimmer itself, it is on the power brick/cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how mine malfunctions:&lt;br /&gt;1. It thinks it is charging even when it isn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;2. The battery runs down as fast as it can -- as if I was using it continuously, even though the power is off&lt;br /&gt;3. Intermittently the blade size adjustment won&#x27;t work when I press the up/down buttons&lt;br /&gt;4. One time I couldn&#x27;t even turn it off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the crappy product decisions they made:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You have to charge the trimmer for 16 hours continuously before you use it&lt;br /&gt;2. You cannot use it while it is plugged in&lt;br /&gt;3. You cannot use it in the shower&lt;br /&gt;4. It is not water proof&lt;br /&gt;5. The serial number is not on the product itself&lt;br /&gt;6. Their return policy is a joke: the customer pays shipping both ways and has to wait for weeks to receive a new one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Conair, if you built this product with even a modicum of care, you&#x27;d probably make millions more dollars from loyal customers. As it stands, I&#x27;m going to get rid of your product and try a competitor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Works for face but cant get hairs under nose.  As for anywhere else, the setting is to close.  Sorry i bought it.</li>
            <li> The adjustable length feature is really nice. It cuts very well. It&#x27;s a little hard to trim under the nose, but if you come in from the sides, you can reach it. In the video, the guy flipped the plastic guard back to trim under his nose...if you do that, you will have a close shave under the nose instead of stubble like the rest of your face. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t store the length setting after you use it, so you have to set the length every time. At least it is easy to set the length with a few presses of the button.</li>
            <li> This is a good idea in theory, but it doesn&#x27;t work.  I used to use hair clippers with an adjustable trim level to get my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  I bought this thinking it would be an improvement over using hair clippers.  False!  These things take much longer to use that hair clippers.  I need to go over the same spot over and over again to cut the hair and it doesn&#x27;t get everything done evenly.  In addition, there are certain spots it just can&#x27;t get!  Like under the chin. Or close to the nose since the plastic guide hits my nose and I can&#x27;t shave the top of my moustache.  I&#x27;ve since gone back to my hair clippers.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money with this.  Whoever made it obviously doesn&#x27;t shave with it.</li>
            <li> I get bad razor bumps and ingrown hairs when blade shaving, so I typically use an electric shaver, or go for the stubbled look.  I&#x27;ve previously been using a Panasonic ES8103S (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DNE3KQ) and a Philips Norelco BG2030 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E0C9LI).  Each of these are &#x27;just okay&#x27; for me, the shaver misses hairs, and the body groomer (which, to be fair, is not rated for use as a shaver) is not wide enough and the guard is too thick to be usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could consider the product video advertising shillery, but it helped me make a purchase decision after seeing how close it could shave.  And it really does -- 0.4mm is the shortest it shaves with the guard in place, and it is a nice, short stubble that looks great for me.  The shave closeness is adjustable as the product information shows, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use it.  It really does glide easily over your skin as the video shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also haven&#x27;t experienced any significant issues regarding not being able to get my whole face.  I keep my hair fairly short so I can fade my sideburns into my hair without issues, but you may want to keep a trimmer or something along those lines for under your nose and your sideburns if you have a longer hairstyle, although I also find that probably overkill, as flipping up the guard for edging purposes is extraordinarily easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few other misc things:&lt;br /&gt;- Oil is included to lubricate the blade, and it is recommended doing so before shaving for the first time, but upon inspection mine seemed sufficiently oiled so I didn&#x27;t oil mine before starting shaving.&lt;br /&gt;- I do not know if you can wash the blade off under the faucet -- I&#x27;ve done it with every other shaver I&#x27;ve owned without any issues, but you might want to research it.  I plan on using the included brush for now.&lt;br /&gt;- Price.  I linked a bodygroomer earlier, it is currently twice the price of this.  Really the price for this facial trimmer is quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with this is I&#x27;d like my beard to be just a bit longer, and I have to get another device to do this. Otherwise this is easy to clean, simple and nice for 5 o&#x27;clock shadows..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for about month now and I&#x27;m really pleased with it. I always like to keep a bit of a stubble on and this trimmer keeps it really short and tight.</li>
            <li> I actually really enjoy using this trimmer. Gave me a perfect, hassle-free way to get the stubbly look that I wanted. It didn&#x27;t nick me, didn&#x27;t make me red, and it&#x27;s easy to adjust. Only problem is that it stopped working 3 months into ownership. It will hold a charge but when I press the power button nothing happens. The  unti still lights up but nothing. Disappointed! And I didn&#x27;t keep the receipt, so now I have to find something else and spend more money. Not cool.</li>
            <li> Great for beard or stubble trimming.</li>
            <li> easy to use, trims nicely</li>
            <li> I have owned many shavers including wahl/phillips ect ..this one is really good value for money and provides and nice clean height to your beard, only problem is its hard shave around under your nose/top lip. For that I have to un-clip the height adjustment guide and just hover over that area... no real big deal..you will see what I mean when you purchase one :)</li>
            <li> Bought in June, by August the &amp;#34;adjusting&amp;#34; slide stopped working altogether.&lt;br /&gt;After that, it continue to degrade until it ended up in the bin, terrible product.</li>
            <li> Until I bought and used the Conair GMT900, I had no idea how much difference in appearance would result from a trimmer that precisely cut all bristles to the same length.  The other trimmers I used left different lengths depending on the angle  the trimmer was held and the location of the hair on the chin or face whether it be on a flat, convex or concave surface.  The Conair delt with all areas similarly regardless of location or angle.  If there was one downside, you have to reset the desired length every time you star up the razor, only takes a few seconds though.</li>
            <li> After owning quite a few facial trimmers, I was eager to purchase this particular one. First off, it&#x27;s difficult to trim your beard, especially the hairs below your nose, as the unit is just too big. It requires multiple passes in order to get a perfect trim, and be sure to remember the last setting used because every time you use it, the unit resets itself to 0.4mm, which is the shortest available option. For the price, honestly, I&#x27;m a bit let down. I&#x27;ve had a Norelco that could less and performed much better than this unit. Oh well, I suppose that&#x27;s the way the cookie crumbles.</li>
            <li> The iStubble is definitely a handy shaver to have for beard control. Probably the best shaver in the market for stubble control however it doesn&#x27;t work as effective as expected in some areas. Like under the chin, I usually need to shave 2/3 times before it works. Other than that, its a good product and I recommend it for buyers wanting the most out of a shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift and he is loving it.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have returned because the battery won&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s charge. Will only work if it&#x27;s plugged in and stays plugged in.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked great for 6 months.  However a piece in the bladehead broke and now when I turn on the trimmer, the blade rattles everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping the Conair warranty will replace</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting the istubble to work as advertised, but I&#x27;ve had it for about a week now and have used it twice. It cuts much closer than I expected and very evenly too. This was exactly what I was looking for. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin either.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, wish the cutting blade was a little wider but otherwise great.  Face looks good after getting this.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not a good product. Cheaply made, doesnt last very long, unable to get a close shave. I dont recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 y.o. black male and as you know, most black guys have curly hair (duh) so I was a little skeptical about this working as well for me as it has for others. I love the one week stubble look but it sucks to have to shave my entire face + possibly deal with hair bumps just to maintain my \\&quot;look.\\&quot; Luckily, I came across this product and took a chance on it. I don&#x27;t regret it.  The iStubble can be set to a wide margin of lengths and helps me maintain the mature hipster look I&#x27;ve grown to love. It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair at all and it&#x27;s easy to set. The one con I do have is cleaning the trimmer, but that&#x27;s really not a problem if you learn how to use the brush provided in the packaging. Overall, the iStubble is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a while.</li>
            <li> So there seems to be a lot of confusion around this product, so its easier to state what it doesn&#x27;t do to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Its not a &#x27;complete&#x27; shaver system.&lt;br /&gt;2. Its not suitable for longer beards (0.4mm - 5.0mm is its total range).&lt;br /&gt;3. It doesn&#x27;t collect trimmings as you shave, so could be described as a &#x27;messy&#x27; shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its function is very simple - Its literally for achieving stubble and that&#x27;s it - period, nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its perfect for the stubble look and can achieve stubble from 0.4mm (looks like you haven&#x27;t shaved for a day) to 5.0mm...looks like you have shaved for a few weeks. Anything longer than that and you are firmly in the &#x27;beard&#x27; category and this is not the shaver for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its cuts well and cleanly. Its mono directional pivoting head glides over the surface of the skin easily / smoothly and I find that I only need 1 - 2 passes to collect most hair. Difficult areas such as rear jaw line (between neck and ear) might need a few more passes and a shaving mirror, but this is the case for all but a few shavers that have multi-adapting / contour following, flexible heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few different types of shaver that claim to offer a genuine stubble grooming solution and this is the only one that works REALLY well. It cuts cleanly, doesn&#x27;t pull / tug on hairs and is very easy to use straight out of the box. There really isn&#x27;t to much to it. Switch the unit on, push up / down using the buttons on the shaver to adjust the stubble cut length (0.2mm increments, as displayed on the LCD screen) and start shaving, that&#x27;s it. It is possible to remove the guard and use as a trimmer if required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor gripe would be that yes it doesn&#x27;t collect your hair as you shave....but it doesn&#x27;t claim to do this, so you cant really complain about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other minor thing is that you have to charge the device for 16 hours before you use it for the first time. This is so the battery is primed and will potentially have a longer life in general. Whether it does or not, I&#x27;m not really 100% sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But those really are minor points...its only $38!! Which is such great value... It feels like a very well put together unit and the motor driven adjustment system works really nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are after a &#x27;stubble look&#x27; and want to try out a few different lengths and styles there really is no better shaver on the market than this one at the moment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an adjustable for years. Now my search is over. This trimmer will trim facial hair and gives a great haircut to boot. Setting the trimmer to my perfect setting is very easy. The cutting head mows thru thick hair with little effort and without pulling.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone who wants to keep sideburns or a short goatee trimmed and nice looking, but for beards of ANY length it is just too messy and it takes longer to clean up everything then it does to actually trim your beard. For just about the same price you can buy another trimmer with a built in vacuum to collect all the hair...I wish I would have done this. My final though is this; that the functionality of this trimmer is actually excellent, as it keeps your stubble very even and looking good. It&#x27;s just way WAY too messy and gets hair absolutely everywhere.  PROS: Even trimming, fast, comfortable, digital display, self adjusting guard, looks great, long charge.  CONS: No built in vacuum which means it&#x27;s very messy, a bit expensive, difficult to clean completely, hair goes evrywhere while your trimming, very close settings actually scrap skin, no bag or way to store it.</li>
            <li> Excellent stubble trimmer!  Well built.  You can tell this is a good one by the weight and hum of the trimmer.  I wanted a serious product and I found it in the Conair GMT900 iStubble.  While I don&#x27;t have any complaints, I would have liked the trimmer to have allowed me to trim at longer lenghts.  It goes to the setting of 5.  But, if it did, then it would have been called a beard trimmer and not a stubble trimmer.  You&#x27;re going to like this one!</li>
            <li> This thing works great! I love that it is digital, and how the head bends with every arch of your face/head. For me it&#x27;s perfect when set on 5mm for shaving my head, besause it&#x27;s equal to a 1 1/2 at a barber shop. Also, folding the comb back to use the blade to trim the neckline, around the ear, sideburns &amp; close shave is nice beause you can&#x27;t lose the comb. Overall it&#x27;s great for keeping your beard, mustache &amp; hair short.</li>
            <li> I use this for the hair on my face, as well as what&#x27;s left of the hair on my head. The stubble trimmer lets me cut my hair much shorter than a regular hair trimmer, and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.  It is not possible to trim just below my nose, leaving a small patch of longer stubble, which I find frustrating. It adjusts extremely easily and cuts effectively, but I wish the battery lasted a bit longer and that the battery indicator was a bit more accurate. I would buy this again, I definitely think I get my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other comments here, I find .4mm very short--shorter than I&#x27;m used to. I find .6mm is closer to what I usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely agree with the upper lip issue. The head is just too big to go under your nose, so you get left with a very awkward little patch (think mini-Hitler stach). The other issue is that the head seems awkwardly attached, and fairly delicate. I&#x27;m afraid to toss it in my travel case like I would a normal razor. Definitely feels like it wouldn&#x27;t last long in that environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it does the best job on the rest of my face of any stubble razor I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer because it can shave stubble shorter than my norelco vacuum trimmer. I have a couple problems with it, though.  First of all, I have never used a trimmer like this that has ever cut my skin... until now. Since receiving it, I have cut myself several times...the cuts are deep and bleed for a while. I have never cut myself with any other trimmer that I have owned. The second problem that I have is with the height adjustment. Although it is cool, and electrically operated, the issue that I have with it makes me wish that it was just a regular comb. If I have it set to 1.5mm, trim, and return the next day to trim again, it defaults back to .4mm, causing me to shave much shorter than I intended. My regular manual combs stay at the same length no matter what. I am getting used to adjusting before I shave, but it has been a problem and I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that. I wish I could give it 2.5 out of 5 stars, but I figured I&#x27;ll take off a star for each problem.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great trimmer but I found out that it cannot be used plugged in to an outlet if the battery has little or no charge (at least with the one I have). What happens is it&#x27;ll turn on but then after some time the motor will slow down &#x27;till it stops. Being plugged in has no effect except charging it when it&#x27;s not being used/turned on. Once you turn it on it stops charging the unit and starts using battery power exclusively. I thought I had found the trimmer of all trimmers but it&#x27;ll be useless (it won&#x27;t turn on) once the battery dies permanently. A friggin&#x27; shame really.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been very difficult for me to find a beard trimmer that can allow me to get the short level of stubble I want. This has been the only one that works.</li>
            <li> The product does the job, but leaves a lot to be desired.  The battery has an extremely short life and constantly needs to be recharged.  When the trimmer is plugged in, it does not function, so you have to wait until it is fully charged to use it again.  Although the trimmer can keep you stubble extremely short, it cannot reach the hairs under your nose because of the design of the blade gaurd.  It also makes a big mess in your sink, although this is probably true for most beard/facial hair trimmers.  Overall, the product gets the job done, but leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> I dont normally write reviews but Im making a exception. This trimmer rocks!!!! I just got done trimming my face and head on the 1mm setting and cant believe what a great job its done. Very even trim on my head and face. Dont worry about getting under your nose....just kind of move your nose around and play at the angles of the strokes youre using. I may add that not not a hair was pulled and i was able to trim everything very quick and comfortably. Ive used many a trimmer and this beats them all hands down.</li>
            <li> Doesnt pull hair at all. love the .4mm length. It seems very well engineered. Finnaly I found something that will work for me because I always get ingrown hairs when I shave</li>
            <li> sturdily built, works well.  6/1/16 Update: The plastic hinged &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; has broken. Tried super glues and Bondic without sucess. Finally found that Gorilla Glue worked to make an acceptable repair. Although this is a current Conair product and the comb is easily replaceable, Conair does not have replacement parts.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have used</li>
            <li> The iStubble is amazing. I&#x27;ve used several different trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best hands down. It is smooth, soft on your face, doesn&#x27;t pull, and the trimmer and head unit glides over your face and cheek bones without pulling hair as it trims. I also get a really close trim with this iStubble making it look like I had shaved my face a day ago. Love this thing!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been in the middle of the \\&quot;Battle of the Beard\\&quot; for a while now. Too long and I look like a sloppy homeless man or a 1950s beat poet. Too short and I look like a loser who forgot to shave. I&#x27;ve tried many different buzzer trimmer things, ranging from your cheap $10 Wal-Mart Remmington trimmer to the $40 Wahl hair trimmer from Costco without the clip. The Wahl did a nice job, but this Conair \\&quot;iStubble\\&quot; (which may be the stupidest name for a product in human history) seems to rule the roost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable lengths are quite literal. I assumed that a .04 or .06 mm would leave my beard at a similar length but NOOOOO it took almost everything away, leaving behind, you guessed it, just-barely-shaved stubble. So here&#x27;s a pro-tip: work your way down to progressively shorter lengths until you&#x27;re sure you have the right length. Otherwise you&#x27;ll need to let it grow for a few days and in our impatient, \\&quot;me first me now\\&quot; society that can be a tough one. I&#x27;ve found that the 1.6 length is just about right for the half-beard that drives the fellas crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery seems to last for about two weeks. Plus it looks cool. Certainly better than the cheap-crap-plastic bad-battery-junk-falls-apart-doesn&#x27;t-cut stuff that they sell at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is perfect, I have had no problems with it.  I was a little skeptical before purchasing after reading some reviews about how it is difficult to hold, but it is not difficult to hold.  I have no cons about this product.  If you are even thinking about buying it, just buy it.</li>
            <li> Its pretty good- anything below 2.5 mm is what I&#x27;d call a heavy 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and the 3, 3.5 and 4 are great for that scruffy look. Excellent buy, no regrets.</li>
            <li> This thing was exceptionally easy to use, and very comfortable. Maybe it&#x27;s my face, but the trim tended to be a bit uneven, though.  The same length setting cut different lengths on different parts of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have carried on using it but I accidentally plugged the wrong A/C charger into it and now it won&#x27;t charge at all, so it&#x27;s essentially bricked. I decided to get the trimmer with the built in vacuum, because using this every other day left a constant mess of stubble around the sink, and I could never quite clean it all.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s adjustable but it still doesn&#x27;t add much variety in length.  I have to go over the same spots again to make sure it trims evenly.</li>
            <li> This item provided my brother with the close, attention detail shave he was craving while maintaining a long battery life and comfort. Super happy!</li>
            <li> Everything they say about it is true.&lt;br /&gt;This thing really works and is really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit tricky under the nose, and sometimes it can be hard to figure out just what length you need - you may over shoot it a couple of times. But you get the hang of it, and it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li> Awsome product.  It does the job and it is very easy to operate with.  Defenetly satisfied!  Great tool! buy buy</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband and he loves it.  Gives him the 5 o&#x27;clock shade that he loves.  But he did wish it had a shorter setting (like 0.1).</li>
            <li> i prefer simplicity. i dont need a digital readout for a beard trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any questions about this please don&#x27;t be afraid to ask me. I&#x27;d be more than happy to answer any and all of them.</li>
            <li> Had for a month now. Works pretty good. Cuts good. Not good at all for mustache.</li>
            <li> Easily adjustable and cuts just to the length I need. Can remove guard cover to trim sideburns or neckline.</li>
            <li> The best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Very very smooth. Easy to program for exactly the length of stubble you want. Easy to use. Easy to clean. Other reviewers who claim it cannot get under their noses are not trying hard enough. My recommendation: buy it. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> My brother requested this and I bought it for him for Christmas!  He was in love, no complaints and over a year later, the trimmer is going strong.  No complaints here!</li>
            <li> Excellent hair trimmer, works as advertised and has great battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a Toni and guy trimmer previously, and I am hAppy I found this one instead!</li>
            <li> 1. The other reviews are correct that the design of the tip does not allow the blades to reach the upper part of the mustache, near the nose. I have to trim the upper lip with a different shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The entire point of buying this was the adjustable length; brilliant idea, but terrible execution here. Mine broke within two weeks. Now, when I press the &#x27;up&#x27; button, It goes to the max setting. When I press the &#x27;down&#x27; button, it goes to the minimum setting. There is some malfunction where it will not set anywhere in between mountain-man and clean-shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I choose clean-shaven over mountain-man, and the blade cut a chunk out of my neck and I started bleeding. I&#x27;ve never been cut by an electric shaver before.</li>
            <li> After an extensive and thorough research, I settled to buy this Conair i-Stubble a year ago. With the regular daily use, I think this should give me enough credibility to review this trimmer with excellent judgement.&lt;br /&gt;  FACTS ABOUT i-STUBBLE&lt;br /&gt;Fact 1: This is a TRIMMER, NOT a shaver! It can bring your facial hair down to the very bare minimum but not &amp;#34;baby bottom&amp;#34; smooth kind of  shave. For sensitive skins with potential risk of stubs leading to shaving bumps, I will only recommend this trimmer if you are using it to maintain a beard (preferably a five o&#x27;clock shadow).&lt;br /&gt;Fact 2: The power is very good, especially when plugged in to an outlet, needless to say it still gets the job done when it is used without the cord plugged. With full charge for the first 4 months, it lasted about 20 to 30 mins (non-stop), after 6 months to a year, fully charged battery life can only sustain about 15 to 20mins...and it will continue to decline (every cordless trimmers have this problem).&lt;br /&gt;Fact 3: It is sturdy and the design is cool but definitely not a heavy duty trimmer that you will hand over to your son someday...the body is made with very nice hard plastic, however the very edge trimmer, especially the adjustable comb, is made with soft plastic which can easily break over extensive amount of usage.&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: THIS IS A WELL THOUGHT OUT TRIMMER WITH SATISFACTORY RESULTS. THE DESIGN IS GOOD. THE POWER IS VERY GOOD...(not great, in comparison to your barber&#x27;s clippers). THE PUSH BOTTON ADJUSTABLE COMB IS GREAT and precise!!!(except if you don&#x27;t push too hard against your face which can cause the soft comb trimmer plastic to bend, and that will lead to uneven trim). THE LCD LIGHT IS COOL TO LOOK AT.&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE IS I am not wowed by this trimmer, but I learned to love it because it delivers and gets the job done. You can trust it to keep your beard looking good in between barber&#x27;s visit, but you won&#x27;t be looking like the pretty boy in the poster. If youdecide to buy this trimmer or any other one...Be SMART! and Keep the warranty!!!</li>
            <li> Works great. Lasts a long time so no need to recharge too often.</li>
            <li> This device was exactly what I was looking for. I hate having a clean baby faced look. I don&#x27;t know why it took me all these years to finally buy a stubble trimmer! Also, when I shave close my skin always gets irritated. Especially when it is humid. My skin will get red. With this trimmer I just set it to 1.8 mm (two days of stubble for me) and I quickly and easily have a perfect stubble look. No skin irritation. I&#x27;ve been using this for a year and it works wonderfully. I like how you can shave while it&#x27;s plugged in charging. I could not do this with my old razor.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li> The best trimmer ever.  i need to charge it once in 2 weeks. the electronic adjustments work ike they should.</li>
            <li> It did a good job for all of 3 shaves. Went dead before the 4th. Followed all the instructions, charged for 16 hours before first use, cleaned after each use, kept away from water. It won&#x27;t run or even light the LED display. Customer service is inexistent. Will spend a little more for a Philips now.</li>
            <li> This is a really good trimmer. I read up on multiple reviews about it that were mainly positive. I really like it. It&#x27;s only downside as of now is that it is difficult to use in between the lip and nose area.</li>
            <li> Unsatisfied because the trimmer came with a bit of hair in it, as if it were returned by another customer. That is kinda disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t live in USA, so it would be more expensive to send the item back to Amazon, so I just gifted it to the guy who works in my office by cleaning up the hair that came in the box. The box also had kind of a white sticker on it, could be that this sticker is to denote that the item is used and has been returned. Had no usage manuals in it which suggests it was used as well, and well yea it had some blonde guy&#x27;s blonde beard in it.</li>
            <li> Closest stubble trimmer I&#x27;ve had. Good design too.</li>
            <li> I bought this facial trimmer, and it works great.  After a few minutes, you&#x27;re ready to face the world.  great</li>
            <li> It worked great when I got it....very nice trim that you can adjust. Although the charge you get only lasted for like 1 shave. My main problem was that after a month of using it, it just died. Went from a full charge to dead and hasn&#x27;t worked since. Checked with amazon and was just a few days from a refund. Unfortunately my wife threw my receipt and box that it came in out, so I couldn&#x27;t call the company. Yes partly my fault there. So to recap...if the razor hadn&#x27;t died and I lost all that money probably would have given it a 4 star review</li>
            <li> I bought it and tried to use it without any luck. Very difficult to maneuver. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had this trimmer for six months, and the battery will no longer charge. Trimming under the nose is also difficult, but I was willing to live with that because while it worked, the trimmer did a great job. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Now I have the Criockett miami vice thing all the time.  But the real kicker is my face is a lot happier since I stopped shaving.</li>
            <li> The product which I am using for almost 8 months and I haven&#x27;t faced any problems till now. This is not seen same as others which I bought from the stores that available outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this conair GMT900 is good for any one if you maintain the product very well.</li>
            <li> Love this razor. Tons of different sizes. 2 inches to .4. Great to maintain the perfect beard. I like the stubble look it gives me and so does my lady friend.</li>
            <li> I regret buying it. I did a lot of research and at the time was looking for a facial trimmer with 0.6 to 1 mm clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Batter lasts surprisingly long. I use it twice a week and charge approx. every month or so. I think I know why, though - it&#x27;s motor is simply powerless.&lt;br /&gt;- Clip height adjustment works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It just simply does not do the job of cutting hair. Trimming beard (maintaining a 2-day stubble) takes 10-20 minutes because you have to go through each and every spot over and over and over and over again. The device is cheaply made and the blades motor seems to be powerless.&lt;br /&gt;- The blades pull on hair if it&#x27;s longer than approx. 1.5 mm.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s noisy and vibrates more than one would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend buying GT900R product.</li>
            <li> From all the reviews, this looked like the shaver to beat; but unfortunately after trying this on a few different settings I was mistaken. The shaver works well, and is fairly quiet, but I found that any setting lower than 2.5 basically came close to a clean cut look. Plus, there is no real way to shave your mustache at the same length due to the size of the head attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search continues..</li>
            <li> Only thing missing is a shavings catcher. But cleaning is very easy. The trim is spotless. Couldn&#x27;t of been happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The iStubble does everything I need it to do, and does it well. The lowest setting is perfect for stubble, and 3.5 is perfect for the mustache and goatee. The floating head and sharp blades give nice even results. I only need a really small trimmer for nose hair and for around the ears. Well worth my money!</li>
            <li> I have had it for 4 months now and love it. It goes down to .4mm with the guard which is plenty close enough. The guard flips back allowing for even closer shaving and touching up. I like to maintain a stubble and this makes if effortless. So far the battery life has not been an issue and goes a couple weeks without recharging with everyday use from me. I have no complaints, especially for what I paid.</li>
            <li> The digital meter is frankly a silly and unnecessary gadget. However, it does cut very smoothly and cleanly, and with less irritation than any trimmer I&#x27;ve used before. I&#x27;d still like it to cut a little closer, though this is one of the (or maybe *the*) closest of the consumer-grade trimmers.</li>
            <li> Bad Battery.  Had to return it for a new one...The $5 shipping/handling fee sucks.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. I love it. If you don&#x27;t use it everyday the battery doesn&#x27;t really die that quick as I read in some of the other reviews (at least for me this is the case, it works fine). I just had to charge it for a very long time at first just like most of the other electric devices.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave anymore and haven&#x27;t for the  about the last 10 years. Just stubble as low as I can get it. Tried many different trimmers and the iStubble is by far the best.  Will not use anything else.  Hopefully they won&#x27;t stop making it</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about proper charging of the iStuble so I followed the directions and gave it a full 16 hour charge. The next day I got about 10 seconds run time out of the razor before the lights went out. I tried several more times and got about 1/5 of a second run time and all out... I plugged it back into the charger for 10 minutes and tried again, 1 second run time. I tried to use it as a corded razor and I guess it needs battery power as soon as I pushed the power button same thing, less than a second run time then lights out. I get the light when its charging and it shows battery 100%. Just got my return slip for a replacement so I will try this with one more unit before I thrown in the towel. From the specs and features, I really like it - let&#x27;s hope I have better luck on round 2.</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t work unless it is plugged in all the time. Pretty useless if you want to use it cordless.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this trimmer. After 1 year of use (once a week) it stopped trimming and made a clicking noise when turned on. Nothing I could do to get it to work.</li>
            <li> After trying several different trimmers, this item does manage to provide the right closeness I have been looking for. Not a big fan of the blade guard.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, couldn&#x27;t change lengths of blades.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great! It gives you any type of length you can imagine. It will not pull the hairs at all and does not irritate even at the lowest level. I use it to shave my head as well and it works great for that as well.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Works great but doesn&#x27;t seem to have a good setting to buzz the beard every couple days.  I buzz it about once every 5 days but that doesn&#x27;t allow the short &#x27;5 O&#x27;clock&#x27; shadow to be consistent.  However, it works for me.  For more meticulous people you may want to go a little more high end.</li>
            <li> Gift for son - didn&#x27;t use it much before he started having issues with it not cutting properly and I didn&#x27;t bother to return it as it was over a year.</li>
            <li> read lots of reviews of different products, even watched youtube videos on stubble shavers and settled on this one......happy i did. i love it. easy to use and clean. AND the price is the most reasonable! NOT disappointed at all!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for trimming. It&#x27;s excellent for that but not actual shaving  but I got it just for trimming so I am very happy with it</li>
            <li> I found this product to work perfectly as expected, even with my thick facial hair, and I like the range of cut lengths! Be careful when shaving, if you are prone to nicking yourself. If you take your time and give yourself a quality shave it should not be a problem!</li>
            <li> Apparently rims beard nice and short (it was a gift for someone).</li>
            <li> Pros: Many levels of stubble are possible. Pivots well enough to get under chin.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The blade broke after three months, had to toss the whole thing. Also, needs to be charged often. Not exactly an even cut (but better than your average beard trimmer). And a crude shave at that.</li>
            <li> Odd shaped head, but it works great.</li>
            <li> This was to replace a previous i-Stubble that my son really liked.  But this one is a dud -- it makes a horrible noise and pulled at his facial hair, injuring his face.  Sending this defective product back.</li>
            <li> I always keep the day old stubble and before I was scraping just a trimmer edge against my face to get it that short. It worked for years but what a pain in the ass  - it was definitely time for something purpose built and this was it. Smooth, comfortable and quick. What more can I ask for?</li>
            <li> Best. Stubble. Trimmer. Ever. And I have used many different styles and brands over the years. Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a few weeks so I cant comment on the battery life that a few people have mentioned, but overall this is a great product and I would highly recommend it. Its light weight and very easy to use. I will definitely get another when mine dies/breaks.</li>
            <li> 3.4/4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first one a few years ago 2011?). I did so because I always got shaving bumps. However, after using this (just used the blades straight on my hair/skin), my face no longer got shaving bumps! You can change the setting for the length. The battery worked fine for me. I had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because of how long I had my first one and how great it was. However, I ordered a new one because my first one would no longer charge. I did the whole charging thing and the razor part pulls on my hair :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited, and tried everything but I can&#x27;t use it anymore. It pulls and pulls and pulls on my hair.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Guys if you are looking to trim your beard in style all diff lengths... DO NOT GET THIS BUZZER. Only thing it&#x27;s good for is taking of one length just like on buzzer very short cut don&#x27;t not buy waste of money.. Your welcome</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for almost 4 years now. I use it alot. Its not for a clean shave. It is to maintain short stubble. This is so hard to do. Too much and you look like a bum, and too little you look like you just didnt shave. While other reviews say that the settings are not true to what length the blade actually cuts your beard to, well maybe, but just experiment with it a few times and youll find a length that you like. Or you can layer, by moving up the beardline on incrimentally shorter settings. Theres like 8 different settings so it will create a smooth fade. I personally have never once never cut myself with this machine, even with the guide off, upside down, whatever. The only thing is that you must tap out the shavings periodically or use the brush it comes with. And also keep it maintained and drop a few drops of oil on the blade every 5 times you shave. And its not waterproof, so dont get it wet. Thats really my only gripe is that its not waterproof. Although i have gotten it wet a few times and it will dry out in like 2 days, and it keeps kicking just like before. so overall, its very consistent and it wont pull or cut you, even with the guide off. If you finish up the edges of your beard with a few swipes of your disposable razor, it will naturally grow in in two days and your stubble look will be on point. ****</li>
            <li> trims just as i need it to trim, i like how you can adjust just by clicking the up or down button for a perfect time,</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 4 weeks, then the plastic that holds down the spring in the cutter assm. fractured. Conair customer service was of little help, and requires the entire unit to be shipped back to be repaired. I now wished that I had heeded the warning from others about Conair.</li>
            <li> I would buy again and would recommend, but it can be improved.   I would have given 5 stars but:   It does not catch your hair so you need a vacuum nearby    The battery wears down kind of quickly and it can&#x27;t be used while plugged in   The length setting is reset every time you turn it on.   It doesn&#x27;t come with a secure travel case, but putting it inside a shoe seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I waited to write a review for a few reasons, I read some that were so strange to me, then I read some that sounded too good to me. I was used to an old Remington MB-300 that I used for many years with great results. I would still use it, it works but the plastic cap that controls the cutting hight has a tooth missing and no replacements in sight. So I tried a TRYM ll, I tried another Remington and was going to try the Norelco, what I found with the first 2 was that I could not get the cutting low enough. Now I do not have stubble, I have a beard but a close cropped beard. Some of the bad reviews come from people that want to have like an hour of stubble showing, other bad reviews form people that set this too low (easy to do) and then had no beard. The settings can be very low, .4 is too low to even consider for me, but for a close stubble look I assume it would be fine. I set it at 1.8 for what I wanted, 1.6 was really too low (it makes that much of a difference). 1.8 for beard, 2.5 for mustache and I am good to go. You do have to open it up and get the hair it has collected out if you have a long beard, I can empty it at the end of a trim. It is not perfect but it is very good. I thought the price was a tad high, I see they have the model before this one with manual height controls for just over $20 but I have this one now and it does not say what the cutting heights on that one are. All in all this is a good choice but be careful how you set it, test it by going high first and take it down in increments.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these. One for my summer residence and 1 for home. The batteries in the one for home will not hold a charge. The other one was fine. It works great when it works.</li>
            <li> Feels like it is build with quality in mind.  Trims good at all advertised lengths.  Battery last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend always uses this to trim his beard. It works great for keeping a controlled, rugged look. It also works great for trimming the bikini line.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well and does it drop, but who designed the charging system? The problem is that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t retain a charge -- there is no way to \\&quot;turn it off,\\&quot; so to speak. You charge it fully, and it supposedly will have 45 minutes of power. Well, it usually takes &lt;10mins to use. Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t mean you have 35 minutes left on the charge. You will have to keep it charging until you need to use it again. Additionally, not sure the sizes are entirely accurate, and I wish it could go down to .2mm. The sizing had no effect on my rating, though.</li>
            <li> The iStubble precision is incredibly accurate! I was skeptical at first about it&#x27;s usefulness (i.e. why would I want something that doesn&#x27;t completely shave?)but now it has a permanent spot on counter-top. A definite buy!</li>
            <li> Of all the silly things in life, all I wanted was to maintain my &#x27;stubble&#x27;.  The Conair GMT900 does just that.  It works well, and keeps me looking the way I want to.</li>
            <li> I received this facial hair trimmer through the Amazon Vine program and it really does a great job of trimming my beard down to very light stubble without looking patchy or uneven.  The head glides smoothly, and feels very comfortable against my skin.  The length choices are good for people with longer facial hair needing to achieve a \\&quot;darker\\&quot; or more full look, but keep everything neat, clean and intentional stubbly is the name of the game here.  Great item.</li>
            <li> It basically works. It is hard to trim the upper mustache part given the design. But it does work well.&lt;br /&gt;oiling the blades thing is kind of annoying, but I appreciate them telling me how to make this long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have owned so far.  (Previously have used Wahl x1, Norelco x3, and Remington x1.)  The design allows me to finish the job in a quicker time, and the parts seem tough.  I have used this several times per week for 90 days now, and my results continue to be superb.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone needing a good beard trimmer.  I have my hair buzzed off, so I also use this to trim my head, too.  Works great.  (It is for stubble/very short looks.  the max is 5mm)</li>
            <li> Pretty Sweet. This is the second one I have bought, because my roommate was using it so I was just like whatever you can have this one and i&#x27;ll get a brand new one. The one I gave him was about 3 years old and still worked perfectly. I just liked the trimmer so much that I decided to buy another one without even looking at the alternatives. (bad choice?) Has good adjustable settings, I would say its for those who like to keep a 5oclock shadow going or to trim it close but not clean shaven. you can remove the guard thing to get an even closer shave. But this is not for the man looking to be completely clean shaven every morning. Blue LED light is cool which monitors the battery and the adjustable level for length. I usually use the lowest just to shave any growth off. I&#x27;d buy it again if it ever broke (or another roommate steals it)</li>
            <li> i love to have certain hair length on my face. this is great product which allow me now to control facial hair length on my face</li>
            <li> I really like the way this one cuts. I generally use it on the longest setting (5.0) because the shorter ones make a light beard invisible but that&#x27;s just me. It is easy to adjust, cuts cleanly, and has been easy to clean. Includes a nice brush. holds the charge reasonably well; I generally use it 1-2x/week and go several weeks between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can flip the spacer off to use it for trimming along the edge of your beard, but I didn&#x27;t find this as nice because it was hard to see exactly where I was holding it and when trimming the edges I want a pretty precise cut so I often use my old plug-in trimmer for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major caveat I have is that the head unit is relatively fragile - I tried taking it with me on a trip and the second trip it knocked the adjustment out and despite very carefully disassembling and reassembling that part, I could see that it was not perfectly aligned and was no longer cutting evenly or at the height specified. Maybe if you very carefully wrap it in clothing (or better, ensure that the head can&#x27;t press against anything) you&#x27;d be ok, but I would advise against putting it in a suitcase unless you put it back in the original package.</li>
            <li> Got this and used it for one week before the entire LCD screen crapped out.  I cant figure out what setting its on or  what the battery level is at.&lt;br /&gt;Save you money.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer and does everything that it said it would. Gives a much closer trim than my Philips-Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is the the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. Battery life is great and the digital settings make getting the perfect trim easy and fast.</li>
            <li> Works well, great gradation in stubble length allowing for easy experimentation to find the look best for you.&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned before, doesn&#x27;t get that area about a 1/4&amp;#34; under your nose because of the guide, you have to trim that yourself with a few snips of the scissors, but not really an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine does not fling hair everywhere in the bathroom like others report, but generally collects in the trimmer and comes out with a shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my selection, and so is my girlfriend, as she enjoys stroking my face.</li>
            <li> I wanted a trimmer to keep my facial hair as short as possible.  Buying mens razors and shaving gel every few weeks gets expensive.  Was worried about battery life but have had it now for 6 months and it is fine - if you follow manufacturers instructions for charging you won&#x27;t have any issues.  Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great idea, poor execution. I read all the reviews and thought I would take my chances because I like the idea, so I ordered this trimmer and followed the directions exactly. Charged for 16 hours, but it wouldnt turn on when it was supposed to be done charging. I tried to charge it again, and found that the trimmer would actually stop charging and turn off after about 4-5 seconds of being plugged into the wall. It doesnt even work while plugged into the wall directly, it stops working and pulls the hair out of my face. I talked with customer service and they told me there was nothing they could do. Clearly a faulty battery that needed to be returned.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts through multiple shaves, the LCD screen is very helpful, and trimming facial hair is now a breeze!</li>
            <li> The best beard trimmer I have ever owned.  I use it all the time.  I recommend this purchase to anyone.</li>
            <li> The shaver works great, however the charge cannot last through one shave, the warranty makes me cover shipping and takes 4-6 weeks and maybe longer.  I need to shave before that 4-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should pay for the shipping if their product fails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product EXCEPT it&#x27;s extremely difficult for me to get the hair under my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of beard trimmers trying to get the closest shave while keeping the perpetual 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.  This is the closest shave I&#x27;ve found while keeping on the comb attachment.  It gives a smooth shave, no nicks or hair tugging.  I shave every other day and a charge lasts a few weeks.  Don&#x27;t forget that this is not a self-lubricating razor, you do need to oil the blades once per month.  Biggest complaint is that the comb is big and you have to take it off to shave close quarters like under the nose.</li>
            <li> Better than I was expecting  best trimmer  no tugging or pulling  works perfect  I would highly recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Cuts well but I hate that it automatically goes down to 0.4mm when you turn it off for 30 seconds. I lost my beard once because I started trimming again. Never made that mistake again.</li>
            <li> This facial trimmer was everything I excepted and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. If you are looking for an electronic trimmer with various settings then the iStubble is what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> Earlier this year, I started getting positive feedback about how I look with three-day-scruff.  The only way I knew to get it was to shave clean and wait three days, so I started researching beard trimmers online.  I&#x27;ve now had the istubble for about four months and love it.  It is incredibly easy to use, allows very simple yet precise control of stubble length, and let&#x27;s me get my stubble to the length I want in about one minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a little more time if I want precise trimming around my nose, but I find this is true of any trimmer with a guard; your nose is simply too close to your mustache! It does passable duty as a body hair trimmer, but if that&#x27;s your primary purpose, there are better choices out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I talked through the guy that cuts my hair, and we figured out the different settings of the istubble are equivalent to a professional trimmer (e.g., Wahl) with something like 12 removable guards. He said he does like the removable guards for hair, but the shortest length removable guards often slip so even the pros have to be very careful using removable guards when doing stubble. The Istubble is a much easier system for us grooming at home.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after reading the great reviews. Was debating between this model and the Philips Norelco QT 4070 but liked these features a bit better. After getting the unit and doing the initial 16 hr charge, found the unit motor wasn&#x27;t working. Adjustable guide worked fine, but cutting motor wouldn&#x27;t activate. A call to Conair Customer Care couldn&#x27;t resolve the issue and they said to return product. Doesn&#x27;t inspire a lot of confidence in a product that gets shipped DOA. Now have to decide if it was just a freak occurrence that I got a DOA unit, or should I just go with the other option (QT4070).</li>
            <li> Would be a great trimmer if the battery worked.  I am able to use it while its plugged in though.</li>
            <li> great beard trimmer.  nothing else you could ask for in a trimmer thats not in this.  very easy blade length to set and battery charge lasts me 3 days (3 shaves).  purchased this 6 months ago and havent had any issues at all with trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT BUY OVERALL!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find something like this that shaves close enough for some stubble so I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m 12 and this does the job.  I put it on the .4mm setting for a little bit of stubble and it shaves perfectly to get that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. The settings and cut are right on.&lt;br /&gt;The under nose trimming is the only  downfall but I am getting the&lt;br /&gt;hang of it.</li>
            <li> My brother used it to shave his head and thought it was going to be too narrow.  It worked fine, however, for a couple of months and then quit working.</li>
            <li> I have used this product flawlessly for 18 months now. As a beard and stubble trimmer it works great. I love the digital control to adjust the length. Very easy to adjust for different lengths depending on your mood or needs. I have found it very reliable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLUSES: The comb is gentle on the skin, it holds a charge for a long time (I use it once to twice a week and have only had to charge it about 9 times in the 18 months), and it is quick and easy to use and clean. Still holding a charge pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MINUSES: It can be messy, and it is only fair in the mustache area. I frequently stop and empty the hair which minimizes the mess. This doesn&#x27;t slow me down that much (still done in 5 minutes or so). I shave over a trash can to catch the excess, since it was a bit messy in the sink. You will need to pull the comb back and use the bare metal blade to trim around the lips and under the nose. It is not really a great body trimmer yet I have used it in a pinch (when on the road) and was satisfied with the result. I would buy this product again (if needed). Hope this review helps someone else.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a couple of weeks now and it works just as advertised! I really like how simple it is to adjust the razor and also how long the charge holds for. I have zero complaints so far and am recommending it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Read a lot about this online. It was a bit more expensive than others, but I must say it&#x27;s great. Nice and tidy design too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have long facial hair (it&#x27;s more bum fluff) and I have sensitive skin, but it was a perfect shave. Smooth shaving very accurate. Had no problem shaving under my nose, which some people stated and I have a big nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+ Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> This machine is great. Electronic input for desired hair length that actually stays in place with even all around shave. Charge has lasted me an entire month with about 2 hours of usage every week. (Sounds like a little but this trimmer makes quick work of facial hair) it seems durable, It slipped into the sink while the faucet was running and it still works fine. Great trimmer to invest in, gives that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look effortlessly ( I would recommend using 1.4 mm setting or below for this look)</li>
            <li> The benefit is that I can maintain a beard at any length.  The drawbacks is that it doesn&#x27;t hold power for more than three uses before I have to recharge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now and it&#x27;s worked out great for me. You have to charge usually after three or four shaves, which isn&#x27;t bad at all if you&#x27;re only shaving down stubble a few times a week. I&#x27;ve no problems with it cutting me whatsoever. Once you learn which length you prefer the best, it&#x27;s great. The floating head is really helpful for those tricky parts under the neck, my other trimmers could never reach those parts evenly.</li>
            <li> Worked great (for about a month) then terrible grating sound and never would trim unless I held the guard down half way with a finger. THe other complaint are valid. Maybe they will fix it. Mine was too late to send back via Amazon Prime and the Conair return policy, or I would have. Nice concept, poorly executed I think.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer works great for about the first 3-6 months then you will see a huge depletion  of battery life.  Do Not use the trimmer while your wet, if the smallest amount of water gets behind the display it will fog up and not work.  As of now the trimmer will no longer adjust and will only stay running for about a second after it is turned on.  If your made of money and want to buy a new one every 6 months, then not a bad product.  I figured I would at least get a couple years out of the item, HUGE LETDOWN!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever used, in fact this is my second one, the first doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s charge after 3 years of use.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about how comfortable this thing was. It&#x27;s all that and more. I shave at 1.4 and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to cut yourself. Plus it give you that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look. I read other reviews that complained about it not being strong enough. I think the opposite. It shaves quickly and efficiently while also being nice and quiet. It also doesn&#x27;t throw hair all over the place which makes for easy clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it can&#x27;t get those hard to reach places like the crease under the nose. For a complete shave I use this for 90 percent and then a precision Mach 3 for the rest. But for stubble this thing is King.</li>
            <li> All I gotta say is this thing rocks! Gets it shorter then my last trimmer, no problems getting everything cut low. Easy to use, make sure you fully charge before use.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my boyfriend and he swears by it. He is extremely picky about having the perfect trim and has tried multiple trimmers ranging from high end items to practical ones and this is his favorite by far. It has reduced his trimming/ shaving time because of how great it works every time. Great product.</li>
            <li> Being 21, I&#x27;ve not had much experience with beards.  (Although some kids have beards at 15 years old!).  I researched for a long time to see what would be the best to maintain a constant stubble.  I opted with this and have been using it for about 6 months and it has been working great!!  Love how you can adjust the height with a click of a button.  Would definitely recommend this to friends</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a great stubble trimer for years now and really thought this would be the one, based on the previous reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed by how uneven the trim is (I tried using at 2 and 2.5mm), leaving patches of lighter beard on the middle of my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Also, as pointed out already, it&#x27;s quite impossible to trim below the nose area since the guard is too big (and even taking it out doesn&#x27;t really allow you to trim as desired).&lt;br /&gt;Will return it and continue my search.</li>
            <li> This is not gonna give you a close shave. Exactly what I wanted. Keeps me with a shadow all the time, which is what I like. Gets close enough to go to work without anyone complaining. Also does a decent job shaving other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> if I could give this a negative review I would, bought this and straight out of the box, I knew it couldn&#x27;t be good, it worked then the next day it didn&#x27;t, went to use it again, it worked again, it would pick moments that it wanted to work and not work, was going to send it back and it started working again, have only had this a few months and only used about 1 time a week for basic trimming and it is now completely crapped out, I got a new one today that im very happy with and is very sleek and come charged straight out of the box this is the one I would recommend now: TRYM II - The Rechargeable Modern Hair Clipper Kit - Ultra-sleek Hair, Body, Mustache, and Beard Trimmer Looks Great in Any Bathroom - AC Adapter, Base Dock, and Trimming Attachments Included which I just gave a 5 star review for</li>
            <li> I like the stubble trimmer.  The only place it doesn&#x27;t trim well is the upper lip under my nose.  The guard blocks the blade from getting close, so that hair doesn&#x27;t get trimmed.  Every week or so, I have to pull the guard back and carefully trim up that area.  Other than that, this has been a great razor.</li>
            <li> Great product, still messing with it to get the perfect trim.  Only complaint would be that it&#x27;s really hard to EVENLY trim as it sometimes required you to go over the same section repeatedly but this could be user error.</li>
            <li> I am actually in the process of having to order something else as this just doesn&#x27;t work for trimming under your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing needs a huge clearance (just look at the size of the guard on the picture!) and no matter how you try to shape your face - there&#x27;s just not a way you can get those hairs right under your nose, so if you&#x27;re trying to go for that multi-day stubble look from longer hairs, you end up looking like Hitler...so then you just end up having to shave everything because you look like a freak...defeating the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice how neither Conair video provided shows them shaving between the nose and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like they initially designed this for body hair or something where the clearance doesn&#x27;t matter and someone who doesn&#x27;t have a nose at Conair corporate decided to position it as a face trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of using a riding mower that can&#x27;t get within 2 feet of things in your yard. While technically you could still use it to mow your yard and then go back around with some push mower or weed eater, I&#x27;d prefer to have one precision mower instead of having to come back in with some other tool to get the weeds that this thing (due to poor design) can&#x27;t handle.....esp when we&#x27;re not talking about a huge yard and a mower but your face.</li>
            <li> Works great, use it twice a week. The adjustable settings are excellent and it is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> While the trimmer seems awesome and works very well,  I ordered the bonus item and was under the impression it would have an additional attachment.  Otherwise very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This worked fine for a while, I even liked the design but the battery life kept getting shorter and shorter (yes I did the initial obligatory 14 hour charge).  They warrantied it quickly and without issue.  The second one would turn off randomly which is borderline terrifying in the middle of the night.  After about a month of that it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge.  I could probably warranty it again but frankly it&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr - two separate trimmers, both defective batteries, not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Great for goatees and beards. DO NOT use to try and thin down your mustache. it will shave it off no matter what the setting you have it set on.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this a couple months ago, but I decided to wait to review it until I had some time with it to see how I liked it. I have to say this is hands down the best trimmer I ever used. I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few different brands and run the price range on them. This is the one that impresses me most. I keep a very short stubble beard (slightly more filled in for the goatee area). I use ti with the guard off so I can&#x27;t reaaly vouch too much for the various settings, but using ti with the guard off produces exactly the look I want. For my goatee area, I use the .04 setting which works well. I don&#x27;t really find this trimmer makes a big mess and it is very easy to clean, the blade snaps out and back in very easily. It charges very quickly and I like the fact I can quick charge if it runs out before I finish. On a side note, I have very thick beard hair and I have had no problem with this trimmer cutting/hurting in any way.</li>
            <li> This product is absolute garbage. I purchased this from amazon a few days ago and it died after one use. When I received it i plugged it in for 16 hours as the manual says, and then used it once. It worked fairly well and was pleased until i tried to use it the next day and was completely dead. Confused as to why the battery didn&#x27;t last longer than a single use, I plugged it in and a white screen came up on the display. It will not charge or turn on or anything, and am stuck with a useless paperweight. Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> It cuts hair but it doesn&#x27;t make it easy. Terrible at getting the angles on sideburns and as far as shaving my upper lip, it&#x27;s near impossible to get it all.</li>
            <li> I really hate shaving and have not used a blade in years.  I was also getting tired of my electric razor and have been skipping more days.  This trimmer was what I needed.  It has allowed me to shave every few days but keep a little stubble and that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.  Also, I participated in Movember and grew a full beard this time and this trimmer was fantastic when I shaved down into my mustache of choice to end the month.  I agree with other posts that it is messy but knowing that you are prepared and it is not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not perfect, this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned yet.  I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- nothing to clip on / attach... it&#x27;s all built in&lt;br /&gt;- micro-adjustment is fantastic; much more precise than mechanical adjusters&lt;br /&gt;- uniform shave across most curved areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- like the name says, this is for stubble or short/neat beards.  Doesn&#x27;t go long enough for long beards.&lt;br /&gt;- never, ever reaches the area right under my nose; I have to finish with scissors</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a trimmer like this for years. I have also been dealing with breakouts caused by shaving and trimmers for years also and this is my best yet! Like someone else mentioned you may need another trimmer to do edge work. You can&#x27;t have it both ways in my experience. I use this and another com air trimmer with great results. I will not take a star  away for this because of the exceptional value and performance of this device. Even if it only lasts a year I will gladly but another at this price. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who likes the \\&quot;too cool to shave every day\\&quot; look...he really likes that he can adjust the closeness and finds this razor comfortable to hold and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an effective way to get the fashionable 5:00 shadow look. I found it. The unit is solidly built and does what it says it will do. I&#x27;m not sure why it has to be so large, but it does feel good in the hand. I wish it came with some sort of stand, but overallim very happy with this purchase. No razor burn, easily controlled stubble length, and well built.</li>
            <li> It was ok. I have had better. Will not buy another</li>
            <li> Best electric shave for stubble Iâ€™ve ever had. Perfect stubble length every dayâ€¦&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the unit stopped holding a charge after two weeks and would only come on for less than a minute. After seeing postings here complaining of the same, I assumed the battery was the culprit. The battery is soldered on and must be removed carefully, but you can find a replacement at Radio Shack for under $7 bucks. Now it works like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Battery: 2.4V 600mAh NiMH&lt;br /&gt;Replacement Battery (Radio Shack 2302374): 2.4v 650mAh NiMH</li>
            <li> One stop shop for all facial hair needs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shortest length is that slight shadow while the longest is sufficient enough for a decent sized beard. With the guard removed it gives some precision cutting</li>
            <li> I have owned one of these for about two years, and I recently bought one for my younger brother as a gift.  My skin is rather sensitive to a straight razor, but I havent had to use one since getting the iStubble.  I am a salesman, so looking my best is very important.  It measures in millimeters, and gives you that nice short, rugged, yet professional shave every time!</li>
            <li> I just trim my beard all the way to .4 all around, it leaves some hair greater than .4 so uneven trimming but I do have one of the toughest or hardest beards so maybe it works better for others. Also heavy to hold. The beard measurer or protector comb doesnt come off totally so it gets difficult to trim near the ears.</li>
            <li> I looked and looked and researched all kinds of different trimmers before I decided on this one.  My husband has a beard and I really like when he has the &amp;#34;hasn&#x27;t shaved in 2 days&amp;#34; look the best and I wanted a trimmer that would cut close enough for him to achieve that look. This one does the job.  He loves that he can set it on whatever length he wants.  He uses it all the time.  We also bought a duplicate so he can trim &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; areas of his body.  All in all, we are very happy with our purchase.  It stays charged for a very very long time between uses.  The only thing that kinda annoys me is that it holds so much hair, so every time he sets it down hair falls out of it so there&#x27;s usually whiskers all over the bathroom sink.  I HATE that!!! But what I&#x27;ve started doing is banging it on the side of the garbage can until all loose hairs are off of it and then sticking it in his bathroom drawer. That seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I first bought the BabyLiss i-stuble trimmer (which really looks identical by the way), and it did not work (just didn&#x27;t charge), so I had to return it.  Then I ordered this one.  So far so good.  Really does trim to 0.4mm, although it&#x27;s just a tad longer than I would have liked - it basically gives me that full 2 day look, which is great, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s a comfortable stubble.  So basically I have to use it daily to keep it up.  But it&#x27;s easy, doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate skin. Tough for hard to reach places and the mustache area, so you have to go over it several times.  But overall very decent - it certainly does what &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; 1mm trimmers don&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to charge for a full day before using and use the first (and second and third) charge fully, before recharging.  The bummer is that if the first charge runs out in the middle of use, you canNOT use it while the charger is hooked up.  So I would say after two full uses, let it run and just let the battery die and recharge.  Hopefully after three charges, this problem will go away.</li>
            <li> This razor worked well for about 2 months, then the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough for a shave.  It would stop in the middle of a job and yank hairs from my face.  It hurt so bad I threw it across the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Very cool shaver does a excellent job.</li>
            <li> I actually Love the product but it broke 4 months after purchase from amazon... Conair refuses to warranty it even though it has a 2 year warranty - and im only 4 months in with proof of purchase.  They claim it is from date of manufacture... I asked to speak to a supervisor - I was told that i would get a call from one in 24 hours.. that was 6 days ago.. I cant believe that i can get better service from a no name fly by night company that Conair - oh well - Better Business Bureau here i come&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy this if you expect them to honor their warranty at all.  Other wise its a great product for 4 months but a bit pricey for that short of a lifetime</li>
            <li> best trimmer it is very good especially if u want to avoid shaving it gives me a clean shave look at 0.4mm!</li>
            <li> Awesome stubble trimmer, since I no longer have to use the shaving gel and razors since just go with the stubble look. I use the .4 inch setting on neck, and the 1.6 or 1.8 on the rest and works great for me. Two complaints that takes it from a 5 to a 4 star is the mess it makes. Does not catch the hair but instead just drops all the tiny shavings all over the sink. If I was single and had my own apartment no big deal, but with a wife who wants clean bathrooms I am constantly being asked to clean up the mess. Hopefully they fix this going forward. And the other complaint is doesnt get right under the nose, so have to just pull back the guard and trim it up with the razor. But other than those 2 things great buy! I would buy again and would upgrade if they fixed the above 2 problems.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer.  Not as versatile as my old Norelco but it cuts much more evenly and reliably giving me a better look. Easy to use with minimal risk of &#x27;user error&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides are the lack of a good way to do edging (I use the small-tip from my old Norelco for that), plus I think it would work better/faster if it had a bit more powerful battery.</li>
            <li> I only keep a short stubble/5 o&#x27;clock shadow,  so I wanted a device only for that purpose.  For that sole purpose, it&#x27;s the most comfortable device I&#x27;ve ever used. I keep it on the shortest setting of .4 mm and it&#x27;s fast, easy, no cuts, no irritation, no creams/gels needed afterwards.  You can flip the guard down to reach under the nose area.  The question is, how long will it last...but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this guy, but it turned out to be an epic fail.  The trimming isn&#x27;t precise.  There were many uneven spots left after trimming.  You really have to be careful when you&#x27;re trimming, too, because you will get scraped.  To top it all off, after 3 weeks of use it won&#x27;t take a charge and is now a useless paper weight.  I just purchased the Philips Norelco QT4070 /41 and it blows this one out of the water.  Norelco is an extremely even trim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working great for my beard and mustache.  I like being able to select the length of the cut - a great feature for an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;Rob</li>
            <li> Arrived with the oil exploded all over everything. Absolutely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a great one, the product was as described and works perfectly.  Was shipped to Canada and i was not charged any customs or additional fees, cheers</li>
            <li> Leaves a touch of stubble.  Takes about 15 seconds in the am to trim up.  Oddly large head, but works better than other options tried.  I don&#x27;t see many of these out in stores, which makes me nervous that they&#x27;ll discontinue the product.  Hence the review ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First lasted almost 2 years.  Dropped in the sink into water a few times.  Last time it got a full soak, and that kind of did it.  Got another one.</li>
            <li> It trims great but is hard to clean due t the guard not being removable.  It is also difficult to trim hair on your upper lip near your nose because the guard gets in the way.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair face!</li>
            <li> The i-Stubble works perfectly for my needs, allowing me to go from a full beard down to the perfect length of stubble in just minutes. The design allows for easy maneuverability over the contours of your face and for easily lining up around sideburns or other close areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade slips off easily for cleaning and the device is easy to clean. It also seems to hold a charge well, but can also be powered by the cord if it dies in the middle of using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.  The electronic length adjustment works fine,  it can give you a real close &amp;quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;quot; to a nice long stubble..  It give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t so hard to use on your upper lip.  The &amp;quot;super&amp;quot; model has a neat new display that counts down the remaining battery time in minutes.  It looks as though they did a little re-design of the comb, which is good because I broke 2 using the prior model.  Oddly, the comb isn&#x27;t user-replaceable, so you have to send it to Conair for replacement (they have great customer service though).</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have ever owned.  I like the multiple length settings, especially the shadow look. I use the shaver for about 2 minutes in the morning and done; so much easier than shaving every day for work. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this razor.  If you want a perfectly clean shave, this might not be the one for you.  I like to keep a shadow at all times so it&#x27;s perfect for me.  The only thing I wish it had was an area that catches shaved hairs.  My previous shaver had that and it saved a lot of mess on the sink.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer but be warned the battery tends to fail on these units fairly quickly. I did proper charge/discharge cycles(even though li-ion batteries dont need it) and within a few months the battery would just die after minimal use. It works fine once you connect the charge but it does defeat the purpose of having a cordless trimmer. The trimmer works great otherwise, the longest length is 5mm so this is only good for stubble(hence the name) and short beards-- those with longer beards look into the norelco beard trimmers. The conair also works great at the lowest setting when you push the trimmer guard all the way back. I&#x27;d still recommend this but just be aware of the battery issue..</li>
            <li> The product quit working after 4 months and am waiting for replacement from Conair.</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of this trimmer. The spring loaded comb that is supposed to contour to your face kind of stinks. It&#x27;s not really worth it cause I end up taking my index finger and holding it down while I trim my face. I have to do that especially when trying to trim above your top lip and below the lip. I&#x27;d rather have a non-movable trimmer right in there. This is my 2nd one because my first one the blade and spring assembly just completely popped out and it was nearly impossible to replace myself. I contacted con-air and they sent me a brand new one. Although I had to pay for shipping on the unit I sent back and the unit they sent me. It was a great idea and it does work but personally I would of spent my money on another normal trimmer with the clip on adjustments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked shaving, as it always irritates my face (both handheld &amp; electric).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is perfect!  Even on the lowest setting it cuts very cleanly and does not irritate my skin. I&#x27;ve also used it to pull off some extra low fades on my hair, it goes way lower than a standard clipper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it away from water though, I figured rinsing off the head wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal but I almost fried this thing.  Luckily after airing it out for a day it started working again.</li>
            <li> Still using it after 2 years its very good product and trims perfectly.</li>
            <li> total waste of money.  bought for christmas, was used a few times- made grinding noises and wouldn&#x27;t cut.  got a replacement in June of 2014.  used twice and didn&#x27;t cut and basically was useless. called conair they couldn&#x27;t do&lt;br /&gt;anything for me.  threw it in the garbage and will never buy conair again.</li>
            <li> As an asian person it is hard finding a shaver to make me look like I have really thick facial hair.  With this, I can put different lengths on different parts of my face and it makes it look like I can grow a majestic beard.  The hair on my face is thick BUT the surface area of the hair is not really great.  Either way this has helped me great the perfect beard where other stubble type shavers could not.</li>
            <li> Overall, works very nicely. There should be some sort of stand or holder for the cord, brush, etc but that is a minor complaint.&lt;br /&gt;You have to charge it for 16 hours the first time before using it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it once, and liked the length I had, but then wanted to go just a little shorter the next day. What I did not realize is, that the&lt;br /&gt;setting is re-set to the shortest length possible. I thought it returned to the setting last used. So, I went from short trim beard to stubble. No biggie, it will grow back, but you need to remember your length setting and set it before you start trimming. Other than that, works very well.</li>
            <li> This trimmer trims my beard exactly as I want it trimmed. It is light and efficient. The battery lasts as long as I need. I charge it twice a month. No fuss. Where I wish it would do more, I am not willing to pay the price. It was only $365 bucks or so and it is neat and elegance.  Try it</li>
            <li> Initially I bought a Norelco vacuum stubble and beard trimmer for only one reason: stubble beard. I was not getting result that I want. Far from stubble look, it did not even cut my beard with 1.0mm setting, so I returned it and bought Con air I-stubble. And that it, I got the result that I desire and gave me great stubble and great beard shapes without irritating my skin. Just little bit trouble with trimming mustache and bit with neck hair. I give it two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I read the good reviews for the iStubble and was excited to receive it today. When I opened the box and inspected the product, I noticed hair clippings under the swivel head, and I hadn&#x27;t used it yet. From what I can tell, this wasn&#x27;t from a third-party vendor, but from Amazon directly. I have loved Amazon (I&#x27;ve been a Prime member for several years), but this has really soiled my impression of Amazon.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very easy to use and works wonderfully.  It keeps the beard from getting too long and is adjustable to 5mm.  I would have liked it to adjust a bit longer but I am getting used to that</li>
            <li> I adore this device. It was dirt cheap compared to many others and it works exceptionally well if you are looking for the stubble look or for maintaining a proper beard. Battery life is great and the charger works off both 110v and 220v, very important for those of us who travel abroad often.</li>
            <li> I tried it for 2 weeks now, it works great to trim facial hair and bet that stubble look. However if you&#x27;re looking for a clean shave after the trim (to line the stubble) it won&#x27;t work. You&#x27;ll have to use a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband.  He tried several facial trimmers and this was the one he kept.  He is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It trims extremely well, the length settings (in mm) are intuitive so getting the look you want is relatively easy after just a bit of experimentation.  My only complaint after a month of use is that the battery life is really rather terrible.  I&#x27;ve never used any razor from any brand that held a charge for so few shaves.  For example, the Wahl razor this replaces, while not as nice of a tool overall, only seemed to need a monthly charge.  With this I get 4-5, and then it needs to be recharged again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does a job that no other razor has done for me.  That makes it worth it for me despite the annoyingness of charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair People: Charge $10 more and make this trimmer with a Li-ion battery.  I&#x27;d even be willing to help if you need someone to test it.  ;)</li>
            <li> I have had several electric trimmers and the lengths available for this one are awesome. I only wish that they had some type of smaller adapter to allow for easier trimming directly under your nose. It&#x27;s pretty much impossible to get all the hair on your upper lip, just under your nose because the trimmer guard is so big. It would also be nice if you the maximum length was also a bit longer as well. But overall, this thing is awesome.</li>
            <li> I liked the iStubble a lot but only very briefly.  There are some plastic pieces that snapped after a couple weeks and now it&#x27;s unusable.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the performance of the charger, but quite displeased with the fact that it never holds a charge. Now, less than a year after buying the product, the battery has totally quit and the shaver does not hold a charge.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone buy such a shoddy product.</li>
            <li> Noisy, does not work straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> Works great, and I use it all the time but I have this feeling that once you go lower than about 1.8, the measurements no longer matter and it&#x27;s all almost the same length. Also, after a few weeks the movable head started to feel really loose and flimsy.</li>
            <li> Gift recipient was very pleased as how well trimmer works, it&#x27;s easy to clean and light weight.  Will purchase Conair products online again</li>
            <li> i want to able to give it ZERO rating.  This thing is totally useless and the moving head does not help at all as it does not mold to your face and it can only do its work by removing the guard out of the blades to reach the skin.  Useless Trimmer. AVOID.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my goatee and it works very well. I like all of the different settings and the fact that I can use it while plugged in and charging (unlike many electric razors). I&#x27;m not hip enough to have the stubble look, so I can&#x27;t comment on that ;p</li>
            <li> So the product works, but its not comfortable to use.  Especially on more sensitive areas of the face and it is big so good look getting at your philtrum (stache) without alot of wonky manipulation.  It will work but its going to take some time and the cut is not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Note: I followed the charging isntructions exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked well for about 6 month then it would no longer take a charge. My guess is that there&#x27;s a bad connection within the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li> The Battery Life is not much. I constantly have to charge it after 3 or 4 uses. But it is very useful for trimming. It is still a good buy.</li>
            <li> This is leaps and bounds better than anything I have been able to find at the big box stores. I don&#x27;t know about longevity but it give an even shave hassle free out of the box.</li>
            <li> Worked great for 5 months, then died. Will not take a charge anymore. I loved the adjust on the fly feature for different beard lengths, hated having all the attachemnts floating around in the drawer from my previous trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wished this worked longer. Going to try the Braun out.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have had so far. Adjustable length works great and the floating head makes it easy to get all spots.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. If you want a razor for low stubble or a short beard buy with confidence. Battery life could be better, you get about 10 shaves per charge. That is a minor complaint for an awesome product.</li>
            <li> This Trimmer works very well and holds a charge for a long time! Easy to clean and maintain! Like the adjustability, but I usually just leave it on one setting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade has broken on my unit, so I call Conair to get a replacement blade and they tell me that they do not carry the blades.&lt;br /&gt;So I will have to throw away a perfect trimmer because they do not sell new blades!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cut my hairs and instead pulled them out of my face.  After taking it apart, I realized that the sharpest blade is held on by a small piece of metal that barely holds it on.  The engineering isn&#x27;t quite there yet.</li>
            <li> I had to shave, daily, for 25 years and hated it. When I retired I stopped the daily shaving but when the hair started to get long it would start to itch and I would have to shave it off.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the iStubble and no longer have this problem. I run the iStubble over my face every 2 days at .4, the shortest setting, and it never itches,</li>
            <li> I actually really enjoy this device. The only thing is how sensitive it is. I was traveling and somehow it broke. Not sure how. It was in my luggage wrapped in clothing and it still broke. I guess maybe I should have kept the box for it. Won&#x27;t stop me from ordering a new one, just unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t exactly shopping around looking for &#x27;The Ultimate Shaver&#x27; or something like that. My face was scruffy, and I needed something that did the job. And this did the job! A lot of complaints on other reviews revolved around the difficulty in shaving the moustache area with this shaver, and I must say I had no problem with that. People need to chill out.</li>
            <li> except for not holding a charge more than 1-2 shave this is a nice stubble razor.  it does take some time to get used to getting into the nooks and crannies and curves of the face but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It fell apart the first week I had it</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, easy to use and very safe on skin. Only thing is the battery technology is not that great, takes a long time to charge and doesn&#x27;t hold charge long. If the battery is too low, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t even function while plugged in. Best to give it a charge regularly or just always plug in. The trimmer itself does a good job and the adjustability in millimeters is handy.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer/shaver. I really like the micro adjustments that can be made, it is used for all the hair on my body. Manscaping has never been easier or refined.</li>
            <li> Works great, the only reason I gave it a 4 is because you have to keep cleaning hair out as you&#x27;re using it, which gets to be annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd one of these now as they break frequently... yet I keep coming back. Why? I&#x27;ve tried every stubble trimmer out there, and this is the most comfortable due to the plastic comb that glides along the face. The clipper is also wide so gets more done in each pass. But this LCD version is over-engineered, with an electronic motor that can and has failed. I therefore recommend the cheaper version without the LCD control; it has a manual control but the head mechanism is identical.</li>
            <li> Works really well and is easy to clean. The battery life is better than the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> First time used was fine but has not held a charge since</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and does an excellent job.  Set it for any height from 0.4 mm to 5 mm.  Holds a charge for a long time.  I use it on my head.  No worries about nicks and cuts and 0.4 mm is so short it looks like I shaved with a razor.</li>
            <li> I like this one it is well designed, good quality, doing a nice shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is not bad though i expected a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall experience with this trimmer is good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Rodi</li>
            <li> It worked alright, stopped holding a charge after a few months. You can&#x27;t reach the bit of hair under your nose with it.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving for many reasons, but the iStubble makes it a quick simple task. Trims right down to the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow! If it had a lithium ion battery, it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as everyone says it is. I&#x27;ve been using it on and off and I have to say it&#x27;s pretty consistent, probably the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used in my five years of shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Works well, I love the adjustment flexibility to the .5 mm!  Only issue I have is that it is pretty hard to maneuver in the mustache area.  It&#x27;s a bit long because of the guard, but its somewhat manageable.  Feels like its going to catch my skin sometimes but doesn&#x27;t, so I guess I just have to lean to trust it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the $, I&#x27;d recommend it.  It makes life that much easier so its worth it...</li>
            <li> Perhaps that phrase is inappropriate for a beard trimmer, but I found this product to be well worth the money.  I have tried several other cheap battery operated beard trimmers.  Some corded hair clippers and the sort.  In the end this thing they were all a pain.&lt;br /&gt;This product protects the face well and I get no hair pulling.  It has a couple of weaknesses but that is mainly due to the fact that it is not meant to be an all in one.  1.  Right under the nose it is hard to clip with so you will need a secondary clipper.  2.  Does not work on side burns very well.  3.  The only one that they should really fix.  My set does not seem to recall the last clipper size.  Always defaults to lowest.&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that I love the thing.  Holds a charge for a long time, has a scoop to catch some of your clippings, does a great job of trimming the stubbly and has provided me the shortest shave time.</li>
            <li> Wow. This is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to shaving, I&#x27;ve been trying to get this look for the last few years, but I&#x27;ve failed miserably due to genetics and total incompetence with razors. I have sensitive skin and light hair so basically any time I try to get the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look, my face fills up with rashes from the harshness of other mechanical razors and I end up with something that looks like a goatee and whispy stubble on the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor fixes both of my problems: 1. It is SUUUUPER easy to use, which is great for me because as I mentioned I suck at getting the proper trim. 2. There is seriously no razor burn when I use this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much do I like this thing? This is the first item I&#x27;ve ever been compelled to rate on Amazon after years of using prime.</li>
            <li> When I first got this trimmer, I followed the instructions and everything yet it broke within 5 min of me first using it. I returned it for another one. The next one I got broke in 5 min as well. I followed the instructions very carefully yet it still broke. Don&#x27;t waste your time as you will just end up returning it for your money back.</li>
            <li> so far it has work very good,&lt;br /&gt;I have not gotten any irritation using this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;not very quiet but tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;Conair, products have not yet disappointed me. I still have my old shaver for about 4 yrs now, however the battery can only do one shave on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;thats understandable, after 4 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this shaver cuts nicely</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it its a piece of junk the maneuver is freaking ridiculous i have a few spots on my faces where its uneven not the same length because i dug too much into my skin</li>
            <li> Its great for the first few shaves. Always difficult trimming mustache.</li>
            <li> So this one hurts, it&#x27;s very loud when compared to other trimmers, the blade has two parts and one comes off which takes me a while to fit in. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t hold enough charge for a week&#x27;s use.  Hard to go back and forth without the guide locked into place (if it doesn&#x27;t lock into place on its own, which can be really annoying).  Overall, this is the lightest weighing electrical shaver I&#x27;ve ever used and it has diminished my hand joint pain remarkably, but I think the design could be improved upon.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t hold a cake to the top contender, but for specializing in stubble, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Garbage did not work right out of box</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast delivery. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> ... I love that it goes up in increments of .2 mm starting with from .4 all the way to 2.0, and then it increases in increments of .5 thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the only downside (so far) is that you can&#x27;t properly trim your mustache. No matter how hard you try to angle it, you&#x27;ll be left with a Hitler-stache. You just can&#x27;t seem to get the area directly under your nose due to the size of the trimmer. Luckily for me, my old trimmer still works, so I trim my mustache with my old trimmer, and the rest with the new one.</li>
            <li> First one was defective, however the 2nd one has worked great for over a year.</li>
            <li> Really hard to keep a charge on it</li>
            <li> my husband loves this product. We have had it a year now and he really likes how it works it shaves his face down far enough where he never has to shave with a razor and get ingrown hairs anymore or bumps.</li>
            <li> Received and immediately tried this since I have only heard good things. I absolutely LOVE this shaver!!! It is very accurate and does not irritate my skin. I will no longer be using any razors to maintain my facial hair, would recommend to EVERYONE!!!</li>
            <li> Comfortable, easy to handle and effective trimmer</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised. This thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last six months</li>
            <li> Broke after 4 months.</li>
            <li> I used the product for about two weeks and it failed to adjust trim length accurately. It shifted from lowest setting to highest setting and nothing in between. It had to be turned on and off repeatedly to get it to move to other settings. Returned for a refund.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after reading the poor and good reviews. I see what some users are experiencing when they hold the device differently, and seem to get a different trim length, but that isn&#x27;t the device&#x27;s fault. Sure you will get different trims depending on if you use your dominant hand vs. your none dominant hand. You will also get different results if you try and trim while hanging upside down from your bed rather than standing right side up. It is basic knowledge of angles and kinesiology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK so now onto the good and the bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;The digital display is easy to read, and the way the guard is designed it moves across my face with ease. The device is not bulky, nor does it emit an undesirable level of noise while in use. Plus it does not tug at my face, so I anticipate that when it is time for regular maintenance that with proper application of the provided oil, it will continue to run perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;The device is slightly difficult to clean. The brush provided is not conducive to sweeping the cut hair from inside the guard. Also the guard has to be moved to a higher setting to get some of the hard to reach places. Other than that, my only other complaint is that the device resets the length setting after every use. Not really a negative ractor, since I remember what I like my settings at, but more of an inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is by far superior to the others I have tried on the market. I rarely give full stars, so this is the best most anything ever gets.</li>
            <li> Was very much disappointed to find pieces of somebodies beard on my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; device.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is well worth it, it is on point perfect! i love it so does my girlfriend. Create your own stubble design.</li>
            <li> This item broke after 5 uses. The blade cannot be adjusted anymore. Paint is removed from plastic. Don&#x27;t buy. This is my first negative review for any product.</li>
            <li> This would have been a great trimmer if it didn&#x27;t break so easily. Mine lasted a little under a year before it just stopped charging or powering up at all. It just randomly died. I guess I should consider myself lucky that it lasted as long as it did. People have been reporting that theirs go out much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s covered under a 2 year warranty by ConAir. You will have to package and ship the item yourself and pay for them $5.00 to ship out a new one (wtf lol?). Not really happy with their customer service. If you promise a 2 year warranty for your defective product, why do you make the customer pay for shipping out a replacement? Doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Should have just bought a Phillips..</li>
            <li> this is an incredible shaver very first I&#x27;ll it lives up to every feature the manufacture claims and has plus I have found a few other things that can be done with it as well ... highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This trimmer is exactly what I wanted - a high precision stubble trimmer which leaves a perfect stubble on your face. The variable length setting allows you to have your beard trimmed from as low as 0.4mm to a highest of 5 mm. There are plenty of length options available in between these high and low settings which allows you to trim the beard at the most perfect length you want it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, you can have a very close shave if you use the device without the comb head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motors are really powerful and I have not had any hair pulls with this trimmer. Its quite smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery charge is awesome and I could use this for around 45 minutes after the first full charge of 16 hours (Refer the manual). After the first super-charge, you just need 4 hours for the subsequent chargings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a STUBBLE trimmer which does exactly that! Not for guys who needs a longer beard (5mm is the maximum possible length with this device).</li>
            <li> Purchased Jul 14, quit running Jan 15!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for maintaining my five o&#x27;clock shadow.  I use it on the lowest setting, .4 mm, and it&#x27;s great.  No irritation, no pulling, no pain. Don&#x27;t even turn it on before you charge it a full 16 hours per the directions.  I&#x27;m assuming the people who have had battery issues didn&#x27;t comply.</li>
            <li> It baffles me why it would be engineered this way but you can only operate it on charged battery so if you pick it up and it starts to run down and die in the middle of use you are left in limbo until it charges because plugging it in does not provide enough current for actual use.&lt;br /&gt;To make things worse, the battery life span seems to be short as it has to be recharged sooner and sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE; June 2013 - I have thrown it away. Too much of hassle with charging it and charge does not last long enough. Since you cannot use it when plugged in, that makes it worthless. It got to point where I could not trim my entire face. One small thing can make huge difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently doing my annual treatment for skin cancer and cannot shave for a while. This just came and seems to be just what I needed to keep about a 3mm stubble.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a previous trimmer, looking for a closer &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; result than I was able to get from the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the lowest setting of my old trimmer, which that manufacturer reports as 1.6mm, I initially set the Conair to 1mm. That was a mistake. The resulting trim was MUCH shorter than I expected, almost a shave. So beware of the reported settings; they&#x27;re not very accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this trimmer is set to the same 1.6mm as my old one, it gives a MUCH closer shave. For me, it&#x27;s exactly the stubble length I was looking for. My advice would be to start much higher than you think, and work down. The reported lengths are misleading. But once I arrived at the setting that works best for me, I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head pivots, which does allow for a very comfortable ride as you go over the edge of your chin, etc. But I think it sometimes results in the head losing contact, and you may notice some uneven patches when you&#x27;re done. Just go back over them at the same setting. Simple fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any trimmer with a raised blade guard, it&#x27;s not perfect at getting under your nose, etc. I&#x27;ve never found a trimmer that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the open design of the top, where there&#x27;s space between the unit and the shaving head, reduces the mess a bit. There seems to be less hair trapped in the shaver, and the flip-up head makes cleaning very easy. (Of course, you&#x27;ll need to shave over the sink or in the tub/shower to avoid a mess all over the counter in any case.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a few oddities with the on/off switch:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you press it once when you&#x27;re done trimming, the blade shuts off but the unit stays powered on. You can see the battery life display and trimmer height setting. If you do nothing, it will turn off a few seconds later but &amp;#34;remember&amp;#34; the height setting the next time you turn the unit on. That&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you hold the power button down for a couple of seconds to turn the unit off manually, it will lower the blade to the lowest setting before turning off. So the next time you turn it on, it&#x27;s at .4mm. If you don&#x27;t notice that, your beard is gone. I find that arrangement a bit dicey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no issues with battery life. I&#x27;ve used it a few times a week for several weeks and the battery is at 3/4 full. Just charge it for the full time suggested in the manual and you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very good trimmer at a very good price. Can&#x27;t imagine you&#x27;d need your beard to be closer than this trimmer will get it.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality trimmer. I like the digital display and the ease of changing the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> Arrived dead to the world and won&#x27;t charge. Amazon is sending a replacement and we&#x27;ll see if that one fairs any better.  Well got the replacement and it works pretty good. Still kind of annoyed at the first ones DOA.</li>
            <li> OK product, but it lasted less than 1 year. The battery is enough for 4-5 uses, then it needs to be charged. The problem is that if the battery dies during the use, you cannot plug the trimmer to a wall and keep going, but need to wait for the battery to recharge!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift. I was told it was very hard to keep the hair from flying everywhere and makes a big mess. Also, annoying to clean out every time. But, it has the adjustable levels so that makes it more precise for what your personally want. Good for people who don&#x27;t mind spending time to clean up often.</li>
            <li> I spent way too many hours reading reviews, looking on the internet, watching videos to pick a beard trimmer. As we all know, it is something we have to live with for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the negative reviews here seemed a bit weak, or was not a big negative to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really miss my old Panasonic trimmer (edit - just saw my review for the er-203 trimmer. I bought it in 2003 - got almost a decade on that trimmer! The last trim was as good as the first. This iStubble trimmer actually IS better!) that I had for years and years..Felt it was the best out there and didn&#x27;t want to change to something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had my short list of trimmers to try. figured try this one first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleasantly surprised. Naturally I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. gave it a quick, few hour, charge. tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read some negative reviews about power on thick beards. Since this, is max, 5mm, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to go through a santa claus beard. it is not designed for that. It is for us that want a short, stubble, type beard. My beard was fairly long for me, and it is very thick, often stopped other trimmers in their tracks, even when plugged in. This one just went though like nothing. quick, clean, short. No hesitation, even on a short initial charge. Not a single pulled hair, no straining of the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claims of not being able to get good detail work done.. don&#x27;t know where that comes from. great control, flipping up the comb, I am able to get a great edge, good trimming, very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics. like another reviewer. Agree, needs something for better grip.. maybe some rubber or some molded in grips.. something.. however, not a deal breaker by any means. I do like the motorized comb adjustment. thought it would be a gimmick, but it is actually pretty good. edit-The stock images do not do it a service. It LOOKS clunkier than it is to use. It is quite nimble despite the poor marketing material&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I can&#x27;t see any way to really improve on it. I like that you can&#x27;t easily lose the comb, it gets out of the way so it is not a problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only variable, to me, is how long will the battery last..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this is for someone who wants a stubble type beard. You have a long beard, this isn&#x27;t for you. It is called iStubble for a reason :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it at 4mm  -- worked great..then tried at 2mm. WOW .. that&#x27;s short! very even and great results. Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell how it stands up... but initial impression is quite good. Other than some better grip on the unit, I can&#x27;t think of anything I could tell the mfr to change. Has control, power, ease of use, flexibility for the short beard/stubble beard guyay to really improve on it.

            <li> Perfect stubble every time, and no time wasted changing the plastic length pieces. Only small problem is sometimes its hard to reach the hairs under my nose due to the design. After a while I get them little squirts anyway.</li>
            <li> My Original Review:  I like a less than close shave.  I wanted a shaver that holds its charge and indicated how much charge it had left.  I didn&#x27;t want a bare blade against my face.  I wanted a fast and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Updated Review:  At least I thought I found my shaver until that fateful day when I dropped it in the sink.  It was not a violent drop, which the shaver should have survived.  The head is attached to flimsy plastic pins/nubs which adjust the beard cutting length.  Those plastic nubs broke off rendering my shaver useless unless you are okay with the minimum cutting length and a floppy floating head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called customer support and they told me that parts are not available for it.  In my opinion, the shaver should be more durable, so my 5-star rated review has been reduced to 2-stars.</li>
            <li> Fits my needs perfectly.  I&#x27;d rather not shave at all, with a regular razor, but during the summer I need to do so.  But over the winter, I try to maintain a &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; at varying lengths, and this does the job.  Love the multiple length settings.  Easy to use.  One charge lasts weeks (I don&#x27;t use it everyday).</li>
            <li> I finally found a way to keep groomed in between haircuts at the barber without having to deal with razor bumps from shaving. If you suffer from razor bumps then this is what you need. You can control how close the shave is. Wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - the charger says that initially you have to charge it for 16 hours. Make sure you charge it for 16 hours.</li>
            <li> It works well enough. I would like it if the battery life were longer though. This uses a Nickel-Metal Hydride battery instead of a Lithium-ion battery. Also, the battery indicator is totally useless. Always room for improvement, but this felt like just a tad too much room.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it worked great until after a couple of months it fell apart. The battery lasts only 15 minutes now and I have to charge it for 2 hours. It&#x27;s going to be replaced soon with Norelco.</li>
            <li> Great razor for the price. Its a bit hard to work around your nose but I can deal with that. I like it especially for the price. The battery doesnt last very long even after charging overnight. If not for that it would be 5 stars based on performance &amp; price.</li>
            <li> Both original item and replacement did not hold charge after 16 hours of constant charging. Very frustrating. Find something else and don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
