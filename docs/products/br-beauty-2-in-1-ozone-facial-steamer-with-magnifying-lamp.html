    <ol>
            <li>And was happy to hear they were sending me my replacement bulb ASAP!</li>
            <li>but between me, my husband and very intelligent boys</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already used it a handful of times and it works great!</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for at home facials and a close-up look at the face with the magnifying, lighted glass.</li>
            <li>It did not say that when ordering...not happy with there return policy.  </li>
            <li>The steamer puts out a lot of steam and heat, very nice.  </li>
            <li>and it stopped working today, took off the jar and cleaned the metal really good to see if that could have been an issue and no luck its a done steamer.</li>
            <li>I had a feeling it wasn&#x27;t going to be good quality</li>
            <li>/&gt;Light works good though.</li>
            <li>is very good machine, works efficiently and quietly, we are very happy with it.</li>
            <li>We love it!  </li>
            <li>Came on time and easy to assemble!  </li>
            <li>The machine arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li>very cheap, you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again for many reasons:</li>
            <li>I suggest saving your money for a better quality steamer.</li>
            <li>It work just okay.  </li>
            <li>Well it could be a couple months at most since I got this equipment it is leaking.</li>
            <li>I love the versatility of having both the mag lamp &amp; steamer as one.</li>
            <li>I love my stemer and mag lap that I purchased for my treatment room out of my home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I have had everyone and their brother see if there is anything I can do to make this thing safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I contacted customer service and they gladly took care of my problems.  </li>
            <li>It makes a ticking sound and can&#x27;t turn steam on without the timer and to top</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s worked great, haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li>Easy assembly.</li>
            <li>I thought it was easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li>ozone and light are immediate.</li>
            <li>Also, when I turn on the steamer it makes a ticking sound</li>
            <li>At first, you do have to run the steamer all the way through with distiller water because at first the steam kind of smells chemically.</li>
            <li>and you hear the ticking sound all the time and when it stops ticking it makes a loud sound .</li>
            <li>Other then that, it was a good purchase</li>
            <li>Suck it up and pay a few hundred dollars more for a better quality one.</li>
            <li>Hoping this is an easy process to get this fixed.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering from this competent company in the future!   </li>
            <li>but no matter what I tried adding seal etc still leaking it burnt  a client when hot water spurted out.</li>
            <li>The mag light is ok, the color is a little off.</li>
            <li>First review - Really puts out alot if steam.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  very sturdy and works very well!</li>
            <li>Bitter sweet moment today when it broke because now I get to buy a new one that will perform better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I originally didn&#x27;t get a tracking number for this item, but when I emailed the company they got back to right away with my tracking number.</li>
            <li>It also has a large &amp;#34;ding&amp;#34; at the end of the timer that could wake a sleeping client out of a restful state.  </li>
            <li>but since facials are not a treatment we perform often - didn&#x27;t want to invest a lot of money into something we wouldn&#x27;t get much use out of.</li>
            <li>I much regret from this purchase</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can&#x27;t stand up straight, causing water to spill,  and not for lack of tightening screws.</li>
            <li>At least the lady I spoke with when I needed to return the hair steamer was nice and very helpful.</li>
            <li>I do wish it was a little more sturdy.  </li>
            <li>B003TYBS46 New Salon 2</li>
            <li>There is a bell when steam is done but for how well works I could live with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As well if you are purchasing and live in the West Indies problems.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this steamer a month ago for my new business.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The packaging for the steamer itself was fine, but the 2 extra fuses were loose in the box (they weren&#x27;t even in a bag, they were literally loose in the huge box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When i opened up my package it was easy to put together, but some pieces were a little dirt</li>
            <li>However, the seller&#x27;s customer service is very responsive and the replacement parts arrived quickly with little effort on my part.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the price was excellent but not worth it fore me because the sound it makes is annoying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer countdown and &#x27;ding&#x27; are nowhere near as loud as others have made it out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I had to give it a quick wipe down.</li>
            <li>Instructions could be a more detailed for eg when assembling base you need to tilt legs a little for screws to fit well.</li>
            <li>In addition, a few times the canister holding the boiling water has made scary &#x27;popping&#x27; sounds (water was filled appropriately) as though it could explode!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pressure of steam is crummy barely comes out.</li>
            <li>My steamer, the 3rd one, just completely stopped working on me tonight.</li>
            <li>I contacted company they seemed willing until I informed them where I live, although my sky box is Miami was not able to get part.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 steamers from them over the last year and they keep dying on me within 2-3 months, after only few treatments, not even full day of facials..</li>
            <li>The timer is loud and it take a long while for the steam to start.</li>
            <li>Received the steamer and it is a decent steamer, I also have two Paragon steamers and I bought this one to have an extra one when the other two needs servicing.  </li>
            <li>The customer service rep was very helpful on the phone when I had a little confusion putting the parts together.  </li>

            <li> The customer service rep was very helpful on the phone when I had a little confusion putting the parts together.  </li>
            <li> The only thing was it didn&#x27;t come with a whole lot of instructions just a small paper showing how to fill the container with water</li>
            <li> When I put it all together the screw at the bottom comes loose making everything wiggly and leans over.</li>
            <li> The lamp is already starting to break down.  </li>
            <li> The Mag Lamp part is starting to hang down and tightening</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this facial steamer for a year and a half</li>
            <li> Certainly not the junk</li>
            <li> I am now being very careful with it.  </li>
            <li> almost sure im going to drop the stupid thing.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this product its not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> The glass jar that hold the water attaches in such a way that it is difficult to remove and put back on, and with continued use im</li>
            <li> if you tighten the jar on too tight it breaks.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it hasn&#x27;t lasted long enough to even get one of them serviced.  </li>
            <li> They tend to crack within a few months.</li>
            <li> I bought this steamer in February and now have used it for a few months.  </li>
            <li> When it came a small part was missing  to cover water inlet.</li>
            <li> I then had to push all of my clients further into the week.&lt;br /&gt;Although was unfortunate,  </li>
            <li> I ended up paying half the cost of the steamer just to return it!!</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews, the product arrived with a broken lamp bulb.</li>
            <li> They said it was too late</li>
            <li> Never in my entire career have I used such a horrible piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> It was made well, but I seriously think a client would not return because of it&#x27;s annoyance.</li>
            <li> not good when doing facials if client is a sleep.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint would have to be that it doesn&#x27;t remain upright and the lamp shifts all over the place, although I could go on and on about what a poorly manufactured piece of equipment this is.</li>
            <li> However, the timer is really loud, and the bell is annoying.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t hard to figure out!</li>
            <li> I recieved it within 2-4 days of my complaint!  </li>
            <li> This steamer is so poorly made it slants to one side.</li>
            <li> circular bulb broken.....</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with the timer on the steamer.  </li>
            <li> The customer service, extremely poor..</li>
            <li> The magnifying lamp piece is way too heavy to be supported by the base.</li>
            <li> The steamer has this nasty musty smell that after multiple uses - STILL hasn&#x27;t disappeared at all.</li>
            <li> Of course I will never, ever again!&lt;br /&gt;Their products are the worst quality possible.</li>
            <li> To begin the ordeal I&#x27;ve had with this equipment,  the company sent me a hair steamer instead of a facial steamer which was horrible because I took time off and did not have the steamer by the time I needed it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am too spineless to ask for a refund.  </li>
            <li> This machine is dangerous and very poorly made.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to use it on a client.</li>
            <li> Sooo disappointing.</li>
            <li> Bad business..</li>
            <li> This steamer &amp;#34;ticks&amp;#34; and is annoying to clients.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a horrible company.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had this facial steamer for a year and a half and it stopped working today, took off the jar and cleaned the metal really good to see if that could have been an issue and no luck its a done steamer. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again for many reasons: 1. it dings and clicks the entire time it is on. 2. Pressure of steam is crummy barely comes out. 3. if you tighten the jar on too tight it breaks. Bitter sweet moment today when it broke because now I get to buy a new one that will perform better. don&#x27;t buy this product its not worth the money.</li>
            <li> very cheap, you do get what you pay for. I suggest saving your money for a better quality steamer. I sent it back withing 3 days. Not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> We need the seller to post up the Instructions Manual Online for download. A lot of this machines come without the manual at all.</li>
            <li> This steamer was purchased for use in a medical spa. I had a feeling it wasn&#x27;t going to be good quality but since facials are not a treatment we perform often - didn&#x27;t want to invest a lot of money into something we wouldn&#x27;t get much use out of. I should have listened to my gut. This steamer is so poorly made it slants to one side. The magnifying lamp piece is way too heavy to be supported by the base. The steamer has this nasty musty smell that after multiple uses - STILL hasn&#x27;t disappeared at all. Its embarrassing to use this on clients. In addition, a few times the canister holding the boiling water has made scary &#x27;popping&#x27; sounds (water was filled appropriately) as though it could explode!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PURCHASE!!! Suck it up and pay a few hundred dollars more for a better quality one.</li>
            <li> The plastic does not hold up to heat of the lamp. They tend to crack within a few months. I would like to find a metal mag lamp.</li>
            <li> I had written about receiving my facial Steamer/with magnifying glass.....circular bulb broken.....And was happy to hear they were sending me my replacement bulb ASAP! I recieved it within 2-4 days of my complaint!  Thank You for such a prompt response! I will be ordering from this competent company in the future!   [[ASIN:B003TYBS46 New Salon 2 IN 1 Ozone Facial Steamer With Magnify Lamp Spa Salon]]</li>
            <li> Received the steamer and it is a decent steamer, I also have two Paragon steamers and I bought this one to have an extra one when the other two needs servicing.  Needless to say it hasn&#x27;t lasted long enough to even get one of them serviced.  The timer is what broke, it won&#x27;t turn off.  I&#x27;ve called customer service and I&#x27;m waiting for a call back.  Hoping this is an easy process to get this fixed.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with the timer on the steamer.  It makes a ticking sound and can&#x27;t turn steam on without the timer and to top&lt;br /&gt;it off it dings when the timer shuts off.  Whoever designed this steamer must not of been an esthetician or in the skin care field.&lt;br /&gt;Light works good though.</li>
            <li> is very good machine, works efficiently and quietly, we are very happy with it. recommend it. ozone and light are immediate.</li>
            <li> It work just okay.  The timer is loud and it take a long while for the steam to start.</li>
            <li> Came on time and easy to assemble!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> First review - Really puts out alot if steam. Instructions could be a more detailed for eg when assembling base you need to tilt legs a little for screws to fit well. There is a bell when steam is done but for how well works I could live with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Well it could be a couple months at most since I got this equipment it is leaking. Worked well before but now it is leaking  but no matter what I tried adding seal etc still leaking it burnt  a client when hot water spurted out. Unless something could be done about this i recommend do not buy. As well if you are purchasing and live in the West Indies problems.  When it came a small part was missing  to cover water inlet. I contacted company they seemed willing until I informed them where I live, although my sky box is Miami was not able to get part. I much regret from this purchase</li>
            <li> I love the versatility of having both the mag lamp &amp; steamer as one. I would&#x27;ve preferred a larger water jar but it is enough to get through a facial. Easy assembly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for at home use for me and my family!  We love it!  It&#x27;s great for at home facials and a close-up look at the face with the magnifying, lighted glass. It&#x27;s  very sturdy and works very well! The only thing was it didn&#x27;t come with a whole lot of instructions just a small paper showing how to fill the container with water but nothing about how to work the buttons - but between me, my husband and very intelligent boys it wasn&#x27;t hard to figure out!</li>
            <li> The machine arrived very quickly! The customer service rep was very helpful on the phone when I had a little confusion putting the parts together.  The mag light is ok, the color is a little off. The steamer puts out a lot of steam and heat, very nice.  However, the timer is really loud, and the bell is annoying.  Nothing on the site was said about the noise.  I would have rethought the purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that you have to put the timer on in order for the steam to start and you hear the ticking sound all the time and when it stops ticking it makes a loud sound . not good when doing facials if client is a sleep. the price was excellent but not worth it fore me because the sound it makes is annoying.</li>
            <li> I love my stemer and mag lap that I purchased for my treatment room out of my home. I&#x27;ve already used it a handful of times and it works great! At first, you do have to run the steamer all the way through with distiller water because at first the steam kind of smells chemically. When i opened up my package it was easy to put together, but some pieces were a little dirt so I had to give it a quick wipe down. Other then that, it was a good purchase and I recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Just received my order an hour ago, it doesn&#x27;t work at all after we installed it, how can I get in touch with custmor service?</li>
            <li> Everything is great but the wheel base is unstable. When I put it all together the screw at the bottom comes loose making everything wiggly and leans over. I am afraid to use it on a client. I have left a message for customer service.</li>
            <li> By mistake I keep ordering stuff from this company.. Of course I will never, ever again!&lt;br /&gt;Their products are the worst quality possible. The customer service, extremely poor.. They won&#x27;t cover any replacements or shipping or anything. Their warranty is 30 days, if any, and you need to pay for shipping back to them. I had to exchange emails and pictures for 2 months before they even replaced or took back or refund me any money, which I got after yelling at them multiple times! I bought 3 steamers from them over the last year and they keep dying on me within 2-3 months, after only few treatments, not even full day of facials.. My steamer, the 3rd one, just completely stopped working on me tonight. I got 2 magnifying lamps, and yes, they stopped working too! Enough with your crappy quality and service! Amazon, should NOT allow them to sell their stuff here. It&#x27;s a horrible company. Bad business.. Sooo disappointing.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews, the product arrived with a broken lamp bulb. It also had an non-functional leg. However, the seller&#x27;s customer service is very responsive and the replacement parts arrived quickly with little effort on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer countdown and &#x27;ding&#x27; are nowhere near as loud as others have made it out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> To begin the ordeal I&#x27;ve had with this equipment,  the company sent me a hair steamer instead of a facial steamer which was horrible because I took time off and did not have the steamer by the time I needed it. I then had to push all of my clients further into the week.&lt;br /&gt;Although was unfortunate,  my low rating reflects the quality of the steamer.  What did I expect for how inexpensive the steamer is?  Certainly not the junk I was sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can&#x27;t stand up straight, causing water to spill,  and not for lack of tightening screws. The arm that holds the lamp in place allows it to swing all over, not only has the lamp dinged my walls but it has also shifted and knocked 2 clients in the forehead. The glass jar that hold the water attaches in such a way that it is difficult to remove and put back on, and with continued use im almost sure im going to drop the stupid thing. Never in my entire career have I used such a horrible piece of equipment. My biggest complaint would have to be that it doesn&#x27;t remain upright and the lamp shifts all over the place, although I could go on and on about what a poorly manufactured piece of equipment this is. Please understand it has nothing to do with how it was put together.  I have had everyone and their brother see if there is anything I can do to make this thing safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This machine is dangerous and very poorly made. Unfortunately I am too spineless to ask for a refund.  Please avoid wasting your money and buy a quality steamer. At least the lady I spoke with when I needed to return the hair steamer was nice and very helpful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this steamer a month ago for my new business. So far it&#x27;s worked great, haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. The only issues I had were the fuse packaging and no tracking number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The packaging for the steamer itself was fine, but the 2 extra fuses were loose in the box (they weren&#x27;t even in a bag, they were literally loose in the huge box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I originally didn&#x27;t get a tracking number for this item, but when I emailed the company they got back to right away with my tracking number.</li>
            <li> I thought it was easy to assemble.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this steamer in February and now have used it for a few months.  The lamp is already starting to break down.  The Mag Lamp part is starting to hang down and tightening it does not matter.  I am now being very careful with it.  Also, when I turn on the steamer it makes a ticking sound and I can not seem to turn it off until the time runs out.  I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> well the situacion is  I receved the producto ,  with two problem the ligth no work( maybe the bulb), and one scaffold came without thread.</li>
            <li> I had a couple of problems with this product after receiving it.  I contacted customer service and they gladly took care of my problems.  I do wish it was a little more sturdy.  Customer service is why I gave this five stars.</li>
            <li> This steamer &amp;#34;ticks&amp;#34; and is annoying to clients.  It also has a large &amp;#34;ding&amp;#34; at the end of the timer that could wake a sleeping client out of a restful state.  It was made well, but I seriously think a client would not return because of it&#x27;s annoyance.</li>
            <li> I purchased this facial steamer for my business with the intention it would arrive in the time that was given to me after ordering.  Once I received the delivery notification it was a much later date than what was given at ordering.  It wouldn&#x27;t work for my business...I needed it asap.  I found another steamer that I could purchase and receive quicker.  I called the company immediately after placing the order and told them my dilemma and wanted to cancel the order so they wouldn&#x27;t send it out.  They said it was too late and they are going to process my credit card and once it arrives I need to send it back and I would have to pay the shipping fee and a re-stocking fee in order to get my refund! I ended up paying half the cost of the steamer just to return it!! It did not say that when ordering...not happy with there return policy.  They should be upfront about their policy.</li>
