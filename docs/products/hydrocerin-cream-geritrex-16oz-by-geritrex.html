            <li>SUPER Moisturizing!</li>
            <li>This stuff works great on dry skin.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li>Fragrance free, a bit oily when it first goes on</li>
            <li>it seeps right into the corners of your fingernails.</li>
            <li>First introduced to this product in a rehab facility.</li>
            <li>It helps dry skin better than anything I have used before.</li>
            <li>Great for rough and dry</li>
            <li>Shipping was a little bit more but it is completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is great for my husband who has dry skin due to diabetes.  </li>
            <li>Because my husband really needed the cream we kept it just pick  out all the broke pieces</li>
            <li>and this really helps a lot.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on well when you&#x27;re wet but soaks in pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t give you that gooped up feeling.</li>
            <li>Again what I like the most about this is that it&#x27;s not messy like a lot of other OIL based products.</li>
            <li>itching!&lt;br /&gt;This is a very thick cream, but it spreads easily and absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>At first I needed to use it several times a day.  </li>
            <li>As an amputee, I have certain issues to deal with and this cream keeps my skin hydrated, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>Only problem which wasn&#x27;t a big deal was the top was loose</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find such a large jar here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This cream works like a charm on my 86 yr old Mother&#x27;s legs....</li>
            <li>To quote her, &amp;#34;it makes my feet feel soft as a baby&#x27;s butt!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>My friend gave me a sample from her dermatologist and it really smooths dry skin, rashes or burns.</li>
            <li>A little will go a long way and spread easily once you work it</li>
            <li>but he came with the top broken..</li>
            <li>it is kind of difficult to find it in a smaller jar.</li>

            <li> Love this product!  Fixes dry skin almost immediately. I can even use it on my face without breaking out. Amazing.</li>
            <li> The product is great. Delivered as promised.  Only problem which wasn&#x27;t a big deal was the top was loose and it leaked a little. Other than that everything else GREAT!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product from amazon.com, a friend gave me some. After I moved to Idaho from the East coast, I was getting a rash on my hands and arms... Doctors couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was. I get the rash 3-4 times a year for a couple of weeks. I have tried prescription and over the counter creams and pills for it. Nothing worked until I used this amazon stuff!</li>
            <li> DOCTOR  HAS MY HUSBAN USEING THIS.</li>
            <li> I use this on my butt sores it does great</li>
            <li> This is the best cream ever for extremely dry skin.  I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works as well as this cream.  Fragrance free, a bit oily when it first goes on but that goes away once it absorbs in to your skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is kinda blah but the cream itself is excellent.  Doesn&#x27;t go on well when you&#x27;re wet but soaks in pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t give you that gooped up feeling.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this really helps a lot. I will definitely order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Very effective cream.  Works wonders on bedsores.</li>
            <li> I had very dry skin due to some medications while in the hospital.  An aid brought me a jar of this and put some on me.  Within hours I felt relief from the dryness and itching!&lt;br /&gt;This is a very thick cream, but it spreads easily and absorbs into the skin quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t have an odor, and it&#x27;s not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!  I like to use it after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This is great for my husband who has dry skin due to diabetes.  Love it!  It is the best choice of all the different creams and lotions we have tried for his skin.</li>
            <li> My friend had this cream several years ago, and I&#x27;ve wanted some ever since.  It feels wonderful on my dry, chapped, sclerosis-damaged skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is really good. It helps dry skin better than anything I have used before. My dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that has helped my hands.  At first I needed to use it several times a day.  Over time my daily use has dropped to two times a day.  I wish I had tried it a long time ago.  All hydocerin creams are not equal in benefits reaped.  The larger jar, 16 oz, works best value wise.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, works well.</li>
            <li> Awesome moisturizer.  Absorbs cleanly no oily residue.</li>
            <li> This is literally the only product that works for my dry skin. It prevents my skin from being dry and ashy and it helps soften my skin. It&#x27;s very cheap for the amount of product you get. Give it a try</li>
            <li> This stuff works great on dry skin. What I like about this the most is that it does not leave a mess behind when you rub it into your skin. It lasts for several hours. Shipping was a little bit more but it is completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I have looked for a long time for this stuff it is kind of difficult to find it in a smaller jar.

            <li> Great for rough and dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;The best I have ever used. A little will go a long way and spread easily once you work it and it reaches your body temperature.</li>
