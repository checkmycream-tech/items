            <li>i love this it helps on those days where i dont wash my hair!</li>
            <li>I will buy more canisters!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazingly overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Its absolutely AMAZING....</li>
            <li>Plus this stuff smells amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for 6months (with light use) and it still works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and works great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>The price kind of makes up for it, but its still a con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a shame, i really liked this product but if that is all i can get out of a bottle then i will not buy it again.</li>
            <li>Dove has a really nice smell without being overbearing.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>Nice effect on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Really liked it after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best product for the price.</li>
            <li>Its an affordable, and effective product.  </li>
            <li>this is a nice option.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product since the price is so good</li>
            <li>Strong but pleasant odor.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product- works well without the high intensity smell</li>
            <li>It really is a great dry shampoo, and I got it at a great price!</li>
            <li>I can now go happily for 4-5 days without a shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it has a lovely, light, scent.</li>
            <li>but great for a quick hair freshener.</li>
            <li>Great product for those moments when you&#x27;re in a jiffy and need a quick touch-up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very strong...</li>
            <li>very easy  to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the best I&#x27;ve discovered so far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want others being able to smell it, and I also wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the texture of my hair afterward.</li>
            <li>That easy!</li>
            <li>And it is STRONG!  </li>
            <li>I liked the scent, it was not too overpowering and smelled very clean.</li>
            <li>This has been the best working and smelling dry shampoo I have tried, leaves hair light and smelling great.</li>
            <li>As for the scent yea it was strong but I liked it.</li>
            <li>I honestly think it smells too strong...</li>
            <li>(it leaves more of a matte finish).&lt;br /&gt;It also does a great job absorbing oiliness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure any of the powder is coming out--</li>
            <li>I love how well this product works and smells...except for the fact</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, it does cast off a white powder</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been stocking up on this:)</li>
            <li>Cannot get hold of it in my country so more satisfied.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing is that it doesn&#x27;t stink like the others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>They have updated the spray nozzle, and it works fabulously!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>But I did find that after using this, I was able to &amp;#34;re-fluff&amp;#34</li>
            <li>For $4 to be able to spend 10 minutes total showering and doing my hair 4 to 5 days a week this girl is happy!</li>
            <li>it works way better</li>
            <li>I have been trying different brands of &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34; and I am very happy with the DOVE brand.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than John Frieda</li>
            <li>You are better off using a hair perfume than this product.</li>
            <li>Better than talcum powder to absorb excess oil if that is your problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried applying it at night before bed and find that it absorbs oil better and my hair is easier to style in the morning.  </li>
            <li>i am so glad that i purchased this product.</li>
            <li>, what you smell reminds me more of deodorant than baby powder.</li>
            <li>I just bought 3 more bottles at wallmart</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this product is the amount of volume and life my hair gets after using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You need to check the sprayer and make sure you do not hear any noise.</li>
            <li>I was paying thirty dollars more for...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll have to give this some more time</li>
            <li>I was expecting more......</li>
            <li>The hair is much better with the product, but not as whashed.</li>
            <li>Before this I used another brand and it did not work at all, so I fell in love with this product as soon as I used it.</li>
            <li>I have used a TIGI brand that I really love</li>
            <li>but I think I love Dove more.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of it, and for the price it is just fantastic!</li>
            <li>I was sure to shake the can before application but the powdery portion of the spray comes out in intermittent blasts.  </li>
            <li>Because of the intermittent blasts of powder, I have to use more product and the end result is that my hair feels filmy and doesn&#x27;t look refreshed</li>
            <li>This is one of the better ones on the market.</li>
            <li>Works really good and smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I am not a girly girl most of the time</li>
            <li>but I have been watching too many Youtube videos and a lot of women</li>
            <li>and I love Dove products.</li>
            <li>as many others I have tried.</li>
            <li>so you may love it</li>
            <li>Problem is the price is more than doubled and will need to go elsewhere to buy now.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Suave brand since and like it a lot better.</li>
            <li>and I would use it a lot more.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the $30 salon brands &amp; the $3 drugstore brands and many, many in between.</li>
            <li>and I am really pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Both are much better than the Tresemme&#x27; brand.</li>
            <li>I wash about once a week to keep my hair healthy but the downside is I have greasy roots.</li>
            <li>and it had more volume then</li>
            <li>and it has become their favorite as well.</li>
            <li>I love using it -</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use a ton to make my hair look and feel better.</li>
            <li>Smells okay too.</li>
            <li>but when I use it I make sure that I don&#x27;t hear any air being released from the can before replacing the cap.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>but it may be able to fuel your cooking stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is OKAY.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue looking for something better...</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>The powder takes a bit more effort to \\&quot;rub</li>
            <li>But Dove did add more volume than Suave.</li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Good house keeping was right.  </li>
            <li>No white residue and makes my hair have lovely volume!!!</li>
            <li>When I get up in the morning, I have beautiful, fluffy, great smelling hair.  </li>
            <li>They pretty much all do the job, but this is one of the ones that works best for me.  </li>
            <li>The scent is cheap and very strong - it stays for hours in your hear.</li>
            <li>Does the job in a pinch but has a VERY strong cheap perfume smell.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product to use between normal shampoing.</li>
            <li>The Suave one is pretty good too, and is $1.00 cheaper.  </li>
            <li>This was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty good, and it smells alright as well.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo smells wonderful and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I had to quite one for this awesome dry</li>
            <li>Unless you want to pay $18 a bottle, this is the best dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I have tried.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo out there</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo for drugstore price.</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>My scalp is picky when it comes to dry shampoo, but this is THE BEST product on the market.</li>
            <li>this is the best dry shampoo ever.  </li>
            <li>This was better than the Oscar Blandi product - which did absolutely nothing - but not as good as the Batiste.</li>
            <li>it really is smelly, but in a good way, which i love.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE, defiantly worth trying ladies :)</li>
            <li>Smell is good, size is good , it does not leave too much residue but absorbs grease good enough.</li>
            <li>so if you have particularly fine hair this might be worthwhile for you.</li>
            <li>Time to try out another product on my hunt for the best, affordable dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>Maybe if it were available in an unscented version I could give it a better rating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, smells great and works so well.</li>
            <li>it really smells GOOD.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>The smell in this shampoo is good but very over-powering.  </li>
            <li>Of course, it&#x27;s great at absorbing oil and keeping your hair fresh between washes.</li>
            <li>The application is easy and the spray doesn&#x27;t leave a powdery look to your hair.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and such a good price.</li>
            <li>If you like your hair to feel natural and light, this one is for you (it also smells great).</li>
            <li>anyway, its a strong scent.</li>
            <li>My husband can&#x27;t stand strong smells and he complimented my hair for smelling &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The smell can be a bit strong....</li>
            <li>If you have any problem with strong smells, this product is NOT for you.  </li>
            <li>And the smell is extremely strong and perfume-y.</li>
            <li>The Dove Dry Shampoo is light, and smells very pleasant, and it has worked wonders on my hair.  </li>
            <li>ordered suave and dove the suave is better but this one is also good six more words are required enough said</li>
            <li>It gave my hair some volume in the top front, where I have the most oil, from touching my hair so much.</li>
            <li>The trick for fine hair is to NOT massage the product in after spraying it.  </li>
            <li>it smells wonderful, and does make my hair seem less greasy, but I don&#x27;t think hair spray types are my thing....</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair and this product gives me some texture to work with.</li>
            <li>It could be just my fine hair that didn&#x27;t mix well with this formula.</li>
            <li>That product was fine for removing the oil, and it even added some volume to my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a bit overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t fade quickly.</li>
            <li>I have hair that gets oily fairly quickly at the top of my head -</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>But the one drawback is the smell -- its very strong as you first spray it.</li>
            <li>It was fantastic for making my hair look cleaner and fuller.</li>
            <li>Instead, gently separate the strands a bit after applying the product (you kind of just use your finger tips to puff up your hair).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this is.</li>
            <li>The product is great, however only got to use it once.</li>
            <li>It does make my hair look semi fresh and not oily so that I am able to just tie it up in a bun or something.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell, but I guess everyone has their own opinion on that.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and effective.  </li>
            <li>It actually adds a lot of volume, surprisingly, and that makes my hair look even better.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair the right amount of refreshing needed after a couple days of not washing it.</li>
            <li>I have greasy hair and on day 2 my roots need a little help in a can to not look so greasy, this stuff is great, does exactly what it says it will and smells good too.</li>
            <li>It has a nice sweet scent that is soft and not to overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use, think hair spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It reacted like shiny clean hair and gave me hhhuuggee  beautiful curls not normal for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Great in between washes when you cannot make it to the hairdresser, or a long night out in a smokey environment and trying to get the smell</li>
            <li>I love Dove products and thought that this was a reasonable price so why not give it a try!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really overwhelming when you first spray it</li>
            <li>It works way better than the higher priced salon versions.</li>
            <li>Even after 3 days at a sweaty outdoor festival, my hair feels fresh!</li>
            <li>My new birth control is causing my hair to become more greasy more quickly</li>
            <li>product allows me to do that, while keeping a clean look with added texture.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great light-weight dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried a dry shampoo before, this is a great one to get started with.</li>
            <li>and then i can just go about my day knowing that it is clean.</li>
            <li>But Dove&#x27;s dry shampoo smells great and hides the grease.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo works great.</li>
            <li>My favorite is Batiste - lightly fragranced and works really well on the oil in my hair.</li>
            <li>, I felt like I needed a shower just to clean this stuff out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look and feel clean</li>
            <li>clean smell&lt;</li>
            <li>I have long, very nice, brown wavy hair.</li>
            <li>The dove hands down was the best first for price and because it does the job.</li>
            <li>I have been trying different dry shampoos to find the one that works best for me and Dove is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>My hair smells fresh and  It&#x27;s got everything of convenience, and it brings shine and clean feel, free of any fragrance.</li>
            <li>The finishing is not that great either leaving you with rough hair.</li>
            <li>I have brightly colored hair (violet &amp; blue) using semi-permanent dye, so I was looking space apart my hair-washing days.</li>
            <li>just use it at the roots at the top of my forehead where I get really oily.</li>
            <li>Overly sweet, like potpourri, and somewhat chemically.  </li>
            <li>Fair for the good price, but does not compare to more expensive options.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;perfume&#x27; is light and fresh - so you don&#x27;t feel like your hair announces, &#x27;I didn&#x27;t get washed today.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>Perfect for saving time on days you are busy with baby and just don&#x27;t have the time to wash and blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li>I liked the Tresemee and Suave dry shampoos a lot more.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many different dry shampoos throughout the years and this one is by far my favorite!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I have experienced with other products</li>
            <li>It has a fresh scent that smells clean and isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I can now go 2-3 days without washing my hair with this product and it looks and smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>If Batiste is sold out I guess this could make an ok back up, but baby powder might honestly be a better choice.</li>
            <li>They also leave my hair feeling super sticky or like I&#x27;ve sprayed loads of hairspray in my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets oily quickly.</li>
            <li>The powder seems to work its way through and be gone quickly,  </li>
            <li>This one works really good comparing to other cheap brands.</li>
            <li>It removed my oil, it gave me volume, and it smells very pretty.</li>
            <li>I would definitely continue using this for now to keep that fresh day1and2 look to my hair until I&#x27;m ready to brave the hair drying experience again</li>
            <li>It WORKS, it&#x27;s easy to apply, it DOESN&#x27;T easily turn your hair white (although I&#x27;m blonde, so I don&#x27;t know about darker hair), and it smells nice to boot!</li>
            <li>I can go an extra day without washing and my hair looks clean and amazing even though I haven&#x27;t washed it.</li>
            <li>I also slightly prefer the smell of Dove&#x27;s, though both are great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m forever on the hunt for a good dry shampoo that&#x27;s cheaper than batiste.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good and actually works, plus the bottle lasts quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Emailed Dove, they responded quickly and promised a complimentary coupon.  </li>
            <li>Batiste dry shampoo is a good alternative to this product.</li>
            <li>This absorbs some but adds too much weight without getting the full dryness that you get from Batiste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still better than the Oscar Blandi product and much cheaper than the Batiste</li>
            <li>With long hair it isn&#x27;t healthy to wash everyday so this is perfect for the in between days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve easily used it 5-6 times and still have most of the can left.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo - works great in my blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands of dry shampoo and this by far is the best one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing a lot of mixed reviews on this product, but for me it is amazing.</li>
            <li>When I put it on I look like I have freshly washed and styled hair all day</li>
            <li>This one, I was able to use twice, but then the spray nozzle completely quit working.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair looking fresh in between the washes.  </li>
            <li>This by far is my favorite.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for a product to truly refresh your hair and that is all natural I would recommend Cake Beauty Satin Sugar Refreshing Hair &amp; Body Powder.</li>
            <li>soaks up all the oil and leaves my hair fresh.</li>
            <li>My hair is in much better condition because I don&#x27;t wash all the natural oils away.</li>
            <li>I bought it for those rare occasion when I don&#x27;t want to wake up and shower.</li>
            <li>Although I do want my hair to smell fresh between washes, I don&#x27;t want my head to smell</li>
            <li>Not only does it work really well, but it smells really good too.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for about 2 weeks, so I can&#x27;t say yet whether this will work for me long-term, but it seems like a great product so far.</li>
            <li>As good  or better than more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>This works pretty good for a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Ie tried several other drug store brands, but this is the best...  </li>
            <li>The scent is super nice and that&#x27;s about the only positive thing for me.</li>
            <li>Shipping was right on and the product performs up to expectations.</li>
            <li>It arrived today, and I tried it right away.</li>
            <li>Having fine, oily hair I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoos, even the pricey ones.</li>
            <li>It goes on white and powdery, which might be a problem for those with dark hair, but for me, it&#x27;s the perfect product.</li>
            <li>I finish the style with a light hair spray or finishing mist that adds a small bit of shine and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li>I picked up the Dove dry shampoo on a whim and fell in love!</li>
            <li>I often use dry shampoos for volume alone, and this is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;It REALLY works on oily hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing; I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the dispenser getting stuck or running out of product quickly; and it leaves no visible white residue after rubbing it into my scalp and brushing out, per the directions.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and lasts long too</li>
            <li>She has to style her hair everyday, so this is a nice break, when you need one!</li>
            <li>My BF uses it too and he has dark hair and it works just as good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll update if something changes, but as of right now it doesn&#x27;t seem to do very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, for me, Suave wins because it give my hair more volume, has fresher scents, and seems to always last longer.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is really nice for the price.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re at all sensitive to strong scents, avoid this like the plague...</li>
            <li>If you are like me and do not like strong smelling products, stay far away from this product.</li>
            <li>and I was nearly knocked out senseless by the strong chemical odor.</li>
            <li>My hair is auburn right now and there is a bit of whitish powder look to it some days that I didn&#x27;t notice when my hair was its natural light brown.</li>
            <li>This helps tremendously with my overall hair health, and helps to keep my ends from becoming the texture of a boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos but this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is definitely the best brand I have used thus far.</li>
            <li>but if you aren&#x27;t sensitive to smells it is fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always favored Suave dry shampoos (Suave has several different kinds, I love them all), but I&#x27;m not mad if I have to use this one</li>
            <li>I have almost black hair, when used correctly this is one of the best dry shampoos for the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my favorite because the smell is light and fresh and it leaves little residue if used in moderation.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it in hot water, took it apart, and could not fix it.  </li>
            <li>I use this the night before and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I also felt that it stopped working as well after consistent use for 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff - I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and this is the one I go back too.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff to prevent it from getting greasy in the first place and give my hair volume.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Will be buying &amp;#34;Suave&amp;#34; next to save $$ and see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li>This step is critial -- brushing alone won&#x27;t get most of the white out.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a care package I was putting together for my wife because we were about to have our first child</li>
            <li>Make sure to shake the product well before spraying as it does leave a residual white powdery substance</li>
            <li>I gave it away after the first use; I&#x27;d rather wash my hair every day than deal with those drawbacks.</li>
            <li>I have thinning hair that looks pretty greasy after 1 day of no washing.  </li>
            <li>Since I was running out the door (the whole purpose of using this!)</li>
            <li>I just got this bottle 2 days ago...used it for the first time today in the morning and when I went to use it again in the afternoon all the aerosol leaked out...</li>
            <li>I actually quite love this product.</li>
            <li>and I believe alcohol can be pretty drying.</li>
            <li>It can be really strong if you have to use more than just a little bit of it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for after the gym or just for those mornings where you don&#x27;t have enough time to wash and dry your hair.</li>
            <li>Hair feels more flat after usage, but does feel noticably cleaner.</li>
            <li>It DOES take the oil out of my hair and make it look clean again but for whatever reason it also makes my hair feel like straw when it was soft before.</li>
            <li>It definitely is a clean fix for day old hair if you can&#x27;t shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it very helpful mostly on using on my white dog.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have a heavy smell too it, more of a light powder scent.</li>
            <li>Dry shampoo is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair and don&#x27;t like to wash it too often, so the dry shampoo is great at prolonging wear (especially if I curl my hair).</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent and my partner does as well, it&#x27;s clean, light and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many conversations with people about how they can&#x27;t believe they waited so long to buy Batiste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much just seconding what everyone else has said.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Dove Refresh+Care Invigorating Dry Shampoo...</li>
            <li>I could not ask for more in a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love my Dove Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very older lady perfumy.</li>
            <li>Not to mention afterwards my hair is super soft</li>
            <li>I love dry shampoo</li>
            <li>However, 2 stars because it does work okay as a dry shampoo and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft but after using this, I can&#x27;t run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li>Dove has found the magic potion with this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many dry shampoos and this one works as well as the rest, I have just have a problem with the scent.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo will make your hair look cleaner, but with too many undesirable side effects.  </li>
            <li>But the scent was so strong I had to shampoo an hour later.</li>
            <li>IF I got a few more uses out of it!</li>
            <li>It is way too strong for me, which makes me only use it in hair and time &amp;#34;emergencies.&amp;#34; I wish it could be in scented or much lighter scent</li>
            <li>B008D5HAHU Batiste Dry Shampoo Original Clean &amp; Classic</li>
            <li>/&gt;This may be appropriate for women but it not a dry shampoo for men due to the strong womanely perfume smell that pervades your presence for hours after applying this chemical stench.</li>
            <li>( I could go 3 days no problem with my lower back length, fine but lots of it, hair)</li>
            <li>This stuff is way better than the tres semme dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>the smell is amazing and the little amount that i did get out did work...</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, if I skip a wash day, usually my hair gets extraordinarily oily very quickly, with the awesome odor of unwashed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, as compared to other brands such as Bastiste.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really sticky, so it acted much like hairspray in matting my hair together and making it very untouchable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to run out fast.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the spray because it doesn&#x27;t get all over my hands and clothes and doesn&#x27;t look like I have baby powder in my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair gets very oily within 24 hours of washing</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really staticky, and I had to use ALOT of it to see the oil in my hair subside.</li>
            <li>And, from what I noticed, there wasn&#x27;t much product in the can to begin with.</li>
            <li>However, your hair must be light in color, because it is white and does leave a residue.</li>
            <li>This stuff works well:  absorbs oil, adds texture, doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a powdery residue (or gunk like Tresemme).  </li>
            <li>not too much product though.</li>
            <li>really, really like this product, so</li>
            <li>if you do that it really works.  </li>
            <li>so I really need this sometimes</li>
            <li>The powder doesn&#x27;t brush out, and even after two real washes I can still feel the residue.</li>
            <li>i use as directed and it really does wash away all of the grease build up in your hair.</li>
            <li>I have really oily hair</li>
            <li>have a scent but fades really fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>that I end up getting really itchy by the end of the day and need to shower just to get everything out of my hair.</li>
            <li>It really works well.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my hair feel refreshed and cuts the shine and greasy feeling if I have not had time to wash it.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to anyone who has my hair type!</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t have quite as much oil absorbing power</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t even really run my hands trough it.</li>
            <li>It takes as much time as washing your hair....</li>
            <li>I get oily hair rather fast.</li>
            <li>My hair retains its volume and the shampoo efficiently keeps my hair not-oily for up to two days (with a light reapplication on the second day).</li>
            <li>Really works like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>All at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t really do anything to help me skip a wash -</li>
            <li>spray too much</li>
            <li>but this is really something.</li>
            <li>nothing really happened even after spraying quite a lot and fluffing up my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it wors.</li>
            <li>Thanks Dove!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a floral sent which is very pleasing.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>I use this because my hair is very oily in the morning if I haven&#x27;t had a chance to shower yet.  </li>
            <li>than that, it does what you want it to do - my hair looked perfectly clean for a whole extra day (which is really saying something because my hair is a greaseball within 24 hours of washing it).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products that have worked better than this</li>
            <li>and I can get so much more sleep without having to worry about what to do with my wet mop every day!</li>
            <li>I have tried many other  products and this one sprays on well</li>
            <li>overwhelming smell I really do not care for!</li>
            <li>So far, the best budget dry shampoo I have found is Psssst, but it can be hard to find in drug stores sometimes.</li>
            <li>It appears clean at a glance but does have any movement and feels gross.</li>
            <li>just wash it with water and regular shampoo if you want clean hair.</li>
            <li>While dry shampoos never give you that freshly washed feel, this one is different in that it does have a decent scent unlike so many others.</li>
            <li>I do love trying new products though, so this will go in my mental \\&quot;yes\\&quot; list of approved products</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING, and the only dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>this smells fresh, i didnt notice any leaking at all.works amazing, and it doesnt make my hairs STARK white like the tresemme one did.</li>
            <li>The product itself works OK -- it removes oil but makes my dark brown hair look gray and mousy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to put to much heat on my ends during my normal work week, so when I blow out my hair</li>
            <li>Well... it does smell nice but not sure how &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; my hair feels.</li>
            <li>The Dove Dry Shampoo works pretty well for me as my hair gets oily fairly quickly after a wash.</li>
            <li>Its slightly floral but sort of fresh and clean smelling...</li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t particularly offensive, but it was... everpresent.</li>
            <li>It absorbs the oils in my hair quickly, and I do not have the white powder residue.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a very strong, very long lasting perfume-y smell.</li>
            <li>And HOURS later, I could still smell nothing but the spray (which had a not terribly unpleasant powdery scent).</li>
            <li>Right after you spray it on, really rub your scalp so it&#x27;s not white.</li>
            <li>The small is great and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film of dry flakey powder on your scalp.</li>
            <li>I have used this type of dry shampoo when I am not able to wash my heair, and am quite happy with the results</li>
            <li>I have tried drug store and high end.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Just pull up on the nozzle a little and put it up to your ear and make sure you don&#x27;t hear air.</li>
            <li>I tried this one day when my hair looked like it needed a little help--hoping to give it more volume and make it look cleaner.  </li>
            <li>They said by just putting it on with their hands &amp; then combing their hair, it made their hair soft and clean without flakes or white powder.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this stuff unless you want to smell like that 80 year old grandma in the elevator wearing so much perfume it makes your eyes</li>
            <li>It is nice to have on hand on busy or lazy days</li>
            <li>it has a fresh scent without the white residue.</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>The powder doesn&#x27;t show up as white like most dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling gross like many dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different drugstore dry shampoos and this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li>Does not leave your hair with a white residue that most dry shampoos leave.  </li>
            <li>(For what it&#x27;s worth, I have fine, dark blonde hair.)  </li>
            <li>It is more liquid and less powder based like other dry shampoos and seems to do nothing but add oil and a very strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weight down the hair and it makes it easy to re-style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s available at Target and lotsa other places.</li>
            <li>Smells decent, albeit a little strong for my taste.  </li>
            <li>It also did give my hair a little extra volume, which was nice.</li>
            <li>My daughter borrowed my new can for her vacation ...  </li>
            <li>Compared to other dry shampoos I think Dove&#x27;s smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to have this product for times when I am running late and don&#x27;t have time to do the whole beauty routine.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this product to use between washes like everyone else, but then realized it works amazingly on my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>Works like any other dry shampoo good for touch ups in the middle of the week if you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair seems exactly the same as it was before I put it on-- I can see and feel no difference.</li>
            <li>The first bottle started out full, but after just one use, when I went to use it a second time, it was completely empty.  </li>
            <li>I only got any powder out the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, it seemed to work relatively well; it took out a bit of the oil</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat this one for the price by far!  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the ingredient list was a joke, but I checked the Dove corporate site and it is not a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they could come up with different scents, I&#x27;d be willing to try it, otherwise I am going to have to try another brand.</li>
            <li>The first ingredient is isobutane, and the second is propane.</li>
            <li>I found that it works better then the Pantene brand dry shampoo and the Tresame brand dry shampoo, which are comparable in price.</li>
            <li>Instead of just getting rid of the greasiness in my long, fine, oil-prone, blonde hair, it gives me a ton of volume.</li>
            <li>lol it was still pretty bad...</li>
            <li>Also, as previously mentioned, it does smell very strongly of cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind a subtle smell on hair products but this one is pretty strong floral scent.</li>
            <li>When I was finally able to spray more - it leaves your scalp feeling cold and barely absorbs any oil.</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot more $$ on dry shampoo before and nothing compares to this one.</li>
            <li>used dry shampoo quite a bit back in the early 70&#x27;s and am glad to have finally found it again.</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, I did not have any problems with the nozzle getting clogged, but it still didn&#x27;t last for very many uses before it was empty.</li>
            <li>can emptying quickly like other reviewers seemed to have...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible my hair is much too oily for this</li>
            <li>and it may work well for people with regular hair trying to extend a style rather than someone with a real oil problem.</li>
            <li>I only get about 2-3 VERY FRUGAL uses from a bottle.</li>
            <li>Works well, no grimy residue, but offers no volume or boost.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind this personally, because as I mentioned before my hair is very thin/wispy and tends to be all over the place.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money....  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of something I used to spray in my old college dorm room.</li>
            <li>I have straight dirty-blonde hair, and it has grown about three inches above my waist.</li>
            <li>Okay, the negative reviews here are for the can, not the product.</li>
            <li>and you look like an old lady....</li>
            <li>So I got up a bit early</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use much or your hair turns white even when you brush it in.</li>
            <li>i am not that sensitive to smells, and i can smell this all day wafting around my head.</li>
            <li>I had to throw this away after only a few uses; the perfume smell was overwhelming and it did not absorb oil well at all.</li>
            <li>It is more expensive but so worth the price.</li>
            <li>the first day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used every dry shampoo out there (many company&#x27;s just started making it, a few years ago you needed to go to a specialty store and there was only two brands)</li>
            <li>Luckily I was only going to a dog class, but this was pretty much a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if 5oz really goes that quickly or if it just leaked out somehow.</li>
            <li>So dry shampoo is something I use pretty frequently.</li>
            <li>The first one I tried was the Tresemme dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>It has a light powdery scent similar to their other hair care products.  </li>
            <li>Some days it is just too hot to blow dry...</li>
            <li>This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel TOTALLY clean as it would with regular shampoo, though that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true that it can leave a white residue, but only if you can&#x27;t follow simple directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Dove DS made my hair feel soft with no real stiff or too-thick feeling.</li>
            <li>I recommend only using this once in between washing, I have found that the morning after I use this my hair is typically pretty gross.</li>
            <li>I have dark blonde hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it too light.</li>
            <li>I have found that a few quick bursts of dry shampoo work better than just holding the nozzle down and spraying all over.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo works as well was the expensive salon ones &amp; smells great.</li>
            <li>It is scented, but not as heavily as the other dry shampoo I tried, which is good.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work on my hair, I have long brown hair that can get oily after a day of not washing.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of dry shampoos and they all have a certain smell to them.  </li>
            <li>I use dry shampoo every day, but the kind I like (nexxus) is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li>I still wash my hair every other day and sometimes I would use this stuff on the 3rd day especially if I don&#x27;t have to be anywhere important.</li>
            <li>I actually picked this up at Walmart but figured I&#x27;d write a review since I&#x27;m looking for a new brand on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep trying new brands as they come along, but this one is a winner, especially at this</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t see it working really well as a dry shampoo...</li>
            <li>I despise the smell of this brand of dry shampoo, and I found it very sticky.</li>
            <li>My hair gets really oily by day2/3 and takes over a hour between rollers and blow dry.</li>
            <li>so if you put too much on you definitely have to spend some time and drizzle some water on your hairbrush to get the white powdery look out.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure there may have been something people were doing wrong when they say it only lasts 1-2 uses, but sure enough, mine is completely empty after just 1.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, not strong, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dry or &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; like some dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li>I should of read other reviews first.  </li>
            <li>After not washing my hair for a couple days, it gets oily and greasy (gross but natural) and this dry shampoo really helps.</li>
            <li>Not too powdery, the white spray was easily absorbed, unlike other sprays.</li>
            <li>I ordered this based on reviews that said it was better than other similar brands, with less of an offensive smell.  </li>
            <li>Such a time saver for my busy schedule</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s about the same as Sauve, so far.  </li>
            <li>This particular one tends to leave my hair so dry throughout the day (instead of just removing grease)</li>
            <li>I do &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34; frequently, so  I&#x27;ve tried a number of different brands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m middle aged and have been using dry shampoo on my fine hair since middle school.  </li>
            <li>I am really surprised Dove would carry a product such as this</li>
            <li>I also LOVE the way it adds tons of volume to my thin hair.</li>
            <li>Not bad but not better than others.</li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo, it removes the extra oil from your hair, it gives you extra voulum and if you have a little grow out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time,  can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>If I would have to say one negative thing about this dry shampoo is the fragrance, if you are sensitive to strong scents, this may be a turn off.</li>
            <li>I normally use salon products but decided to give this dry shampoo a whirl.  </li>
            <li>So much in fact that I stopped using my other volumizing products bc</li>
            <li>I am always very cautious about stong smells when I am at work or around other people</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of these other reviews &amp; I think that some might not be using the product correctly; using too much product &amp; not rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>I have used other brands that  cost twice as much.  </li>
            <li>The smell a little overwhelming but overall a typical dryshampoo, hey it did</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other dry shampoos that make my hair look and feel like it had been freshly washed.</li>
            <li>I am new to the wonders of dry shampoo</li>
            <li>This is the third dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used and my least favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only slightly hazy, compared to the many other dry shampoos I have tried.  </li>
            <li>This was the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried and it did some pretty serious damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying, I have use so many of these products on my thick, curly hair but only this spray doesn&#x27;t leave my hair super heavy with clay or too dried out.</li>
            <li>I have tried at least a half dozen dry shampoos and this is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an overpowering, sickeningly sweet, saccharine, chemical aroma that makes me feel like my head has been doused in every scent at Bath &amp; Body Works combined with a dose of that horrible smell that hits you when you walk into Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, topped off with a cheap, overwhelming taxi air &amp;#34;freshener&amp;#34; that makes your eyes water and forces you to roll down the window even if it&#x27;s raining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands, but they have ultimately made my hair feel gunky and have been REALLY over-scented.  </li>
            <li>So, I stopped washing my hair every day and only did it every other day or every two days which I really find to be gross</li>
            <li>I wish they would find a way to make it clear like some of the pricer salon dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li>To be clear this is not about the dry shampoo</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that my hair definitely doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it would if I were to wash it</li>
            <li>And it really doesn&#x27;t even work to make my hair look less oily.  </li>
            <li>It smells clean and does not leave a heavy white powder like other brands do.</li>
            <li>tried Tresemme&#x27;s Dry Shampoo first, but their dry shampoo left my hair too dry and with visible white residue, no matter how often I tried brushing my hair</li>
            <li>If you have fine or thin hair I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands of dry shampoos before, and I really don&#x27;t like this one.</li>
            <li>I really like the Dove Dry Shampoo compared to other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>While it wasn&#x27;t as bad as tresseme (made me more oily instead of absorbing oil) or suave (breakout city and migraine inducing scent)</li>
            <li>It provides volume (which is what my straight hair needs) but not so much thats its crazy - still very touchable hair.</li>
            <li>Sprays on clear and leaves my hair looking wet and greasy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> The price kind of makes up for it, but its still a con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a shame, i really liked this product but if that is all i can get out of a bottle then i will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Dove has a really nice smell without being overbearing.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice</li>
            <li> Nice effect on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Really liked it after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product for the price.</li>
            <li> Its an affordable, and effective product.  </li>
            <li> this is a nice option.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product since the price is so good</li>
            <li> Strong but pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product- works well without the high intensity smell</li>
            <li> It really is a great dry shampoo, and I got it at a great price!</li>
            <li> I can now go happily for 4-5 days without a shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it has a lovely, light, scent.</li>
            <li> but great for a quick hair freshener.</li>
            <li> Great product for those moments when you&#x27;re in a jiffy and need a quick touch-up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very strong...</li>
            <li> very easy  to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the best I&#x27;ve discovered so far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want others being able to smell it, and I also wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the texture of my hair afterward.</li>
            <li> That easy!</li>
            <li> And it is STRONG!  </li>
            <li> I liked the scent, it was not too overpowering and smelled very clean.</li>
            <li> This has been the best working and smelling dry shampoo I have tried, leaves hair light and smelling great.</li>
            <li> As for the scent yea it was strong but I liked it.</li>
            <li> I honestly think it smells too strong...</li>
            <li> (it leaves more of a matte finish).&lt;br /&gt;It also does a great job absorbing oiliness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure any of the powder is coming out--</li>
            <li> I love how well this product works and smells...except for the fact</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, it does cast off a white powder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been stocking up on this:)</li>
            <li> Cannot get hold of it in my country so more satisfied.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing is that it doesn&#x27;t stink like the others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> They have updated the spray nozzle, and it works fabulously!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> But I did find that after using this, I was able to &amp;#34;re-fluff&amp;#34</li>
            <li> For $4 to be able to spend 10 minutes total showering and doing my hair 4 to 5 days a week this girl is happy!</li>
            <li> it works way better</li>
            <li> I have been trying different brands of &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34; and I am very happy with the DOVE brand.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than John Frieda</li>
            <li> You are better off using a hair perfume than this product.</li>
            <li> Better than talcum powder to absorb excess oil if that is your problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried applying it at night before bed and find that it absorbs oil better and my hair is easier to style in the morning.  </li>
            <li> i am so glad that i purchased this product.</li>
            <li> , what you smell reminds me more of deodorant than baby powder.</li>
            <li> I just bought 3 more bottles at wallmart</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this product is the amount of volume and life my hair gets after using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You need to check the sprayer and make sure you do not hear any noise.</li>
            <li> I was paying thirty dollars more for...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to give this some more time</li>
            <li> I was expecting more......</li>
            <li> The hair is much better with the product, but not as whashed.</li>
            <li> Before this I used another brand and it did not work at all, so I fell in love with this product as soon as I used it.</li>
            <li> I have used a TIGI brand that I really love</li>
            <li> but I think I love Dove more.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it, and for the price it is just fantastic!</li>
            <li> I was sure to shake the can before application but the powdery portion of the spray comes out in intermittent blasts.  </li>
            <li> Because of the intermittent blasts of powder, I have to use more product and the end result is that my hair feels filmy and doesn&#x27;t look refreshed</li>
            <li> This is one of the better ones on the market.</li>
            <li> Works really good and smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I am not a girly girl most of the time</li>
            <li> but I have been watching too many Youtube videos and a lot of women</li>
            <li> and I love Dove products.</li>
            <li> as many others I have tried.</li>
            <li> so you may love it</li>
            <li> Problem is the price is more than doubled and will need to go elsewhere to buy now.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Suave brand since and like it a lot better.</li>
            <li> and I would use it a lot more.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the $30 salon brands &amp; the $3 drugstore brands and many, many in between.</li>
            <li> and I am really pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Both are much better than the Tresemme&#x27; brand.</li>
            <li> I wash about once a week to keep my hair healthy but the downside is I have greasy roots.</li>
            <li> and it had more volume then</li>
            <li> and it has become their favorite as well.</li>
            <li> I love using it -</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use a ton to make my hair look and feel better.</li>
            <li> Smells okay too.</li>
            <li> but when I use it I make sure that I don&#x27;t hear any air being released from the can before replacing the cap.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> but it may be able to fuel your cooking stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is OKAY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue looking for something better...</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> The powder takes a bit more effort to \\&quot;rub</li>
            <li> But Dove did add more volume than Suave.</li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Good house keeping was right.  </li>
            <li> No white residue and makes my hair have lovely volume!!!</li>
            <li> When I get up in the morning, I have beautiful, fluffy, great smelling hair.  </li>
            <li> They pretty much all do the job, but this is one of the ones that works best for me.  </li>
            <li> The scent is cheap and very strong - it stays for hours in your hear.</li>
            <li> Does the job in a pinch but has a VERY strong cheap perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product to use between normal shampoing.</li>
            <li> The Suave one is pretty good too, and is $1.00 cheaper.  </li>
            <li> This was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty good, and it smells alright as well.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo smells wonderful and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I had to quite one for this awesome dry</li>
            <li> Unless you want to pay $18 a bottle, this is the best dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have tried.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo out there</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo for drugstore price.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is picky when it comes to dry shampoo, but this is THE BEST product on the market.</li>
            <li> this is the best dry shampoo ever.  </li>
            <li> This was better than the Oscar Blandi product - which did absolutely nothing - but not as good as the Batiste.</li>
            <li> it really is smelly, but in a good way, which i love.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE, defiantly worth trying ladies :)</li>
            <li> Smell is good, size is good , it does not leave too much residue but absorbs grease good enough.</li>
            <li> so if you have particularly fine hair this might be worthwhile for you.</li>
            <li> Time to try out another product on my hunt for the best, affordable dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> Maybe if it were available in an unscented version I could give it a better rating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, smells great and works so well.</li>
            <li> it really smells GOOD.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> The smell in this shampoo is good but very over-powering.  </li>
            <li> Of course, it&#x27;s great at absorbing oil and keeping your hair fresh between washes.</li>
            <li> The application is easy and the spray doesn&#x27;t leave a powdery look to your hair.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and such a good price.</li>
            <li> If you like your hair to feel natural and light, this one is for you (it also smells great).</li>
            <li> anyway, its a strong scent.</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t stand strong smells and he complimented my hair for smelling &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The smell can be a bit strong....</li>
            <li> If you have any problem with strong smells, this product is NOT for you.  </li>
            <li> And the smell is extremely strong and perfume-y.</li>
            <li> The Dove Dry Shampoo is light, and smells very pleasant, and it has worked wonders on my hair.  </li>
            <li> ordered suave and dove the suave is better but this one is also good six more words are required enough said</li>
            <li> It gave my hair some volume in the top front, where I have the most oil, from touching my hair so much.</li>
            <li> The trick for fine hair is to NOT massage the product in after spraying it.  </li>
            <li> it smells wonderful, and does make my hair seem less greasy, but I don&#x27;t think hair spray types are my thing....</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair and this product gives me some texture to work with.</li>
            <li> It could be just my fine hair that didn&#x27;t mix well with this formula.</li>
            <li> That product was fine for removing the oil, and it even added some volume to my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t fade quickly.</li>
            <li> I have hair that gets oily fairly quickly at the top of my head -</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> But the one drawback is the smell -- its very strong as you first spray it.</li>
            <li> It was fantastic for making my hair look cleaner and fuller.</li>
            <li> Instead, gently separate the strands a bit after applying the product (you kind of just use your finger tips to puff up your hair).  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this is.</li>
            <li> The product is great, however only got to use it once.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair look semi fresh and not oily so that I am able to just tie it up in a bun or something.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, but I guess everyone has their own opinion on that.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and effective.  </li>
            <li> It actually adds a lot of volume, surprisingly, and that makes my hair look even better.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair the right amount of refreshing needed after a couple days of not washing it.</li>
            <li> I have greasy hair and on day 2 my roots need a little help in a can to not look so greasy, this stuff is great, does exactly what it says it will and smells good too.</li>
            <li> It has a nice sweet scent that is soft and not to overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use, think hair spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It reacted like shiny clean hair and gave me hhhuuggee  beautiful curls not normal for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great in between washes when you cannot make it to the hairdresser, or a long night out in a smokey environment and trying to get the smell</li>
            <li> I love Dove products and thought that this was a reasonable price so why not give it a try!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really overwhelming when you first spray it</li>
            <li> It works way better than the higher priced salon versions.</li>
            <li> Even after 3 days at a sweaty outdoor festival, my hair feels fresh!</li>
            <li> My new birth control is causing my hair to become more greasy more quickly</li>
            <li> product allows me to do that, while keeping a clean look with added texture.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great light-weight dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried a dry shampoo before, this is a great one to get started with.</li>
            <li> and then i can just go about my day knowing that it is clean.</li>
            <li> But Dove&#x27;s dry shampoo smells great and hides the grease.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works great.</li>
            <li> My favorite is Batiste - lightly fragranced and works really well on the oil in my hair.</li>
            <li> , I felt like I needed a shower just to clean this stuff out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair look and feel clean</li>
            <li> clean smell&lt;</li>
            <li> I have long, very nice, brown wavy hair.</li>
            <li> The dove hands down was the best first for price and because it does the job.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different dry shampoos to find the one that works best for me and Dove is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> My hair smells fresh and  It&#x27;s got everything of convenience, and it brings shine and clean feel, free of any fragrance.</li>
            <li> The finishing is not that great either leaving you with rough hair.</li>
            <li> I have brightly colored hair (violet &amp; blue) using semi-permanent dye, so I was looking space apart my hair-washing days.</li>
            <li> just use it at the roots at the top of my forehead where I get really oily.</li>
            <li> Overly sweet, like potpourri, and somewhat chemically.  </li>
            <li> Fair for the good price, but does not compare to more expensive options.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;perfume&#x27; is light and fresh - so you don&#x27;t feel like your hair announces, &#x27;I didn&#x27;t get washed today.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Perfect for saving time on days you are busy with baby and just don&#x27;t have the time to wash and blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I liked the Tresemee and Suave dry shampoos a lot more.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many different dry shampoos throughout the years and this one is by far my favorite!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have experienced with other products</li>
            <li> It has a fresh scent that smells clean and isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I can now go 2-3 days without washing my hair with this product and it looks and smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> If Batiste is sold out I guess this could make an ok back up, but baby powder might honestly be a better choice.</li>
            <li> They also leave my hair feeling super sticky or like I&#x27;ve sprayed loads of hairspray in my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets oily quickly.</li>
            <li> The powder seems to work its way through and be gone quickly,  </li>
            <li> This one works really good comparing to other cheap brands.</li>
            <li> It removed my oil, it gave me volume, and it smells very pretty.</li>
            <li> I would definitely continue using this for now to keep that fresh day1and2 look to my hair until I&#x27;m ready to brave the hair drying experience again</li>
            <li> It WORKS, it&#x27;s easy to apply, it DOESN&#x27;T easily turn your hair white (although I&#x27;m blonde, so I don&#x27;t know about darker hair), and it smells nice to boot!</li>
            <li> I can go an extra day without washing and my hair looks clean and amazing even though I haven&#x27;t washed it.</li>
            <li> I also slightly prefer the smell of Dove&#x27;s, though both are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m forever on the hunt for a good dry shampoo that&#x27;s cheaper than batiste.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good and actually works, plus the bottle lasts quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Emailed Dove, they responded quickly and promised a complimentary coupon.  </li>
            <li> Batiste dry shampoo is a good alternative to this product.</li>
            <li> This absorbs some but adds too much weight without getting the full dryness that you get from Batiste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still better than the Oscar Blandi product and much cheaper than the Batiste</li>
            <li> With long hair it isn&#x27;t healthy to wash everyday so this is perfect for the in between days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve easily used it 5-6 times and still have most of the can left.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo - works great in my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of dry shampoo and this by far is the best one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing a lot of mixed reviews on this product, but for me it is amazing.</li>
            <li> When I put it on I look like I have freshly washed and styled hair all day</li>
            <li> This one, I was able to use twice, but then the spray nozzle completely quit working.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair looking fresh in between the washes.  </li>
            <li> This by far is my favorite.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for a product to truly refresh your hair and that is all natural I would recommend Cake Beauty Satin Sugar Refreshing Hair &amp; Body Powder.</li>
            <li> soaks up all the oil and leaves my hair fresh.</li>
            <li> My hair is in much better condition because I don&#x27;t wash all the natural oils away.</li>
            <li> I bought it for those rare occasion when I don&#x27;t want to wake up and shower.</li>
            <li> Although I do want my hair to smell fresh between washes, I don&#x27;t want my head to smell</li>
            <li> Not only does it work really well, but it smells really good too.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about 2 weeks, so I can&#x27;t say yet whether this will work for me long-term, but it seems like a great product so far.</li>
            <li> As good  or better than more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good for a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Ie tried several other drug store brands, but this is the best...  </li>
            <li> The scent is super nice and that&#x27;s about the only positive thing for me.</li>
            <li> Shipping was right on and the product performs up to expectations.</li>
            <li> It arrived today, and I tried it right away.</li>
            <li> Having fine, oily hair I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoos, even the pricey ones.</li>
            <li> It goes on white and powdery, which might be a problem for those with dark hair, but for me, it&#x27;s the perfect product.</li>
            <li> I finish the style with a light hair spray or finishing mist that adds a small bit of shine and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li> I picked up the Dove dry shampoo on a whim and fell in love!</li>
            <li> I often use dry shampoos for volume alone, and this is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;It REALLY works on oily hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing; I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the dispenser getting stuck or running out of product quickly; and it leaves no visible white residue after rubbing it into my scalp and brushing out, per the directions.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing and lasts long too</li>
            <li> She has to style her hair everyday, so this is a nice break, when you need one!</li>
            <li> My BF uses it too and he has dark hair and it works just as good.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll update if something changes, but as of right now it doesn&#x27;t seem to do very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, for me, Suave wins because it give my hair more volume, has fresher scents, and seems to always last longer.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is really nice for the price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re at all sensitive to strong scents, avoid this like the plague...</li>
            <li> If you are like me and do not like strong smelling products, stay far away from this product.</li>
            <li> and I was nearly knocked out senseless by the strong chemical odor.</li>
            <li> My hair is auburn right now and there is a bit of whitish powder look to it some days that I didn&#x27;t notice when my hair was its natural light brown.</li>
            <li> This helps tremendously with my overall hair health, and helps to keep my ends from becoming the texture of a boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos but this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is definitely the best brand I have used thus far.</li>
            <li> but if you aren&#x27;t sensitive to smells it is fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always favored Suave dry shampoos (Suave has several different kinds, I love them all), but I&#x27;m not mad if I have to use this one</li>
            <li> I have almost black hair, when used correctly this is one of the best dry shampoos for the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my favorite because the smell is light and fresh and it leaves little residue if used in moderation.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it in hot water, took it apart, and could not fix it.  </li>
            <li> I use this the night before and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I also felt that it stopped working as well after consistent use for 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and this is the one I go back too.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff to prevent it from getting greasy in the first place and give my hair volume.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying &amp;#34;Suave&amp;#34; next to save $$ and see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li> This step is critial -- brushing alone won&#x27;t get most of the white out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a care package I was putting together for my wife because we were about to have our first child</li>
            <li> Make sure to shake the product well before spraying as it does leave a residual white powdery substance</li>
            <li> I gave it away after the first use; I&#x27;d rather wash my hair every day than deal with those drawbacks.</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair that looks pretty greasy after 1 day of no washing.  </li>
            <li> Since I was running out the door (the whole purpose of using this!)</li>
            <li> I just got this bottle 2 days ago...used it for the first time today in the morning and when I went to use it again in the afternoon all the aerosol leaked out...</li>
            <li> I actually quite love this product.</li>
            <li> and I believe alcohol can be pretty drying.</li>
            <li> It can be really strong if you have to use more than just a little bit of it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for after the gym or just for those mornings where you don&#x27;t have enough time to wash and dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Hair feels more flat after usage, but does feel noticably cleaner.</li>
            <li> It DOES take the oil out of my hair and make it look clean again but for whatever reason it also makes my hair feel like straw when it was soft before.</li>
            <li> It definitely is a clean fix for day old hair if you can&#x27;t shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it very helpful mostly on using on my white dog.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have a heavy smell too it, more of a light powder scent.</li>
            <li> Dry shampoo is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair and don&#x27;t like to wash it too often, so the dry shampoo is great at prolonging wear (especially if I curl my hair).</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent and my partner does as well, it&#x27;s clean, light and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many conversations with people about how they can&#x27;t believe they waited so long to buy Batiste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much just seconding what everyone else has said.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Dove Refresh+Care Invigorating Dry Shampoo...</li>
            <li> I could not ask for more in a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Dove Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very older lady perfumy.</li>
            <li> Not to mention afterwards my hair is super soft</li>
            <li> I love dry shampoo</li>
            <li> However, 2 stars because it does work okay as a dry shampoo and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft but after using this, I can&#x27;t run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> Dove has found the magic potion with this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many dry shampoos and this one works as well as the rest, I have just have a problem with the scent.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo will make your hair look cleaner, but with too many undesirable side effects.  </li>
            <li> But the scent was so strong I had to shampoo an hour later.</li>
            <li> IF I got a few more uses out of it!</li>
            <li> It is way too strong for me, which makes me only use it in hair and time &amp;#34;emergencies.&amp;#34; I wish it could be in scented or much lighter scent</li>
            <li> B008D5HAHU Batiste Dry Shampoo Original Clean &amp; Classic</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may be appropriate for women but it not a dry shampoo for men due to the strong womanely perfume smell that pervades your presence for hours after applying this chemical stench.</li>
            <li> ( I could go 3 days no problem with my lower back length, fine but lots of it, hair)</li>
            <li> This stuff is way better than the tres semme dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> the smell is amazing and the little amount that i did get out did work...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if I skip a wash day, usually my hair gets extraordinarily oily very quickly, with the awesome odor of unwashed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, as compared to other brands such as Bastiste.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really sticky, so it acted much like hairspray in matting my hair together and making it very untouchable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to run out fast.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the spray because it doesn&#x27;t get all over my hands and clothes and doesn&#x27;t look like I have baby powder in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair gets very oily within 24 hours of washing</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> It made my hair really staticky, and I had to use ALOT of it to see the oil in my hair subside.</li>
            <li> And, from what I noticed, there wasn&#x27;t much product in the can to begin with.</li>
            <li> However, your hair must be light in color, because it is white and does leave a residue.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well:  absorbs oil, adds texture, doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a powdery residue (or gunk like Tresemme).  </li>
            <li> not too much product though.</li>
            <li> really, really like this product, so</li>
            <li> if you do that it really works.  </li>
            <li> so I really need this sometimes</li>
            <li> The powder doesn&#x27;t brush out, and even after two real washes I can still feel the residue.</li>
            <li> i use as directed and it really does wash away all of the grease build up in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have really oily hair</li>
            <li> have a scent but fades really fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> that I end up getting really itchy by the end of the day and need to shower just to get everything out of my hair.</li>
            <li> It really works well.  </li>
            <li> It really helps my hair feel refreshed and cuts the shine and greasy feeling if I have not had time to wash it.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to anyone who has my hair type!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have quite as much oil absorbing power</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t even really run my hands trough it.</li>
            <li> It takes as much time as washing your hair....</li>
            <li> I get oily hair rather fast.</li>
            <li> My hair retains its volume and the shampoo efficiently keeps my hair not-oily for up to two days (with a light reapplication on the second day).</li>
            <li> Really works like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> All at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really do anything to help me skip a wash -</li>
            <li> spray too much</li>
            <li> but this is really something.</li>
            <li> nothing really happened even after spraying quite a lot and fluffing up my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it wors.</li>
            <li> Thanks Dove!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a floral sent which is very pleasing.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> I use this because my hair is very oily in the morning if I haven&#x27;t had a chance to shower yet.  </li>
            <li> than that, it does what you want it to do - my hair looked perfectly clean for a whole extra day (which is really saying something because my hair is a greaseball within 24 hours of washing it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that have worked better than this</li>
            <li> and I can get so much more sleep without having to worry about what to do with my wet mop every day!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other  products and this one sprays on well</li>
            <li> overwhelming smell I really do not care for!</li>
            <li> So far, the best budget dry shampoo I have found is Psssst, but it can be hard to find in drug stores sometimes.</li>
            <li> It appears clean at a glance but does have any movement and feels gross.</li>
            <li> just wash it with water and regular shampoo if you want clean hair.</li>
            <li> While dry shampoos never give you that freshly washed feel, this one is different in that it does have a decent scent unlike so many others.</li>
            <li> I do love trying new products though, so this will go in my mental \\&quot;yes\\&quot; list of approved products</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING, and the only dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> this smells fresh, i didnt notice any leaking at all.works amazing, and it doesnt make my hairs STARK white like the tresemme one did.</li>
            <li> The product itself works OK -- it removes oil but makes my dark brown hair look gray and mousy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to put to much heat on my ends during my normal work week, so when I blow out my hair</li>
            <li> Well... it does smell nice but not sure how &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; my hair feels.</li>
            <li> The Dove Dry Shampoo works pretty well for me as my hair gets oily fairly quickly after a wash.</li>
            <li> Its slightly floral but sort of fresh and clean smelling...</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t particularly offensive, but it was... everpresent.</li>
            <li> It absorbs the oils in my hair quickly, and I do not have the white powder residue.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a very strong, very long lasting perfume-y smell.</li>
            <li> And HOURS later, I could still smell nothing but the spray (which had a not terribly unpleasant powdery scent).</li>
            <li> Right after you spray it on, really rub your scalp so it&#x27;s not white.</li>
            <li> The small is great and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film of dry flakey powder on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of dry shampoo when I am not able to wash my heair, and am quite happy with the results</li>
            <li> I have tried drug store and high end.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just pull up on the nozzle a little and put it up to your ear and make sure you don&#x27;t hear air.</li>
            <li> I tried this one day when my hair looked like it needed a little help--hoping to give it more volume and make it look cleaner.  </li>
            <li> They said by just putting it on with their hands &amp; then combing their hair, it made their hair soft and clean without flakes or white powder.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this stuff unless you want to smell like that 80 year old grandma in the elevator wearing so much perfume it makes your eyes</li>
            <li> It is nice to have on hand on busy or lazy days</li>
            <li> it has a fresh scent without the white residue.</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The powder doesn&#x27;t show up as white like most dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling gross like many dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different drugstore dry shampoos and this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> Does not leave your hair with a white residue that most dry shampoos leave.  </li>
            <li> (For what it&#x27;s worth, I have fine, dark blonde hair.)  </li>
            <li> It is more liquid and less powder based like other dry shampoos and seems to do nothing but add oil and a very strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight down the hair and it makes it easy to re-style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s available at Target and lotsa other places.</li>
            <li> Smells decent, albeit a little strong for my taste.  </li>
            <li> It also did give my hair a little extra volume, which was nice.</li>
            <li> My daughter borrowed my new can for her vacation ...  </li>
            <li> Compared to other dry shampoos I think Dove&#x27;s smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> I am glad to have this product for times when I am running late and don&#x27;t have time to do the whole beauty routine.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to use between washes like everyone else, but then realized it works amazingly on my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Works like any other dry shampoo good for touch ups in the middle of the week if you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair seems exactly the same as it was before I put it on-- I can see and feel no difference.</li>
            <li> The first bottle started out full, but after just one use, when I went to use it a second time, it was completely empty.  </li>
            <li> I only got any powder out the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, it seemed to work relatively well; it took out a bit of the oil</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this one for the price by far!  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the ingredient list was a joke, but I checked the Dove corporate site and it is not a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they could come up with different scents, I&#x27;d be willing to try it, otherwise I am going to have to try another brand.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient is isobutane, and the second is propane.</li>
            <li> I found that it works better then the Pantene brand dry shampoo and the Tresame brand dry shampoo, which are comparable in price.</li>
            <li> Instead of just getting rid of the greasiness in my long, fine, oil-prone, blonde hair, it gives me a ton of volume.</li>
            <li> lol it was still pretty bad...</li>
            <li> Also, as previously mentioned, it does smell very strongly of cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind a subtle smell on hair products but this one is pretty strong floral scent.</li>
            <li> When I was finally able to spray more - it leaves your scalp feeling cold and barely absorbs any oil.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot more $$ on dry shampoo before and nothing compares to this one.</li>
            <li> used dry shampoo quite a bit back in the early 70&#x27;s and am glad to have finally found it again.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I did not have any problems with the nozzle getting clogged, but it still didn&#x27;t last for very many uses before it was empty.</li>
            <li> can emptying quickly like other reviewers seemed to have...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible my hair is much too oily for this</li>
            <li> and it may work well for people with regular hair trying to extend a style rather than someone with a real oil problem.</li>
            <li> I only get about 2-3 VERY FRUGAL uses from a bottle.</li>
            <li> Works well, no grimy residue, but offers no volume or boost.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind this personally, because as I mentioned before my hair is very thin/wispy and tends to be all over the place.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money....  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of something I used to spray in my old college dorm room.</li>
            <li> I have straight dirty-blonde hair, and it has grown about three inches above my waist.</li>
            <li> Okay, the negative reviews here are for the can, not the product.</li>
            <li> and you look like an old lady....</li>
            <li> So I got up a bit early</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use much or your hair turns white even when you brush it in.</li>
            <li> i am not that sensitive to smells, and i can smell this all day wafting around my head.</li>
            <li> I had to throw this away after only a few uses; the perfume smell was overwhelming and it did not absorb oil well at all.</li>
            <li> It is more expensive but so worth the price.</li>
            <li> the first day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used every dry shampoo out there (many company&#x27;s just started making it, a few years ago you needed to go to a specialty store and there was only two brands)</li>
            <li> Luckily I was only going to a dog class, but this was pretty much a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if 5oz really goes that quickly or if it just leaked out somehow.</li>
            <li> So dry shampoo is something I use pretty frequently.</li>
            <li> The first one I tried was the Tresemme dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> It has a light powdery scent similar to their other hair care products.  </li>
            <li> Some days it is just too hot to blow dry...</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel TOTALLY clean as it would with regular shampoo, though that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true that it can leave a white residue, but only if you can&#x27;t follow simple directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Dove DS made my hair feel soft with no real stiff or too-thick feeling.</li>
            <li> I recommend only using this once in between washing, I have found that the morning after I use this my hair is typically pretty gross.</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it too light.</li>
            <li> I have found that a few quick bursts of dry shampoo work better than just holding the nozzle down and spraying all over.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works as well was the expensive salon ones &amp; smells great.</li>
            <li> It is scented, but not as heavily as the other dry shampoo I tried, which is good.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work on my hair, I have long brown hair that can get oily after a day of not washing.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of dry shampoos and they all have a certain smell to them.  </li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo every day, but the kind I like (nexxus) is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I still wash my hair every other day and sometimes I would use this stuff on the 3rd day especially if I don&#x27;t have to be anywhere important.</li>
            <li> I actually picked this up at Walmart but figured I&#x27;d write a review since I&#x27;m looking for a new brand on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep trying new brands as they come along, but this one is a winner, especially at this</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t see it working really well as a dry shampoo...</li>
            <li> I despise the smell of this brand of dry shampoo, and I found it very sticky.</li>
            <li> My hair gets really oily by day2/3 and takes over a hour between rollers and blow dry.</li>
            <li> so if you put too much on you definitely have to spend some time and drizzle some water on your hairbrush to get the white powdery look out.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure there may have been something people were doing wrong when they say it only lasts 1-2 uses, but sure enough, mine is completely empty after just 1.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not strong, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dry or &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; like some dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li> I should of read other reviews first.  </li>
            <li> After not washing my hair for a couple days, it gets oily and greasy (gross but natural) and this dry shampoo really helps.</li>
            <li> Not too powdery, the white spray was easily absorbed, unlike other sprays.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on reviews that said it was better than other similar brands, with less of an offensive smell.  </li>
            <li> Such a time saver for my busy schedule</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s about the same as Sauve, so far.  </li>
            <li> This particular one tends to leave my hair so dry throughout the day (instead of just removing grease)</li>
            <li> I do &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34; frequently, so  I&#x27;ve tried a number of different brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m middle aged and have been using dry shampoo on my fine hair since middle school.  </li>
            <li> I am really surprised Dove would carry a product such as this</li>
            <li> I also LOVE the way it adds tons of volume to my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not better than others.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo, it removes the extra oil from your hair, it gives you extra voulum and if you have a little grow out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time,  can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> If I would have to say one negative thing about this dry shampoo is the fragrance, if you are sensitive to strong scents, this may be a turn off.</li>
            <li> I normally use salon products but decided to give this dry shampoo a whirl.  </li>
            <li> So much in fact that I stopped using my other volumizing products bc</li>
            <li> I am always very cautious about stong smells when I am at work or around other people</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of these other reviews &amp; I think that some might not be using the product correctly; using too much product &amp; not rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands that  cost twice as much.  </li>
            <li> The smell a little overwhelming but overall a typical dryshampoo, hey it did</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other dry shampoos that make my hair look and feel like it had been freshly washed.</li>
            <li> I am new to the wonders of dry shampoo</li>
            <li> This is the third dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used and my least favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only slightly hazy, compared to the many other dry shampoos I have tried.  </li>
            <li> This was the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried and it did some pretty serious damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I have use so many of these products on my thick, curly hair but only this spray doesn&#x27;t leave my hair super heavy with clay or too dried out.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least a half dozen dry shampoos and this is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an overpowering, sickeningly sweet, saccharine, chemical aroma that makes me feel like my head has been doused in every scent at Bath &amp; Body Works combined with a dose of that horrible smell that hits you when you walk into Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, topped off with a cheap, overwhelming taxi air &amp;#34;freshener&amp;#34; that makes your eyes water and forces you to roll down the window even if it&#x27;s raining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands, but they have ultimately made my hair feel gunky and have been REALLY over-scented.  </li>
            <li> So, I stopped washing my hair every day and only did it every other day or every two days which I really find to be gross</li>
            <li> I wish they would find a way to make it clear like some of the pricer salon dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> To be clear this is not about the dry shampoo</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my hair definitely doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it would if I were to wash it</li>
            <li> And it really doesn&#x27;t even work to make my hair look less oily.  </li>
            <li> It smells clean and does not leave a heavy white powder like other brands do.</li>
            <li> tried Tresemme&#x27;s Dry Shampoo first, but their dry shampoo left my hair too dry and with visible white residue, no matter how often I tried brushing my hair</li>
            <li> If you have fine or thin hair I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of dry shampoos before, and I really don&#x27;t like this one.</li>
            <li> I really like the Dove Dry Shampoo compared to other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> While it wasn&#x27;t as bad as tresseme (made me more oily instead of absorbing oil) or suave (breakout city and migraine inducing scent)</li>
            <li> It provides volume (which is what my straight hair needs) but not so much thats its crazy - still very touchable hair.</li>
            <li> Sprays on clear and leaves my hair looking wet and greasy.</li>
            <li> well, I always have trouble spraying at the appropriate distance, so maybe that&#x27;s why my head ended up seeming very dry feeling and stiff.  </li>
            <li> Most drugstore brands leave my hair just feeling stiff &amp; thick with product.</li>
            <li> Not good on my pocket book or the environment to go through a bottle that quickly.</li>
            <li> Have been using klorane dry shampoo for awhile and loved it but decided to give Dove a try since it was much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Batiste dry shampoo over the other brands.  </li>
            <li> Surprised at some other reviews re:</li>
            <li> this Dove shampoo works well to add back some bulk and take away that flat look</li>
            <li> As such I try to go for as long as I can between washes, brushing the oil from my roots to my ends daily.</li>
            <li> It starts to look a little dull though after a few days, and loses some shine... but generally, it looks great.</li>
            <li> but I had to go back to the only dry shampoo that has ever worked for me: Batiste.</li>
            <li> Rate for 4 star as it do helps my hairstyle recover in a short time while I am staying at bed for a long time.</li>
            <li> Yes, it doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a white powdery look so long as you either blend it in with your fingers or brush/comb it in.  </li>
            <li> I want my hair long as possible, so I have read that you should minimize the amount of times you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t leave it on long enough to decide if it works or not.</li>
            <li> Usually I wash me hair every other day to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> I normally have to wash my hair everyday until I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Towards the bottom of the bottle, for some reason, the color was WHITE-- and when sprayed on my (dark) hair, left a visible white splotch somewhat reminiscent of bird poo.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue, but it also doesn&#x27;t last for very long</li>
            <li> The bottle did not last very long.</li>
            <li> So I have tried three different dry shampoo products now.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> especially for a dry shampoo like this one that i don&#x27;t always have to wash it every time.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product if someone is looking for an inexpensive dry shampoo to use.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo helps me extend the time in between washings even further without looking greasy and compromising that &amp;#34;just washed&amp;#34; hair look.</li>
            <li> And it makes my hair SOOO dry when I go to wash it next.  </li>
            <li> I use a little when I first dry my hair and add some in the mornings when I don&#x27;t shower for a volume boost and a little extra texture.</li>
            <li> It also has a very strong scent that I found unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I am a little sensitive to smells, but not excessively sensitive and the smell of this</li>
            <li> I usually do not like to use dry shampoos because I like to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> It almost makes my hair feel more dirty than it was before.</li>
            <li> As in, I spray my hair, then leave the bathroom to let the room clear out for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> like to go a few days without washing, so as not to strip the scalp of natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Well, it took a LOOONG time for it to be shipped at my house and it only partially works.</li>
            <li> next time I pick it up the can is completely empty and unsprayable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how long your hair is - you just want to spray the roots.</li>
            <li> Why have long hair?</li>
            <li> the formula is very lightweight, and I don&#x27;t notice any thick powder on my scalp even if I use a lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You see this complaint a lot with dry shampoos and thats just how it is, but this one seems to run out much faster.</li>
            <li> My hair was really getting dry from washing it at least once a day</li>
            <li> Also left a slight white residue on my hair.  </li>
            <li> smell is not overbearing compared to hair spray, if its to much try opening a window!&lt;br /&gt;Reduce the amount of white, the instructions due say shake well, and hold at least 8inches away and rub in.</li>
            <li> Some dry shampoos don&#x27;t soak up oil at all, which I find strange...</li>
            <li> I have tried two other brands prior to this one.  </li>
            <li> Bought this at my local drug store,and what a helper it is to prolong time between washes due to oiliness.</li>
            <li> It does take the oil out of your hair but makes you look 10 years older because of the dull gray/white color it turns your hair.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other dry shampoos, this one actually makes ur hair smell like u just got out of the shower!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to leave as much white residue on my hair either as some of the other dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li> The Dove brand goes on light, re-fluffs weighed down hair and leaves minimal to no residue behind.  </li>
            <li> I have light dirty blonde roots and it makes my hair look gray.</li>
            <li> I have some Oscar Blandi Pronto Dry Shampoo powder and this Dove Invigorating Dry Shampoo spray.  </li>
            <li> I like using this dry shampoo</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a dry shampoo to add texture, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a $20 bottle of dry shampoo and then this one.</li>
            <li> After trying Tresme&#x27;s dry shampoo I thought that dry shampoo was a joke.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any body in need of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo saved my hair and my sanity.  </li>
            <li> I had never tried dry shampoo before</li>
            <li> NOT what I want from a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading about dry shampoo and decided to give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> so I thought that I would give dry shampoo a try.  </li>
            <li> With dry shampoo, I always spray rub then brush</li>
            <li> In the &amp;#34;olden days&amp;#34;, there was Pssssst, a dry shampoo for touch ups between hair washings.  </li>
            <li> , I picked up Dove Invigorating Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I began my time with dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have let my friends use this dry shampoo</li>
            <li> Anyway, I like dry shampoos that keep my hair in place (kinda like hairsprays).</li>
            <li> However, if you are like me and you want your hair to stay in one place, I suggest the Suave dry shampoo (not the keratin one).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s self as this is my go-to dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo on days I just don&#x27;t feel like shampooing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to blow dry and straighten it a bit, so it is time-consuming.</li>
            <li> I decided to try dry shampoo and</li>
            <li> So I decided to give dry shampoo a try.</li>
            <li> Problem is, my hair has gotten so long, my roots are oily while the ends are still very dry.</li>
            <li> However it could not keep long time, say half day is enough.</li>
            <li> like it because I have dark brown hair, and this doesn&#x27;t leave a ton of white powder showing afterwards</li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t want to sport a librarian bun constantly, that&#x27;s no fun.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair that is very long (past my waist), so washing daily isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every third day and this help keep my hairline less greasy.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, it takes a while to &amp;#34;rub in&amp;#34; and leaves white splotches on my hair (I have black hair)</li>
            <li> It is truly dry and does not make my hair wet.</li>
            <li> so I only wash my hair once a week or less.</li>
            <li> I recently used this brand for the first time and did not like it at all: the smell is overpowering, the spray is super-charged, making even application difficult, and the \\&quot;powder\\&quot; seems sticky.  </li>
            <li> My hair typically looks greasy by the next day if I don&#x27;t wash it, but with this, I can go 3-4 days without washing my hair and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I always use a dry shampoo from garnier, but when my last bottle ended I couldn&#x27;t find it anywere, so I make a Little of search at the web</li>
            <li> This is never going to be as good as washing your hair, so it will still look oily, just not as bad!</li>
            <li> My hair type is thin, straight and tends to be dry</li>
            <li> It does remove some oil and makes your hair fluff up a bit, but it also makes it feel very dry and straw-like.</li>
            <li> and my hair moves a little bit differently.</li>
            <li> I am blonde that went a little blonder</li>
            <li> And the smel stuck around for a real long time too!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of dry shampoo</li>
            <li> Not powdery like some of the other dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Still has that sticky feeling and gray film that other dry shampoos have.  </li>
            <li> With thin straight hair a slight bout of perspiration makes that type of hair fall flat.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite weapons for when I&#x27;m in a hurry or just a bad hair day.  </li>
            <li> even though it is bad at absorbing oil, it makes the hair very tangly somehow.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work well at all and left crazy white dandruff in my hair no matter how much I tried to brush it out.</li>
            <li> but it can be carefully distributed.</li>
            <li> read about this in an article and since it was only a few dollars I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> so I bought a few different brands to try.  </li>
            <li> I bought a few bottles last Fall for just under $4 each.</li>
            <li> One day after washing my roots become oily and my hair becomes heavy and gross.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair feel like straw, sticky and rough.</li>
            <li> It comes out like an aerosol powder, but it&#x27;s sort of wet and sticky.  </li>
            <li> Might look strange on dark hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and naturally oily.</li>
            <li> The only small downside is that it changes my hair texture ever so slightly and as a result it is a little more difficult to run my fingers through</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding, I&#x27;ve tried almost every average and low priced dry shampoo on the market (plus a few over priced ones).</li>
            <li> Others I&#x27;ve tried are to floral or smell like spilled cheap perfume and often leave me feeling sick or with a headache after a short time</li>
            <li> Plus it makes your hair stiff and makes your hair white-</li>
            <li> This stuff is gross and makes my hair feel stiff and doesn&#x27;t make it feel cleaner at all.  </li>
            <li> but I gave it a one star because every other can runs empty after using it 1-3 times.</li>
            <li> I started with more expensive brands based on reviews but always was trying to find something cheaper due to ridiculously overpriced products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who up until now washed their hair daily simply because I hate the way it looks at the roots on the second day; a bit oily and very lack-luster.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other one again.</li>
            <li> One one hand, this does seem to work, but one the other....</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve brushed the oil through my hair, I&#x27;ll spray the roots with a few spritzes of this, and bam!</li>
            <li> Nozzle doesn&#x27;t clog like other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> if it kills my head with the smell, what can it do to other people.</li>
            <li> This is a serious rip-off and is available in other stores for way less.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> All the other drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried have been lemon scented &amp; I end up feeling like I&#x27;ve just sprayed Lemon Pledge on my hair.</li>
            <li> The other two that I&#x27;ve used are both salon grade</li>
            <li> As for me, I have extremely oily hair.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t happenned me with other brands.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure why some people are only getting 1-2 uses.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had that trouble with other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> but I use it almost everyday and have very long hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried dry shampoo once before in my life, and found it to be messy and ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I sprayed a few times, left it for a few days --</li>
            <li> It was also difficult to get rid of the white appearance of my roots completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to save precious time in my life by cutting down on hair prep!!!</li>
            <li> It almost feels  stiff and dry.</li>
            <li> it was hard to rub it in enough to mask all the powder.</li>
            <li> This is the only can of 4 that didn&#x27;t get clogged or stuck or stop working ins some way ( usually after just a few uses).  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is quite aerosol-y.</li>
            <li> They make it for dark and lighter hues and it can be used all over your body.</li>
            <li> my only complaint</li>
            <li> Does not &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; my dark hair.</li>
            <li> it reminds me of an old Victorias&#x27;s Secret scent</li>
            <li> Batiste is the hands down winner.</li>
            <li> My hair also felt so gunky, there would be no way to wear my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I swear I went through one of these in a week and  a half, using it once/day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make it look any less greasy</li>
            <li> 6.73 fl oz \\&quot;New\\&quot;]]This one is half the price, but does not work as well at hiding greasiness.  </li>
            <li> I have black hair</li>
            <li> However $12 is a ridiculous price as this same bottle is sold at a drug store (Walgreens) for $5.</li>
            <li> Part of the reason I want to be washing it less is to keep it healthier...</li>
            <li> Leaves my dark hair a little hazy colored, otherwise I would have rated it 5.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a can mess up on me</li>
            <li> this, I can wash my bleached hair a little less often.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little stiffer, as I need my volume to stay throughout the day.</li>
            <li> He gets a little funky looking from rolling around in the yard</li>
            <li> and it lasts a little over a month.</li>
            <li> And I let it sit for about 2-5 mins and then brush my hair a little.</li>
            <li> Dove isn&#x27;t terrible, but Batiste is the only dry shampoo worth buying.</li>
            <li> Sprays on cold and fast.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to build up on the scalp after a few uses...</li>
            <li> It also makes your hair feel really rough, but at least it doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li> dried it in seconds.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday...</li>
            <li> The product works well to decrease the oil in my hair without it leaving it heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Then you let is sit &amp; &#x27;work&#x27; for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> so I bought this one to save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> just a waste of $5 plus whatever shipping was.</li>
            <li> The others I tried all leave a heavy powder residue on my brush.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try dry shampoo having heard that washing hair too often is not good for the hair and thins it out and dries it out over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, the scent is not as terrible as many other brands.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair stiff at the roots</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my head itchy and it isn&#x27;t too sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several budget dry shampoos over the years, and this is the absolute worst of the bunch.</li>
            <li> bad* exactly,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too bad because i actually think it works great, but the smell is so awful that i can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> You want to spray a very little amount into the roots of your hair, sections at a time.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really helps with the greasy look, and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad</li>
            <li> Works well for the price, the smell reminds me of bathroom spray, can&#x27;t get past that.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my extra oily hair feeling weird or greasy.</li>
            <li> Usually under $3.  </li>
            <li> This works as well, if not better, than the Bumble and Bumble</li>
            <li> I  just can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> So I usually go 2-3 days between washing my hair.</li>
            <li> it costs no more than 5 dollars in the store</li>
            <li> My opinion...don&#x27;t be lazy...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t buy this product and I am not sure why anyone would?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might vary from hair type to hair type but being from a mixed background and having difficult to manage hair</li>
            <li> breathe a few times, then go back in - which was quite inconvenient.</li>
            <li> When you find yourself with bangs or the hair along the sides of your face, a little oily looking, this will give you a few hours of reprieve, enough to get you thru your day if your hair isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> But I hate the feeling of having heavy hair the 2nd day, and this product only made it worse.</li>
            <li> I bought it a while ago and used it a few times at first and hated it.</li>
            <li> If you spray it on it makes your hair look dull and has a gray/white tint to it that you can not brush out no matter how hard you try.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly stand it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is notty and hard to brush.  </li>
            <li> but I try and stretch it out at least 2 days between washing.  </li>
            <li> I have at least 20 times.</li>
            <li> for late</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this, because she has thick hair</li>
            <li> but if you had brown hair I am not sure if this product would work for you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obviously in the wrong line of work if this kinda racketeering is acceptable!</li>
            <li> I can only imagine how weird it would look on someone with brown hair!  </li>
            <li> RIDICULOUS.</li>
            <li> when i use this dry shampoo, it makes absolutly nothing in my hair, it continuous looking dirty and greasy.</li>
            <li> but i felt like it made my hair just smell weird not clean.</li>
            <li> but my experience is not good.  </li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that it takes a lot of rubbing....and rubbing and messing with hair is never good, it breaks it and makes it weaker.</li>
            <li> I know that it is not good to wash your hair so often</li>
            <li> I sprayed in it, followed the instructions, and when it dried, it felt worse than it had before I used this!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to wash my hair every day, as I know it&#x27;s not good for it.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Works well, though leaves hair feeling a bit brittle, but I&#x27;ve tried much worse.</li>
            <li> I have oily, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that this product was very heavily scented, and I have a health condition with which I need to avoid heavily perfumed items.</li>
            <li> I hate having to wash my hair every day, so I thought I&#x27;d try some dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> were saying they don&#x27;t wash their hair everyday because it is bad for your hair.</li>
            <li> So sad they took it away.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Amazon will not allow me to return this item because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;flammable aerosol&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but when you try to brush it through its difficult to brush.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> and it releases all the air which makes it unable to spray.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for the inconsistent usage.</li>
            <li> The smell of this dry shampoo spray is TERRIBLE!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible in my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> and i was afraid it would be gone forever.</li>
            <li> but with this product the results are always disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> My hair still looks greasy and feels dirty.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck at work with dirty hair that smells like a Hallmark store during an after-Christmas sale.</li>
            <li> like I just went crazy with perfume on my head.</li>
            <li> The scent is so overpowering and makes me sneeze like crazy.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a crazy price to pay for the convenience of being shipped to your house.</li>
            <li> BUT DO NOT ORDER WITH EXPENSIVE SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> I can use it on days 2 and 3 after shampooing, and it&#x27;s impossible to tell that my hair hasn&#x27;t been</li>
            <li> Gives me horrible, horrible headaches that last all day.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair matt up bad during the night.</li>
            <li> so my grow out isnt that bad</li>
            <li> And it did not go away, so it was like I was wearing bad perfume all day.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> , really disappointed in the company.</li>
            <li> I HATE the smell, though.  </li>
            <li> I cannot fully express how much I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> Blech.</li>
            <li> I hate having to wash my hair twice/day</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in Dove this time</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! :</li>
            <li> It has an awful smell that give me a headache.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d put up with that, but the smell is so awful and overpowering that I just can&#x27;t tolerate it.  </li>
            <li> Just terrible.... 1 spritz</li>
            <li> but it SMELLED terrible.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!</li>
            <li> It was awful!  </li>
            <li> Felt greasy and lank, and looked awful.  </li>
            <li> I cannot get beyond the awful smell.  </li>
            <li> horrible smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This dry shampoo smells wonderful and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because I have dark brown hair, and this doesn&#x27;t leave a ton of white powder showing afterwards (it leaves more of a matte finish).&lt;br /&gt;It also does a great job absorbing oiliness. I have recieved compliments for how great my hair looks after using this (with days of not washing).&lt;br /&gt;I like to go a few days without washing, so as not to strip the scalp of natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;This product allows me to do that, while keeping a clean look with added texture.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best I&#x27;ve discovered so far. I do love trying new products though, so this will go in my mental \\&quot;yes\\&quot; list of approved products lol.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell and works wonder to fix up your hair when you are out of time in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I have tried several budget dry shampoos over the years, and this is the absolute worst of the bunch. It does NOTHING to absorb oil. My hair seems exactly the same as it was before I put it on-- I can see and feel no difference. I&#x27;m not even sure any of the powder is coming out-- for all I know, it could just be air. So far, the best budget dry shampoo I have found is Psssst, but it can be hard to find in drug stores sometimes.</li>
            <li> ordered suave and dove the suave is better but this one is also good six more words are required enough said</li>
            <li> Great smell!! Works well, though leaves hair feeling a bit brittle, but I&#x27;ve tried much worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m forever on the hunt for a good dry shampoo that&#x27;s cheaper than batiste. This doesn&#x27;t cut it.. While it wasn&#x27;t as bad as tresseme (made me more oily instead of absorbing oil) or suave (breakout city and migraine inducing scent) lol it was still pretty bad... It didn&#x27;t work well at all and left crazy white dandruff in my hair no matter how much I tried to brush it out. It&#x27;s possible my hair is much too oily for this and it may work well for people with regular hair trying to extend a style rather than someone with a real oil problem. As for the scent yea it was strong but I liked it. Oh another thing, even though it is bad at absorbing oil, it makes the hair very tangly somehow.</li>
            <li> I love how well this product works and smells...except for the fact I only get about 2-3 VERY FRUGAL uses from a bottle. Hopefully Dove can fix this issue soon to make it awesome! Otherwise I&#x27;m going back to Tresemme.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not strong, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dry or &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; like some dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it takes the oil out of my hair, especially when I use hair spray. It almost makes my hair feel more dirty than it was before.</li>
            <li> This product just does not work well for me. I bought it a while ago and used it a few times at first and hated it. My new birth control is causing my hair to become more greasy more quickly ( I could go 3 days no problem with my lower back length, fine but lots of it, hair) I have to almost wash it every day, which I won&#x27;t so I figured to give this another shot, but I still can&#x27;t say I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it does help soak up some grease but I can&#x27;t stand how it makes my hair feel. It almost feels  stiff and dry. I have light dirty blonde roots and it makes my hair look gray. I honestly think it smells too strong... It helps a tad but I have to wash my hair that night or else it makes my hair matt up bad during the night.</li>
            <li> This is the only can of 4 that didn&#x27;t get clogged or stuck or stop working ins some way ( usually after just a few uses).  The smell is wonderful, it does cast off a white powder but it can be carefully distributed. Works for me. I can now go 2-3 days without wash even with sweaty cardio workouts! Not overly priced. I&#x27;ve been stocking up on this:) BUT DO NOT ORDER WITH EXPENSIVE SHIPPING! It&#x27;s available at Target and lotsa other places.</li>
            <li> So I have tried three different dry shampoo products now. Batiste is the hands down winner. This was better than the Oscar Blandi product - which did absolutely nothing - but not as good as the Batiste. This absorbs some but adds too much weight without getting the full dryness that you get from Batiste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still better than the Oscar Blandi product and much cheaper than the Batiste so if you have particularly fine hair this might be worthwhile for you.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many different dry shampoos throughout the years and this one is by far my favorite!!!!!!! I will never use any other one again. Unlike other dry shampoos, this one actually makes ur hair smell like u just got out of the shower!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t fade quickly.</li>
            <li> Works well, no grimy residue, but offers no volume or boost. Hair feels more flat after usage, but does feel noticably cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite dry shampoo. I&#x27;ve always favored Suave dry shampoos (Suave has several different kinds, I love them all), but I&#x27;m not mad if I have to use this one if Suave isn&#x27;t available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It gives your hair great volume. I often use dry shampoos for volume alone, and this is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;It REALLY works on oily hair. Some dry shampoos don&#x27;t soak up oil at all, which I find strange...this one is good if you are going 2+days between washes.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to build up on the scalp after a few uses...the formula is very lightweight, and I don&#x27;t notice any thick powder on my scalp even if I use a lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very strong...it reminds me of an old Victorias&#x27;s Secret scent but I can&#x27;t remember what its called. Its slightly floral but sort of fresh and clean smelling...anyway, its a strong scent. I put this as a con since I think someone sitting close to you could smell it.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to run out fast. You see this complaint a lot with dry shampoos and thats just how it is, but this one seems to run out much faster. I swear I went through one of these in a week and  a half, using it once/day. The price kind of makes up for it, but its still a con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, Suave wins because it give my hair more volume, has fresher scents, and seems to always last longer. Give this product a try to see for yourself, though.</li>
            <li> I have some Oscar Blandi Pronto Dry Shampoo powder and this Dove Invigorating Dry Shampoo spray.  I much prefer the spray because it doesn&#x27;t get all over my hands and clothes and doesn&#x27;t look like I have baby powder in my hair. Plus I can just spray it on evenly and then brush my hair without even getting any on my hands. I don&#x27;t use it all that often, but when I do it does make my hair feel cleaner. It smells pretty good and actually works, plus the bottle lasts quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used dry shampoo quite a bit back in the early 70&#x27;s and am glad to have finally found it again.</li>
            <li> Good price, nice smell. Cannot get hold of it in my country so more satisfied.</li>
            <li> It was fantastic for making my hair look cleaner and fuller. But the scent was so strong I had to shampoo an hour later. Defeated the purpose.</li>
            <li> Works well for the price, the smell reminds me of bathroom spray, can&#x27;t get past that.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Gives my hair the right amount of refreshing needed after a couple days of not washing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews even though I read them all the time before buying but I had to quite one for this awesome dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about this in an article and since it was only a few dollars I decided to try it.  I am so pleased with it!  My hair gets very oily within 24 hours of washing but I try and stretch it out at least 2 days between washing.  I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos but this one is the best by far.  When I put it on I look like I have freshly washed and styled hair all day, I can even go 3 days if I do choose.  My favorite thing is that it doesn&#x27;t stink like the others I&#x27;ve tried.  It has a fresh scent that smells clean and isn&#x27;t overpowering.  Others I&#x27;ve tried are to floral or smell like spilled cheap perfume and often leave me feeling sick or with a headache after a short time but I find have this problem with the dove.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with the can not working and it has lasted about a month.  My only problem is that they are sold out and I know I&#x27;m getting low!  Next time I&#x27;ll order two so I won&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my extra oily hair feeling weird or greasy. Perfect for day two hair for those with oily hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that have worked better than this but it does smell great. I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Rate for 4 star as it do helps my hairstyle recover in a short time while I am staying at bed for a long time. However it could not keep long time, say half day is enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give this a 2.5, but it&#x27;s closer to a 3 than a 2 so here we are. I actually picked this up at Walmart but figured I&#x27;d write a review since I&#x27;m looking for a new brand on Amazon. This product didn&#x27;t do much for me. The scent is super nice and that&#x27;s about the only positive thing for me. It made my hair really staticky, and I had to use ALOT of it to see the oil in my hair subside. And, from what I noticed, there wasn&#x27;t much product in the can to begin with. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have almost black hair, when used correctly this is one of the best dry shampoos for the money. With long hair it isn&#x27;t healthy to wash everyday so this is perfect for the in between days.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and lasts long too but i don&#x27;t see it working really well as a dry shampoo... My hair looked just same as before I sprayed this product.</li>
            <li> This product works well to get that grease shine off your hair. However, your hair must be light in color, because it is white and does leave a residue. Also, as previously mentioned, it does smell very strongly of cheap perfume. It also makes your hair feel really rough, but at least it doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well:  absorbs oil, adds texture, doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a powdery residue (or gunk like Tresemme).  I HATE the smell, though.  If you like Gardenia, it won&#x27;t bother you, but I can&#x27;t stand it.  And it is STRONG!  I&#x27;m going to try the Suave instead.</li>
            <li> Smells great! not too much product though. but great for a quick hair freshener.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Dove Refresh+Care Invigorating Dry Shampoo... I&#x27;ve tried several other brands, but they have ultimately made my hair feel gunky and have been REALLY over-scented.  The Dove Dry Shampoo is light, and smells very pleasant, and it has worked wonders on my hair.  I can use it on days 2 and 3 after shampooing, and it&#x27;s impossible to tell that my hair hasn&#x27;t been re-washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have currently poured $10 into two bottles of this that were rendered unusable after a use or two.  The first bottle started out full, but after just one use, when I went to use it a second time, it was completely empty.  Emailed Dove, they responded quickly and promised a complimentary coupon.  In the meantime, we were going out of town, so I went ahead and purchased another bottle.  This one, I was able to use twice, but then the spray nozzle completely quit working.  I rinsed it in hot water, took it apart, and could not fix it.  So- into the trash it went.  Very disappointed! :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really, really like this product, so I&#x27;m hoping that Dove makes some improvements to the packaging...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED TO ADD:  Yay!  Dove listened!  They have updated the spray nozzle, and it works fabulously!</li>
            <li> This smelled great and worked wonders but i only got two uses out of it. I am not sure if 5oz really goes that quickly or if it just leaked out somehow. It is a shame, i really liked this product but if that is all i can get out of a bottle then i will not buy it again. Not good on my pocket book or the environment to go through a bottle that quickly.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to use between washes like everyone else, but then realized it works amazingly on my fine, thin hair. It actually gives me volume! So much in fact that I stopped using my other volumizing products bc this one just takes the cake. Love it. I get it on a monthly basis. The only negative is that it is quite aerosol-y.</li>
            <li> Unless you want to pay $18 a bottle, this is the best dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.  Ie tried several other drug store brands, but this is the best...  Usually under $3.  Great deal!</li>
            <li> After 2 uses, I was going to give this product only 1 star, but I&#x27;ve finally learned how to use it correctly.  The trick for fine hair is to NOT massage the product in after spraying it.  For me, this INCREASED the look of grease.  Instead, gently separate the strands a bit after applying the product (you kind of just use your finger tips to puff up your hair).  It smells very nice too.&lt;br /&gt;*You do have to adjust your expectations of course.  This is never going to be as good as washing your hair, so it will still look oily, just not as bad!</li>
            <li> I like using this dry shampoo it works well for me.  I like the smell, not having to wash my hair every day, and how it works.</li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo every day, but the kind I like (nexxus) is pretty expensive. So I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It&#x27;s terrible in my dark brown hair. It doesn&#x27;t make it look any less greasy</li>
            <li> This is a great light-weight dry shampoo. It provides volume (which is what my straight hair needs) but not so much thats its crazy - still very touchable hair. I wish it was a little stiffer, as I need my volume to stay throughout the day. But I did find that after using this, I was able to &amp;#34;re-fluff&amp;#34; my hair as the day went by, getting that &amp;#34;first spray&amp;#34; texture back. But the one drawback is the smell -- its very strong as you first spray it. As in, I spray my hair, then leave the bathroom to let the room clear out for a few minutes. Kinda makes ya choke! But then the smell dissipates and it isn&#x27;t in your hair at all. Phew! I&#x27;d definitely buy again. Can&#x27;t beat the price for the products Pro&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> But the smell is so gross. It has an awful smell that give me a headache. Please make this product smell free!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my hair definitely doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it would if I were to wash it but I guess I should expect that... but my hair definitely doesn&#x27;t look like I haven&#x27;t washed it in three days! For $4 to be able to spend 10 minutes total showering and doing my hair 4 to 5 days a week this girl is happy! Such a time saver for my busy schedule and I can get so much more sleep without having to worry about what to do with my wet mop every day!</li>
            <li> it really is smelly, but in a good way, which i love. i used the tresemme but i felt like it made my hair just smell weird not clean. this smells fresh, i didnt notice any leaking at all.works amazing, and it doesnt make my hairs STARK white like the tresemme one did. it works way better</li>
            <li> I have been trying different brands of &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34; and I am very happy with the DOVE brand.  I don&#x27;t think i have seen it in stores, so thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I like it better than John Frieda but it&#x27;s about the same as Sauve, so far.  If you can afford it, Oribe is the best!</li>
            <li> If you have fine or thin hair I would not recommend this product. It is more liquid and less powder based like other dry shampoos and seems to do nothing but add oil and a very strong perfume smell. I did not find the smell pleasant at all but that&#x27;s personal preference. You are better off using a hair perfume than this product. If you are looking for a dry shampoo to add texture, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> my favorite at a good price!</li>
            <li> I use this the night before and it works pretty well. It&#x27;s super easy to use, think hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just use it at the roots at the top of my forehead where I get really oily. It is very possible to use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this, I can wash my bleached hair a little less often.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for those moments just before you&#x27;re going to shampoo, but don&#x27;t have the time.  When you find yourself with bangs or the hair along the sides of your face, a little oily looking, this will give you a few hours of reprieve, enough to get you thru your day if your hair isn&#x27;t too bad.  I&#x27;ve found it very helpful mostly on using on my white dog.  He gets a little funky looking from rolling around in the yard and I use this on him and he smells good and looks good.  I have the product for dogs and it&#x27;s basically the same ingredients (just don&#x27;t get it in their eyes).</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on reviews that said it was better than other similar brands, with less of an offensive smell.  The smell wasn&#x27;t particularly offensive, but it was... everpresent. And the aeresol smell was pervasive. After just a spray or two, I found myself inhaling nothing else, and to finish applying it, I literally had to take a deep breath, step into the bathroom and spray for a couple of seconds, then step out, breathe a few times, then go back in - which was quite inconvenient. And HOURS later, I could still smell nothing but the spray (which had a not terribly unpleasant powdery scent). I didn&#x27;t want others being able to smell it, and I also wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the texture of my hair afterward. My stylist has since recommended a shake-in powder that she loves (I can&#x27;t remember the brand), and I&#x27;ll give that a try in an effort to avoid the cloud of spray again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time,  can&#x27;t live without it. Keeps my hair looking fresh in between the washes.  Smells good also.</li>
            <li> I like that this product doesnt leave alot of residue.  I have tried many other  products and this one sprays on well and you are supposed to rub it in and then brush it out...if you do that it really works.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day so I really need this sometimes and I love it!</li>
            <li> Works great. Can&#x27;t take the smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different dry shampoos. When I first used this product, I was impressed at how well it worked for the price. As an added bonus, the scent is not as terrible as many other brands. However, I feel like I need to use quite a bit of this product for it to work, so that it only lasts for 2-4 applications. I also felt that it stopped working as well after consistent use for 3-4 weeks. Time to try out another product on my hunt for the best, affordable dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> Product is very good but the strong scent makes it unusable. The scent is cheap and very strong - it stays for hours in your hear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried dry shampoo once before in my life, and found it to be messy and ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;But this stuff is awesome. It WORKS, it&#x27;s easy to apply, it DOESN&#x27;T easily turn your hair white (although I&#x27;m blonde, so I don&#x27;t know about darker hair), and it smells nice to boot! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this is a game-changer for me. Goodbye, daily shampoos and blowdrying (ugh, talk about hair damage). Great product.</li>
            <li> Ignore all the good reviews and get over to the Batiste Amazon page. Buy it. Never look back. I&#x27;m not kidding, I&#x27;ve tried almost every average and low priced dry shampoo on the market (plus a few over priced ones). Dove isn&#x27;t terrible, but Batiste is the only dry shampoo worth buying. If Batiste is sold out I guess this could make an ok back up, but baby powder might honestly be a better choice. I&#x27;ve had so many conversations with people about how they can&#x27;t believe they waited so long to buy Batiste. Don&#x27;t be one of those people.</li>
            <li> One one hand, this does seem to work, but one the other....well, I always have trouble spraying at the appropriate distance, so maybe that&#x27;s why my head ended up seeming very dry feeling and stiff.  it smells wonderful, and does make my hair seem less greasy, but I don&#x27;t think hair spray types are my thing....</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do..Better than talcum powder to absorb excess oil if that is your problem. My girl uses it and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and this is the one I go back too. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t last that long but I use it almost everyday and have very long hair (it&#x27;s blonde which might make a difference - cant say if it would show up in brown or not). Personally I wash my hair twice a week. Even on the days I wash my hair I use this stuff to prevent it from getting greasy in the first place and give my hair volume. Then I use it before I go to bed and don&#x27;t bother with brushing it out or anything. My tossing and turning in the night does the trick and I wake up with clues looking and smelling hair.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is really nice for the price. I found that it works better then the Pantene brand dry shampoo and the Tresame brand dry shampoo, which are comparable in price. I use this on the roots of my hair before styling on days that I don&#x27;t wash my hair. I&#x27;ve also tried applying it at night before bed and find that it absorbs oil better and my hair is easier to style in the morning.  If you&#x27;ve never tried a dry shampoo before, this is a great one to get started with.</li>
            <li> It smells clean and does not leave a heavy white powder like other brands do. I have tried drug store and high end. This by far is my favorite. I wash my hair every third day and this help keep my hairline less greasy. My husband can&#x27;t stand strong smells and he complimented my hair for smelling &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> If you have oily hair, this is a no-brainer. However, dry/coarse-haired ladies, listen up! I have extremely dry hair. As such I try to go for as long as I can between washes, brushing the oil from my roots to my ends daily. This helps tremendously with my overall hair health, and helps to keep my ends from becoming the texture of a boar bristle brush. Once I&#x27;ve brushed the oil through my hair, I&#x27;ll spray the roots with a few spritzes of this, and bam! Perfect hair: moisturized, but without greasy roots. I can now go happily for 4-5 days without a shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it has a lovely, light, scent.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re at all sensitive to strong scents, avoid this like the plague...it&#x27;s amazingly overpowering.  Maybe if it were available in an unscented version I could give it a better rating.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and do not like strong smelling products, stay far away from this product. The finishing is not that great either leaving you with rough hair.</li>
            <li> I despise the smell of this brand of dry shampoo, and I found it very sticky. The powder doesn&#x27;t brush out, and even after two real washes I can still feel the residue.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite dry shampoo. It takes the oils from your hair and gives volume. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this, because she has thick hair that&#x27;s always tangled - fewer &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shampoos&lt;br /&gt;First time using this product</li>
            <li> Terrible.  If you spray it on it makes your hair look dull and has a gray/white tint to it that you can not brush out no matter how hard you try.  It does take the oil out of your hair but makes you look 10 years older because of the dull gray/white color it turns your hair.  there is no shine at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and she said that it works well.  She has to style her hair everyday, so this is a nice break, when you need one!</li>
            <li> I only got any powder out the first time I used it. The rest of the time, it just blew stinky air onto my head. It smells like formaldehyde.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of dry shampoos and they all have a certain smell to them.  They also leave my hair feeling super sticky or like I&#x27;ve sprayed loads of hairspray in my hair.  Dove has a really nice smell without being overbearing.  It&#x27;s great for after the gym or just for those mornings where you don&#x27;t have enough time to wash and dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this stuff unless you want to smell like that 80 year old grandma in the elevator wearing so much perfume it makes your eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be appropriate for women but it not a dry shampoo for men due to the strong womanely perfume smell that pervades your presence for hours after applying this chemical stench.</li>
            <li> It smells so so so good . the only problem i had was after putting it on my hair kinda felt gritty</li>
            <li> i am so glad that i purchased this product. i use as directed and it really does wash away all of the grease build up in your hair. especially for a dry shampoo like this one that i don&#x27;t always have to wash it every time. all i have to do is spray this onto my hair and restyle it the way i want it and then i can just go about my day knowing that it is clean. plus the smell of it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am new to the wonders of dry shampoo so I bought a few different brands to try.  I highly recommend the Batiste dry shampoo over the other brands.  [[ASIN:B008D5HAHU Batiste Dry Shampoo Original Clean &amp; Classic 6.73 fl oz \\&quot;New\\&quot;]]This one is half the price, but does not work as well at hiding greasiness.  Plus it makes your hair stiff and makes your hair white- it was hard to rub it in enough to mask all the powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a $20 bottle of dry shampoo and then this one. The dove hands down was the best first for price and because it does the job. I normally have to wash my hair everyday until I started using this product. Now I can go up to 3 days. It doesn&#x27;t leave a white powdery look so long as you either blend it in with your fingers or brush/comb it in.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a heavy smell too it, more of a light powder scent. And who can beat the price.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best dry shampoo I have ever used. My hair gets oily quickly. I&#x27;m talking if I shower in the morning and have to go out at night, my hair needs to be washed before heading out. So dry shampoo is something I use pretty frequently. The dove works the best. The powder doesn&#x27;t show up as white like most dry shampoos. And the scent is almost non-existent, what you smell reminds me more of deodorant than baby powder. And it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling gross like many dry shampoos. It doesn&#x27;t weight down the hair and it makes it easy to re-style.</li>
            <li> Gives me horrible, horrible headaches that last all day. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why I was getting them. I figured out that every time I used this I got them!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I have use so many of these products on my thick, curly hair but only this spray doesn&#x27;t leave my hair super heavy with clay or too dried out. If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive spray, I would recommend this but if you&#x27;re looking for a product to truly refresh your hair and that is all natural I would recommend Cake Beauty Satin Sugar Refreshing Hair &amp; Body Powder. They make it for dark and lighter hues and it can be used all over your body. It&#x27;s around $15 but mine container has lasted about a year now. It&#x27;s all natural, smells great and works so well. I only wash my hair every 3-5 days, I will ocassionally use these two products together.</li>
            <li> I could not ask for more in a dry shampoo.  Good house keeping was right.  It works perfectly and was a great price when amazon carried it on subscribe and save.  So sad they took it away.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes my hair look like i just washed and blow dried it in seconds. I have blond wavy/fine hair and after 1 day i look greasy, i can go almost 3 days of not washing my hair and look like i just washed and styled it every time i use this. My BF uses it too and he has dark hair and it works just as good. It lasts all day without looking greasy. I just bought 3 more bottles at wallmart cause amazon was out and i was afraid it would be gone forever.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use between normal shampoing. Gets rid of the over shiny-ness, but still leaves a sheen to your lock. My favorite part about this product is the amount of volume and life my hair gets after using it. If I would have to say one negative thing about this dry shampoo is the fragrance, if you are sensitive to strong scents, this may be a turn off. But overall I would definately recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I have really oily hair and this works well for the day after washing. Not a miracle but gets me through if I don&#x27;t want to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to check the sprayer and make sure you do not hear any noise. This ensures that product is still not coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does have a scent but fades really fast.</li>
            <li> I hate having to wash my hair every day, so I thought I&#x27;d try some dry shampoo.  But I hate the feeling of having heavy hair the 2nd day, and this product only made it worse.</li>
            <li> This product is a great price, and works like magic.  It helps my hair make it 2-3 days between washing &amp; blow drying my hair.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> this was recommended by a friend. After trying Tresme&#x27;s dry shampoo I thought that dry shampoo was a joke. But Dove&#x27;s dry shampoo smells great and hides the grease. I would recommend this to any body in need of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This works as well, if not better, than the Bumble and Bumble I was paying thirty dollars more for... Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of dry shampoos before, and I really don&#x27;t like this one. This particular one tends to leave my hair so dry throughout the day (instead of just removing grease) that I end up getting really itchy by the end of the day and need to shower just to get everything out of my hair. Aside from that, it takes a while to &amp;#34;rub in&amp;#34; and leaves white splotches on my hair (I have black hair) if I don&#x27;t spend a good amount of force rubbing it into my scalp. I liked the Tresemee and Suave dry shampoos a lot more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who up until now washed their hair daily simply because I hate the way it looks at the roots on the second day; a bit oily and very lack-luster. The first time I used this, it seemed to work relatively well; it took out a bit of the oil but I was still self-conscious. Since then it hasn&#x27;t seemed to work well at all; my hair still seems oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that it can leave a white residue, but only if you can&#x27;t follow simple directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to give this some more time and I&#x27;ll update if something changes, but as of right now it doesn&#x27;t seem to do very much.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo.  I spray my hair at night before I go to bed and comb it through.  When I get up in the morning, I have beautiful, fluffy, great smelling hair.  It really works well.  I started using it when I broke my foot and could not put weight on the foot for a year.  This dry shampoo saved my hair and my sanity.  I had never tried dry shampoo before but I use it all the time now.  I have tried other brands of dry shampoo but Dove works the best.  I really love this stuff and Amazon sells it at a great price!!!</li>
            <li> Who thought of this product? Its absolutely AMAZING.... Great in between washes when you cannot make it to the hairdresser, or a long night out in a smokey environment and trying to get the smell out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for hair extensions also</li>
            <li> I was expecting more...... but it helps  when you don&#x27;t have time. The hair is much better with the product, but not as whashed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Dove Dry Shampoo. Before this I used another brand and it did not work at all, so I fell in love with this product as soon as I used it. It really helps my hair feel refreshed and cuts the shine and greasy feeling if I have not had time to wash it. Smells great as well. I recommend only using this once in between washing, I have found that the morning after I use this my hair is typically pretty gross. I would definitely recommend this product if someone is looking for an inexpensive dry shampoo to use.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that this product was very heavily scented, and I have a health condition with which I need to avoid heavily perfumed items. It did the job it was designed to do but I ended up giving it to a neighbor because of the smell!</li>
            <li> This stuff REEKS. It doesn&#x27;t smell *bad* exactly, but it&#x27;s a very strong, very long lasting perfume-y smell. I used it once and then could smell it all day and even the next morning. NOT what I want from a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have greasy hair and on day 2 my roots need a little help in a can to not look so greasy, this stuff is great, does exactly what it says it will and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind a subtle smell on hair products but this one is pretty strong floral scent.Gave me a headache after awhile. But it did the job!</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have tried. I have spent a lot more $$ on dry shampoo before and nothing compares to this one. Would def buy this again.</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself works great. I  just can&#x27;t get past the smell. It&#x27;s very older lady perfumy. Wish Dove could fix that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading about dry shampoo and decided to give this one a try.  However, upon spraying the shampoo on my hair it left a white layer of film on my hair.  It almost looked like hair coloring spray.  After some brushing it eventually disappeared, but I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have used a TIGI brand that I really love but I think I love Dove more. I use it everyday...sometimes multiple times a day. It is truly dry and does not make my hair wet. I have really fine hair and this product gives me some texture to work with. I sometimes go four to five days without washing my hair. I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this is.</li>
            <li> overwhelming smell I really do not care for!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work on my hair, I have long brown hair that can get oily after a day of not washing.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo out there</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend and I gave it a try and I am so glad I did. I like the smell of it, and for the price it is just fantastic! If you follow the directions and shake well and massage it in this product works great. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend over and over. This is now a staple in my house!</li>
            <li> Nozzle doesn&#x27;t clog like other products I have tried.  Smells decent, albeit a little strong for my taste.  Leaves my dark hair a little hazy colored, otherwise I would have rated it 5.  It&#x27;s only slightly hazy, compared to the many other dry shampoos I have tried.  I wish they would find a way to make it clear like some of the pricer salon dry shampoos.  Can&#x27;t beat this one for the price by far!  Way better than suave or tresemme!!</li>
            <li> The product was not helpful and did not appear to remove any oil but instead added to the oil and appeared flaky.</li>
            <li> i love this it helps on those days where i dont wash my hair! soaks up all the oil and leaves my hair fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different drugstore dry shampoos and this is my favorite one. It&#x27;s often not in stock at CVS or Walgreens so I was happy to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite because the smell is light and fresh and it leaves little residue if used in moderation. I have black hair so if you put too much on you definitely have to spend some time and drizzle some water on your hairbrush to get the white powdery look out. Of course, it&#x27;s great at absorbing oil and keeping your hair fresh between washes.</li>
            <li> My hair was really getting dry from washing it at least once a day so I thought that I would give dry shampoo a try.  I love Dove products and thought that this was a reasonable price so why not give it a try!  I found the fragrance to be overpowering to the point that it was making me feel ill/giving me a headache.  I was sure to shake the can before application but the powdery portion of the spray comes out in intermittent blasts.  It does this each time I use the product no matter the angle at which I am spraying...the nozzle is not clogged so I can&#x27;t figure it out.  With dry shampoo, I always spray rub then brush but with this product the results are always disappointing.  Because of the intermittent blasts of powder, I have to use more product and the end result is that my hair feels filmy and doesn&#x27;t look refreshed and I reeks of fragrance.  Batiste dry shampoo is a good alternative to this product.</li>
            <li> Good product to have around.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and it doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue, but it also doesn&#x27;t last for very long</li>
            <li> Does the job in a pinch but has a VERY strong cheap perfume smell.  My boyfriend thought I was spraying Fabreze onto my head.  Also left a slight white residue on my hair.  Very inexpensive but I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This does a C-grade job.  It may help to minimize hair greasiness a bit, but I can&#x27;t stand the smell. Overly sweet, like potpourri, and somewhat chemically.  Not a fan.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works great. It has a nice sweet scent that is soft and not to overwhelming. It doesn&#x27;t have a baby powder smell which I like. The product works well to decrease the oil in my hair without it leaving it heavy. The powder absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave white powder streaks in my hair. I use the product moderately 2-3 a week and it lasts a little over a month.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is definitely the best brand I have used thus far. My hair type is thin, straight and tends to be dry so I only wash my hair once a week or less. This dry shampoo helps me extend the time in between washings even further without looking greasy and compromising that &amp;#34;just washed&amp;#34; hair look. I also LOVE the way it adds tons of volume to my thin hair. The only small downside is that it changes my hair texture ever so slightly and as a result it is a little more difficult to run my fingers through and my hair moves a little bit differently. I don&#x27;t mind this personally, because as I mentioned before my hair is very thin/wispy and tends to be all over the place. The application is easy and the spray doesn&#x27;t leave a powdery look to your hair. I really enjoy the scent and my partner does as well, it&#x27;s clean, light and not overwhelming. All in all this product does wonders for my hair and I highly recommend it to anyone who has my hair type!</li>
            <li> In the &amp;#34;olden days&amp;#34;, there was Pssssst, a dry shampoo for touch ups between hair washings.  This is one of the better ones on the market. Avoid Suave brand.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo for drugstore price. Works really good and smells fresh. Right after you spray it on, really rub your scalp so it&#x27;s not white. It&#x27;s always out at walmart so when I find it, I buy extra.</li>
            <li> The smell of this dry shampoo spray is TERRIBLE!!  Does NOT work.  Do not waste your money....  Very disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> I am not a girly girl most of the time but I have been watching too many Youtube videos and a lot of women were saying they don&#x27;t wash their hair everyday because it is bad for your hair. So, I stopped washing my hair every day and only did it every other day or every two days which I really find to be gross BUT, it works. My hair is in much better condition because I don&#x27;t wash all the natural oils away. After not washing my hair for a couple days, it gets oily and greasy (gross but natural) and this dry shampoo really helps. I can go an extra day without washing and my hair looks clean and amazing even though I haven&#x27;t washed it. Plus this stuff smells amazing and I love Dove products. Dry shampoo is super easy to use. I just lift up sections of my hair and spray the roots, I do this in all over my head and I let it sit for a couple seconds, then use my fingers to move it around almost like I am washing my hair. And I let it sit for about 2-5 mins and then brush my hair a little. It works great.</li>
            <li> Well, it took a LOOONG time for it to be shipped at my house and it only partially works. The smell a little overwhelming but overall a typical dryshampoo, hey it did it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have quite as much oil absorbing power as many others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now. My hair feels so greasy and gross by the end of the day. I&#x27;ve used other dry shampoos that make my hair look and feel like it had been freshly washed. So not the case here I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> it really smells GOOD.</li>
            <li> I like this product but I feel like I am spraying air freshener on my hair.  It smells SO gross!  Smell is an individual thing so you may love it but my experience is not good.  My nose doesn&#x27;t agree with it at all.  Reminds me of something I used to spray in my old college dorm room.</li>
            <li> Have bought this product several times for daughter who uses it all the time. Problem is the price is more than doubled and will need to go elsewhere to buy now. What is going on!!! Get price back inline with competition.</li>
            <li> I bought it for those rare occasion when I don&#x27;t want to wake up and shower. My hair still looks greasy and feels dirty.</li>
            <li> Very effective for a good price</li>
            <li> Loved the light scent, some can be overwhelming, but this one is great!</li>
            <li> This has been the best working and smelling dry shampoo I have tried, leaves hair light and smelling great. Thank you Dove.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo, it removes the extra oil from your hair, it gives you extra voulum and if you have a little grow out it will cover that grow out. I am blonde that went a little blonder so my grow out isnt that bad but if you had brown hair I am not sure if this product would work for you!</li>
            <li> Not greasy, works pretty well.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel TOTALLY clean as it would with regular shampoo, though that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> The product itself works OK -- it removes oil but makes my dark brown hair look gray and mousy.  I&#x27;d put up with that, but the smell is so awful and overpowering that I just can&#x27;t tolerate it.  It&#x27;s really overwhelming when you first spray it and it doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> great stocking stuffer</li>
            <li> It DOES take the oil out of my hair and make it look clean again but for whatever reason it also makes my hair feel like straw when it was soft before. Once I put this stuff in my hair I can&#x27;t run my fingers through it anymore. Will be buying &amp;#34;Suave&amp;#34; next to save $$ and see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li> This product tends to leave my hair feeling like there is something on it. It makes my hair stiff at the roots and I can&#x27;t even really run my hands trough it. It appears clean at a glance but does have any movement and feels gross. But it&#x27;s still better than others I&#x27;ve tried. I have found loreal and tigi to be the best</li>
            <li> I have found that a few quick bursts of dry shampoo work better than just holding the nozzle down and spraying all over.  The scent is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Amazon will not allow me to return this item because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;flammable aerosol&amp;#34; product. I cannot fully express how much I hate the smell. It&#x27;s an overpowering, sickeningly sweet, saccharine, chemical aroma that makes me feel like my head has been doused in every scent at Bath &amp; Body Works combined with a dose of that horrible smell that hits you when you walk into Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, topped off with a cheap, overwhelming taxi air &amp;#34;freshener&amp;#34; that makes your eyes water and forces you to roll down the window even if it&#x27;s raining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it didn&#x27;t make any noticeable difference to my hair, which I didn&#x27;t wash this morning before work just so I could try out this product. Now I&#x27;m stuck at work with dirty hair that smells like a Hallmark store during an after-Christmas sale.</li>
            <li> This was the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried and it did some pretty serious damage to my hair. I&#x27;ve tried the Suave brand since and like it a lot better. (A friend said her stylist recommended it). It could be just my fine hair that didn&#x27;t mix well with this formula. Otherwise it worked just how it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> Having fine, oily hair I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoos, even the pricey ones. This one works much better than the expensive ones (and comes in a much bigger size!) my only complaint and it&#x27;s a big one, is the scent. It is way too strong for me, which makes me only use it in hair and time &amp;#34;emergencies.&amp;#34; I wish it could be in scented or much lighter scent and I would use it a lot more. Surprised at some other reviews re: the bottle. I&#x27;ve had mine for 6months (with light use) and it still works great. Follow the instructions on the can.</li>
            <li> Just terrible.... 1 spritz and I was nearly knocked out senseless by the strong chemical odor. When I was finally able to spray more - it leaves your scalp feeling cold and barely absorbs any oil. I could not use any more than 2-3, 1 second sprays as the fumes and smell were too overbearing and unfortunately, stayed with me all day. My favorite is Batiste - lightly fragranced and works really well on the oil in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, very nice, brown wavy hair. I don&#x27;t like to put to much heat on my ends during my normal work week, so when I blow out my hair I have to make it last. I have used many different brands of dry shampoo and this by far is the best one! My absolute favorite! The small is great and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film of dry flakey powder on your scalp. It gave my hair some volume in the top front, where I have the most oil, from touching my hair so much. It really is a great dry shampoo, and I got it at a great price! LOVE LOVE LOVE, defiantly worth trying ladies :)</li>
            <li> The product is great, however only got to use it once. I sprayed a few times, left it for a few days -- next time I pick it up the can is completely empty and unsprayable. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Usually I wash me hair every other day to keep it fresh. I decided to try dry shampoo having heard that washing hair too often is not good for the hair and thins it out and dries it out over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this stuff works but it does at times leave white residue and you have to brush it out. It takes as much time as washing your hair....so don&#x27;t try this if you are trying to cut time off of your morning routine. What I don&#x27;t like is that it takes a lot of rubbing....and rubbing and messing with hair is never good, it breaks it and makes it weaker. It does make my hair look semi fresh and not oily so that I am able to just tie it up in a bun or something. The smell can be a bit strong....I would never wear my hair out with this stuff.....if it kills my head with the smell, what can it do to other people. I am always very cautious about stong smells when I am at work or around other people (I only wish others were the same way!!!!!). Anyway, it takes 2-3 hours for the smell to sort of dissipate. I will be trying something else when this bottle is done. I still wash my hair every other day and sometimes I would use this stuff on the 3rd day especially if I don&#x27;t have to be anywhere important.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo - works great in my blonde hair. BUT: it&#x27;s currently selling for over $11 and is way overpriced. I bought a few bottles last Fall for just under $4 each. This is a serious rip-off and is available in other stores for way less.</li>
            <li> I have bleached blonde hair. I get oily hair rather fast. A little bit goes a long way! No white residue and makes my hair have lovely volume!!! Smells amazing and such a good price. Not to mention afterwards my hair is super soft</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product- works well without the high intensity smell I have experienced with other products</li>
            <li> It works. Fair for the good price, but does not compare to more expensive options.</li>
            <li> I had to throw this away after only a few uses; the perfume smell was overwhelming and it did not absorb oil well at all. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I started with more expensive brands based on reviews but always was trying to find something cheaper due to ridiculously overpriced products. This one works really good comparing to other cheap brands. Smell is good, size is good , it does not leave too much residue but absorbs grease good enough. I would recommend it but probably will buy in Wal-Mart next time where it is even cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great for gray hair and powdered wigs.  I suppose I&#x27;d get a similar effect by rubbing corn starch and flour on my head.</li>
            <li> I have brightly colored hair (violet &amp; blue) using semi-permanent dye, so I was looking space apart my hair-washing days. Unfortunately, if I skip a wash day, usually my hair gets extraordinarily oily very quickly, with the awesome odor of unwashed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Tresemme&#x27;s Dry Shampoo first, but their dry shampoo left my hair too dry and with visible white residue, no matter how often I tried brushing my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I picked up Dove Invigorating Dry Shampoo.  Conclusion? Fantastic. It&#x27;s refreshing; I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the dispenser getting stuck or running out of product quickly; and it leaves no visible white residue after rubbing it into my scalp and brushing out, per the directions.  My hair retains its volume and the shampoo efficiently keeps my hair not-oily for up to two days (with a light reapplication on the second day). It smells fantastic, too! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Really works like it is supposed to. Does not &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; my dark hair. Does give it a good lift. With thin straight hair a slight bout of perspiration makes that type of hair fall flat. This product helps revitalize the look. All at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> After a 45 min. blowout, I don&#x27;t want to wash &amp; repeat every morning. So I usually go 2-3 days between washing my hair. I love dry shampoo and I&#x27;m on a never ending quest to find the best product at the best PRICE.  I&#x27;ve tried the $30 salon brands &amp; the $3 drugstore brands and many, many in between. I tried the Dove this morning on my 3-days ago washed hair and I am really pleased with the product. Most drugstore brands leave my hair just feeling stiff &amp; thick with product. The Dove DS made my hair feel soft with no real stiff or too-thick feeling. I really like the smell, but I guess everyone has their own opinion on that. It&#x27;s a baby powder / ivory soap smell. All the other drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried have been lemon scented &amp; I end up feeling like I&#x27;ve just sprayed Lemon Pledge on my hair. I&#x27;ll keep trying new brands as they come along, but this one is a winner, especially at this price!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of these other reviews &amp; I think that some might not be using the product correctly; using too much product &amp; not rubbing it in. You want to spray a very little amount into the roots of your hair, sections at a time. Then you let is sit &amp; &#x27;work&#x27; for a few minutes. Then you rub it in with your fingers, like a scalp massage. This step is critial -- brushing alone won&#x27;t get most of the white out. Then you brush the rest through. I&#x27;ve used the can I have at least 20 times. It doesn&#x27;t matter how long your hair is - you just want to spray the roots. You can always ask the stylist to show you next time you go to the salon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for this at all, made my hair feel dirtier. It smells nice but when you try to brush it through its difficult to brush. Haven&#x27;t had that trouble with other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> Sprays on cold and fast.  No visible powder. Oil just disappears.  One of my favorite weapons for when I&#x27;m in a hurry or just a bad hair day.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.  The Suave one is pretty good too, and is $1.00 cheaper.  Both are much better than the Tresemme&#x27; brand.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair that is very long (past my waist), so washing daily isn&#x27;t an option. I wash about once a week to keep my hair healthy but the downside is I have greasy roots. One day after washing my roots become oily and my hair becomes heavy and gross. A spritz of this and it had more volume then the first day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used every dry shampoo out there (many company&#x27;s just started making it, a few years ago you needed to go to a specialty store and there was only two brands) and this smells the best. A bottle lasts me about a week using it daily. I spray my roots and section it to get it all, then spritz the ends. After massaging it in I let it sit for about five minutes to soak in and then I brush it. This stuff is AMAZING, and the only dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and effective.  Not powdery like some of the other dry shampoos.  I do &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34; frequently, so  I&#x27;ve tried a number of different brands.  They pretty much all do the job, but this is one of the ones that works best for me.  I intend to use it regularly.</li>
            <li> This is the third dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used and my least favorite. The other two that I&#x27;ve used are both salon grade so I bought this one to save a few dollars. Although this one worked as well as the others, the smell was overpowering. Although I do want my hair to smell fresh between washes, I don&#x27;t want my head to smell like I just went crazy with perfume on my head. Won&#x27;t buy again but if you aren&#x27;t sensitive to smells it is fine.</li>
            <li> I have oily, thin hair. This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used.  I have used other brands that  cost twice as much.  It gives me extra volume as well as getting me through an extra day without having to wash it.</li>
            <li> Good smell, texture and great softness</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really do anything to help me skip a wash - so its not something I would recommend or suggest</li>
            <li> The &#x27;perfume&#x27; is light and fresh - so you don&#x27;t feel like your hair announces, &#x27;I didn&#x27;t get washed today.&#x27;  My daughter borrowed my new can for her vacation ...  I never got it back.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing a lot of mixed reviews on this product, but for me it is amazing. I guess it depends on everyone&#x27;s preferences/ hair types. As for me, I have extremely oily hair. If I wash my hair at 6AM, then it will appear greasy by about 10PM that same day. I have straight dirty-blonde hair, and it has grown about three inches above my waist. I want my hair long as possible, so I have read that you should minimize the amount of times you wash your hair. Thus, I began my time with dry shampoos. The first one I tried was the Tresemme dry shampoo. That product was fine for removing the oil, and it even added some volume to my hair but it SMELLED terrible. It also made my hair have like a sticky feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;Then I picked up the Dove dry shampoo on a whim and fell in love! It removed my oil, it gave me volume, and it smells very pretty. It also doesn&#x27;t leave the sticky feeling in my hair. I have let my friends use this dry shampoo and it has become their favorite as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a care package I was putting together for my wife because we were about to have our first child and I wanted to take care of her too. Everyone kept complimenting her after labor. She loves this product and smells great. Perfect for saving time on days you are busy with baby and just don&#x27;t have the time to wash and blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I usually do not like to use dry shampoos because I like to wash my hair everyday. I know that it is not good to wash your hair so often but I feel really gross if I don&#x27;t.  Anyway, I like dry shampoos that keep my hair in place (kinda like hairsprays). This shampoo is what it says it is...lightweight.....but I figure if I want to skip a day of washing my hair, I don&#x27;t want it flying all over my face. If you like your hair to feel natural and light, this one is for you (it also smells great). However, if you are like me and you want your hair to stay in one place, I suggest the Suave dry shampoo (not the keratin one). It&#x27;s cheap and works great.</li>
            <li> This was pretty good.  I have used this type of dry shampoo when I am not able to wash my heair, and am quite happy with the results</li>
            <li> Great product for those moments when you&#x27;re in a jiffy and need a quick touch-up. Make sure to shake the product well before spraying as it does leave a residual white powdery substance but once you massage it into your hair, it disappears!</li>
            <li> This shampoo was a gift for a family member.  They said by just putting it on with their hands &amp; then combing their hair, it made their hair soft and clean without flakes or white powder.</li>
            <li> I love using it - I use a little when I first dry my hair and add some in the mornings when I don&#x27;t shower for a volume boost and a little extra texture.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different dry shampoos to find the one that works best for me and Dove is at the top of my list. It smells great and I don&#x27;t have to use a ton to make my hair look and feel better. It works way better than the higher priced salon versions.</li>
            <li> The scent is so overpowering and makes me sneeze like crazy. It also makes my hair feel like straw, sticky and rough. Towards the bottom of the bottle, for some reason, the color was WHITE-- and when sprayed on my (dark) hair, left a visible white splotch somewhat reminiscent of bird poo. AWFUL! Stick to Batiste.</li>
            <li> This works great to freshen up your hair inbetween washes. Smells okay too.</li>
            <li> Okay, the negative reviews here are for the can, not the product. This stuff WORKS! I have horrid hair that looks greasy within hours of washing, so keep this with me in my purse all the time. I have never had a can mess up on me but when I use it I make sure that I don&#x27;t hear any air being released from the can before replacing the cap. The reason it goes \\&quot;empty\\&quot; for people is because the nozzle gets stuck and it releases all the air which makes it unable to spray. Just pull up on the nozzle a little and put it up to your ear and make sure you don&#x27;t hear air. That easy! I use this even on days that I wash because it gives you really great volume and makes your hair feel thicker. Don&#x27;t be turned off by the white powder, just spray all over (flip your hair in sections and spray your roots), pat your head and brush.. I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m middle aged and have been using dry shampoo on my fine hair since middle school.  I recently used this brand for the first time and did not like it at all: the smell is overpowering, the spray is super-charged, making even application difficult, and the \\&quot;powder\\&quot; seems sticky.  I had to wash it out.</li>
            <li> To be clear this is not about the dry shampoo it&#x27;s self as this is my go-to dry shampoo. Use it every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it costs no more than 5 dollars in the store so why the hell is one 5oz can 20+ dollars on Amazon?? RIDICULOUS. I&#x27;m obviously in the wrong line of work if this kinda racketeering is acceptable!</li>
            <li> I have tried this product on a section of hair that needed washing.  It reacted like shiny clean hair and gave me hhhuuggee  beautiful curls not normal for my curly hair. I am glad to have this product for times when I am running late and don&#x27;t have time to do the whole beauty routine.  Nice effect on my hair.  I will buy more canisters!</li>
            <li> This stuff is gross and makes my hair feel stiff and doesn&#x27;t make it feel cleaner at all.  It comes out like an aerosol powder, but it&#x27;s sort of wet and sticky.  I gave it 2 chances and both times, I felt like I needed a shower just to clean this stuff out of my hair.  Blech. My opinion...don&#x27;t be lazy...just wash it with water and regular shampoo if you want clean hair.</li>
            <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;And i will bey form you net time&lt;br /&gt;and i will see what do you have by visit your store&lt;br /&gt;sorry for late</li>
            <li> The bottle did not last very long. Unlike other reviewers, I did not have any problems with the nozzle getting clogged, but it still didn&#x27;t last for very many uses before it was empty. It was also difficult to get rid of the white appearance of my roots completely. It takes quite a bit of rubbing and brushing to get rid of the &amp;#34;powered-wig&amp;#34; look. After it was rubbed in, it did get rid of all the oil and actually lasted for 2 days. I liked the scent, it was not too overpowering and smelled very clean. It also did give my hair a little extra volume, which was nice.</li>
            <li> this product needs to be your haircolor or something spray too much and you look like an old lady....</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair everyday. I bought this to keep in my cabinet just in case I needed to get some extra sleep one morning.  Well, I wanted to try it out to see how it worked.  So I got up a bit early (in case it didn&#x27;t work) and sprayed my roots and rubbed in and then brushed and brushed.  No matter how much I brushed the white would not go away....and you would not believe the static electricity!!! I was planning on pulling my hair back anyway, but even in a pony- my hair looked worse than it did before I sprayed...and I have light colored hair. I can only imagine how weird it would look on someone with brown hair!  My hair also felt so gunky, there would be no way to wear my hair down.  I ended up having to wash my hair anyway.  The reviews that state otherwise, have got to be written by people with ulterior motives. This stuff does not work.</li>
            <li> While dry shampoos never give you that freshly washed feel, this one is different in that it does have a decent scent unlike so many others.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t buy this product and I am not sure why anyone would? At first I thought the ingredient list was a joke, but I checked the Dove corporate site and it is not a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list could also double as a list of things you should NEVER put in your hair but it may be able to fuel your cooking stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isobutane, propane, and alcohol? I am really surprised Dove would carry a product such as this, really disappointed in the company.</li>
            <li> I ordered because of the price. This is an aerosol and whenever I use it I end up breathing a lot of it in. The rather gross synthetic smell lingers on your hair and body (it gets everywhere). However, 2 stars because it does work okay as a dry shampoo and is inexpensive. Just don&#x27;t use much or your hair turns white even when you brush it in.</li>
            <li> If you have any problem with strong smells, this product is NOT for you.  I couldn&#x27;t leave it on long enough to decide if it works or not. I am a little sensitive to smells, but not excessively sensitive and the smell of this was overpowering. Had to wash it out immediately.</li>
            <li> Really liked it after reading the reviews. Happy I bought it. Smells great. Not too powdery, the white spray was easily absorbed, unlike other sprays. Just don&#x27;t use too much and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo on days I just don&#x27;t feel like shampooing.  It makes my hair look and feel clean</li>
            <li> This is OKAY. It does remove some oil and makes your hair fluff up a bit, but it also makes it feel very dry and straw-like. My hair is super soft but after using this, I can&#x27;t run my fingers through it. It definitely makes your hair feel like there&#x27;s &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; in it and makes it somewhat unmanageable. I&#x27;ll continue looking for something better...</li>
            <li> My scalp is picky when it comes to dry shampoo, but this is THE BEST product on the market. I came from washing my hair every day to 3x a week (doing my part for California&#x27;s drought) and my hair looks and smells awesome. The spray gives my hair a blow-out texture that I adore. I highly recommend trying.</li>
            <li> This stuff is way better than the tres semme dry shampoo! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I used that for months and it works okay, but this is really something. Instead of just getting rid of the greasiness in my long, fine, oil-prone, blonde hair, it gives me a ton of volume. It goes on white and powdery, which might be a problem for those with dark hair, but for me, it&#x27;s the perfect product. Even after 3 days at a sweaty outdoor festival, my hair feels fresh!</li>
            <li> This product smells good.  Does not leave your hair with a white residue that most dry shampoos leave.  Absolutely the best product for the price.</li>
            <li> You want to skink like hair product and still have greasy hair? Buy this and you will get just that.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a white residue in you hair (if you apply it correctly). My boyfriend loves the smell and is very handy when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> such invigorating&lt;br /&gt;many oils?&lt;br /&gt;such spray!&lt;br /&gt;very flower scent&lt;br /&gt;yum&lt;br /&gt;such clean smell&lt;br /&gt;such powder in hair&lt;br /&gt;much soft&lt;br /&gt;wow</li>
            <li> I have tried two other brands prior to this one.  Dove has found the magic potion with this dry shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t make my head itchy and it isn&#x27;t too sticky or stiff.  It smells great too.</li>
            <li> I always use a dry shampoo from garnier, but when my last bottle ended I couldn&#x27;t find it anywere, so I make a Little of search at the web and i saw this Dove product and after Reading the reviews I ignored all the bads ones and decided to try it (after all it was a very fair price) The fact is tan when i use this dry shampoo, it makes absolutly nothing in my hair, it continuous looking dirty and greasy. That doesn&#x27;t happenned me with other brands. Used it a couple of time and threw it to the trash can. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have tried many dry shampoos and this one works as well as the rest, I have just have a problem with the scent.  It can be really strong if you have to use more than just a little bit of it.  I can still smell it much later in the day!  It smells so perfume-y I can hardly stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you can stand the scent, it DOES work well.  I have dark blonde hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it too light. It doesn&#x27;t take a ton of product to cover what greasiness I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they could come up with different scents, I&#x27;d be willing to try it, otherwise I am going to have to try another brand.</li>
            <li> I love this product but I gave it a one star because every other can runs empty after using it 1-3 times. Way too expensive for the inconsistent usage.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo will make your hair look cleaner, but with too many undesirable side effects.  (For what it&#x27;s worth, I have fine, dark blonde hair.)  It&#x27;s really sticky, so it acted much like hairspray in matting my hair together and making it very untouchable.  It also has a very strong scent that I found unpleasant.  And it did not go away, so it was like I was wearing bad perfume all day.  I gave it away after the first use; I&#x27;d rather wash my hair every day than deal with those drawbacks.</li>
            <li> I have hair that gets oily fairly quickly at the top of my head - so thought I&#x27;d try the product.&lt;br /&gt;But nothing really happened even after spraying quite a lot and fluffing up my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this at my local drug store,and what a helper it is to prolong time between washes due to oiliness. My hair gets really oily by day2/3 and takes over a hour between rollers and blow dry. So here&#x27;s my take based on what I read on others reviews:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not overbearing compared to hair spray, if its to much try opening a window!&lt;br /&gt;Reduce the amount of white, the instructions due say shake well, and hold at least 8inches away and rub in. not rocket science&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might vary from hair type to hair type but being from a mixed background and having difficult to manage hair I would definitely continue using this for now to keep that fresh day1and2 look to my hair until I&#x27;m ready to brave the hair drying experience again</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo! Not only does it work really well, but it smells really good too. It doesn&#x27;t seem to leave as much white residue on my hair either as some of the other dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good for a dry shampoo.  I have thinning hair that looks pretty greasy after 1 day of no washing.  This shampoo really helps with the greasy look, and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much just seconding what everyone else has said. I thought for sure there may have been something people were doing wrong when they say it only lasts 1-2 uses, but sure enough, mine is completely empty after just 1. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem with the nozzle, it&#x27;s the amount in the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it does what you want it to do - my hair looked perfectly clean for a whole extra day (which is really saying something because my hair is a greaseball within 24 hours of washing it). The powder takes a bit more effort to \\&quot;rub out\\&quot; than Suave&#x27;s does. But Dove did add more volume than Suave. I also slightly prefer the smell of Dove&#x27;s, though both are great. I would continue to buy Dove over Suave IF I got a few more uses out of it!</li>
            <li> I tried this one day when my hair looked like it needed a little help--hoping to give it more volume and make it look cleaner.  It was awful!  I sprayed in it, followed the instructions, and when it dried, it felt worse than it had before I used this!  Felt greasy and lank, and looked awful.  Since I was running out the door (the whole purpose of using this!) I had to wear a bandana.  Luckily I was only going to a dog class, but this was pretty much a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! Stick with Baptiste.</li>
            <li> I normally use salon products but decided to give this dry shampoo a whirl.  I cannot get beyond the awful smell.  I think I will \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; leave it in a restaurant bathroom somewhere.  Maybe it will work for the next person.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works as well was the expensive salon ones &amp; smells great.</li>
            <li> I just got this bottle 2 days ago...used it for the first time today in the morning and when I went to use it again in the afternoon all the aerosol leaked out...I heard it hissing after i used it but thought it would eventually stop...but NO...all the aerosol leaked out and I can&#x27;t use it anymore...the smell is amazing and the little amount that i did get out did work...just a waste of $5 plus whatever shipping was. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> The Dove Dry Shampoo works pretty well for me as my hair gets oily fairly quickly after a wash. I have fine blonde hair and don&#x27;t like to wash it too often, so the dry shampoo is great at prolonging wear (especially if I curl my hair). However $12 is a ridiculous price as this same bottle is sold at a drug store (Walgreens) for $5. That&#x27;s a crazy price to pay for the convenience of being shipped to your house. Yikes.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it onto and into my hair then massaged and that was it!  My hair smells fresh and  It&#x27;s got everything of convenience, and it brings shine and clean feel, free of any fragrance.</li>
            <li> great product. horrible smell. i am not that sensitive to smells, and i can smell this all day wafting around my head. it&#x27;s too bad because i actually think it works great, but the smell is so awful that i can&#x27;t use it. get rid of the smell and it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it wors. Only draw back i that it has a strng smell. It isn&#x27;t unplasent, but I could go for a less-smelly product.</li>
            <li> Shipping was right on and the product performs up to expectations.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least a half dozen dry shampoos and this is my new favorite.  The others I tried all leave a heavy powder residue on my brush.  The Dove brand goes on light, re-fluffs weighed down hair and leaves minimal to no residue behind.  I am very pleased with this.  It definitely is a clean fix for day old hair if you can&#x27;t shampoo.  I finish the style with a light hair spray or finishing mist that adds a small bit of shine and I am good to go.  A must have for your beauty emergency kit.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about 2 weeks, so I can&#x27;t say yet whether this will work for me long-term, but it seems like a great product so far. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the spray can emptying quickly like other reviewers seemed to have... perhaps they have resolved the faulty container problem. I hate having to wash my hair twice/day - I do it before work then later after the gym and I don&#x27;t want to fix it up every time. I&#x27;ve got to blow dry and straighten it a bit, so it is time-consuming. I&#x27;m trying to save precious time in my life by cutting down on hair prep!!! I was getting to the point where it was constantly in a ponytail or pulled back so I didn&#x27;t have to bother doing it. Well, I don&#x27;t want to sport a librarian bun constantly, that&#x27;s no fun. Why have long hair? Now I can blow-dry and straighten once, and keep it that way for 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells good, and does an excellent job absorbing sweat. My hair typically looks greasy by the next day if I don&#x27;t wash it, but with this, I can go 3-4 days without washing my hair and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all. It actually adds a lot of volume, surprisingly, and that makes my hair look even better. It starts to look a little dull though after a few days, and loses some shine... but generally, it looks great. I think a spritz of a shine spray would help with the dullness. I actually quite love this product. It saves me tons of time and I&#x27;m not wasting my life away washing and styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave a 4 because I&#x27;m concerned about long-term. It contains alcohol and I believe alcohol can be pretty drying. I don&#x27;t want my hair to turn to straw. Part of the reason I want to be washing it less is to keep it healthier... so I hope that won&#x27;t turn out to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product to use on days you don&#x27;t have time to shampoo.  Great price too.  As good  or better than more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> This product allows me to go a day or so without washing my hair.  It has a pleasant smell, as compared to other brands such as Bastiste.  It absorbs the oils in my hair quickly, and I do not have the white powder residue.  This is my second bottle that I have purchased and I could not be happier.  Its an affordable, and effective product.  Thanks Dove!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is medium in thickness and virgin.</li>
            <li> Holy smokes does this spray smell awesome!!  I was walking around my house trying to smell my hair hen I got done using this! And the smel stuck around for a real long time too!  Works like any other dry shampoo good for touch ups in the middle of the week if you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the Dove Dry Shampoo compared to other brands I have tried. It has a bit of a floral sent which is very pleasing.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the list of ingredients before purchasing. The first ingredient is isobutane, and the second is propane. Really? Don&#x27;t put this stuff in your hair! And the smell is extremely strong and perfume-y.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from a different retailer and at the current price on Amazon, I would definitely suggest purchasing here!  Compared to other dry shampoos I think Dove&#x27;s smells amazing.  It has a light powdery scent similar to their other hair care products.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem using this product so I&#x27;m not sure why some people are only getting 1-2 uses.  I&#x27;ve easily used it 5-6 times and still have most of the can left.  For the price compared to the amount of product this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Well... it does smell nice but not sure how &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; my hair feels. I have used it but the jury is still out. It is nice to have on hand on busy or lazy days you don&#x27;t want to deal with hair styling. Some days it is just too hot to blow dry... this is a nice option.</li>
            <li> Still has that sticky feeling and gray film that other dry shampoos have.  Not bad but not better than others.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT TO USE BETWEEN SHAMPOOS!! I HAVE USED IT TWICE AND BOTH TIMES IT GAVE ME VOLUME AND TOOK AWAY THAT OILY LOOK !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Sprays on clear and leaves my hair looking wet and greasy. I wanted to love this product since the price is so good but I had to go back to the only dry shampoo that has ever worked for me: Batiste. It is more expensive but so worth the price.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine and I used to wash it every day.  I decided to try dry shampoo and this Dove shampoo works well to add back some bulk and take away that flat look I&#x27;d get the second day after a shampoo.  My hair is auburn right now and there is a bit of whitish powder look to it some days that I didn&#x27;t notice when my hair was its natural light brown. The powder seems to work its way through and be gone quickly,  I don&#x27;t know if it would continue to show on even darker hair.  It is scented, but not as heavily as the other dry shampoo I tried, which is good.  I plan to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve never been one to wash my hair every day, as I know it&#x27;s not good for it. But, once my roots get oily, I wash it. Problem is, my hair has gotten so long, my roots are oily while the ends are still very dry. So I decided to give dry shampoo a try. It arrived today, and I tried it right away. It works pretty good, and it smells alright as well. I am pleased.</li>
            <li> this is the best dry shampoo ever.  it has a fresh scent without the white residue. very easy  to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My hair is thick and naturally oily. I used to wash my hair every day. I can now go 2-3 days without washing my hair with this product and it looks and smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Works well on my hair because I am blond. Might look strange on dark hair. Strong but pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work.  I use this because my hair is very oily in the morning if I haven&#x27;t had a chance to shower yet.  I bought this to buy me some time before I shower if I ever have to run to the store or something.  The smell in this shampoo is good but very over-powering.  And it makes my hair SOOO dry when I go to wash it next.  It is notty and hard to brush.  And it really doesn&#x27;t even work to make my hair look less oily.  Will never buy this again and do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have been using klorane dry shampoo for awhile and loved it but decided to give Dove a try since it was much less expensive.  I should of read other reviews first.  Product does not work. Leaves hair just as oily as before you used it.  Very disappointed in Dove this time</li>
