            <li>I love this facial brushes, it got great reviews</li>
            <li>Light never indicates that it has completed charge.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush, it is rechargeable battery operated, it is very easy to wash my face, and my face feels fresh every time, working quiet, may be rotating speed should improved for others, but I think it is ok.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this product if you are intending to clean face save your money and use your wash cloth  </li>
            <li>So soft and kind to my face.</li>
            <li>This cleansing system is awesome, very easy to use, really cleans and exfoliates your face, the body brush makes your skin so soft after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it makes my face feel really soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I love this facial brush, it makes my face feel so refreshed, smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, the price can not be better, pay few money get what you want, just order it.</li>
            <li>Works as described, my face feels better after first use, will keep using it and updated later, so far so good.</li>
            <li>This product would be great for applying  face lotions when hands aren&#x27;t  available ( if there is such a product) but definitely not cleansing/cleaning  face.</li>
            <li>Excellent - works just like more expensive brands!</li>
            <li>but because this isn&#x27;t an easily replaceable charger, I might have to get a return &amp; swap it for a new one.</li>
            <li>The brush head is supper soft, clean face comfortable, rotating speed is not too high</li>
            <li>I wish the strength could be a bit louder - I&#x27;m not worried about it making more noise, but I understand why they left it at where it was.</li>
            <li>I love this small brush very much, this face brush is made from high quality soft bristles, it is rotating and special design to clean face, after use it is very comfortable, my face feel clean and relax, I do feel that it is making a difference in the overall appearance of my skin</li>
            <li>it is more fast than I expected, thanks</li>
            <li>Also, when recharging, the red light never goes off</li>
            <li>but I did not feel it accomplished what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It is rechargeable but after plugging it in for over 24 hours, the red light which was supposed to go off when fully charged, was still on.</li>
            <li>Instructions said the red light would go off after it was charged.</li>
            <li>Pricy, but really works well.</li>
            <li>Good brush sins a bit slow but it works&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Some of these facial brushes are very expensive, this is priced right and does a great job, I travel a lot, so these is easy to pack.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still wonder if the more expensive versions do a better job.</li>
            <li>Be sure not to hold the brush to firmly to you skin, the unit will stop.</li>
            <li>If I get a response from the seller for a new charger, I&#x27;ll let everyone know.</li>
            <li>Well, I tried charging it a second time for 48 hours and the red light never did go off.  </li>
            <li>so so very soft.</li>
            <li>Not magical, but better.</li>
            <li>No problems so far.</li>
            <li>Brush too soft though</li>
            <li>The brush is too soft.  </li>
            <li>soft brush does not need batteries you can plug it into your computer to recharge.  </li>
            <li>It was decent while it lasted, and the bristles are too soft for my personal liking.</li>
            <li>I wish i could have read the instruction every thing is in chinese and i which to know where can i get new brush</li>
            <li>I just expected the bristles of the brush to be not so soft and to really exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to using my old one that uses batteries.  </li>
            <li>size long soft bristles</li>

            <li> size long soft bristles</li>
            <li> This product did not last long.</li>
            <li> and what an improvement after using it for 30 day and this is not a young face.</li>
            <li> It was going to be a &amp;#34;first&amp;#34;, trial brush before buying a more expensive one, but I am not sure if I will bother upgrading as this seems to be doing what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> Consequently I M left to wonder if the under powered spinning action  is due to that or if the spin motor just sucks...!??</li>
            <li> However, the brush is way too soft and the motor is way too slow.  </li>
            <li> only problem is the speed seems slow</li>
            <li> My skin feel softer, cleaner and my pores are gradually looking less clogged.</li>
            <li> works really slow, and I would say that after using it I didn&#x27;t really notices at least a small difference on my skin!</li>
            <li> Does not clean your face or pores at all.</li>
            <li> This worked for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so slow.  </li>
            <li> It spins very slow.</li>
            <li> so so very slow and brush is so</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed in the directions are in Asian characters!</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless to me.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worthless!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this brush, it makes my face feel really soft and clean. It was going to be a &amp;#34;first&amp;#34;, trial brush before buying a more expensive one, but I am not sure if I will bother upgrading as this seems to be doing what I wanted it to. Excellent value for money.</li>
            <li> This cleansing system is awesome, very easy to use, really cleans and exfoliates your face, the body brush makes your skin so soft after just a few uses. I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a spa like experience at home.</li>
            <li> Works well, feels good after the first use, will try more times.</li>
            <li> only had it one week.. seems to be doing the job! only problem is the speed seems slow</li>
            <li> I love this small brush very much, this face brush is made from high quality soft bristles, it is rotating and special design to clean face, after use it is very comfortable, my face feel clean and relax, I do feel that it is making a difference in the overall appearance of my skin, so happy that I have it.&lt;br /&gt;And it is more fast than I expected, thanks</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t charge, no power</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, my face feels clean and smooth, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Good brush sins a bit slow but it works&lt;br /&gt;Nice size long soft bristles</li>
            <li> I wish i could have read the instruction every thing is in chinese and i which to know where can i get new brush</li>
            <li> Purchased as gift. No problems so far. Priced great.</li>
            <li> Does the job well , cheap to buy but does work well !</li>
            <li> Brush too soft though</li>
            <li> It seems like a sturdy, waterproof brush.  However, the brush is way too soft and the motor is way too slow.  Also, when recharging, the red light never goes off so you think it&#x27;s isn&#x27;t recharged b/c it&#x27;s so slow.  However, everything died 6 months after using this brush (&amp; I didn&#x27;t use it that often).  I see no manufacturer&#x27;s warranty posted and you can only return it after 1 month.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very good product, the brush is very soft, and make face very clean and comfortable, the product is rechargeable and waterproof, it is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is may be the speed of rotating, can be faster I think, it is good anyway, I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this facial brushes, it got great reviews so I thought I should try it. So soft and kind to my face. I like how my face feels after. It is battery operate, and the battery can be recharged, waterproof and great price, if rotating speed is faster it will be great, I have contacted the seller if they have another one that move faster, they said if they improve the speed, it will make more noise, that is why it works so quiet, I can accept and recommend.</li>
            <li> What is a good replacement brush for these</li>
            <li> After 5 months will not accept charge!  Worthless!</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with this. I just expected the bristles of the brush to be not so soft and to really exfoliate my skin. But it did not. Felt good but I did not feel it accomplished what I wanted. It is rechargeable but after plugging it in for over 24 hours, the red light which was supposed to go off when fully charged, was still on.</li>
            <li> This was the fastest delivery. It is a great product. I wish it had two speeds, but it just has one speed. Be sure not to hold the brush to firmly to you skin, the unit will stop. I love using it to put cream on. I would buy again. Dave from youthful Advantage contacted me to see if everything is ok. This is great customer service.</li>
            <li> Excellent - works just like more expensive brands!</li>
            <li> Works as described, my face feels better after first use, will keep using it and updated later, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I love this facial brush, it makes my face feel so refreshed, smooth and clean. I have noticed my skin improving since I have been using this awesome brush.</li>
            <li> Does not clean your face or pores at all.</li>
            <li> I think it deserves one star for the disign only!&lt;br /&gt;It works really slow, and I would say that after using it I didn&#x27;t really notices at least a small difference on my skin!</li>
            <li> i love it but i have only had it seance may and the only way it works is pludged in it wont work anyother way i have had it pludged in for 3 days and if i unpludg it it wont work i dont know what to do</li>
            <li> My skin feel softer, cleaner and my pores are gradually looking less clogged. Not magical, but better. Still wonder if the more expensive versions do a better job. Good for the lower price.</li>
            <li> This product did not last long. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> After the initial charge of 24 hours, it acts as if it&#x27;s not fully charged.  It spins very slow. The brush is too soft.  It&#x27;s useless to me.  I&#x27;ll go back to using my old one that uses batteries.  The reason why I ordered this one is that it could be charged using USB instead of batteries.  The instructions had several misspelled words. Instructions said the red light would go off after it was charged. Well, I tried charging it a second time for 48 hours and the red light never did go off.  It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This worked for a little over a month. It is NOT waterproof. It was decent while it lasted, and the bristles are too soft for my personal liking.</li>
            <li> Its like brushing  your face with a feather. Spinning goes so so so very slow and brush is so so so very soft. This product would be great for applying  face lotions when hands aren&#x27;t  available ( if there is such a product) but definitely not cleansing/cleaning  face. Don&#x27;t buy this product if you are intending to clean face save your money and use your wash cloth  you&#x27;ll get better results.</li>
            <li> Good product with great price, this is my first one, if it is really good for my face, I will buy again for my friend.</li>
            <li> Pricy, but really works well.</li>
            <li> What a deal..soft brush does not need batteries you can plug it into your computer to recharge.  I love it!  My face loves it. and what an improvement after using it for 30 day and this is not a young face.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser brush is wonderful! I have only been using this about a few days now, but it has really taken the redness out of my face and my face feels cleaner than it did before. I am very pleased with this product, the price can not be better, pay few money get what you want, just order it.</li>
            <li> Have not used this product. VERY disappointed in the directions are in Asian characters! I am tempted to send it back.</li>
            <li> It works great. I wish the strength could be a bit louder - I&#x27;m not worried about it making more noise, but I understand why they left it at where it was. I&#x27;ve used it throughout several showers - it got a LOT of water on and throughout the machine, so I can actually vouch for them saying that it&#x27;s waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have to say is, I&#x27;ve tried charging it for the 3rd time and it looks like the charger no longer works. It&#x27;s only working if I&#x27;m literally pushing the charger in. If I get a response from the seller for a new charger, I&#x27;ll let everyone know. The main piece works great but because this isn&#x27;t an easily replaceable charger, I might have to get a return &amp; swap it for a new one. 2 stars until then. 4 stars once I find a solution.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, well made of quality parts but the  rechargeable feature has yet to work S described. Light never indicates that it has completed charge.  Consequently I M left to wonder if the under powered spinning action  is due to that or if the spin motor just sucks...!??</li>
            <li> Love this brush I lost mine &amp; am reordering another one! It really works just as good as the Mia by clarsonic.</li>
            <li> Can not complain about this facial brush, does a great jobs on my face, keep my face clean and healthy, I will introduce to anyone who want this kind of brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this newer model and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive price, works as described.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is rechargeable battery operated, it is very easy to wash my face, and my face feels fresh every time, working quiet, may be rotating speed should improved for others, but I think it is ok.</li>
            <li> Supper soft brush head, great massage accessories, works good and quiet, worth four stars, but the price is great, so five stars is OK.</li>
            <li> Some of these facial brushes are very expensive, this is priced right and does a great job, I travel a lot, so these is easy to pack.&lt;br /&gt;We love this electric rotating brush. It is just what we wanted &amp; couldn&#x27;t find in any store in town.</li>
            <li> The brush head is supper soft, clean face comfortable, rotating speed is not too high, this make face feels good, but you should spend more time to wash face, can not get both.</li>
