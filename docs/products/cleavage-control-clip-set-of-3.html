    <ol>
            <li>and I was very impressed  </li>
            <li>the size of these was perfect and the quality when I reveived</li>
            <li>Pricing is also excellent.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied product arrived in perfect condition</li>
            <li>They are awesome, easy to use and the colors are perfect.</li>
            <li>But they are great to have on hand.  </li>
            <li>The one in the picture I&#x27;ve had before, they work great.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>But, for what I bought them for, they are a great product and bargain at this price.</li>
            <li>I was happy and that&#x27;s all that matters.  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>it was great.</li>
            <li>is a great product.</li>
            <li>I think these things come in very handy during summer.  </li>
            <li>Very handy item -</li>
            <li>Was looking for a good clip for a bra that would hide the straps whenever I use my racerback tank tops</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really good for that.</li>
            <li>- I can even wear the 2 for $7 bras and they make the bra fit perfectly</li>
            <li>I gave it a good review because although I havn&#x27;t tried it yet...</li>
            <li>Also good if you child still has growing room in a leotard</li>
            <li>Delighted when I saw this....not so when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>I bought these more to alter my bra for racer-back tops, which they do, and they are great for that.</li>
            <li>Nice try.</li>
            <li>Its a pratical cleavage control clip, a good way to hide handles, making you more elegant, bought it and liked it</li>
            <li>Its easy to use, effective and even gives you a \\&quot;push\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and order the better quality ones.</li>
            <li>Received on time and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a more durable plastic to have been used for this product.  </li>
            <li>I like not having my straps showing all the time :)</li>
            <li>works perfectly and has 3 colors for different shirts.</li>
            <li>most important keeps bra straps up!</li>
            <li>i would never recommend this item because i didnt get more then 1 clip</li>
            <li>sounds like more of a hassle to me,</li>
            <li>Though to be fair, I&#x27;m 90 lbs and a 32A, so there isn&#x27;t a large amount of tension.     </li>
            <li>I originally got these two years ago for my sister&#x27;s wedding, but I have since worn them many times.  </li>
            <li>Strong and still using them.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>They are made of cheap material and dont hold on well to bra straps.</li>
            <li>However, inside the package were three cheap flimsy \\&quot;H\\&quot; shaped clips.</li>
            <li>If my husband is available, I&#x27;ll ask him to put them on for me once my suit is on.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fantastic for shirts that are any variety of sleeveless.  </li>
            <li>The style I received is cheaply made and bends when I place the bra straps in it.</li>
            <li>Cheap and can&#x27;t work as described.</li>
            <li>GREAT for tanks or for the extra cleavage in the right dress</li>
            <li>Material is very flimsy and easy to break.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely perfect for hiding straps behind racerback tops.  </li>
            <li>These guys count on you not bothering to return it as $5 isn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>I don;t even know if 4 dollars is even worth calling and complaning about</li>
            <li>It lays flat, is comfortable, and is easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Yes, it was reasonably priced and received quickly.</li>
            <li>I am pretty busty though and wanted something to help lift.</li>
            <li>Other versions are better!</li>
            <li>They snap too easily under pressure so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for bigger busts.</li>
            <li>I have large breast and bought this item to help lift my breasts.</li>
            <li>but I bought these for the racerback style, that way my bra straps don&#x27;t show with certain shirts.</li>
            <li>Did not work for people that have large chest.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the cleavage part, I haven&#x27;t really noticed all that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It does the job that I want it to do, I didn&#x27;t really look about the change in cleavage</li>
            <li>Yes, it does pull your shoulders back but not in a comfortable way.  </li>
            <li>Spend the extra buck or two and buy the original brand.</li>
            <li>There are other products on the market that is better.</li>
            <li>However, my favorite way to use them is on old bathing suits that have the straps all stretched out.  </li>
            <li>The clips held my straps back all day when I was wearing a T-Back tank top and they were not uncomfortable at all(I adjusted my bra straps of course to make them as long as they would go.)However if I could give the directions that came with the product</li>
            <li>It does make your neck sore, but I have larger breasts so what I really need is the right bra to hold them up and not put all the weight on my neck.</li>
            <li>This is a great concept but it is really difficult to use.</li>
            <li>This bra clip is hard to put on and very easy to fell off without notice.  </li>
            <li>I reordered four packages of these, which as pictured are the exact same ones I got before.  </li>
            <li>This was complete deception.</li>
            <li>I like to wear old bathing suits this way to work around the yard and in my garden, with a pair of shorts over them.  </li>
            <li>The material is not tough enough to keep its shape and therefore the bra straps will not stay in place.</li>
            <li>I wear a lot of tanks while I work out and in general.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the back one so far, and I didn&#x27;t have any problems at all.</li>
            <li>so simple to use, works well, exactly as described and they dont hurt your neck like the other reviewer</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t sit completely flat like the old ones did.  </li>
            <li>The pieces are a little flimsy so they don&#x27;t stay put very well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> like it takes THAT long</li>
            <li> Some of my sister&#x27;s leotards had to long and un-adjustable straps.</li>
            <li> The pack I bought included 9 pieces, 3 as shown and the other 6 were also in these colors but with different shape for all kinds of cleavage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try the one elastic strap next time that goes from one bra strap to the other.</li>
            <li> It also made my neck and back sore from wearing it for only a few hours.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and got a set.  </li>
            <li> I am not thrilled with the new improved version.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get them set up properly, but I like the way my new tops look without having to buy new (expensive) bras.</li>
            <li> It keep slipping off the bra straps.</li>
            <li> But if he&#x27;s not, I will put then on the bathing suit carefully and then step into the suit.    </li>
            <li> The item arrived just as expected lived up to its expectations</li>
            <li> This product is just what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t have the quality of other similar products I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> Instead, an extremely flimsy almost paper-like material was used.  </li>
            <li> , not fun for either of us.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wearing a sleeveless shirt and don&#x27;t want your bra straps to show, it will hold them in place well and keep them hidden.  </li>
            <li> Its not very easy to put it on yourself</li>
            <li> Product is not worth your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive the tried and true ones that I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was left confused and wondering if I had received a faulty product.</li>
            <li> It does not stay and it&#x27;s hard to put on, unlike the other ones.</li>
            <li> but i still was not able to figure out how to use them with my bra straps.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> Yes, eventually if you use them hard they will snap and break.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find them that hard to put on.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time keeping the straps together with this.</li>
            <li> Clip wasn&#x27;t hard to put on.</li>
            <li> negative stars</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint -</li>
            <li> The package has a photo of three thick circular clips.</li>
            <li> However, I was sent a different set. :(</li>
            <li> One broke while I was out, and they&#x27;re difficult to maneuver; I&#x27;m fairly thin, so it&#x27;s not like they were under pressure.</li>
            <li> Appearantly the company randomly picks which style they want to send you.</li>
            <li> My husband had to help me put the clip on - sadly</li>
            <li> It was a bit difficult to put on yourself but either get help or learn yourself, not</li>
            <li> The clips are made of a flexible plastic that make it very difficult to connect and then hold in place.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to do yourself.</li>
            <li> Almost impossible by yourself.</li>
            <li> This piece of crap is too flimsy to hold a Barbie Doll&#x27;s bra.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was looking for a good clip for a bra that would hide the straps whenever I use my racerback tank tops and I found it. Its easy to use, effective and even gives you a \\&quot;push\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I bought them and tried one out today. It fell off when I was walking around and I didn&#x27;t even feel it. They are made of cheap material and dont hold on well to bra straps. Spend the extra buck or two and buy the original brand. It also made my neck and back sore from wearing it for only a few hours.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely perfect for hiding straps behind racerback tops.  It lays flat, is comfortable, and is easy to put on.</li>
            <li> This is crappy. Product is not worth your money! There are other products on the market that is better. It does not stay and it&#x27;s hard to put on, unlike the other ones.</li>
            <li> The photo is the \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot; Cleavage Control Clip. The package has a photo of three thick circular clips. However, inside the package were three cheap flimsy \\&quot;H\\&quot; shaped clips. They looked nothing like the picture on the packaging. This was complete deception.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews saying that these things break. I have not had this happen to me. Though to be fair, I&#x27;m 90 lbs and a 32A, so there isn&#x27;t a large amount of tension.     These help because sometimes my straps are too long, and they also provide some extra lift.     They were packaged efficiently--they came in an envelope with instructions.</li>
            <li> the product came with directions and everything but i still was not able to figure out how to use them with my bra straps. The products didn&#x27;t even seem similar when described on the directions.</li>
            <li> the clip wouldnt stay put and in place long enough for it to work. It keep slipping off the bra straps. Very difficult to install on your own.</li>
            <li> I think these things come in very handy during summer.  If you&#x27;re wearing a sleeveless shirt and don&#x27;t want your bra straps to show, it will hold them in place well and keep them hidden.  However, my favorite way to use them is on old bathing suits that have the straps all stretched out.  I use one of these, and the bathing suit becomes an X back that has renewed life in it.  I like to wear old bathing suits this way to work around the yard and in my garden, with a pair of shorts over them.  I originally got these two years ago for my sister&#x27;s wedding, but I have since worn them many times.  Yes, eventually if you use them hard they will snap and break.  But they are great to have on hand.  I don&#x27;t find them that hard to put on.  If my husband is available, I&#x27;ll ask him to put them on for me once my suit is on.  But if he&#x27;s not, I will put then on the bathing suit carefully and then step into the suit.    Update on 8/1/11 I reordered four packages of these, which as pictured are the exact same ones I got before.  What I received was a different product.  I am not thrilled with the new improved version.  They don&#x27;t sit completely flat like the old ones did.  I think I&#x27;m going to return three of the packages, or maybe all four.  I&#x27;m disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive the tried and true ones that I ordered.  The picture here should be updated so as not to deceive customers in the future.</li>
            <li> This bra clip is hard to put on and very easy to fell off without notice.  It does not do the job. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I always wondered about these.  I finally broke down and got a set.  They&#x27;re fantastic for shirts that are any variety of sleeveless.  Plus it gives your chest a helpful boost!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time keeping the straps together with this. I am pretty busty though and wanted something to help lift.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  They don&#x27;t stay in place once you get it attached, comes undone constantly.  Try getting one of these on the back of your bra by yourself, it&#x27;s quiet imposible.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this company. Appearantly this company sells different styles of the bra strap clip. (known because the package shows a picture of the 4 different types [not known until I received it]). I ordered it because it was a specific one that wanted..l.when I received it, it was a different style then I had ordered. I have large breast and bought this item to help lift my breasts. The style I received is cheaply made and bends when I place the bra straps in it. It digs into my back and cut me and I bled. Appearantly the company randomly picks which style they want to send you. Very disappointed. The one in the picture I&#x27;ve had before, they work great. However, I was sent a different set. :(</li>
            <li> so simple to use, works well, exactly as described and they dont hurt your neck like the other reviewer said unless you dont know how to adjust your bra straps lol. GREAT for tanks or for the extra cleavage in the right dress</li>
            <li> Clip wasn&#x27;t hard to put on. It has fallen off a couple of times.  It does make your neck sore, but I have larger breasts so what I really need is the right bra to hold them up and not put all the weight on my neck. This is only a temporary fix and it does the job. I feel lifted.</li>
            <li> I give the product, price &amp; shipping speed 5 stars. The clips held my straps back all day when I was wearing a T-Back tank top and they were not uncomfortable at all(I adjusted my bra straps of course to make them as long as they would go.)However if I could give the directions that came with the product negative stars I would... They are for a completely different as seen on TV product! I was left confused and wondering if I had received a faulty product. I went on amazon to ask the seller for either a refund or the correct product but then I decided to look at pictures of the product before and that&#x27;s when I figured out how to put the clips on. I recommend these clips to everyone but look at the picture online to figure out how to wear them and don&#x27;t even bother reading the directions.</li>
            <li> I bought these more to alter my bra for racer-back tops, which they do, and they are great for that. It takes a little practice to get them set up properly, but I like the way my new tops look without having to buy new (expensive) bras. I can&#x27;t comment on the cleavage part, I haven&#x27;t really noticed all that much of a difference. But, for what I bought them for, they are a great product and bargain at this price.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied product arrived in perfect condition I was happy and that&#x27;s all that matters.  I would definitely recommend this seller to future customers and would purchase items from them again.  The item arrived just as expected lived up to its expectations and I was very impressed  Its not very easy to put it on yourself but it could just be me lol</li>
            <li> Total deception; the package shows 3 oval discs while the actual clips were &amp;#34;H&amp;#34; shaped which looked nothing like what is shown on the package. Cheap and can&#x27;t work as described.</li>
            <li> Ordered these because of the video.  These are nothing but junk. Flimsy pieces of plastic that won&#x27;t even attach to the bra.  Do yourself a favor and order the better quality ones.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work all that well, are hard to put in and they make your neck REALLY sore after wearing them for part of the day.</li>
            <li> My wife uses them all the time.</li>
            <li> Received on time and I love it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without these</li>
            <li> I bought this to convert my bras for shirts with open sleeves in the back. One broke while I was out, and they&#x27;re difficult to maneuver; I&#x27;m fairly thin, so it&#x27;s not like they were under pressure.</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint - the brochure I received did not match the product. It was not the same as the one shown with the item on Amazon. My husband had to help me put the clip on - sadly, not fun for either of us. This should probably be called Houdini Control Clip. Yes, it was reasonably priced and received quickly. I think it took us longer to put it on than it did to receive it.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supossed to do. Works fine. I&#x27;ve used the back one so far, and I didn&#x27;t have any problems at all.</li>
            <li> well, it does not control your cleavage so if you hope that&#x27;s the trick it does, don&#x27;t buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;BUT it conceals the straps in a racer back tanks so it&#x27;s really good for that.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t have the quality of other similar products I have purchased in the past.  The clips are made of a flexible plastic that make it very difficult to connect and then hold in place.  Other versions are better!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy these for cleavage control but I bought these for the racerback style, that way my bra straps don&#x27;t show with certain shirts. It does the job that I want it to do, I didn&#x27;t really look about the change in cleavage but mine is never showing either case. It was a bit difficult to put on yourself but either get help or learn yourself, not like it takes THAT long</li>
            <li> They are kinda flimsy compared to ones I&#x27;ve had before but they get the job done so no complaints here</li>
            <li> Very handy item - I have not puleed a bra strap up since I recieved these - I can even wear the 2 for $7 bras and they make the bra fit perfectly</li>
            <li> These clips are really thin, bendy and feels cheap. They snap too easily under pressure so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for bigger busts.</li>
            <li> These guys count on you not bothering to return it as $5 isn&#x27;t worth the hassle.This piece of crap is too flimsy to hold a Barbie Doll&#x27;s bra. Total con.</li>
            <li> I gave it a good review because although I havn&#x27;t tried it yet...the size of these was perfect and the quality when I reveived it was great.</li>
            <li> Its a pratical cleavage control clip, a good way to hide handles, making you more elegant, bought it and liked it</li>
            <li> I was expecting a more durable plastic to have been used for this product.  Instead, an extremely flimsy almost paper-like material was used.  The material is not tough enough to keep its shape and therefore the bra straps will not stay in place. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Did not work for people that have large chest. Material is very flimsy and easy to break. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get them to work, not that they were made for 34DDD - but yeah, these don&#x27;t work. Nice try.</li>
            <li> Nothing to do with cleavage but everything to do with visible bra straps. I wear a lot of tanks while I work out and in general. I like not having my straps showing all the time :)</li>
            <li> awesome!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product. works perfectly and has 3 colors for different shirts. most important keeps bra straps up!</li>
            <li> i would never recommend this item because i didnt get more then 1 clip and it claims set of 3</li>
            <li> I dont even know what to say I ordered these clips almost 2 months ago. I NEVER GOT THEM. I don;t even know if 4 dollars is even worth calling and complaning about sounds like more of a hassle to me, Guess i won&#x27;t buy these again!</li>
            <li> Some of my sister&#x27;s leotards had to long and un-adjustable straps. These solve the problem. Also good if you child still has growing room in a leotard but you know she&#x27;ll grow in to it before the end of the year.</li>
            <li> They are peeeeerfect!</li>
            <li> Worked as well as the name brand at a fraction of the price, but will not change life as we know it.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I expected it to be. Very difficult to do yourself. I need assistance inserting bra straps into the clip.</li>
            <li> This is a great concept but it is really difficult to use. Almost impossible by yourself. The pieces are a little flimsy so they don&#x27;t stay put very well. I will update when/if I get these figured out.</li>
            <li> Strong and still using them.</li>
            <li> You must have these clips! They are awesome, easy to use and the colors are perfect. Pricing is also excellent. The pack I bought included 9 pieces, 3 as shown and the other 6 were also in these colors but with different shape for all kinds of cleavage</li>
            <li> Delighted when I saw this....not so when I put it on.  Yes, it does pull your shoulders back but not in a comfortable way.  And the bra then becomes a size smaller.  I&#x27;ll try the one elastic strap next time that goes from one bra strap to the other.</li>
