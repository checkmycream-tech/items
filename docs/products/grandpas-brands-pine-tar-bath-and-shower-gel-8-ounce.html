            <li>Great product at a great price.  </li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of campfires and all the good times associated with them.&lt;br /&gt;Would make a good aromatherapy scent</li>
            <li>Granpas is a good brand.    </li>
            <li>The bar worked wonders on drying up the rash and helping with the itch, but the body wash just wasn&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li>This is great for those who love shower gel over bar soap.  </li>
            <li>Very strong smell that lingers in a not so good way.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>very strong odor - kind of manly.</li>
            <li>This smells like a bon fire and the smell was very strong...</li>
            <li>went away for while ! :-)</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product line by my mother many years ago&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think this kills germs and cleans my skin better than most off the shelf soaps</li>
            <li>love my grandpa pine</li>
            <li>This is a liquid form of your favorite pine-tar soap.     </li>
            <li>I still like the bars better, but I tried this out to test it.    </li>
            <li>The bar is a much better deal all around.    </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what it was</li>
            <li>just so you&#x27;re prepared :)</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I just ran out and will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li>She said it was wonderfully helpful for her skin and has already used the entire bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love its smell.</li>
            <li>My husband and I, both, love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>you do feel very clean.</li>
            <li>Other than that it smells wonderful like a campfire.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m also getting UV light treatment, so it could be a combination of both.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definetely strong but not bad.</li>
            <li>The consensus in the online community was using this product (also available in bar soap form) and the original Sarna cream.</li>
            <li>It gets you clean and it will stop dandruff.</li>
            <li>Using this clean it all up</li>
            <li>OK, so I am a bit strange but have always liked this smell.</li>
            <li>dont know what else to say other than great pine tar  takes away rashes from razor burn thats about it</li>
            <li>I bought this when I was pregnant and suffering from PuPPPS.  </li>
            <li>Yes the smell is odd, but works great.</li>
            <li>Second order love it!</li>
            <li>Note: not for hot dates/job interviews!</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>It is also great for daily use, especially for those who have psoriasis.</li>
            <li>but I found this worked the best and a little goes a long way !</li>
            <li>She said the soap is way too drying for eczema and that it only feels better temporarily because of the cooling agent.  </li>
            <li>so I used Benadryl itch cream at first.</li>
            <li>After showering twice the first day and using this product, and applying the Sarna cream in between for itch relief, the rash stopped spreading and the itchiness went away.  </li>
            <li>It smells at first but the smell goes away.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of hours of research, I realized I had developed PUPPs which is a rash that some pregnant women get.</li>
            <li>It certainly wasn&#x27;t a cure</li>
            <li>Also, for those who aren&#x27;t aware (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s already in the other reviews, but i&#x27;ll say it)</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.  </li>
            <li>but it helped kept the intense icthing away for hours and rash</li>
            <li>Really works for Psoriasis.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been three days now and my rash is no longer red, and has turned into a faded light brown which tells me</li>
            <li>The bar smells worse, but this doesn&#x27;t smell great.  </li>
            <li>This was also much easier to use than the bar soap.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to squeeze much to work up lather on cloth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the whole bar/shower gel because as soon as I had my baby</li>
            <li>the oine tar odor is very stong and the smell does linger in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to share incase other pregnant ladies could benefit from it!!</li>
            <li>Pricey when I consider it did not offer better relief than other products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the results as this rash usually doesn&#x27;t resolve until delivery</li>
            <li>I had PUPPS when I was pregnant and this was the only thing that gave me some relief!</li>
            <li>Also, why the high price?</li>
            <li>The soap has far too much fragrance, and uses crappy additives like sulfates.</li>
            <li>This shower gel is special for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Was pretty messy to clean up.</li>
            <li>No issues with the product just didn&#x27;t live up tot</li>
            <li>When I was young, my mom used to bathe us with pine tar soap.</li>
            <li>I have these white splotches on my arm that only occur when its hot.  </li>
            <li>I showered the next day using my old shampoo and soap and still smelled like smoke.</li>
            <li>Six weeks after having my second baby, I developed a red bumpy rash on my lower abdomen.</li>
            <li>It could have been so much better, but a few bad choices in the product make sure I&#x27;ll never buy it again.    </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and most of the patches are gone and the one stubborn patch isn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> Any benefits are truly minimal in my experience.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week and the rash has started to subside and the itching is minimal at this point.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> just takes a small amount for a big lather.</li>
            <li> volume is a bit less than i expected.</li>
            <li> The product works well for keeping my scalp irritation down.  </li>
            <li> It barely put a dent in it and the rash started getting worse and spreading.  </li>
            <li> I had originally gotten this because I had read in several baby blogs that ur helped with the terrible itching that came with PUPPS.</li>
            <li> I wasted no time and bought both!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product and if you&#x27;re reading this review because of PUPPs, don&#x27;t waste any time and just order it!  </li>
            <li> It gave me at least an hour of freedom from the itching, I even had a bar at work and would wash my legs and stomach at least once during the workday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the mosquitoes hate the smell, maybe you won&#x27;t get bitten and with the high rate of West Nile</li>
            <li> rash - awful pregnancy induced rash that is VERY itchy.</li>
            <li> I had a TERRIBLE case of PUPPPS rash during the last 3 weeks of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I had horrible eczema a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell</li>
            <li> Call me crazy, but we weren&#x27;t bothered by mosquitoes</li>
            <li> She also used it to wash our&lt;br /&gt;hair, needless to say, we NEVER contacted head lice!</li>
            <li> The smell is not as bad as some people say.</li>
            <li> I have to warn you it will make your shower very dirty because of what it is.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the shampoo and hated my life for 2 days...</li>
            <li> This was awful.</li>

            <li> I like it but I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.  I have eczema and it&#x27;s helping.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and most of the patches are gone and the one stubborn patch isn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> The smell is not as bad as some people say. It&#x27;s definetely strong but not bad. I&#x27;ve noticed improvements in my psoriasis but I&#x27;m also getting UV light treatment, so it could be a combination of both.</li>
            <li> This stuff is swell. It gets you clean and it will stop dandruff. It&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I had PUPPS when I was pregnant and this was the only thing that gave me some relief! I tried a different brand of pine tar bar soap  but I found this worked the best and a little goes a long way ! I had to take about two showers a day but it helped kept the intense icthing away for hours and rash went away for while ! :-)</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of campfires and all the good times associated with them.&lt;br /&gt;Would make a good aromatherapy scent</li>
            <li> Really works for Psoriasis. I have had Psoriasis since I was 5 and this makes my skin feal great. Not the best smell but still works.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product line by my mother many years ago&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this kills germs and cleans my skin better than most off the shelf soaps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my grandpa pine</li>
            <li> This shower gel is special for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had horrible eczema a few months ago.  I itched and itched and went to my dermatolgist.  She asked me what I was using and I said Grandpa&#x27;s tar soap.  She looked at me with horror and told me to stop using immediately.  She said the soap is way too drying for eczema and that it only feels better temporarily because of the cooling agent.  Stay away from this if you eczema!</li>
            <li> This is a liquid form of your favorite pine-tar soap.     I still like the bars better, but I tried this out to test it.    The soap has far too much fragrance, and uses crappy additives like sulfates. It could have been so much better, but a few bad choices in the product make sure I&#x27;ll never buy it again.    Also, why the high price? The bar is a much better deal all around.    If you must have pine tar and it must be in liquid form, this is for you, otherwise get the bar soap. Granpas is a good brand.    Also, no noticeable improvement in skin condition with acne or my girlfriends eczema... the bar helps though.</li>
            <li> Just like the stuff grandma used on me..only easier. smell rinses away. scalp itch gone in one week of use.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. I have to warn you it will make your shower very dirty because of what it is. Other than that it smells wonderful like a campfire.</li>
            <li> Six weeks after having my second baby, I developed a red bumpy rash on my lower abdomen. I wasn&#x27;t sure what it was so I used Benadryl itch cream at first. It barely put a dent in it and the rash started getting worse and spreading.  After a couple of hours of research, I realized I had developed PUPPs which is a rash that some pregnant women get. It&#x27;s rare in pregnancy and even less common postpartum (yay me for getting it!). The consensus in the online community was using this product (also available in bar soap form) and the original Sarna cream. I wasted no time and bought both!

It&#x27;s been three days now and my rash is no longer red, and has turned into a faded light brown which tells me it&#x27;s going away. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product and if you&#x27;re reading this review because of PUPPs, don&#x27;t waste any time and just order it!  It does smell like campfire though just so you&#x27;re prepared :)</li>
            <li> OK, so I am a bit strange but have always liked this smell. Product is great. just takes a small amount for a big lather.</li>
            <li> This is great for those who love shower gel over bar soap.  It is also great for daily use, especially for those who have psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I was pregnant and suffering from PuPPPS.  The bar worked wonders on drying up the rash and helping with the itch, but the body wash just wasn&#x27;t as good.  Stick with the bar if you need this for skin conditions.  Also, for those who aren&#x27;t aware (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s already in the other reviews, but i&#x27;ll say it) The bar smells worse, but this doesn&#x27;t smell great.  Campfire comes to mind.  Be forewarned. It&#x27;s an acquired taste, this smell.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I just ran out and will be ordering more.  Have used the Grandpa&#x27;s bar soap for a couple of years for the beard but this is awesome for everywhere.</li>
            <li> Any benefits are truly minimal in my experience.  Very strong smell that lingers in a not so good way.  Pricey when I consider it did not offer better relief than other products.  Would recommend using for a hand soap but not a body soap and decidedly not as a shampoo.  No issues with the product just didn&#x27;t live up tot he hype.</li>
            <li> Use it as a body wash, my bald head, and my beard.  Amazing product.  I get about 2.5 months out of this bottle.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after a visit to my OB and was diagnosed with PUPPS rash - awful pregnancy induced rash that is VERY itchy. I was nervous after getting it and smelling it...very strong odor - kind of manly. I have been using it for a week and the rash has started to subside and the itching is minimal at this point. I&#x27;m thrilled with the results as this rash usually doesn&#x27;t resolve until delivery and I&#x27;m at 30 weeks right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to share incase other pregnant ladies could benefit from it!!</li>
            <li> dont know what else to say other than great pine tar  takes away rashes from razor burn thats about it</li>
            <li> Second order love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has psoriasis.  She said it was wonderfully helpful for her skin and has already used the entire bottle.  She would buy this product again</li>
            <li> This was awful. I bought this and the shampoo and hated my life for 2 days... This smells like a bon fire and the smell was very strong... I showered the next day using my old shampoo and soap and still smelled like smoke. I would not recomend this to anyone with a nose.</li>
            <li> The product works well for keeping my scalp irritation down.  I am only giving three stars because when I opened the packaging with the bottle in it, there was no seal on the bottle and some of it leaked out.  Was pretty messy to clean up.</li>
            <li> This was the only product that gave me any relief from PUPPPS. It certainly wasn&#x27;t a cure but it helped a tiny bit. This was also much easier to use than the bar soap.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> I will buy this product again. I love its smell. Don&#x27;t have to squeeze much to work up lather on cloth. Great for the scalp also. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  My husband and I, both, love it.</li>
            <li> I had originally gotten this because I had read in several baby blogs that ur helped with the terrible itching that came with PUPPS. It helped somewhat and it made me smell like a campfire. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell but my husband seemed to like it lol. I didn&#x27;t use the whole bar/shower gel because as soon as I had my baby the itching stopped immediately but my husband occasionally uses it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I heard about it on the radio and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have these white splotches on my arm that only occur when its hot.  Using this clean it all up and my skin feels great.  Yes the smell is odd, but works great.</li>
            <li> hyperallegentic product needed.  the oine tar odor is very stong and the smell does linger in the bathroom.  you do feel very clean.</li>
            <li> When I was young, my mom used to bathe us with pine tar soap. Call me crazy, but we weren&#x27;t bothered by mosquitoes&lt;br /&gt;much! Maybe they didn&#x27;t like the smell, either way, we could play outside for hours! She also used it to wash our&lt;br /&gt;hair, needless to say, we NEVER contacted head lice! So pine tar does serve it&#x27;s purpose in some aspects! Pros: if&lt;br /&gt;the mosquitoes hate the smell, maybe you won&#x27;t get bitten and with the high rate of West Nile, what have you got to lose! Cons: the smell takes some getting used to!! Note: not for hot dates/job interviews!</li>
            <li> When I was a kid we used pipe tar soap for people and animals, it works wonders.  It smells at first but the smell goes away.  My dog had skin problems for over a year and the vet has tried about ten different soaps and nothing helped. I remembered using this when I was a kid for skin ailments on dogs and horses.  Back then it was in a bar.  I bought this and bathed by dog in it twice a week and his skin cleared up in about two months.</li>
            <li> I had a TERRIBLE case of PUPPPS rash during the last 3 weeks of my pregnancy. This soap (liquid or bar) was the only thing that would help before I finally saw a dermatologist for steroid cream. It gave me at least an hour of freedom from the itching, I even had a bar at work and would wash my legs and stomach at least once during the workday.</li>
            <li> volume is a bit less than i expected.</li>
