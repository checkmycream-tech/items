            <li>You sit under a warm dryer with a plastic cap on for 10 minutes and believe it or not, 10 minutes is all it</li>

            <li>To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t blown away by the results like I thought I would.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very very strong.</li>

            <li>I gave this rating because I love how this made my hair very strong and kept it from breaking off after the chemical process which is very important.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note some very important advice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is more stronger and softer every time I use it....</li>
            <li>Love this treatment.</li>

            <li>i LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li>Or, you may require more moisture, or more strength.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you read all of the directions and apply correctly.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years because I love what it does for may hair.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE  it![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The entire line is awesome....</li>
            <li>If you have problem with your ends you will be in love with this product.</li>
            <li>so I add more hydrafuse the kerafuse.</li>
            <li>So THANK YOU AMAZON for making just about any/everything available :)</li>
            <li>The product is okay and smells pleasant,  except I was trying to kind of stay away from mineral oil and petrolatum in my deep conditioners and this one has both right at the top of the list,  so I probably won&#x27;t repurchase.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply to the hair and it easily rinses off.</li>
            <li>i have used it couple of times now and still experiencing breakage; it is easy to apply but havent seen the benefits.</li>
            <li>Hair is strong and stops shedding after 1 use.</li>
            <li>I love this product it delivered exactly what it promises!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>also important).</li>
            <li>I have never felt it this smooth.</li>
            <li>but I have to put on a good condition to make my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I did not, but instead used ACV and a sulfate and paraban free shampoo to get my hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>You have to section the hair and apply a small amount at a time to get best results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been seeking a great conditioner got my dry hair</li>
            <li>My hair is much stronger and I am glad I did purchase it.  </li>
            <li>Good deep conditioning product.  </li>
            <li>but then again nothing is a quick fix for all the issues so a good routine is essential.</li>
            <li>It was easier to style, and super shiny without any additional products.</li>
            <li>I should say though that it left my hair feeling okay.  :)</li>
            <li>Mizani Never Fails!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend people try this because it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Others reference the Mizani Consultation Sheet and the Mizani Custom Blend Wheel to assist you with the mixing, but we weren&#x27;t able to obtain these items since we aren&#x27;t professional hair stylists, so we searched the web and found how to mix it..</li>
            <li>My hair did appear more hydrated and felt really soft.</li>
            <li>mostly), my hair felt strong and the shedding had pretty much stopped completely.</li>
            <li>Thanks Mizani!</li>
            <li>I HOPE I WAS HELPFUL! ;-)</li>
            <li>my first trial</li>
            <li>and this was my first time using this product along with the Hyrafuse.  </li>
            <li>My hair is much stronger!</li>
            <li>again nothing unusual but worth</li>
            <li>I used the Aphogee reconstructor first, rinsed, and then did the Mizani Kerafuse for just under 10 minutes, rinsed, then used a ph-balancing conditioner, rinse, and then sprayed organic Aloe JUICE</li>
            <li>Love this product when its mixed the hydrafuse.....</li>
            <li>At first I used Kerafuse by</li>
            <li>I use this first and use the Mizani Moisturefuse Moisturizing Conditioner after.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>My hair was SUPER soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>We will certainly order it again.  </li>
            <li>but it should last a good long while since it&#x27;s not used very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had breakage and really needed some protein.</li>
            <li>I ordered this, along with Mizani&#x27;s Hydrafuse Intense Moisturizing Treatment, to treat my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>How much you use will depend on your hair damage.  </li>
            <li>I wears a lot a weave and don&#x27;t take care of my hair as much as I should.</li>
            <li>I notice my hair does break off as much anymore.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s important, don&#x27;t use aloe GEL), and virgin olive oil and left in on for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I can really feel the difference.</li>
            <li>Intense Strengthening Treatment for Unisex,</li>

            <li>B000VUO8VG H2O Intense Strengthening Night-Time Treatment Unisex by Mizani, 5 Ounce]]and the Oil hair treatment[[ASIN</li>
            <li>wa soo much stronger.</li>
            <li>The reason I think Kerafuse is so good is because it&#x27;s a thick cream.</li>
            <li>My hair became very strong, but a little try.</li>
            <li>Hair is left strong yet soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>I did not sit under a warm dryer as instructed...too anxious to rinse it out being that I used waaay too much product.</li>
            <li>I will keep using it until there is nothing left, from there i will make a full review.</li>
            <li>have been reading about treating hair in an old school way where people will wrap the hair in a hot towel.</li>
            <li>Next time I will mix it with a deep conditioner and probably use another conditioner after that just to be sure I am fully moisturized.</li>
            <li>I did mix it with some other cheap conditioner because I didn&#x27;t want to use too much.</li>
            <li>It &#x27;s very good for african american hair especially when used with other Mizani products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was!!</li>
            <li>Helps your hair stay soft and you can manage it very well and gives your hair strength.</li>
            <li>The combination (also referred to as Custom Blend) of the two products brought new life to her</li>
            <li>Other than that I was already familiar with the goodness of this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided that I want to get serious about taking care of my hair, so I decided, after much research, to do more frequent protein treatments, and moisturize with non-protein moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Her hair was deeply moisturized and really strengthened.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft but I had some intial shedding in the detangling process (which I was hoping to avoid).</li>
            <li>By the time I got to styling my hair (this was a three hour process for me as I am natural...</li>
            <li>My issue was born from not using quality products that address MY issues/hair type rather grabbing whatever I could find given my busy schedule.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can also be used with natural hair oils as a treatment and wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t wow&#x27;d.</li>
            <li>It immediately made my hair soft which lasted days.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageabl</li>
            <li>Fortunately I use aphogee products, so I am able to make my hair look amazing when I need it to, but the the truth is that my hair is horrible without that extreme support and my arsenal of salon-level products.</li>
            <li>product probably shouldn&#x27;t be used on a regular basis as keratin is already a part of your hair structure so adding more on a regular basis can make the hair stiff and brittle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair cells are dead and nothing is going to make them perfect again except cutting them off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very course and dry hair.  </li>
            <li>The color is yellowish, the texture is lightly thick and it does not have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve done the big chop and natural thing</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of the authenticity of this product because the cover was sealed with clear tape (outerlayer) and when i opened the product, like most brand new products the inner layer is always sealed but with this product it was not sealed (innerlayer).</li>
            <li>My hair has always been healthy, but as anyone who has a relaxer knows, it can become dry, weak, brittle and shed tons over time.</li>
            <li>My hair is more dry than weak</li>
            <li>product is thick and takes a little bit more time to absorb than general conditioners or masks which is why giving it time is to work is essential.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using it for nearly three months-every other week after shampooing for the first month and a half, now only once a month for the next 4 months-</li>

            <li> wa soo much stronger.</li>
            <li> The reason I think Kerafuse is so good is because it&#x27;s a thick cream.</li>
            <li> My hair became very strong, but a little try.</li>
            <li> Hair is left strong yet soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I did not sit under a warm dryer as instructed...too anxious to rinse it out being that I used waaay too much product.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it until there is nothing left, from there i will make a full review.</li>
            <li> have been reading about treating hair in an old school way where people will wrap the hair in a hot towel.</li>
            <li> Next time I will mix it with a deep conditioner and probably use another conditioner after that just to be sure I am fully moisturized.</li>
            <li> I did mix it with some other cheap conditioner because I didn&#x27;t want to use too much.</li>
            <li> It &#x27;s very good for african american hair especially when used with other Mizani products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was!!</li>
            <li> Helps your hair stay soft and you can manage it very well and gives your hair strength.</li>
            <li> The combination (also referred to as Custom Blend) of the two products brought new life to her</li>
            <li> Other than that I was already familiar with the goodness of this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided that I want to get serious about taking care of my hair, so I decided, after much research, to do more frequent protein treatments, and moisturize with non-protein moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Her hair was deeply moisturized and really strengthened.  </li>
            <li> My hair was soft but I had some intial shedding in the detangling process (which I was hoping to avoid).</li>
            <li> By the time I got to styling my hair (this was a three hour process for me as I am natural...</li>
            <li> My issue was born from not using quality products that address MY issues/hair type rather grabbing whatever I could find given my busy schedule.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can also be used with natural hair oils as a treatment and wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t wow&#x27;d.</li>
            <li> It immediately made my hair soft which lasted days.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageabl</li>
            <li> Fortunately I use aphogee products, so I am able to make my hair look amazing when I need it to, but the the truth is that my hair is horrible without that extreme support and my arsenal of salon-level products.</li>
            <li> product probably shouldn&#x27;t be used on a regular basis as keratin is already a part of your hair structure so adding more on a regular basis can make the hair stiff and brittle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair cells are dead and nothing is going to make them perfect again except cutting them off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very course and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> The color is yellowish, the texture is lightly thick and it does not have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve done the big chop and natural thing</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the authenticity of this product because the cover was sealed with clear tape (outerlayer) and when i opened the product, like most brand new products the inner layer is always sealed but with this product it was not sealed (innerlayer).</li>
            <li> My hair has always been healthy, but as anyone who has a relaxer knows, it can become dry, weak, brittle and shed tons over time.</li>
            <li> My hair is more dry than weak</li>
            <li> product is thick and takes a little bit more time to absorb than general conditioners or masks which is why giving it time is to work is essential.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using it for nearly three months-every other week after shampooing for the first month and a half, now only once a month for the next 4 months-</li>
            <li> I think it works well - my hair has become stronger in general after using this product, though it&#x27;s usually dryer than normal after use as well.</li>
            <li> I applied the mixture using an application brush, parting in small sections much like applying a perm.</li>
            <li> using a protein intense conditioner has a tendency to leave the hair feeling hard..</li>
            <li> This productis very intense...without a moisturizing conditioner afterwards the hair will become hard and break off in time..    </li>
            <li> since I know I&#x27;m strange about stuff like that.</li>
            <li> You can ensure that it covers ever single strand of your hair</li>
            <li> I even did a single strand test</li>
            <li> I first used it, I made the mistake of using it alone, which just made my hair worse.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m using such a small amount, I know this jar is going to last me a while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only takes a small amount of this product applied after shampoo-especially when mixed with a conditioner.</li>
            <li> You MUST mix it with a very heavy moisturizing conditioner in a 50/50 or 75 (conditioner)/25 (kerafuse) ratio, or else it will destroy your hair and make it very brittle.  </li>
            <li> I have little breakage after using this product and for me that a big deal!</li>
            <li> It felt nice and soft when it was wet, then succeeded in making it greasy and disgusting, but not thicker or stronger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> (She has thick wavy natural hair that has difficulty maintaining moisture).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased kerafuse along with the hydrafuse and mixed the two together, about half and half.</li>
            <li> then as needed likely, my hair is regaining it&#x27;s usual thickness and bounce.</li>
            <li> One issue it that I was being lazy and not using them frequently enough for my level of damage.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a VERY long way.</li>
            <li> and my hair STILL felt a little dry from the protein which means I needed to use less.</li>
            <li> My advice is once the product is rinsed off, follow it with a deep conditioner or a hair mask or else your hair will be hard</li>
            <li> I thought that was odd.</li>
            <li> It feels slightly grainy when you apply it to your hair-</li>
            <li> My ends have been a mess for months</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t repair damage, but it will stop the damage to your hair and facilitate growth (little known fact - damage repair is just a marketing term.  </li>
            <li> Prior to using this product my hair was weak and brittle and on its way to being destroyed.  </li>
            <li> Be carefully when mixing the two products...over using the kerafuse will make your hair hard and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I think the Aphogee formula coats the hair very unevenly, because it&#x27;s so watery/runny, and drips while you&#x27;re trying to dry it into a hard state.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shedding less-a lot less!</li>
            <li> I just decided to try a new protein treatment because I always used aphogee and it stinks and its messy .</li>
            <li> It has a slight smell-nothing off-putting or annoying but worth noting</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so darn messy!</li>
            <li> USUALLY DO THE JOB FOR ME MONTHLY.</li>
            <li> (four small scoops of each product) to cover her head.</li>
            <li> I usually have to follow up with a conditioner and another 30 with a plastic cap on under the dryer for optimal results.</li>
            <li> but no more ends, breakage or dryness.</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair very hard as other protein treatment</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would at least help the damage a little!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very thick with tight coils so a relaxer is a must.</li>
            <li> Little on the expensive side</li>
            <li> When I rinsed it out and blowdryed and styled as usual , there was no more breakage anywhere!!!!.</li>
            <li> My weak, shedding easily broken 4b hair strengthened within minutes.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now past my shoulder because of this product!!</li>
            <li> I HAVE ALWAYS HAD THIN HAIR</li>
            <li> This treatment is a miracle for anyone who has relaxed hair or someone looking to strengthen weak hair!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. My hair is more stronger and softer every time I use it....love it!  Thanks Mizani!</li>
            <li> Great buy! Love this treatment.</li>
            <li> I had breakage and really needed some protein. I am relaxed with 4b/4c hair. I tried Aphogee a couple of times and loved it but it&#x27;s so darn messy! Mizani Kerafuse is a cream so I tried it. It works but it is VERY strong! Next time I will mix it with a deep conditioner and probably use another conditioner after that just to be sure I am fully moisturized. Use some Silicon Mix afterwards and your hair will be bouncing and smooth! So Mizani Kerafuse is great but it&#x27;s very very strong.</li>
            <li> i LOVE THE WAY THIS PRODUCT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL. I ALWAYS MEASURE THE HYDRASE AND KERAFUSE AND MIX IT TOGETHER. 1 PART KERAFUSE AND TWO PARTS HYDRAFUSE USUALLY DO THE JOB FOR ME MONTHLY. I HAVE ALWAYS HAD THIN HAIR BUT MY HAIR IS GETTING THICKIER AND THICKER AS IT GROWS. I HOPE OTHERS ARE GETTING THE SAME EXPERIENCE I HAVE BEEN GETTING WITH THIS PRODUCT.  WHEN YOU ORDER THE PRODUCT FROM AMAZON IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE MEASURING CUP SO I WOULD SUGGEST TO USE 1/3 CUP AND JUST MEASURE IT OUT WITH THAT. IF YOU DO ONE PART KERAFUSE JUS LEVEL OUT 1/3 OF A CUP AND TO USE TWO PARTS HYDRAFUSE JUST DOUBLE THE MEASUREMENTS. I HOPE I WAS HELPFUL! ;-)</li>
            <li> using a protein intense conditioner has a tendency to leave the hair feeling hard..This productis very intense...without a moisturizing conditioner afterwards the hair will become hard and break off in time..    if used correctly, as i have just stated, this product makes quite a difference in the thickness, and texture of the hair...great stuff!</li>
            <li> I ordered this, along with Mizani&#x27;s Hydrafuse Intense Moisturizing Treatment, to treat my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It was breaking AND coming out at the root. No one could figure out the cause, so this was suggested.  After being treated with this mixture in a salon and it&#x27;s immediate results, we decided to purchase some since she would require additional treatments. OMG does it work!!!!  The breakage stopped immediately and nor was the hair coming out at the root any longer.  Her hair was deeply moisturized and really strengthened.  The combination (also referred to as Custom Blend) of the two products brought new life to her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used a equal amount ratio 4:4 (four small scoops of each product) to cover her head. How much you use will depend on your hair damage.  You may need equal parts of each product, like my daughter.  Or, you may require more moisture, or more strength.  Whatever the need is, add the correct product accordingly.  Others reference the Mizani Consultation Sheet and the Mizani Custom Blend Wheel to assist you with the mixing, but we weren&#x27;t able to obtain these items since we aren&#x27;t professional hair stylists, so we searched the web and found how to mix it.. You sit under a warm dryer with a plastic cap on for 10 minutes and believe it or not, 10 minutes is all it takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product and I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s also great when used alone. Just make sure you read all of the directions and apply correctly.  We will certainly order it again.  Great Mizani products!!!</li>
            <li> Helps your hair stay soft and you can manage it very well and gives your hair strength.</li>
            <li> Use the suggested amount. My hair became very strong, but a little try. I would use it again. My hair is now past my shoulder because of this product!!</li>
            <li> The product was delivered in a timely manner. I was skeptical of the authenticity of this product because the cover was sealed with clear tape (outerlayer) and when i opened the product, like most brand new products the inner layer is always sealed but with this product it was not sealed (innerlayer). The color is yellowish, the texture is lightly thick and it does not have a strong smell. It is easy to apply to the hair and it easily rinses off. My advice is once the product is rinsed off, follow it with a deep conditioner or a hair mask or else your hair will be hard (afro textured hair). I&#x27;ve used it twice and i haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in my hair. There is still breakage. I will keep using it until there is nothing left, from there i will make a full review.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes the hair beautifully! Arrived when they said it would!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and as described. Very happy with the service; I would not recommend becuase i have used it couple of times now and still experiencing breakage; it is easy to apply but havent seen the benefits.</li>
            <li> It &#x27;s very good for african american hair especially when used with other Mizani products.</li>
            <li> It might just be me, but this didn&#x27;t help my hair at all. It felt nice and soft when it was wet, then succeeded in making it greasy and disgusting, but not thicker or stronger. I used it correctly, but didn&#x27;t get the results I needed. I was hoping this would at least help the damage a little!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing but CAUTION~!! A little bit goes a VERY long way. I used this protein treatment in conjunction with a moisturizing deep conditioner to get a proper balance and my hair STILL felt a little dry from the protein which means I needed to use less. For reference, I have relaxed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my first trial, I used an even 1/4 cup to 1/4 cup ratio. The next time I use it, I&#x27;m going to try a different moisturizing conditioner with a 2 cup to 1/4 cup ratio and see how that works. Since I&#x27;m using such a small amount, I know this jar is going to last me a while. It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have little breakage after using this product and for me that a big deal! I wears a lot a weave and don&#x27;t take care of my hair as much as I should. When I started using this I notice my hair does break off as much anymore.</li>
            <li> mix with hydrafuse for great conditioning</li>
            <li> It took forever for this product to come, but to be fair it was over the good friday and easter weekend. However it took longer tha na week. Other than that I was already familiar with the goodness of this product</li>
            <li> Mizani Never Fails! I love this product it delivered exactly what it promises! Hair is left strong yet soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without it! Ever.</li>
            <li> An excellent conditioner to combat breakage.</li>
            <li> I give myself a protein treatment every six weeks and this was my first time using this product along with the Hyrafuse.  I prepooed overnight, rinsed, shampooed with my aussie moist shampoo and then I applied my mixture(1 part Kerafuse and 2 parts Hydrafuse) for about 45 minutes with my heat cap and then rinsed out.  WOW!!!! I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was!! It was so soft and shiny and it looked great!  This will definitley be my go to mixture for my protein treatments from now on! This was one of if not the best hair wash day I have ever had!</li>
            <li> very good hair product</li>
            <li> Love this product.. It&#x27;s great for my hair and it smells awesome!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses this product and recommened it to me. I like it. I use it about once a month on my relaxed hair. She mixes it with Mizani Hydrafuse</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It does not make my hair very hard as other protein treatment but I have to put on a good condition to make my hair soft. It is a good treatment. I can get used to it</li>
            <li> I use this product about every 6-8 weeks as a protein/strengthening treatment for my hair.  I think it works well - my hair has become stronger in general after using this product, though it&#x27;s usually dryer than normal after use as well. It won&#x27;t repair damage, but it will stop the damage to your hair and facilitate growth (little known fact - damage repair is just a marketing term.  Hair cells are dead and nothing is going to make them perfect again except cutting them off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used it, I made the mistake of using it alone, which just made my hair worse.  You MUST mix it with a very heavy moisturizing conditioner in a 50/50 or 75 (conditioner)/25 (kerafuse) ratio, or else it will destroy your hair and make it very brittle.  I usually have to follow up with a conditioner and another 30 with a plastic cap on under the dryer for optimal results.</li>
            <li> My weak, shedding easily broken 4b hair strengthened within minutes.  I applied as directed, sat under a steamer, and lo and behold the shedding and breakage STOPPED.  I am so grateful to Mizani.</li>
            <li> I purchased kerafuse along with the hydrafuse and mixed the two together, about half and half. The manufacturer recommends using a Mizani clarifying shampoo before applying the mixture. I did not, but instead used ACV and a sulfate and paraban free shampoo to get my hair squeaky clean. I applied the mixture using an application brush, parting in small sections much like applying a perm. Took about 30-40mins. Anyways, after I applied the mixture, read the instructions and saw where it said to use 2oz of the kerafuse tx. I was like \\&quot;oh s***!\\&quot;. I just knew that I was going to have bald spots in my head by the time I rinsed my hair. I did not sit under a warm dryer as instructed...too anxious to rinse it out being that I used waaay too much product. As luck would have it, my hair turned out okay. I followed up with a humectant conditioner. My hair was soft but I had some intial shedding in the detangling process (which I was hoping to avoid). By the time I got to styling my hair (this was a three hour process for me as I am natural...mostly), my hair felt strong and the shedding had pretty much stopped completely. IMO, to get the best result, this product should be combined with hydrafuse and I recommend following instructions to avoid damaging the hair.</li>
            <li> i like fact that u can mix with hydrafuse and make it a balanced treatment for your hair it&#x27;s a good protein and i begining to fall in love with mizani products</li>
            <li> Great hair treatment.  I Love it.  My hair is much stronger! I think is works best with the intense moisturing treatment.  My hair is much stronger and I am glad I did purchase it.  The only problem, the container does not have a seal.  I thought that was odd.</li>
            <li> I have been seeking a great conditioner got my dry hair and this was good but I will still keep looking for a great one.</li>
            <li> This treatment is a miracle for anyone who has relaxed hair or someone looking to strengthen weak hair! My hair has always been healthy, but as anyone who has a relaxer knows, it can become dry, weak, brittle and shed tons over time. My hair is naturally very thick with tight coils so a relaxer is a must. (I&#x27;ve done the big chop and natural thing and it didn&#x27;t work for me) I&#x27;m not a cosmetologist, but I have been doing hair for over 10 years semi-professionally so I know what I&#x27;m doing. My issue was born from not using quality products that address MY issues/hair type rather grabbing whatever I could find given my busy schedule. So THANK YOU AMAZON for making just about any/everything available :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is thick and takes a little bit more time to absorb than general conditioners or masks which is why giving it time is to work is essential. It has a slight smell-nothing off-putting or annoying but worth noting since I know I&#x27;m strange about stuff like that. It feels slightly grainy when you apply it to your hair-again nothing unusual but worth noting if you&#x27;ve never used anything like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it for nearly three months-every other week after shampooing for the first month and a half, now only once a month for the next 4 months- then as needed likely, my hair is regaining it&#x27;s usual thickness and bounce. It&#x27;s shedding less-a lot less! I also use it on my daughters hair once or twice a months and it helps with her shedding and slip ends. (She has thick wavy natural hair that has difficulty maintaining moisture).&lt;br /&gt;Please note some very important advice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product-if used incorrectly-will do the opposite of what you want which is make your hair brittle and break off!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions or consult a hairdresser if you are unsure about this.&lt;br /&gt;Always use with an intensive conditioner (I always use the Hydrofuse from Mizani along with this)&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a small amount of this product applied after shampoo-especially when mixed with a conditioner. You have to section the hair and apply a small amount at a time to get best results.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I have found that if I apply it and wrap with a plastic cap and allow it to work for 20-30 minutes it works best.&lt;br /&gt;It can also be used with natural hair oils as a treatment and wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;This product probably shouldn&#x27;t be used on a regular basis as keratin is already a part of your hair structure so adding more on a regular basis can make the hair stiff and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons are it&#x27;s expensive-espicially when you purchase with proper conditioner but it should last a good long while since it&#x27;s not used very often.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t provide immediate results after one use but then again nothing is a quick fix for all the issues so a good routine is essential.</li>
            <li> I gave this rating because I love how this made my hair very strong and kept it from breaking off after the chemical process which is very important. I would definitely recommend people try this because it is amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair is so damaged from heat styling and chemical processing, I&#x27;m amazed I can get by with it. Fortunately I use aphogee products, so I am able to make my hair look amazing when I need it to, but the the truth is that my hair is horrible without that extreme support and my arsenal of salon-level products. One issue it that I was being lazy and not using them frequently enough for my level of damage. I&#x27;ve decided that I want to get serious about taking care of my hair, so I decided, after much research, to do more frequent protein treatments, and moisturize with non-protein moisturizers. I used the Aphogee reconstructor first, rinsed, and then did the Mizani Kerafuse for just under 10 minutes, rinsed, then used a ph-balancing conditioner, rinse, and then sprayed organic Aloe JUICE* (that&#x27;s important, don&#x27;t use aloe GEL), and virgin olive oil and left in on for 30 minutes. Rinse with a cleansing conditioner (sulfate free! also important). It&#x27;s a lot of steps, but GOOD GRACIOUS my hair became nearly flawless. I have never felt it this smooth. It was easier to style, and super shiny without any additional products. I can really feel the difference. I will move forward and alternate these two protein treatments. The reason I think Kerafuse is so good is because it&#x27;s a thick cream. You can ensure that it covers ever single strand of your hair and it&#x27;s not as sticky/difficult to work with as Aphogees formula. I think the Aphogee formula coats the hair very unevenly, because it&#x27;s so watery/runny, and drips while you&#x27;re trying to dry it into a hard state. Kerafuse makes me feel like it&#x27;s coming in a filling the areas I missed, and coats the hair evenly.</li>
            <li> my hair dresser loves it and asked me to order one for her. i would recommend  it  to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Love this product when its mixed the hydrafuse.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years because I love what it does for may hair.  I mix it with the Hydrafuse moisturizing treatment for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Great product. Hair is strong and stops shedding after 1 use.</li>
            <li> At first I used Kerafuse by it&#x27;s self. Then I found out it could be mixed with Hydrafuse....together they are a force to be reckoned with. By themselves they are great also but the dual actions at once is amazing!!! I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair. It looks and feels great and I have double processed hair, relaxer and color.

            <li> I too mixed this product with the hydrafuse stuff. To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t blown away by the results like I thought I would. My hair did appear more hydrated and felt really soft. I just wasn&#x27;t wow&#x27;d.</li>
            <li> If you want to strengthen your hair and get back the control that you lost, then this product is for you. Prior to using this product my hair was weak and brittle and on its way to being destroyed.  have been reading about treating hair in an old school way where people will wrap the hair in a hot towel. I did just that. I washed my hair with the milk shampoo and then combined this product with the Mizani moisturefuse conditioner and my goodness after I rinsed it out, my hair wa soo much stronger. Im sticking to this product and treatment.</li>
            <li> I use this about twice a week.  I have very course and dry hair.  It immediately made my hair soft which lasted days.</li>
            <li> Mizani has always been my brand of choice for my hair and ths protein treatment does wonders for my locks. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product over 2 months ago and I must tell you, it is a miracle working product. This with hydrafuse will make your hair feel like silk. If you have problem with your ends you will be in love with this product. I found something that works and I will definitely stick with it. Oh, lots of body and hair breakage to a minimum and eventually none.</li>
            <li> It was sent on time without damage.  The product is okay and smells pleasant,  except I was trying to kind of stay away from mineral oil and petrolatum in my deep conditioners and this one has both right at the top of the list,  so I probably won&#x27;t repurchase.  I should say though that it left my hair feeling okay.  :)</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME!!! I use it as a protein treatment. I mix it with the hydrafuse also for a 2in1 deep condition also. My hair is more dry than weak so I add more hydrafuse the kerafuse. Be carefully when mixing the two products...over using the kerafuse will make your hair hard and lifeless. I sat under the dryer for 10mins as instructed and the results were mind blowing!!! My hair was SUPER soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I just decided to try a new protein treatment because I always used aphogee and it stinks and its messy . I wanted to find something that works just as well and mizani kerafuse is it. I did mix it with some other cheap conditioner because I didn&#x27;t want to use too much. When I rinsed it out and blowdryed and styled as usual , there was no more breakage anywhere!!!!. I even did a single strand test and I couldn&#x27;t even break one strand of hair!! No lye!!mizani left my hair that strong!!!So goodbye Aphogee!!Kerafuse is a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> Definitely would purchase again.  Little on the expensive side but it does make my hair for great afterwards.  I use this first and use the Mizani Moisturefuse Moisturizing Conditioner after.</li>
            <li> Good deep conditioning product.  Leaves hair soft and manageabl</li>
