    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to experiment with your technique to get the best results.</li>
            <li>I use it in between bikini waxings for touch ups, works great!</li>
            <li>Nothing is perfect, so</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It still works perfect.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>The Remington EP6010CDN works great for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, I wanted one and got this one since my hair straightener is remington and works great.</li>
            <li>It works best for me when I have a very light touch; almost like hovering over my skin.</li>
            <li>so I decided to buy this one because it was a good price</li>
            <li>Good thing there is a 30 day guarantee because I plan on returning.</li>
            <li>I just bought this yesterday at Fry&#x27;s for $29.99, it was a really good deal.</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>To conclude, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money.</li>
            <li>so you know your root of each hair had been pulled out which allows a good two weeks until another use is needed.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good for the lower part of my legs.  </li>
            <li>A good tip for first-timers:</li>
            <li>This one is durable, and with the moisture comfort heads does a good job.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing for that area.  </li>
            <li>I think that for this price is a good product, much better than the one I used before it</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this remington isn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for a first time user!!</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, hair removal of any kind doesn&#x27;t feel good, but the Remington works great and especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>After using the battery operated epilator my legs were very smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>The more hair there is, the more it hurts.</li>
            <li>I have owned many epilators over the years.</li>
            <li>Personally, I love epilating.</li>
            <li>smooth as a babies butt!</li>
            <li>More hairs break off with the EP6010CDN.</li>
            <li>But considering that this one cost about a third the price, I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think of this as a shaver, you have to be more patient and go for more strokes and slower as well.   </li>
            <li>This is the thing that bothered me the most.</li>
            <li>, if you are on a budget, this is an OK epilator.</li>
            <li>Its kind of like those cheap tweezers that break the hair instead of ripping it out of the follicle.</li>
            <li>I would gladly pay3 times the amount for this product if I had to but</li>
            <li>Since it pulls most of the hairs out from the root, it&#x27;s made my legs look smoother since you couldn&#x27;t see the darkness of the hair beneath my skin.      </li>
            <li>The best thing about this epilator is that you don&#x27;t need to wait for the hair to grow back to a substantial length before removing it again.</li>
            <li>am using this one more than 2 years now.</li>
            <li>This product does remove some hair, however it mostly breaks the hairs off.</li>
            <li>, I think it is better than waxing because you can take breaks.</li>
            <li>cause I cant wait that long :D</li>
            <li>its easy to clean and handy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male body builder and hair removel is important to look your best.  </li>
            <li>My mom&#x27;s still works great, so old and still takes off most of it, not just chops it.  </li>
            <li>I am a first time epilator-user, and am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I would gladly do so.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful and fantastic job Remington.</li>
            <li>and I have to say, I absolutely without a doubt in my mind love, love just love this Remington Epilator.</li>
            <li>Im sure if I bought one of a higher quality it would work better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that it sometimes doesn&#x27;t actually pluck out some hairs and just cuts them off instead (kind of like shaving), but it plucks out a good number.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>I owned a different remington and it was great</li>
            <li>Do not expect it to ever be pain free.</li>
            <li>This product is very cost effective.</li>
            <li>My skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>The results are fabulous.</li>
            <li>When you find something like this that works as fantastic as this for myself?</li>
            <li>It makes my legs smooth.</li>
            <li>My legs never felt smooth after the Remington.</li>
            <li>Yesterday I returned from my 4 day trip and my legs are still smooth.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work fairly well on my underarms, but I had to go over the same area so many times and STILL did not get all the hairs-</li>
            <li>This product is really good for it&#x27;s price, although it DOES hurt A LOT in some areas, for example, sensitive parts of the legs and underarms.</li>
            <li>It was pretty inexpensive and gets the job done!!</li>
            <li>I am pretty satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Every pore is bright red.</li>
            <li>but overall, the product is good and does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I bought this one solely based on the good reviews that it had, and I&#x27;m back to confirm it&#x27;s efficiency.</li>
            <li>i realy liked but was quite old (6 years or so, but still working).&lt;br /&gt;The pain levels are identical between this remington and the Braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not painful --</li>
            <li>It was about $200 for full body.</li>
            <li>after you are finished apply some aloe vera gel to cool off the area</li>
            <li>There is some pain involved but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>, this one is SO much better; doesn&#x27;t hurt like my old one did and removes the hair easily.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I bought because it had a money-back guarantee just in case</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got it in the mail that I had to try it right away.</li>
            <li>This is my very first epilator ever</li>
            <li>The underarm area is also fairly pain-free, as long as I use it once a week, and the bikini area still hurts a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also for a really good price, but if you want one that will get every single hair, this isn&#x27;t the one for you.  </li>
            <li>, I think it works fine for how much it costs</li>
            <li>In my opinion, its totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to only do it once a week and not have stubble after two days!</li>
            <li>The most sensitive area was my bikini area</li>
            <li>I bought this some time ago and have rarely used it.</li>
            <li>I said, it&#x27;s going to hurt but the results are so worth</li>
            <li>the begining it worked better than it does right now, and isn&#x27;t a year old yet.</li>
            <li>When I first switched it on, the sound was very intimidating.</li>
            <li>Most of the time it pulls out by the root, and I find that the more I use it and familiarize myself with how it works, it breaks hairs less often.</li>
            <li>I have to go over each area many times and there is still hair left.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>I LOVE this epilator, but unfortunately, it only deserves a 4.</li>
            <li>The first time I epilated, I didn&#x27;t do this, and a couple spots on each leg got inflamed, and became like a pimple.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator and after using it for 2-3 times, I found it satisfctory.</li>
            <li>I have owned a similar Epilator that just wore out after many years.  </li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>I have pretty think leg hair</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator that I bought</li>
            <li>First, yes it hurts.</li>
            <li>Overall for the price I&#x27;ve been quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it?</li>
            <li>Think I am pretty set for a while.</li>
            <li>This was my first epilator</li>
            <li>It hurts like heck the first time you do it, but after awhile you get used to it.  </li>
            <li>This was my first</li>
            <li>Then I read to shave the first time exfoliate then epilate.</li>
            <li>exfoliate first</li>
            <li>/&gt;(2) spray the area with a litocane spray for burns from the drug store first before using.</li>
            <li>After your first removal, it&#x27;ll be red for 10 minutes and it might be sore for half an hour but after that, it feels so nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>My favorite is by far the Philips Satin Ice (which I don&#x27;t think is made any longer, so I just put the Satinelle Soft on my wishlist).</li>
            <li>After 24 years of my old Lady Remington epilator (which still works just fine), I thought I&#x27;d get a new one to see if it&#x27;d do a better/quicker job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and haven&#x27;t been able to use it very long.  </li>
            <li>This epilator doesn&#x27;t break the hairs (leaving you with stubble)--it&#x27;s strong enough to grab on and remove them swiftly.</li>
            <li>I still use a depilatory cream to remove fine hair (upper arm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>It worked very well though.</li>
            <li>it felt as if I was pulling too much</li>
            <li>(Tip: When a hair breaks, it makes a popping sound, so if you hear that, try using a different technique.)</li>
            <li>epilator will work for you if you really want it too.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have much hair to begin with.</li>
            <li>I have spent the better part of 15 years trying to find something like this.  </li>
            <li>Also some hairs break and grow faster than others afterwards, but for me is pretty normal, I always had this problem.</li>
            <li>I have very hair forearms and used it on them as well.</li>
            <li>for\\&quot; quote really applies here.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t cordless but works very well without pinching or leaving any marks.  </li>
            <li>The root of each hair is pulled out and you can actually hear a popping sound</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really hurt that much on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>so it looks like I really haven&#x27;t shaved.  </li>
            <li>so I got this one because it is cheap enough.</li>
            <li>My hair grows exceptionally fast</li>
            <li>(I used to shave my underarms daily and still feel prickly because even the sharpest razor couldn&#x27;t give me a perfectly smooth result).</li>
            <li>I tried just using per directions and was in so much pain.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  </li>
            <li>so I vowed never to spend that much again.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this time to get bikini ready (legs, arms, underarms)</li>
            <li>For the price I&#x27;d say is a good deal, especially compared to the time, money, and gas spent on going to a waxer.</li>
            <li>Just got this in the mail yesterday and was so excited to try it, only to be really dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure I could tolerate the extreme pain everyone mentions while using this type of product.</li>
            <li>while with other (better) epilators you will need to pass it twice or three times, tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doing this will make the red dots go away faster, and will clean out your pores.</li>
            <li>and it was so much money and didn&#x27;t last the full vacation.</li>
            <li>pains as much as waxing,so its quite normal.</li>
            <li>and yes it hurt the first couple of times and in sensitive areas</li>
            <li>I bought this epilator mainly because of its price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how often more expensive ones break hair, but for this low price, it works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than waxing, and will save you a ton of money (over salon waxing) in the long run.  </li>
            <li>I do wish it covered more area however, because it took me so freakin long to do my entire body.</li>
            <li>I am buying a new one with 72 tweezers.</li>
            <li>I known that, I would have spent the extra money to get a better model.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The product is not really strong, you need to use it few times over the same area to take the hair off and doesn&#x27;t remove the short ones, but the seller is very understanding and wonderful to deal with.</li>
            <li>the higher speed dosen&#x27;t work well for coarse hair</li>
            <li>This product comes with a small cleaning brush, and is NOT rechargeable:)  </li>
            <li>thing I adamantly advise: ALWAYS soap, scrub, and rinse AFTER epilating!</li>
            <li>Probably the expensive ones are better in many ways and maybe in the future I will get one of those, but for the moment I don&#x27;t think of anything else.</li>
            <li>This product works exceptionally well at removing thick underarm hair if you use the second (faster) setting.</li>
            <li>being I have one only3 months old and another brand new on one on the box unopened...</li>
            <li>Anyway, the Remington EP6010CDN is SLOW and doesn&#x27;t do a good job pulling out hairs unless they are over 1 cm long.</li>
            <li>I have 3-4 days worth of growth on my legs and the device did not pick up a single hair.</li>
            <li>This will clearly show you whether or not you can handle the pain.</li>
            <li>This is the fourth epilator I purchased and it is the least effective.</li>
            <li>It will miss some hairs, and you have to go over the same spots a few times for better results.</li>
            <li>This epilator has similar results as waxing for me, but it takes an hour and a half to do both legs which is kind of long.</li>
            <li>it hurt wayyyyy too much, was only able to do half of my right leg, he next day I did half of my left leg,</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right, but I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s doing much, other than causing me pain.</li>
            <li>I bought mine at Walgreens for $36.00 and believe me the price was and is so worth every single red cent.</li>
            <li>It works very well, and I am always amazed at how short that hairs can be for it to pull out, but it does only break off some hairs at skin-level, not by the root.</li>
            <li>It does take a little practice to get it working well, but once you figure it out, it&#x27;s all worth it.</li>
            <li>My legs stay smooth for at least 2 weeks after use.</li>
            <li>For newbies, don&#x27;t expect it to be pain-free, but after 20 years of epilating I barely feel any pain on my legs anymore.</li>
            <li>Barely removes hair.  </li>
            <li>and when I was done barely any of the hair was removed.</li>
            <li>Removing the hairs does become less painful as time goes on, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li>but during my first session half way through I had no pain.</li>
            <li>If the hair is really fine and short, its hard to remove using this epilator.</li>
            <li>After the initial hair removel, I use it every 3 to 7 days nearly painlessly and look alot younger too.</li>
            <li>This epilator isn&#x27;t quite as good as my previous Remington epilator (sorry can&#x27;t remember the model).</li>
            <li>It works fast and it dose hurt a little bit just like wax.</li>
            <li>wouldnt grab any of my leg hair, only takes out fine thin hair but misses A LOT, i wouldnt recommend this product</li>

            <li> Nothing is perfect, so</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It still works perfect.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> The Remington EP6010CDN works great for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, I wanted one and got this one since my hair straightener is remington and works great.</li>
            <li> It works best for me when I have a very light touch; almost like hovering over my skin.</li>

            <li> She loved it.</li>
            <li> To conclude, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> so you know your root of each hair had been pulled out which allows a good two weeks until another use is needed.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good for the lower part of my legs.  </li>
            <li> A good tip for first-timers:</li>
            <li> This one is durable, and with the moisture comfort heads does a good job.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing for that area.  </li>
            <li> I think that for this price is a good product, much better than the one I used before it</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this remington isn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a first time user!!</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, hair removal of any kind doesn&#x27;t feel good, but the Remington works great and especially for the price.  </li>

            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think of this as a shaver, you have to be more patient and go for more strokes and slower as well.   </li>
            <li> This is the thing that bothered me the most.</li>
            <li> , if you are on a budget, this is an OK epilator.</li>
            <li> Its kind of like those cheap tweezers that break the hair instead of ripping it out of the follicle.</li>
            <li> I would gladly pay3 times the amount for this product if I had to but</li>
            <li> Since it pulls most of the hairs out from the root, it&#x27;s made my legs look smoother since you couldn&#x27;t see the darkness of the hair beneath my skin.      </li>
            <li> The best thing about this epilator is that you don&#x27;t need to wait for the hair to grow back to a substantial length before removing it again.</li>
            <li> am using this one more than 2 years now.</li>
            <li> This product does remove some hair, however it mostly breaks the hairs off.</li>
            <li> , I think it is better than waxing because you can take breaks.</li>
            <li> cause I cant wait that long :D</li>
            <li> its easy to clean and handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male body builder and hair removel is important to look your best.  </li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s still works great, so old and still takes off most of it, not just chops it.  </li>
            <li> I am a first time epilator-user, and am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I would gladly do so.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful and fantastic job Remington.</li>
            <li> and I have to say, I absolutely without a doubt in my mind love, love just love this Remington Epilator.</li>
            <li> Im sure if I bought one of a higher quality it would work better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that it sometimes doesn&#x27;t actually pluck out some hairs and just cuts them off instead (kind of like shaving), but it plucks out a good number.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> I owned a different remington and it was great</li>
            <li> Do not expect it to ever be pain free.</li>
            <li> This product is very cost effective.</li>
            <li> My skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> The results are fabulous.</li>
            <li> When you find something like this that works as fantastic as this for myself?</li>
            <li> It makes my legs smooth.</li>
            <li> My legs never felt smooth after the Remington.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I returned from my 4 day trip and my legs are still smooth.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work fairly well on my underarms, but I had to go over the same area so many times and STILL did not get all the hairs-</li>
            <li> This product is really good for it&#x27;s price, although it DOES hurt A LOT in some areas, for example, sensitive parts of the legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> It was pretty inexpensive and gets the job done!!</li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Every pore is bright red.</li>
            <li> but overall, the product is good and does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this one solely based on the good reviews that it had, and I&#x27;m back to confirm it&#x27;s efficiency.</li>
            <li> i realy liked but was quite old (6 years or so, but still working).&lt;br /&gt;The pain levels are identical between this remington and the Braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not painful --</li>
            <li> It was about $200 for full body.</li>
            <li> after you are finished apply some aloe vera gel to cool off the area</li>
            <li> There is some pain involved but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> , this one is SO much better; doesn&#x27;t hurt like my old one did and removes the hair easily.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I bought because it had a money-back guarantee just in case</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got it in the mail that I had to try it right away.</li>
            <li> This is my very first epilator ever</li>
            <li> The underarm area is also fairly pain-free, as long as I use it once a week, and the bikini area still hurts a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also for a really good price, but if you want one that will get every single hair, this isn&#x27;t the one for you.  </li>
            <li> , I think it works fine for how much it costs</li>
            <li> In my opinion, its totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to only do it once a week and not have stubble after two days!</li>
            <li> The most sensitive area was my bikini area</li>
            <li> I bought this some time ago and have rarely used it.</li>
            <li> I said, it&#x27;s going to hurt but the results are so worth</li>
            <li> the begining it worked better than it does right now, and isn&#x27;t a year old yet.</li>
            <li> When I first switched it on, the sound was very intimidating.</li>
            <li> Most of the time it pulls out by the root, and I find that the more I use it and familiarize myself with how it works, it breaks hairs less often.</li>
            <li> I have to go over each area many times and there is still hair left.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> I LOVE this epilator, but unfortunately, it only deserves a 4.</li>
            <li> The first time I epilated, I didn&#x27;t do this, and a couple spots on each leg got inflamed, and became like a pimple.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and after using it for 2-3 times, I found it satisfctory.</li>
            <li> I have owned a similar Epilator that just wore out after many years.  </li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> I have pretty think leg hair</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator that I bought</li>
            <li> First, yes it hurts.</li>
            <li> Overall for the price I&#x27;ve been quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it?</li>
            <li> Think I am pretty set for a while.</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator</li>
            <li> It hurts like heck the first time you do it, but after awhile you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> This was my first</li>
            <li> Then I read to shave the first time exfoliate then epilate.</li>
            <li> exfoliate first</li>
            <li> /&gt;(2) spray the area with a litocane spray for burns from the drug store first before using.</li>
            <li> After your first removal, it&#x27;ll be red for 10 minutes and it might be sore for half an hour but after that, it feels so nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> My favorite is by far the Philips Satin Ice (which I don&#x27;t think is made any longer, so I just put the Satinelle Soft on my wishlist).</li>
            <li> After 24 years of my old Lady Remington epilator (which still works just fine), I thought I&#x27;d get a new one to see if it&#x27;d do a better/quicker job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and haven&#x27;t been able to use it very long.  </li>
            <li> This epilator doesn&#x27;t break the hairs (leaving you with stubble)--it&#x27;s strong enough to grab on and remove them swiftly.</li>
            <li> I still use a depilatory cream to remove fine hair (upper arm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> It worked very well though.</li>
            <li> it felt as if I was pulling too much</li>
            <li> (Tip: When a hair breaks, it makes a popping sound, so if you hear that, try using a different technique.)</li>
            <li> epilator will work for you if you really want it too.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have much hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> I have spent the better part of 15 years trying to find something like this.  </li>
            <li> Also some hairs break and grow faster than others afterwards, but for me is pretty normal, I always had this problem.</li>
            <li> I have very hair forearms and used it on them as well.</li>
            <li> for\\&quot; quote really applies here.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t cordless but works very well without pinching or leaving any marks.  </li>
            <li> The root of each hair is pulled out and you can actually hear a popping sound</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really hurt that much on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> so it looks like I really haven&#x27;t shaved.  </li>
            <li> so I got this one because it is cheap enough.</li>
            <li> My hair grows exceptionally fast</li>
            <li> (I used to shave my underarms daily and still feel prickly because even the sharpest razor couldn&#x27;t give me a perfectly smooth result).</li>
            <li> I tried just using per directions and was in so much pain.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  </li>
            <li> so I vowed never to spend that much again.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this time to get bikini ready (legs, arms, underarms)</li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;d say is a good deal, especially compared to the time, money, and gas spent on going to a waxer.</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail yesterday and was so excited to try it, only to be really dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure I could tolerate the extreme pain everyone mentions while using this type of product.</li>
            <li> while with other (better) epilators you will need to pass it twice or three times, tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doing this will make the red dots go away faster, and will clean out your pores.</li>
            <li> and it was so much money and didn&#x27;t last the full vacation.</li>
            <li> pains as much as waxing,so its quite normal.</li>
            <li> and yes it hurt the first couple of times and in sensitive areas</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator mainly because of its price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how often more expensive ones break hair, but for this low price, it works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than waxing, and will save you a ton of money (over salon waxing) in the long run.  </li>
            <li> I do wish it covered more area however, because it took me so freakin long to do my entire body.</li>
            <li> I am buying a new one with 72 tweezers.</li>
            <li> I known that, I would have spent the extra money to get a better model.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The product is not really strong, you need to use it few times over the same area to take the hair off and doesn&#x27;t remove the short ones, but the seller is very understanding and wonderful to deal with.</li>
            <li> the higher speed dosen&#x27;t work well for coarse hair</li>
            <li> This product comes with a small cleaning brush, and is NOT rechargeable:)  </li>
            <li> thing I adamantly advise: ALWAYS soap, scrub, and rinse AFTER epilating!</li>
            <li> Probably the expensive ones are better in many ways and maybe in the future I will get one of those, but for the moment I don&#x27;t think of anything else.</li>
            <li> This product works exceptionally well at removing thick underarm hair if you use the second (faster) setting.</li>
            <li> being I have one only3 months old and another brand new on one on the box unopened...</li>
            <li> Anyway, the Remington EP6010CDN is SLOW and doesn&#x27;t do a good job pulling out hairs unless they are over 1 cm long.</li>
            <li> I have 3-4 days worth of growth on my legs and the device did not pick up a single hair.</li>
            <li> This will clearly show you whether or not you can handle the pain.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth epilator I purchased and it is the least effective.</li>
            <li> It will miss some hairs, and you have to go over the same spots a few times for better results.</li>
            <li> This epilator has similar results as waxing for me, but it takes an hour and a half to do both legs which is kind of long.</li>
            <li> it hurt wayyyyy too much, was only able to do half of my right leg, he next day I did half of my left leg,</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right, but I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s doing much, other than causing me pain.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Walgreens for $36.00 and believe me the price was and is so worth every single red cent.</li>
            <li> It works very well, and I am always amazed at how short that hairs can be for it to pull out, but it does only break off some hairs at skin-level, not by the root.</li>
            <li> It does take a little practice to get it working well, but once you figure it out, it&#x27;s all worth it.</li>
            <li> My legs stay smooth for at least 2 weeks after use.</li>
            <li> For newbies, don&#x27;t expect it to be pain-free, but after 20 years of epilating I barely feel any pain on my legs anymore.</li>
            <li> Barely removes hair.  </li>
            <li> and when I was done barely any of the hair was removed.</li>
            <li> Removing the hairs does become less painful as time goes on, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> but during my first session half way through I had no pain.</li>
            <li> If the hair is really fine and short, its hard to remove using this epilator.</li>
            <li> After the initial hair removel, I use it every 3 to 7 days nearly painlessly and look alot younger too.</li>
            <li> This epilator isn&#x27;t quite as good as my previous Remington epilator (sorry can&#x27;t remember the model).</li>
            <li> It works fast and it dose hurt a little bit just like wax.</li>
            <li> wouldnt grab any of my leg hair, only takes out fine thin hair but misses A LOT, i wouldnt recommend this product</li>
            <li> On high speed though, typically 1 treatment every 1 to 2 weeks is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad after the first time, and I stay smooth for weeks--as opposed to a couple hours on a bad day, or until the next morning on a good day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have patience, some hairs may not be long enough to get grabbed by the machine.  </li>
            <li> Only be sure to apply ice/ cold water after you epilate and apply some moisturizing cream after that.</li>
            <li> This is not comfortable at all and definitely not for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Pick a weekend afternoon when you are doing anything because it&#x27;s going to take at least an hour or two depending on how much area you plan to use it on.</li>
            <li> and I can see long term results.</li>
            <li> Soon as I am done using this on myself, I scrub all areas I have used this on and I have absolutely NO itching, no red bumps and no scarring</li>
            <li> I previously had another Remington epilator that was confusingly also called Smooth and Silky, but both times I purchased it, it broke a few years later.</li>
            <li> She told me that even though she had just shaved the week before, it managed to get even the little tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> From a little above my ankles to about halfway up my calve/shin area,you can always see the hair follicle beneath my skin</li>
            <li> This morning both of my underarms are completely inflamed to say the least.</li>
            <li> Because it has that curve it makes it a bit harder to remove the hair sometimes.</li>
            <li> This one you CANNOT get wet.  </li>
            <li> and it got only a few hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have to wait a few days to pick up the teeny tiny ones</li>
            <li> Also the two speeds are kind of worthless  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my back and stomach hair and, while not perfect, it&#x27;s certainly cheaper and less painful than waxing and wayyy better all around than shaving.</li>
            <li> The more you use it the less painful it will be.</li>
            <li> you shave, and not sure if you&#x27;ll like epilating, I DEFINITELY would suggest this one.</li>
            <li> Does create some bumps from ingrown hairs and would like a solution to that, but other than that</li>
            <li> Being I never tried anything close to this other then waxing...</li>
            <li> I used it every other day because of hair growth cycles.</li>
            <li> The tweezers don&#x27;t close even or hard enough, everytime</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, it still hurt but not as bad as the first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive, so if you turn out hating it, it doesn&#x27;t matter that much.</li>
            <li> Once you get past that it does last for a few week, but you definatley have to keep going with it.</li>
            <li> My mom has had hers for at least 15 years, but hers is a different brand,</li>
            <li> I only use it on the lower half of my legs (below the knees) and it takes me at least one hour to epilate using this subpar machine.  </li>
            <li> I tried going up, down, in circles ...</li>
            <li> Hurts a lot less than waxing and is wayyyyyyy cheaper.  </li>
            <li> after that it hurts less.</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week and find that it takes less and less time each week.</li>
            <li> This product removes some hair but leaves a lot behind, will also pull in skin if not careful.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a little scared...   </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is the model that replaced my old one.</li>
            <li> yes, some hair is going to get left behind.  </li>
            <li> Not comfortable in any way, shape or form.</li>
            <li> Unlike cheaper epilators, this one actually works instead of just striping my skin off and levaing the hair behind.  </li>
            <li> it hurts, I have to do it in sections over a span of a few days.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on it.</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes once again...</li>
            <li> Basically it was a waste</li>
            <li> So, its alright, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it hurt so bad</li>
            <li> Its pretty painful</li>
            <li> but I figured it would be similar to tweezing, waxing or even threading, boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> but I usually just shave it off</li>
            <li> After a month I noticed my hairs were growing thin and not fast.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small epilation to do my face and decided to try the battery operated (small device) on my legs after using the Remington.</li>
            <li> but it hurts no more than waxing and to tell you the truth</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no need to buy one of the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> This sucks.</li>
            <li> Because I use this epilator slowly and in all directions...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Received this item and not happy with it at all.  </li>
            <li> Also, follow the directions, and use the slower speed for thinner hair; the faster speed can break thin hair.</li>
            <li> There are 2 speeds but the low speed is worthless.</li>
            <li> And I thought the epilator couldn&#x27;t be any worse.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure how painful it&#x27;ll be for you, try using a tweezer on a couple of hairs before using the epilator.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry I did.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy an expensive one, since I had never used one before.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not entirely impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong?</li>
            <li> I had another expensive one</li>
            <li> With this one unfortunately you will end up with a lot of chopped hairs and very few epilated areas :(</li>
            <li> Hold an ice-pack to the area for about 10sec to numb the area.</li>
            <li> It will numb the area.&lt;br /&gt;(3)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just the sensation of having hair pulled, which if you&#x27;re used to it should not be too bad.</li>
            <li> really bad product, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried on underarm area yet because I heard it was painful</li>

            <li> This is the fourth epilator I purchased and it is the least effective. I have to go over each area many times and there is still hair left. I previously had another Remington epilator that was confusingly also called Smooth and Silky, but both times I purchased it, it broke a few years later. It worked very well though. For newbies, don&#x27;t expect it to be pain-free, but after 20 years of epilating I barely feel any pain on my legs anymore. The underarm area is also fairly pain-free, as long as I use it once a week, and the bikini area still hurts a lot. The more hair there is, the more it hurts.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and I&#x27;m very disappointed with it. I&#x27;m a big Remington fan so I decided to buy this one because it was a good price and I thought it would work well but I was wrong. Because it has that curve it makes it a bit harder to remove the hair sometimes. Its pretty painful and it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair. I had to go over my legs a number of times and there were still strays left. Good thing there is a 30 day guarantee because I plan on returning.</li>
            <li> Received this item and not happy with it at all.  Cheap plastic.  Barely removes hair.  I owned a different remington and it was great so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  Sorry I did.  Unfortunately this is the model that replaced my old one.</li>
            <li> I have owned many epilators over the years. My favorite is by far the Philips Satin Ice (which I don&#x27;t think is made any longer, so I just put the Satinelle Soft on my wishlist). Anyway, the Remington EP6010CDN is SLOW and doesn&#x27;t do a good job pulling out hairs unless they are over 1 cm long. I only use it on the lower half of my legs (below the knees) and it takes me at least one hour to epilate using this subpar machine.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I just bought this yesterday at Fry&#x27;s for $29.99, it was a really good deal. I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before but I figured it would be similar to tweezing, waxing or even threading, boy was I wrong. This is not comfortable at all and definitely not for people with sensitive skin it felt as if I was pulling too much and when I was done barely any of the hair was removed. Also the two speeds are kind of worthless  the higher speed dosen&#x27;t work well for coarse hair ( I have really coarse hair). Luckily, I bought because it had a money-back guarantee just in case I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy an expensive one, since I had never used one before. I wanted to make sure I could tolerate the extreme pain everyone mentions while using this type of product. This product comes with a small cleaning brush, and is NOT rechargeable:)  When I first switched it on, the sound was very intimidating. I was basically scared of it lol. It took me forever to get the courage to actually try it out. Now I can use it on my arms and legs and it is tolerable, and I use the highest speed. Do not expect it to ever be pain free. It will miss some hairs, and you have to go over the same spots a few times for better results. It takes a while for the hairs to grow back after this process, I&#x27;d say about a week for me. I have not regretted purchasing this product, and would purchase again if something happened to my current one. There is absolutely no need to buy one of the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> This product is very cost effective. I am a first time epilator-user, and am very satisfied with this product. I LOVE this epilator, but unfortunately, it only deserves a 4. It works very well, and I am always amazed at how short that hairs can be for it to pull out, but it does only break off some hairs at skin-level, not by the root. Most of the time it pulls out by the root, and I find that the more I use it and familiarize myself with how it works, it breaks hairs less often. Also, follow the directions, and use the slower speed for thinner hair; the faster speed can break thin hair. (Tip: When a hair breaks, it makes a popping sound, so if you hear that, try using a different technique.) I don&#x27;t know how often more expensive ones break hair, but for this low price, it works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shave, and not sure if you&#x27;ll like epilating, I DEFINITELY would suggest this one. It&#x27;s not too expensive, so if you turn out hating it, it doesn&#x27;t matter that much. Personally, I love epilating. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad after the first time, and I stay smooth for weeks--as opposed to a couple hours on a bad day, or until the next morning on a good day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I adamantly advise: ALWAYS soap, scrub, and rinse AFTER epilating! Doing this will make the red dots go away faster, and will clean out your pores. The first time I epilated, I didn&#x27;t do this, and a couple spots on each leg got inflamed, and became like a pimple. I think it&#x27;s because when the epilator pulls out the hair, it pulls out the follicle also, and if you don&#x27;t scrub afterwards, the follicle can stay there and irritate the pore for days. The worst spots even scarred, so scrub afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator will work for you if you really want it too. It takes some getting used to, and you have to get past the first couple of times before you decide to quit. Don&#x27;t hesitate to experiment with your technique to get the best results.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and after using it for 2-3 times, I found it satisfctory. I don&#x27;t know what moisture comfort technology means but overall, the product is good and does what its supposed to do. It takes time to remove the hair and removes not all but almost all hair. pains as much as waxing,so its quite normal. its easy to clean and handy. In my opinion, its totally worth the money. Only be sure to apply ice/ cold water after you epilate and apply some moisturizing cream after that.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece because she kept borrowing the epilator I had. She loved it. She told me that even though she had just shaved the week before, it managed to get even the little tiny hairs. I bought this one solely based on the good reviews that it had, and I&#x27;m back to confirm it&#x27;s efficiency. Thank you to all those who take the time to review these products.</li>
            <li> There was no mention in the Description of this product on the Amazon page that it was not to be used on the face, which was the reason for purchasing it.  Buried in the instructions that came with this product, GUESS WHAT!  You got it.  Not to be used on the face!  Oversight or intentional I have no idea but if you are looking for an Epilator to use on the face, keep looking when you get to this one.</li>
            <li> I have owned a similar Epilator that just wore out after many years.  I have to say, this one is SO much better; doesn&#x27;t hurt like my old one did and removes the hair easily. Let&#x27;s be honest, hair removal of any kind doesn&#x27;t feel good, but the Remington works great and especially for the price.  I highly recommend it.  I use mine for bikini hair and my husbands hair on his ears....smooth as a babies butt!</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail yesterday and was so excited to try it, only to be really dissapointed. It seemed to work fairly well on my underarms, but I had to go over the same area so many times and STILL did not get all the hairs- and I don&#x27;t have much hair to begin with. This morning both of my underarms are completely inflamed to say the least. Every pore is bright red. Further, this device will NOT work on my legs. I have 3-4 days worth of growth on my legs and the device did not pick up a single hair. I&#x27;m shipping this thing out for a refund immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male body builder and hair removel is important to look your best.  The Remington EP6010CDN works great for that purpose.  After the initial hair removel, I use it every 3 to 7 days nearly painlessly and look alot younger too.</li>
            <li> The product is not really strong, you need to use it few times over the same area to take the hair off and doesn&#x27;t remove the short ones, but the seller is very understanding and wonderful to deal with. I will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This epilator isn&#x27;t quite as good as my previous Remington epilator (sorry can&#x27;t remember the model). More hairs break off with the EP6010CDN. But considering that this one cost about a third the price, I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;And even though some hairs break, it still gets a majority by the root. There are 2 speeds but the low speed is worthless. On high speed though, typically 1 treatment every 1 to 2 weeks is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a first time user!! It was pretty inexpensive and gets the job done!! You get used to the pain after a couple of uses. I use it in between bikini waxings for touch ups, works great! My legs stay smooth for at least 2 weeks after use. Haven&#x27;t tried on underarm area yet because I heard it was painful and I&#x27;m a little scared...   Does create some bumps from ingrown hairs and would like a solution to that, but other than that, I think it works fine for how much it costs</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator today.  Well the description on this site and the actual product are different.  This one you CANNOT get wet.  Nothing is perfect, so yes, some hair is going to get left behind.  Also have to go over the same area over and over. Have patience, some hairs may not be long enough to get grabbed by the machine.  Pain level, tolerable. Not comfortable in any way, shape or form. For the price I&#x27;d say is a good deal, especially compared to the time, money, and gas spent on going to a waxer.</li>
            <li> I have spent the better part of 15 years trying to find something like this.  Unlike cheaper epilators, this one actually works instead of just striping my skin off and levaing the hair behind.  Hurts a lot less than waxing and is wayyyyyyy cheaper.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got it in the mail that I had to try it right away. it hurt wayyyyy too much, was only able to do half of my right leg, he next day I did half of my left leg, the next day I did the rest of my legs. after that it hurts less. I use it once a week and I love it</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied. This is my first epilator and I think the price is ridiculously low. Just think of all the technology, work and materials.   It does the job. Don&#x27;t think of this as a shaver, you have to be more patient and go for more strokes and slower as well.   Probably the expensive ones are better in many ways and maybe in the future I will get one of those, but for the moment I don&#x27;t think of anything else.</li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied with this product. My hair is thinner now, so I think it does its job. I have pretty think leg hair so I expect my hair to start growing in a week even after waxing. This epilator has similar results as waxing for me, but it takes an hour and a half to do both legs which is kind of long. Also some hairs break and grow faster than others afterwards, but for me is pretty normal, I always had this problem. I think that for this price is a good product, much better than the one I used before it and I can see long term results.</li>
            <li> After 24 years of my old Lady Remington epilator (which still works just fine), I thought I&#x27;d get a new one to see if it&#x27;d do a better/quicker job.  This thing didn&#x27;t work at all.  I tried going up, down, in circles ... and it got only a few hairs.  My leg skin was sore from the fruitless rubbing of the epilator by the time I finally gave up.  This thing is going back.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind that its not chargeable. My skin so smooth. I have to wait a few days to pick up the teeny tiny ones but I usually just shave it off cause I cant wait that long :D</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator that I bought and I&#x27;m not entirely impressed. Im sure if I bought one of a higher quality it would work better. First, yes it hurts. Of course it hurts. You are pulling hair our of your body. Second, this takes time. It is a process. Because of the pain, I by the way have legs that are never waxed so to me it hurts, I have to do it in sections over a span of a few days. It also just is not big enough to go faster. Third, it doesn&#x27;t always grab the hair and sometimes it just cuts it. This is the thing that bothered me the most. It would take a week for me to get all the hair in one area because it would keep growing back where the hair was just cut. Once you get past that it does last for a few week, but you definatley have to keep going with it. So, its alright, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator mainly because of its price.&lt;br /&gt;I had a Braun Silk-epil before that which i realy liked but was quite old (6 years or so, but still working).&lt;br /&gt;The pain levels are identical between this remington and the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;However, this remington isn&#x27;t as effective. You will manage to remove all the unwanted hair, but you will need to pass the epilator over and over and over and over [...] and over till it gets the job done. while with other (better) epilators you will need to pass it twice or three times, tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get the job done, but you need to plan an extra 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Had I known that, I would have spent the extra money to get a better model.&lt;br /&gt;But, if you are on a budget, this is an OK epilator.</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator about three weeks ago. The results are fabulous. It does take a little practice to get it working well, but once you figure it out, it&#x27;s all worth it. It works best for me when I have a very light touch; almost like hovering over my skin. My legs have never been smoother and there is no stubbly re-growth. I use it about once a week and find that it takes less and less time each week. There is some pain involved but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  I have very hair forearms and used it on them as well. It&#x27;s so nice to only do it once a week and not have stubble after two days! I&#x27;ll never shave again.</li>
            <li> From what I understand, an epilator is supposed to rip the hair from the follicle. This just ripped the hair, left it in the follicle.  Its kind of like those cheap tweezers that break the hair instead of ripping it out of the follicle. This sucks. I&#x27;m sad I wasted my money on it. I guess the \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; quote really applies here. Its not too painful but, the sensation this gives you, you&#x27;d expect the follicle being ripped out. Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong? I don&#x27;t know. But I won&#x27;t be recommending this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Forget the fact that it says it&#x27;s for women. I bought this for my back and stomach hair and, while not perfect, it&#x27;s certainly cheaper and less painful than waxing and wayyy better all around than shaving. It&#x27;s true that it sometimes doesn&#x27;t actually pluck out some hairs and just cuts them off instead (kind of like shaving), but it plucks out a good number. It&#x27;s definitely not painful -- it&#x27;s just the sensation of having hair pulled, which if you&#x27;re used to it should not be too bad. Overall for the price I&#x27;ve been quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product is really good for it&#x27;s price, although it DOES hurt A LOT in some areas, for example, sensitive parts of the legs and underarms. To conclude, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money. Shame it isn&#x27;t cordless but works very well without pinching or leaving any marks.  Recommended</li>
            <li> This is my very first epilator ever and I have to say, I absolutely without a doubt in my mind love, love just love this Remington Epilator. I bought mine at Walgreens for $36.00 and believe me the price was and is so worth every single red cent. Being I never tried anything close to this other then waxing... I will admit I was some what a tad nervous.  The first time I used it? On a scale of 1-10. The pain was around a 6 but during my first session half way through I had no pain. ZERO. I use under my arms, on the front of my arms, legs under my chin and on my bikini area.  The most sensitive area was my bikini area but after a few minutes once again... Zero pain. I have been using this now for 3 months and have only had to use it in total 6 times. Soon as I am done using this on myself, I scrub all areas I have used this on and I have absolutely NO itching, no red bumps and no scarring what so ever. Because I use this epilator slowly and in all directions... The root of each hair is pulled out and you can actually hear a popping sound so you know your root of each hair had been pulled out which allows a good two weeks until another use is needed. I bought a second one to always have on hand as a backup. When you find something like this that works as fantastic as this for myself? You want to stick with it. I would gladly pay3 times the amount for this product if I had to but being I have one only3 months old and another brand new on one on the box unopened... Think I am pretty set for a while. If I could rate this10 stars? I would gladly do so.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful and fantastic job Remington. We&#x27;ll done!!!</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator so I decided to go with a cheaper one.  I found this one at Walgreens for $24.  It works well enough.  It definitely only cuts some hair, but you can feel when it actually pulls the hair out.  I&#x27;ve never waxed before but it didn&#x27;t really hurt that much on my arms and legs.  It hurt like a mother though, on my bikini area that I just stopped and shaved instead.      But it&#x27;s good for the lower part of my legs.  From a little above my ankles to about halfway up my calve/shin area,you can always see the hair follicle beneath my skin so it looks like I really haven&#x27;t shaved.  This thing is amazing for that area.  Since it pulls most of the hairs out from the root, it&#x27;s made my legs look smoother since you couldn&#x27;t see the darkness of the hair beneath my skin.      This one also isn&#x27;t as loud as I expected it to be.  It&#x27;s quieter than my electric razor.  It&#x27;s also for a really good price, but if you want one that will get every single hair, this isn&#x27;t the one for you.  But I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I use this epilator on my under arms and bikini area.  It gets rid of all of the hair and it doesn&#x27;t grow back for a while.  It hurts like heck the first time you do it, but after awhile you get used to it.  It actually doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than waxing, and will save you a ton of money (over salon waxing) in the long run.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all when you use it on your legs.</li>
            <li> My mom has had hers for at least 15 years, but hers is a different brand, jeez...can&#x27;t remember, anyway, I wanted one too, so I got this one because it is cheap enough. Silk epil, that&#x27;s the one my mom&#x27;s been using for the last 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I wanted one and got this one since my hair straightener is remington and works great. This is, this epilator kinda works and winda doesn&#x27;t. The tweezers don&#x27;t close even or hard enough, everytime I use it I end up with short hairs instead of no hair. Not everytime though and sometimes depends on the length, but still.  My mom&#x27;s still works great, so old and still takes off most of it, not just chops it.  With this one unfortunately you will end up with a lot of chopped hairs and very few epilated areas :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the begining it worked better than it does right now, and isn&#x27;t a year old yet.</li>
            <li> This product works exceptionally well at removing thick underarm hair if you use the second (faster) setting. The best thing about this epilator is that you don&#x27;t need to wait for the hair to grow back to a substantial length before removing it again. My hair grows exceptionally fast (I used to shave my underarms daily and still feel prickly because even the sharpest razor couldn&#x27;t give me a perfectly smooth result). This epilator doesn&#x27;t break the hairs (leaving you with stubble)--it&#x27;s strong enough to grab on and remove them swiftly. I would recommend this to anyone!  A good tip for first-timers: Hold an ice-pack to the area for about 10sec to numb the area. Then wipe off any moisture from the icepack with a cloth before proceeding to remove. If you&#x27;re not sure how painful it&#x27;ll be for you, try using a tweezer on a couple of hairs before using the epilator. This will clearly show you whether or not you can handle the pain. After your first removal, it&#x27;ll be red for 10 minutes and it might be sore for half an hour but after that, it feels so nice and smooth! Removing the hairs does become less painful as time goes on, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Not upset with my purchase at all. This was my first and yes it hurt the first couple of times and in sensitive areas but after a while you get used to it. I tried just using per directions and was in so much pain. Then I read to shave the first time exfoliate then epilate. I used it every other day because of hair growth cycles. After a month I noticed my hairs were growing thin and not fast. I even went two weeks without shaving which is unheard of for me.</li>
            <li> I am saving a lot of money these days by using epilator at home instead of going to salon for waxing. If the hair is really fine and short, its hard to remove using this epilator. I haven&#x27;t used another product to compare this to. I still use a depilatory cream to remove fine hair (upper arm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 2/3/2014 I kept removing the cord after using and ended up having a problem. It will not work continuously. It starts and stops and I have to keep adjusting it to work. I guess I should have kept the cord attached always. I bought Philips HP6401 Satinelle Epilator to replace this. Now that I can compare this product to something, In my opinion Philips HP6401 is faster in removing hair than this product.</li>
            <li> My friends recommended this epilator for me. I had another expensive one but it did not worked in the us because of valtage difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this one more than 2 years now. It still works perfect. It makes my legs smooth. and you can even moisture and use it.</li>
            <li> really bad product, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> wouldnt grab any of my leg hair, only takes out fine thin hair but misses A LOT, i wouldnt recommend this product</li>
            <li> This product removes some hair but leaves a lot behind, will also pull in skin if not careful. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used epilators before. This one is durable, and with the moisture comfort heads does a good job. A person does, however, have to get used to the pulling of hair out.</li>
            <li> This product does remove some hair, however it mostly breaks the hairs off. I purchased a small epilation to do my face and decided to try the battery operated (small device) on my legs after using the Remington. My legs never felt smooth after the Remington. After using the battery operated epilator my legs were very smooth to the touch. I am buying a new one with 72 tweezers. Save your money here.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I bought this some time ago and have rarely used it. It&#x27;s made well, so why? It HURTS! haha</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and haven&#x27;t been able to use it very long.  Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right, but I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s doing much, other than causing me pain.</li>
            <li> Im a Italian male crossdresser.  It removes hair off my entire face. It works fast and it dose hurt a little bit just like wax. But like what they always say pain is Beauty. The more you use it the less painful it will be. I Will Never Shave Again. Thank You.</li>
            <li> Purchased for the misses.  She likes it so I do as well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because every time I went to  the beautician,  I had to have my upper lip waxed.  And I thought the epilator couldn&#x27;t be any worse.  It took a bit of practice,  but I leaned to stretch the skin a bit and it doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  I&#x27;d rather do this than pay 10 bucks to the beautician.  Delivery was quick.  I use it every week or two.</li>
            <li> So I bought this epilator from Walgreens. The first time I used it, it hurt so bad I didn&#x27;t think I would ever use it again. The second time I used it, it still hurt but not as bad as the first. I was getting ready to go on vacay to vegas and didn&#x27;t want to have to shave everyday. The last vacay I went on I had waxing done and it was so much money and didn&#x27;t last the full vacation. Basically it was a waste so I vowed never to spend that much again. It was about $200 for full body. Anyway, this time to get bikini ready (legs, arms, underarms) I decided to go with this. I&#x27;m not going to lie, it hurts like a muther ****** but it hurts no more than waxing and to tell you the truth, I think it is better than waxing because you can take breaks. Yesterday I returned from my 4 day trip and my legs are still smooth. I have not needed to shave yet. So far I am very happy with the results. Here are some tips on what I used:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) exfoliate first so you don&#x27;t get in grown hairs. Also, exfoliate after as well.&lt;br /&gt;(2) spray the area with a litocane spray for burns from the drug store first before using. It will numb the area.&lt;br /&gt;(3) after you are finished apply some aloe vera gel to cool off the area&lt;br /&gt;(4) take some tylenol or aspirin before you begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it&#x27;s going to hurt but the results are so worth it considering the amount of money you will save. I do wish it covered more area however, because it took me so freakin long to do my entire body. Pick a weekend afternoon when you are doing anything because it&#x27;s going to take at least an hour or two depending on how much area you plan to use it on.</li>
