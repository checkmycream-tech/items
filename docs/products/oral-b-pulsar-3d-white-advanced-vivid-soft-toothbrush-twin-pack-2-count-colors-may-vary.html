    <ol>

            <li>This Teme is great!</li>
            <li>Cleans great!</li>
            <li>The price is wonderful</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s perfect for the 6 month window.  </li>
            <li>One of the best toothbush i ever used in my life.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect reminder.</li>
            <li>Eventually, I will cave and buy one, but for now this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I am using the excellent [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Very good product--really cleans and massages too/</li>
            <li>in good health!</li>
            <li>Great and 5 stars until the installed battery dies, 1 star after I changed battery and found the toothbrush no longer vibrates.</li>
            <li>It is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My friend buy this product and says it&#x27;s great quality, and she loves it and may want to buy again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a great travel alternative to the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Great seller, will use again.</li>
            <li>This is one great invention I look forward to brushing my teeth these days.</li>
            <li>Great his and her package or 6 month supply for one person since I guess you are supposed to change toothbrushes every 3 months.  </li>
            <li>The battery dies between 2 1/2 to 3 months, which is great since you are supposed to change toothbrushes every three months.</li>
            <li>Works great and for some od reason makes you want to brush longer for about 3 mins.</li>
            <li>And, as I say, the lightness is really great for travel.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush</li>
            <li>I am not a dentist, but my dentist says this is a great brush</li>
            <li>Great product and price</li>
            <li>/&gt;VERY happy with this.  </li>
            <li>They are great to take on a trip.  </li>
            <li>and it is great for traveling instead of the rechargeable one</li>
            <li>More than a very good price!</li>
            <li>Most of all very good for gum care  Would recommend for quality and price.</li>
            <li>And I think this toothbrush does a good job . . .</li>
            <li>good on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>we know they&#x27;re doing a good job.</li>
            <li>I hope you will be a good deal.</li>
            <li>has good life -  </li>
            <li>It is nicely shaped and the pulsar works great.</li>
            <li>Good battery powered brush.  </li>
            <li>They are reasonably good.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are actually surprisingly good.</li>
            <li>These are disposable, good toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>these folks did good with deliver.....</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is good, cleans well and has good feeling.</li>
            <li>Then it dawned on me that, for travel, they are perfect because they are light and effective.</li>
            <li>This is a very interesting toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes, they do a great job cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush to pieces!</li>
            <li>My favorite tooth brushes!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>We love these!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>does a great job for easy brushing</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they made a brush like this that you could replace the battery and brush head on.</li>
            <li>and I consider it cost effective vs products with replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>the vibrating is nice until it stops working (3 weeks after i purchased it).</li>
            <li>It feels good on my teeth and gums so far, but not everything that feels good is good for the body.</li>
            <li>The price is perfect for placing this as a subscribe-and-save item on a four-month cycle to replace the brushes as frequently</li>
            <li>Considering that the cheapest replacement brush heads for the most popular powered brush run at around $15, the ~$8 cost for this product makes sense to me.</li>
            <li>Smooth with optimum efficiency.</li>
            <li>These look great and were such a great price.  </li>
            <li>These toothbruses feel so good when you clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>great set, priced right, with the fine Oral-B reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Huge difference!  </li>
            <li>I love the way the toothbrush works.</li>
            <li>I love the Pulsar toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These do a better job.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I order these every 3 months for me and my wife and we love them.</li>
            <li>I thought to buy more.</li>
            <li>but now seek out for sale to buy more supplies.</li>
            <li>My favorite tb  </li>
            <li>and I feel these do a better job than those.</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful on my gums and actually helps with my morning sinus problems.</li>
            <li>TRY IT :-)</li>
            <li>If you get 6 or more items in a delivery, you get 15% off instead of 5%.  </li>
            <li>This has to be the next best thing to having an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>but I got used to it now. :)</li>
            <li>Because it vibrates, it stimulates blood flow in your gums, and healthy gums make for healthy teeth.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothbrush</li>
            <li>I know what to expect from companies that I know, and P&amp;G offers a good product, good promotions, and backs everything they make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buy some more when you run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a much better buy than if you were to purchase it from Target, Wal-Mart, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of electric toothbrushes since they do most of the work</li>
            <li>this is my favorite toothbrush...</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li>Do not hesitate to get the top notch in toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>so I thought Amazon might have something better...</li>
            <li>Your teeth do feel very clean after you use it.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel squeky clean after brushing with this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>Your mouth feels really clean after you use them-definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I love the Oral B Pulsar for the fantastic job it does.</li>
            <li>I love this item and the multi colors available.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise good toothbrush with fast delivery</li>
            <li>I am brand loyal to P&amp;G because their products are outstanding and their customer service is even better.</li>
            <li>These tooth brushes are easy to use and do not require any charging.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to pack for travel.</li>
            <li>Easy cleaning of the roof of the mouth and tongue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how clean my teeth feel after using it and how it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my gums.  </li>
            <li>They are not helping you clean more</li>
            <li>The vibration is strong and rapid and when you&#x27;re done you can&#x27;t help but run your tongue over your teeth to feel the smoothness.</li>
            <li>Cost was a good deal compared to the normal 6 or 7 dollars per brush.</li>
            <li>Bought one in the grocery store first, liked it, so I added it to my subscription.  </li>
            <li>batteries can&#x27;t be changed otherwise works fine.</li>
            <li>The rest have all been fine, though.</li>
            <li>Worked fine while it worked.</li>
            <li>me, this is one of the great advances of the 21st century.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes would have been great for the price, except the battery in mine only lasted 6 or 7 weeks.</li>
            <li>Oral B makes a great brush and these have that bit extra.</li>
            <li>My favourite, I use 3 years, not rigid, comfortable.</li>
            <li>Cheap electric toothbrushes, indeed.</li>
            <li>In fact, the toothbrush does use a AAA battery and the handle unscrews so that the battery is accessible.</li>
            <li>I love them, ever since I first used, never changed to anything else.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any significant whitening going on.  </li>
            <li>Anyone familiar with these toothbrushes knows you can&#x27;t replace the battery after they die.</li>
            <li>I have a clean sweep rechargeable brush at home</li>
            <li>but they work like they&#x27;re supposed to and get teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Will it clean your teeth as well as the Braun or Philips electric models?</li>
            <li>These are usually the only toothbrushes I will buy, really good deal from Amazon, they get your teeth so clean and are great for cleaning your gums and tongue combined with a tongue scraper, I love the tongue cleaners on this toothbrush</li>
            <li>It works great, it feels like it works harder with the pulsing.</li>
            <li>Good for only two weeks.</li>
            <li>By the time I pay for one of these every three months (as recommended by dentist) plus batteries, I&#x27;m rapidly approaching the cost of a good rechargeable.</li>
            <li>good deal for 2 pulsars especially through subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>They get my teeth super clean feeling</li>
            <li>the handle feels nice and the bristles aren&#x27;t too soft.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li>Buy two packs of these when theres a good deal or promotion, and four packs of Crest 3D White and every time you run out of toothpaste, throw away a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and fresh every time i finish brushing.</li>
            <li>This item was packaged well, is exactly what I wanted, arrived on time and is performing fine.</li>
            <li>, I brush quickly and immediately turn it off before I rinse my mouth and rinse the residual toothpaste from the brush.  </li>
            <li>But if you want an electric toothbrush to travel with, I was very pleased with this one from a mobile &amp;#34;good enough for the road!&amp;#34; perspective.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and fits into my hand very well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and gentle on the mouth.</li>
            <li>I have braces, so these are great for fishing out the little food pieces that like to hide in and around the wires and between teeth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on a fancy electric toothbrush system but after having been told by a friend that she rarely had plaque since using a &#x27;sonic&#x27; brush, I bought one of these toothbrushes at the store.  </li>
            <li>So we all have these tooth brushes but with our initials marked in sharpie on them :-)</li>
            <li>Nice simple well made toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>So far I am enjoying this toothbrush and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>The brush is immediately available in the places I&#x27;m most likely to need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like it has to be doing a better job of brushing my teeth than my old toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Two wins for the price of one.</li>
            <li>hard&amp;#34; if you use the right bristle texture.</li>
            <li>Oral-B, the right choice to take care of your teeth</li>
            <li>This is my first Soft style purchase, I read they are better for your teeth.  </li>
            <li>They used to be good, I had one from years ago that was still working but threw it out because the bristles wore down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good but have only been using for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Could probably get similar toothbrushes from a generic brand but for what you get, these are great toothbrushes and do exactly what you expect them to do.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve got this on Subscribe &amp; Save and over all like them very much.</li>
            <li>As far as cleaning, our teeth feel cleaner and look fine</li>
            <li>The kids are all excited to get new toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>the vibrating motion makes cleaning a whole lot fun.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Pretty wasteful.</li>
            <li>These are the only toothbrushes we use, we love them.</li>
            <li>I actually like this one better, we are on a subscription with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Ever since I use the first one years ago I now have to have them.</li>
            <li>I really like!</li>
            <li>- Reaches all parts of the mouth - Cleans better than regular toothbrush - Battery</li>
            <li>This tooth brush cleans your teeth better than a regular one.</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I like these quite a bit better than the Colgate MaxWhite toothbrush, which is similar.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>The short battery life prompted me to go to look at the packaging which was in my drawer with the remaining tooth brush and examine it more closely.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to last more than 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Just be  aware that the battery is not replaceable and lasts about 3 months pet brush.</li>
            <li>These brushes are everything you could ask for; They are comfortable, and I really feel a deep clean.</li>
            <li>and they wore out brand new ones just as quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say they don&#x27;t feel too soft, so I still feel they clean well.  </li>
            <li>So, as surprised as I am, this is an easy five star recommendation, and particularly so for the traveler.</li>
            <li>but they wear out pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Its angled head makes it easy to reach the back of my teeth and</li>
            <li>but please Oral B put a decent battery in it!</li>
            <li>The little plastic thingys in the head are amazing at getting the plague in-between your teeth.</li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush, and this is the fourth or fifth set of these toothbrushes I&#x27;ve bought, however this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever seen a pack where the two toothbrushes in the pack were EXACTLY THE SAME!  </li>
            <li>We both really like them</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li>The battery starts running out after about 3 months, but that is really when you should replace anyways.</li>
            <li>On the package it does say that it &amp;#34;vibrates&amp;#34; and really thats ALL that it does.</li>
            <li>I like the whitening aspect also since it is gentle on gums and enamel.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Lasts about 4-6 months depending how much you use</li>
            <li>One hint though, shop around and don&#x27;t pay too much.  </li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t really brush &amp;#</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using mine for six months (admittedly not as much as I should) and haven&#x27;t needed to replace the battery yet.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes, but you have to be careful not to go at your teeth too aggressively with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work like an electric brush but are much cheaper and lighter weight.  </li>
            <li>, I think it cleans teeth very well</li>
            <li>It should at least give a good buzz for the 3-4 months I need from a toothbrush</li>
            <li>have owned some mid-range toothbrushes with the removable heads, but honestly, the design of a toothbrush is simply not meant to last forever.</li>
            <li>The head on these Pulsars is smaller and the bristles are soft, so it&#x27;s working better for me.</li>
            <li>In addition, the power decreases on the battery so quickly that while it may still turn on, it barely &amp;#34;pulses&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>If you have higher priced items in your order, spending a little more on these little items still puts you over the top, so you actually save more money on the stuff you normally buy.</li>
            <li>Very soft and gentle!  </li>
            <li>my manual to get the same squeaky clean feel.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, nothing a piece of tape to mark my toothbrush apart from my girlfriend&#x27;s can&#x27;t solve, but still, a minor inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>My only reason for not giving it top rating was that the bristles didn&#x27;t seem quite &#x27;soft&#x27; as marked on the package.</li>
            <li>They are guaranteed to last about 3 months, which holds true.</li>
            <li>If you have a moderately short trip or vacation, say, less than a month, this toothbrush will do a more than adequate job without you having to carry your electric toothbrush, it&#x27;s holder, and it&#x27;s recharger, not to mention the brush head itself ...</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t turn themselves on in the bag like older models.</li>
            <li>This is toothbrush bloat and the supposed vibrating bristles (the ones that have enough contact to actually vibrate which many do not)</li>
            <li>This last batch wore out quickly</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>So this brush is not more efficient than a regular toothbrush and doesn&#x27;t help clean your mouth any more than normally.</li>
            <li>Although it is great to have the opportunity to have this double Oral-B Pulsar on save and subscribe and auto-delivery,  I am one of the unfortunate customers who got the &amp;#34;almost dead&amp;#34; battery in my first shipment!</li>
            <li>The soft bristles and gentle vibration</li>
            <li>rarely do the batteries in this product last 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased these tooth brushes in the local pharmacy in the past and the batteries lasted a good 2-3 months, these purchased on Amazon lasted 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>This one was more than I expected for a very small electric toothbrush, and I was fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>For the price, when the batteries die I&#x27;ll just get new ones.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>i know its time to change a new toothbrush...</li>
            <li>The soft bristles are gentle on gums while the soft vibration adds to the cleaning power.  </li>
            <li>suitable for ppl like me...when the battery is down (last ard 3 mth)...</li>
            <li>Over time, using it every day, my teeth started getting very sensitive</li>
            <li>I am very conscious of conserving the battery</li>
            <li>The brush and batteries last about the same amount of time, then you toss it out and start with a clean new one.</li>
            <li>They last longer than I thought they would, too (my first one lasted almost 4 months, was used twice a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These new ones however don&#x27;t last more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li>good quality, there&#x27;s no more other things need to say.</li>
            <li>This one little light item will do it all.</li>
            <li>So I looked them up on prime and this 2 pack is only a little more than I would pay for one at the store.</li>
            <li>I am brand loyal (in this case to Proctor &amp; Gamble), so I have to confess that I am extremely biased.</li>
            <li>It needs to be clearly labeled &amp;</li>
            <li>I would absolutely come back when I need to refill.</li>
            <li>I guess I received old ones, will have to complain.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>I had a $50 sonic toothbrush but the bristles were too soft.  </li>
            <li>your dental professional prefers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Please remember to remove the battery for recycling before discarding your old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You should be able to get at least 3 months out of these brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and I like this because I have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>could cause this problem until I started reading product reviews here by people suffering from sensitive</li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>Also, you can&#x27;t replace the old battery.  </li>
            <li>However I like the massaging action on my gums.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not terribly worse, either, if you take a little time and use the right technique.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I could have bought a plain toothbrush for less, but that&#x27;s what I have now that it doesn&#x27;t pulsate.  </li>
            <li>and I had to get special toothpaste if I hoped to be able to eat anything cold.</li>
            <li>and you will see a major difference.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Crest 3d white Glamorous white teeth whitening Vibrant Mint Toothpaste and it really helps them get white within 1 month total time.</li>
            <li>As a dentist, I generally recommend Oral B products.</li>
            <li>The pulsating action is barely noticeable, and the battery in mine starting dying after about three uses.</li>
            <li>I wonder if not enough care is taken in rating &#x27;soft&#x27; vs &#x27;medium&#x27; and maybe I got &#x27;medium&#x27; in my package.</li>
            <li>Batteries don&#x27;t last forever, bristles don&#x27;t last forever, and I really don&#x27;t want to shove the same piece of plastic in my mouth for a decade.</li>
            <li>This last order was shipped with a batch that contained old batteries.  </li>
            <li>We have those Sonicare toothbrushes, but you can&#x27;t take the battery out of the Sonicare, which could be incredibly embarrassing when flying but also inconvenient if they get turned on in the suitcase and wear down the rechargeable battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are usually good toothbrushes but my most recent shipment was worthless because the batteries were already dead when the package arrived.</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re not as bulky as other electric toothbrushes, and they&#x27;re much quieter.  </li>
            <li>The built-in battery on these things runs for at least a month or more with regular twice-a-day use (maybe longer), and the button mechanism is well built to keep the internal components sealed away from water (there is no need to worry about getting the toothbrush totally wet, because it is completely sealed).</li>
            <li>but when you go from using one of these to a regular brush (or when the battery dies on one of these) you feel like you&#x27;re barely cleaning your teeth at all.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve had years to fix that, but now someone else comes along with a brush that does the same thing and is made of soft rubber/plastic and is the same size as a normal toothbrush, and when the battery finally dies can be used as a conventional toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>US$9 for half a year is consider reasonable i guess</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product will order again</li>
            <li> I will probably not order them from amazon, but the product is awesome.</li>
            <li> This Teme is great!</li>
            <li> Cleans great!</li>
            <li> The price is wonderful</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s perfect for the 6 month window.  </li>
            <li> One of the best toothbush i ever used in my life.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect reminder.</li>
            <li> Eventually, I will cave and buy one, but for now this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I am using the excellent [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good product--really cleans and massages too/</li>
            <li> in good health!</li>
            <li> Great and 5 stars until the installed battery dies, 1 star after I changed battery and found the toothbrush no longer vibrates.</li>
            <li> It is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My friend buy this product and says it&#x27;s great quality, and she loves it and may want to buy again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are a great travel alternative to the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Great seller, will use again.</li>
            <li> This is one great invention I look forward to brushing my teeth these days.</li>
            <li> Great his and her package or 6 month supply for one person since I guess you are supposed to change toothbrushes every 3 months.  </li>
            <li> The battery dies between 2 1/2 to 3 months, which is great since you are supposed to change toothbrushes every three months.</li>
            <li> Works great and for some od reason makes you want to brush longer for about 3 mins.</li>
            <li> And, as I say, the lightness is really great for travel.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush</li>
            <li> I am not a dentist, but my dentist says this is a great brush</li>
            <li> Great product and price</li>
            <li> /&gt;VERY happy with this.  </li>
            <li> They are great to take on a trip.  </li>
            <li> and it is great for traveling instead of the rechargeable one</li>
            <li> More than a very good price!</li>
            <li> Most of all very good for gum care  Would recommend for quality and price.</li>
            <li> And I think this toothbrush does a good job . . .</li>
            <li> good on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> we know they&#x27;re doing a good job.</li>
            <li> I hope you will be a good deal.</li>
            <li> has good life -  </li>
            <li> It is nicely shaped and the pulsar works great.</li>
            <li> Good battery powered brush.  </li>
            <li> They are reasonably good.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are actually surprisingly good.</li>
            <li> These are disposable, good toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> these folks did good with deliver.....</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is good, cleans well and has good feeling.</li>
            <li> Then it dawned on me that, for travel, they are perfect because they are light and effective.</li>
            <li> This is a very interesting toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes, they do a great job cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush to pieces!</li>
            <li> My favorite tooth brushes!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> We love these!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> does a great job for easy brushing</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they made a brush like this that you could replace the battery and brush head on.</li>
            <li> and I consider it cost effective vs products with replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> the vibrating is nice until it stops working (3 weeks after i purchased it).</li>
            <li> It feels good on my teeth and gums so far, but not everything that feels good is good for the body.</li>
            <li> The price is perfect for placing this as a subscribe-and-save item on a four-month cycle to replace the brushes as frequently</li>
            <li> Considering that the cheapest replacement brush heads for the most popular powered brush run at around $15, the ~$8 cost for this product makes sense to me.</li>
            <li> Smooth with optimum efficiency.</li>
            <li> These look great and were such a great price.  </li>
            <li> These toothbruses feel so good when you clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> great set, priced right, with the fine Oral-B reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Huge difference!  </li>
            <li> I love the way the toothbrush works.</li>
            <li> I love the Pulsar toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These do a better job.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I order these every 3 months for me and my wife and we love them.</li>
            <li> I thought to buy more.</li>
            <li> but now seek out for sale to buy more supplies.</li>
            <li> My favorite tb  </li>
            <li> and I feel these do a better job than those.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful on my gums and actually helps with my morning sinus problems.</li>
            <li> TRY IT :-)</li>
            <li> If you get 6 or more items in a delivery, you get 15% off instead of 5%.  </li>
            <li> This has to be the next best thing to having an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> but I got used to it now. :)</li>
            <li> Because it vibrates, it stimulates blood flow in your gums, and healthy gums make for healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothbrush</li>
            <li> I know what to expect from companies that I know, and P&amp;G offers a good product, good promotions, and backs everything they make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buy some more when you run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a much better buy than if you were to purchase it from Target, Wal-Mart, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of electric toothbrushes since they do most of the work</li>
            <li> this is my favorite toothbrush...</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li> Do not hesitate to get the top notch in toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> so I thought Amazon might have something better...</li>
            <li> Your teeth do feel very clean after you use it.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel squeky clean after brushing with this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Your mouth feels really clean after you use them-definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the Oral B Pulsar for the fantastic job it does.</li>
            <li> I love this item and the multi colors available.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise good toothbrush with fast delivery</li>
            <li> I am brand loyal to P&amp;G because their products are outstanding and their customer service is even better.</li>
            <li> These tooth brushes are easy to use and do not require any charging.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to pack for travel.</li>
            <li> Easy cleaning of the roof of the mouth and tongue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how clean my teeth feel after using it and how it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my gums.  </li>
            <li> They are not helping you clean more</li>
            <li> The vibration is strong and rapid and when you&#x27;re done you can&#x27;t help but run your tongue over your teeth to feel the smoothness.</li>
            <li> Cost was a good deal compared to the normal 6 or 7 dollars per brush.</li>
            <li> Bought one in the grocery store first, liked it, so I added it to my subscription.  </li>
            <li> batteries can&#x27;t be changed otherwise works fine.</li>
            <li> The rest have all been fine, though.</li>
            <li> Worked fine while it worked.</li>
            <li> me, this is one of the great advances of the 21st century.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrushes would have been great for the price, except the battery in mine only lasted 6 or 7 weeks.</li>
            <li> Oral B makes a great brush and these have that bit extra.</li>
            <li> My favourite, I use 3 years, not rigid, comfortable.</li>
            <li> Cheap electric toothbrushes, indeed.</li>
            <li> In fact, the toothbrush does use a AAA battery and the handle unscrews so that the battery is accessible.</li>
            <li> I love them, ever since I first used, never changed to anything else.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any significant whitening going on.  </li>
            <li> Anyone familiar with these toothbrushes knows you can&#x27;t replace the battery after they die.</li>
            <li> I have a clean sweep rechargeable brush at home</li>
            <li> but they work like they&#x27;re supposed to and get teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Will it clean your teeth as well as the Braun or Philips electric models?</li>
            <li> These are usually the only toothbrushes I will buy, really good deal from Amazon, they get your teeth so clean and are great for cleaning your gums and tongue combined with a tongue scraper, I love the tongue cleaners on this toothbrush</li>
            <li> It works great, it feels like it works harder with the pulsing.</li>
            <li> Good for only two weeks.</li>
            <li> By the time I pay for one of these every three months (as recommended by dentist) plus batteries, I&#x27;m rapidly approaching the cost of a good rechargeable.</li>
            <li> good deal for 2 pulsars especially through subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> They get my teeth super clean feeling</li>
            <li> the handle feels nice and the bristles aren&#x27;t too soft.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li> Buy two packs of these when theres a good deal or promotion, and four packs of Crest 3D White and every time you run out of toothpaste, throw away a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I feel clean and fresh every time i finish brushing.</li>
            <li> This item was packaged well, is exactly what I wanted, arrived on time and is performing fine.</li>
            <li> , I brush quickly and immediately turn it off before I rinse my mouth and rinse the residual toothpaste from the brush.  </li>
            <li> But if you want an electric toothbrush to travel with, I was very pleased with this one from a mobile &amp;#34;good enough for the road!&amp;#34; perspective.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and fits into my hand very well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and gentle on the mouth.</li>
            <li> I have braces, so these are great for fishing out the little food pieces that like to hide in and around the wires and between teeth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on a fancy electric toothbrush system but after having been told by a friend that she rarely had plaque since using a &#x27;sonic&#x27; brush, I bought one of these toothbrushes at the store.  </li>
            <li> So we all have these tooth brushes but with our initials marked in sharpie on them :-)</li>
            <li> Nice simple well made toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> So far I am enjoying this toothbrush and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The brush is immediately available in the places I&#x27;m most likely to need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like it has to be doing a better job of brushing my teeth than my old toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Two wins for the price of one.</li>
            <li> hard&amp;#34; if you use the right bristle texture.</li>
            <li> Oral-B, the right choice to take care of your teeth</li>
            <li> This is my first Soft style purchase, I read they are better for your teeth.  </li>
            <li> They used to be good, I had one from years ago that was still working but threw it out because the bristles wore down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good but have only been using for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Could probably get similar toothbrushes from a generic brand but for what you get, these are great toothbrushes and do exactly what you expect them to do.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve got this on Subscribe &amp; Save and over all like them very much.</li>
            <li> As far as cleaning, our teeth feel cleaner and look fine</li>
            <li> The kids are all excited to get new toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> the vibrating motion makes cleaning a whole lot fun.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Pretty wasteful.</li>
            <li> These are the only toothbrushes we use, we love them.</li>
            <li> I actually like this one better, we are on a subscription with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Ever since I use the first one years ago I now have to have them.</li>
            <li> I really like!</li>
            <li> - Reaches all parts of the mouth - Cleans better than regular toothbrush - Battery</li>
            <li> This tooth brush cleans your teeth better than a regular one.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I like these quite a bit better than the Colgate MaxWhite toothbrush, which is similar.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> The short battery life prompted me to go to look at the packaging which was in my drawer with the remaining tooth brush and examine it more closely.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to last more than 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Just be  aware that the battery is not replaceable and lasts about 3 months pet brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are everything you could ask for; They are comfortable, and I really feel a deep clean.</li>
            <li> and they wore out brand new ones just as quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say they don&#x27;t feel too soft, so I still feel they clean well.  </li>
            <li> So, as surprised as I am, this is an easy five star recommendation, and particularly so for the traveler.</li>
            <li> but they wear out pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Its angled head makes it easy to reach the back of my teeth and</li>
            <li> but please Oral B put a decent battery in it!</li>
            <li> The little plastic thingys in the head are amazing at getting the plague in-between your teeth.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush, and this is the fourth or fifth set of these toothbrushes I&#x27;ve bought, however this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever seen a pack where the two toothbrushes in the pack were EXACTLY THE SAME!  </li>
            <li> We both really like them</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li> The battery starts running out after about 3 months, but that is really when you should replace anyways.</li>
            <li> On the package it does say that it &amp;#34;vibrates&amp;#34; and really thats ALL that it does.</li>
            <li> I like the whitening aspect also since it is gentle on gums and enamel.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Lasts about 4-6 months depending how much you use</li>
            <li> One hint though, shop around and don&#x27;t pay too much.  </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t really brush &amp;#</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for six months (admittedly not as much as I should) and haven&#x27;t needed to replace the battery yet.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes, but you have to be careful not to go at your teeth too aggressively with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work like an electric brush but are much cheaper and lighter weight.  </li>
            <li> , I think it cleans teeth very well</li>
            <li> It should at least give a good buzz for the 3-4 months I need from a toothbrush</li>
            <li> have owned some mid-range toothbrushes with the removable heads, but honestly, the design of a toothbrush is simply not meant to last forever.</li>
            <li> The head on these Pulsars is smaller and the bristles are soft, so it&#x27;s working better for me.</li>
            <li> In addition, the power decreases on the battery so quickly that while it may still turn on, it barely &amp;#34;pulses&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> If you have higher priced items in your order, spending a little more on these little items still puts you over the top, so you actually save more money on the stuff you normally buy.</li>
            <li> Very soft and gentle!  </li>
            <li> my manual to get the same squeaky clean feel.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, nothing a piece of tape to mark my toothbrush apart from my girlfriend&#x27;s can&#x27;t solve, but still, a minor inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> My only reason for not giving it top rating was that the bristles didn&#x27;t seem quite &#x27;soft&#x27; as marked on the package.</li>
            <li> They are guaranteed to last about 3 months, which holds true.</li>
            <li> If you have a moderately short trip or vacation, say, less than a month, this toothbrush will do a more than adequate job without you having to carry your electric toothbrush, it&#x27;s holder, and it&#x27;s recharger, not to mention the brush head itself ...</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t turn themselves on in the bag like older models.</li>
            <li> This is toothbrush bloat and the supposed vibrating bristles (the ones that have enough contact to actually vibrate which many do not)</li>
            <li> This last batch wore out quickly</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> So this brush is not more efficient than a regular toothbrush and doesn&#x27;t help clean your mouth any more than normally.</li>
            <li> Although it is great to have the opportunity to have this double Oral-B Pulsar on save and subscribe and auto-delivery,  I am one of the unfortunate customers who got the &amp;#34;almost dead&amp;#34; battery in my first shipment!</li>
            <li> The soft bristles and gentle vibration</li>
            <li> rarely do the batteries in this product last 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased these tooth brushes in the local pharmacy in the past and the batteries lasted a good 2-3 months, these purchased on Amazon lasted 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This one was more than I expected for a very small electric toothbrush, and I was fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> For the price, when the batteries die I&#x27;ll just get new ones.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> i know its time to change a new toothbrush...</li>
            <li> The soft bristles are gentle on gums while the soft vibration adds to the cleaning power.  </li>
            <li> suitable for ppl like me...when the battery is down (last ard 3 mth)...</li>
            <li> Over time, using it every day, my teeth started getting very sensitive</li>
            <li> I am very conscious of conserving the battery</li>
            <li> The brush and batteries last about the same amount of time, then you toss it out and start with a clean new one.</li>
            <li> They last longer than I thought they would, too (my first one lasted almost 4 months, was used twice a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These new ones however don&#x27;t last more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> good quality, there&#x27;s no more other things need to say.</li>
            <li> This one little light item will do it all.</li>
            <li> So I looked them up on prime and this 2 pack is only a little more than I would pay for one at the store.</li>
            <li> I am brand loyal (in this case to Proctor &amp; Gamble), so I have to confess that I am extremely biased.</li>
            <li> It needs to be clearly labeled &amp;</li>
            <li> I would absolutely come back when I need to refill.</li>
            <li> I guess I received old ones, will have to complain.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> I had a $50 sonic toothbrush but the bristles were too soft.  </li>
            <li> your dental professional prefers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please remember to remove the battery for recycling before discarding your old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You should be able to get at least 3 months out of these brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and I like this because I have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> could cause this problem until I started reading product reviews here by people suffering from sensitive</li>
            <li> I was surprised.</li>
            <li> Also, you can&#x27;t replace the old battery.  </li>
            <li> However I like the massaging action on my gums.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not terribly worse, either, if you take a little time and use the right technique.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I could have bought a plain toothbrush for less, but that&#x27;s what I have now that it doesn&#x27;t pulsate.  </li>
            <li> and I had to get special toothpaste if I hoped to be able to eat anything cold.</li>
            <li> and you will see a major difference.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Crest 3d white Glamorous white teeth whitening Vibrant Mint Toothpaste and it really helps them get white within 1 month total time.</li>
            <li> As a dentist, I generally recommend Oral B products.</li>
            <li> The pulsating action is barely noticeable, and the battery in mine starting dying after about three uses.</li>
            <li> I wonder if not enough care is taken in rating &#x27;soft&#x27; vs &#x27;medium&#x27; and maybe I got &#x27;medium&#x27; in my package.</li>
            <li> Batteries don&#x27;t last forever, bristles don&#x27;t last forever, and I really don&#x27;t want to shove the same piece of plastic in my mouth for a decade.</li>
            <li> This last order was shipped with a batch that contained old batteries.  </li>
            <li> We have those Sonicare toothbrushes, but you can&#x27;t take the battery out of the Sonicare, which could be incredibly embarrassing when flying but also inconvenient if they get turned on in the suitcase and wear down the rechargeable battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are usually good toothbrushes but my most recent shipment was worthless because the batteries were already dead when the package arrived.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re not as bulky as other electric toothbrushes, and they&#x27;re much quieter.  </li>
            <li> The built-in battery on these things runs for at least a month or more with regular twice-a-day use (maybe longer), and the button mechanism is well built to keep the internal components sealed away from water (there is no need to worry about getting the toothbrush totally wet, because it is completely sealed).</li>
            <li> but when you go from using one of these to a regular brush (or when the battery dies on one of these) you feel like you&#x27;re barely cleaning your teeth at all.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve had years to fix that, but now someone else comes along with a brush that does the same thing and is made of soft rubber/plastic and is the same size as a normal toothbrush, and when the battery finally dies can be used as a conventional toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> US$9 for half a year is consider reasonable i guess</li>
            <li> The battery last longer than the toothbrush, we usually will take the old one and use it in the kitchen when we swap them out for a new brush.</li>
            <li> I could get it to work if I held a new battery in place and the end cap off, but I couldn&#x27;t get the contact to stay down if I screwed it shut again.</li>
            <li> I change it on new once in 3 months (the recommendation of the dentist), but the half of year  will works well</li>
            <li> and the battery is already low &amp; almost dead (with normal twice per day brushing).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these particular versions for a few years.</li>
            <li> The dentist has been very complimentary about our oral health in the past few years so</li>
            <li> The company is aware of the thousands of customers that have given negative comments about this, yet they still have not made the battery replaceable.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last terribly long though, and it&#x27;s hit or miss how long they last.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse for too long and battery starting dying.</li>
            <li> Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t buy toothbrushes online, but since I needed them, and was already ordering a few things, I thought, why not.</li>
            <li> To have to spend roughly $8 every month to buy a new brush is not a good value and is very wasteful, both monetarily and for the environment.</li>
            <li> Bought this - and not a few weeks later the battery was dead.  </li>
            <li> I did that with one of these, making it pretty useless because it would bend open when I brushed, but a dot of superglue carefully applied fixed it.</li>
            <li> We also travel often and they&#x27;re way easier to transport than some older models I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been cleaner and in fact, despite my continued high candy intake and soft teeth, my cavities have decreased as well.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the merchandise had been around too long before it was sold...</li>
            <li> I like using a Pulsar toothbrush, with its motorized bristles and plaque-busting paddles, but the one I had before was larger and had harder bristles.</li>
            <li> I also visited the Oral-B website and strangely this tooth brush received 63 reviews and was rated 2.5 starts out of 5 stars , yet on Amazon it is a 4 star product.  </li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t owned them that long).  </li>
            <li> Very strange.  </li>
            <li> Some last a few months, some last a month.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical that they were anything other than a gimmick, but upon trying them, was pleasantly surprised at</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist asked what I changed when I started using these, it actually took her less time to finish the cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I only wish the bristles were a bit less sparse.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little big</li>
            <li> Five stars for the product, minus one for the inconvenience.</li>
            <li> These were exactly as expected, I think for the price they are on par.</li>
            <li> In short, when the battery is dead you cannot use it with pulsing anymore.</li>
            <li> so I guess it is not a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My biggest criticism, and as others have mentioned, is the short life of the battery and no easy way to replace it, although if you are determined, you can get it done.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thing I would caution you about is not to press down too hard when you are brushing, for the reasons above but also because you can break open the toothbrush&#x27;s casing.</li>
            <li> I just feel bad that you throw the whole thing away every time you need a new one..</li>
            <li> Not worth the $10 I spent....</li>
            <li> Really a dumb and ineffective gimmick to charge extra for a battery and a simple motor.  </li>
            <li> I like this product due to the feeling it gives me</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re very careful you can replace the battery</li>
            <li> The toothbrush usually lasts 3 months but this last one ran out of juice in less than a month.  </li>
            <li> Add to this that I unfortunately do not brush each night because I have a bad habit of falling asleep and waking up the next morning on the sofa.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle of sending</li>
            <li> I like the stiffness of the bristles, and the battery lasts about as long as I usually keep a toothbrush anyway.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes are battery powered, but the batteries cannot be replaced, which would be my only complaint.</li>
            <li> next to &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; in the photo might mean that --</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m on the road for work half the time</li>
            <li> I brushing 3x a day for less than a minute each time.</li>
            <li> My only dislike, and its a dumb one, is that they never come in any other color!  </li>
            <li> A little pricey because it&#x27;s brand name.</li>
            <li> - With the two-pack I keep one toothbrush in the kitchen to use after meals (apologies to those of you with weak stomachs), while the second is in the bathroom for morning and nighttime use.  </li>
            <li> The vibration works with the little flexible plastic paddles among the bristles to knock the plaque out.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few days to get used to it, but then I grew to like it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The battery died after a few weeks, didn&#x27;t even make it to the month mark.</li>
            <li> When these arrived, one of them was completely dead.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this brand/kind of toothbrush for a few years now</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s usually $3-4 in the store, and if you&#x27;re buying on subscription you can get it down to $4.25 each.  </li>
            <li> Brushing your teeth with a plain toothbrush just doesn&#x27;t get the job done after using these.</li>
            <li> very disappointed -  brushes didn&#x27;t do more than vibrate - waste of money</li>
            <li> well, apparently I was wrong.</li>
            <li> In addition the batteries are a reminder that it is time to change your toothbrush as they will slow down.  </li>
            <li> I just got my teeth checked and the hygenist remarked that I had very little tartar.</li>
            <li> but usually the contacts/switch get mucked up.</li>
            <li> The vibration seems almost pointless.  </li>
            <li> I usually brush like 1 min or almost 2</li>
            <li> I have the subscription for this item and will usually keep extras in my closet at home.  </li>
            <li> Wish they were a little less expensive</li>
            <li> I dont go crazy blowing money on tooth brushes but this one is a solid 5 star.</li>
            <li> I brush at least once a day.</li>
            <li> My guess is that these have been sitting around, and the battery has slowly discharged.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a more expensive travel electric toothbrush which I was very disappointed in.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush works great....until the battery stops in less than 30 days!!!</li>
            <li> The other one is kinda feeble, and there are thin slots in the design of the head which will make cleaning difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also not happy with Amazon practice of refusing to post negative reviews claiming they don&#x27;t meet guidelines.</li>
            <li> Not a good investment.</li>
            <li> I like using pulsating toothbrushes for a reason I can&#x27;t quite articulate, but this one is weak.</li>
            <li> While I do like this brush I find it irritating that the battery dies after 5-6 weeks and can&#x27;t be replaced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking one star away because one time one of them came broken.</li>
            <li> Little bit disappointed</li>
            <li> While I do like this toothbrush, I&#x27;m very disappointed that I have only been using it for a month</li>
            <li> I like these toothbrushes, they&#x27;re expensive...</li>
            <li> Useless when the battery dies.</li>
            <li> You literally cannot change the battery because of the flawed design.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had Sonicare toothbrushes for years, and I&#x27;ve used them, but they are very annoying when you&#x27;re trying to get those hard-to-reach places and the hard plastic vibrates against my teeth.  </li>
            <li> However, the battery compartment is designed so that it is virtually impossible to remove the battery without bending the metal contacts to the point that the vibration mechanism is rendered inoperable.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just a bad set, but it&lt;br /&gt;happened</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> I wish battery was changeable :(</li>
            <li> No, i am not an idiot who couldn&#x27;t think about replacing the battery.</li>
            <li> I opened unscrewed the end to change the battery, it made a horrible clicking noise.  </li>
            <li> I guess for the price this isn&#x27;t a horrible toothbrush, but I won&#x27;t buy it ever again.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! I like the vibrations, but I have no idea what frequency they are and if it is harmonious with the body&#x27;s frequencies. I will be looking into this further. It feels good on my teeth and gums so far, but not everything that feels good is good for the body.</li>
            <li> Great and 5 stars until the installed battery dies, 1 star after I changed battery and found the toothbrush no longer vibrates. I would not buy this again. Good for only two weeks.</li>
            <li> The batteries that they came with stopped working almost immediately. Within a couple of weeks. Changed the batteries and they wore out brand new ones just as quickly. In addition, the power decreases on the battery so quickly that while it may still turn on, it barely &amp;#34;pulses&amp;#34;.  By the time I pay for one of these every three months (as recommended by dentist) plus batteries, I&#x27;m rapidly approaching the cost of a good rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I use these with the Crest 3D White toothpaste and mouthwash.  They work well together to keep my teeth sparkling.</li>
            <li> These tooth brushes are easy to use and do not require any charging. All the perks of an electric toothbrush without the charging hassle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a regular toothbrush only it hums and vibrates.</li>
            <li> Very good product--really cleans and massages too/</li>
            <li> batteries can&#x27;t be changed otherwise works fine.</li>
            <li> Excellent product will order again</li>
            <li> These are usually the only toothbrushes I will buy, really good deal from Amazon, they get your teeth so clean and are great for cleaning your gums and tongue combined with a tongue scraper, I love the tongue cleaners on this toothbrush</li>
            <li> good deal for 2 pulsars especially through subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a more expensive travel electric toothbrush which I was very disappointed in. (travel sonic). This one was more than I expected for a very small electric toothbrush, and I was fully satisfied. The only additional thing I wanted was a case to carry it in, which the travel sonic came with, but that one was so ineffective I wouldn&#x27;t carry it no matter how convenient the packaging was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a home electric toothbrush, this might not meet the needs of some. But if you want an electric toothbrush to travel with, I was very pleased with this one from a mobile &amp;#34;good enough for the road!&amp;#34; perspective.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush to pieces! It is so easy to use and fits into my hand very well. Its angled head makes it easy to reach the back of my teeth and the vibrating motion makes cleaning a whole lot fun. Can I get some for my kids ages between 3 and 9?</li>
            <li> All the Oral B toothbrushes have the same design problem. It was not built to enable the customer to change the battery. The company is aware of the thousands of customers that have given negative comments about this, yet they still have not made the battery replaceable. I love the way the toothbrush works. It is a great toothbrush. However the battery runs out before the brush is worn enough to replace.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an electric toothbrush. It took me a few days to get used to it, but then I grew to like it. I just got my teeth checked and the hygenist remarked that I had very little tartar. So it definitely cleans your teeth well. But the battery only lasted one month, not 3 months, like the packaging claims. To have to spend roughly $8 every month to buy a new brush is not a good value and is very wasteful, both monetarily and for the environment. I&#x27;ll be looking at electric toothbrushes where I can replace the battery from now on. Disappointing because I really liked this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My friend buy this product and says it&#x27;s great quality, and she loves it and may want to buy again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on a fancy electric toothbrush system but after having been told by a friend that she rarely had plaque since using a &#x27;sonic&#x27; brush, I bought one of these toothbrushes at the store.  Huge difference!  My dentist noticed.  So I looked them up on prime and this 2 pack is only a little more than I would pay for one at the store. I even signed up for automatic delivery and got an additional 15% off!  My only dislike, and its a dumb one, is that they never come in any other color!  So we all have these tooth brushes but with our initials marked in sharpie on them :-)</li>
            <li> Bought this - and not a few weeks later the battery was dead.  We tried to replace the battery, but that didn&#x27;t work AT ALL.  These are not meant to replace the batteries.  So just a heads up!</li>
            <li> We have those Sonicare toothbrushes, but you can&#x27;t take the battery out of the Sonicare, which could be incredibly embarrassing when flying but also inconvenient if they get turned on in the suitcase and wear down the rechargeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a great travel alternative to the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love the Pulsar toothbrush. It works great, it feels like it works harder with the pulsing. I feel clean and fresh every time i finish brushing.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral B Pulsar for the fantastic job it does. My only reason for not giving it top rating was that the bristles didn&#x27;t seem quite &#x27;soft&#x27; as marked on the package. I wonder if not enough care is taken in rating &#x27;soft&#x27; vs &#x27;medium&#x27; and maybe I got &#x27;medium&#x27; in my package.</li>
            <li> As advertised, works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these particular versions for a few years. They get my teeth super clean feeling and they get in between well. They battery lasts forever too. I actually have gone back to these after having an Oral B Vitality electric brush. These do a better job.</li>
            <li> good quality, there&#x27;s no more other things need to say. I would absolutely come back when I need to refill.</li>
            <li> While I do like this brush I find it irritating that the battery dies after 5-6 weeks and can&#x27;t be replaced (despite trying to follow along with the video hack I found). It should at least give a good buzz for the 3-4 months I need from a toothbrush</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;subscribe&amp;#34; to these toothbrushes, so we automatically receive them every three months. The battery life is REALLY short. I thought it was just a bad set, but it&lt;br /&gt;happened with the second package too. Hmmm.</li>
            <li> As a dentist, I generally recommend Oral B products. And I think this toothbrush does a good job . . . until the battery dies - - which occurs way before the brush needs to be replaced. You would think, therefore, that Oral B would make the battery user-replaceable. In fact, the toothbrush does use a AAA battery and the handle unscrews so that the battery is accessible. However, the battery compartment is designed so that it is virtually impossible to remove the battery without bending the metal contacts to the point that the vibration mechanism is rendered inoperable. There is a Youtube that shows how to change the battery using a screwdriver and an Exacto knife but why should it be necessary to jump through hoops just to change a battery???</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years. The battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> These brushes don&#x27;t rotate but the vibration&lt;br /&gt;feels good on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I like these toothbrushes, they&#x27;re expensive... but when you go from using one of these to a regular brush (or when the battery dies on one of these) you feel like you&#x27;re barely cleaning your teeth at all. They don&#x27;t last terribly long though, and it&#x27;s hit or miss how long they last. Some last a few months, some last a month. Sometimes they just die all the sudden. If you&#x27;re very careful you can replace the battery but usually the contacts/switch get mucked up. It would be nice if they made a brush like this that you could replace the battery and brush head on. I have a clean sweep rechargeable brush at home but I&#x27;m on the road for work half the time so this suffices. I just feel bad that you throw the whole thing away every time you need a new one.. Pretty wasteful. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush, and this is the fourth or fifth set of these toothbrushes I&#x27;ve bought, however this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever seen a pack where the two toothbrushes in the pack were EXACTLY THE SAME!  Fortunately, nothing a piece of tape to mark my toothbrush apart from my girlfriend&#x27;s can&#x27;t solve, but still, a minor inconvenience.  Five stars for the product, minus one for the inconvenience.</li>
            <li> These are the only toothbrushes we use, we love them. The dentist has been very complimentary about our oral health in the past few years so we know they&#x27;re doing a good job. The vibration is strong and rapid and when you&#x27;re done you can&#x27;t help but run your tongue over your teeth to feel the smoothness.</li>
            <li> battery run out after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I received them a couple of days ago: both don&#x27;t work! they are not vibrating, both of them. I guess I received old ones, will have to complain.</li>
            <li> Got these for hubby &amp; me.  We both really like them, they&#x27;re not as bulky as other electric toothbrushes, and they&#x27;re much quieter.  For the price, when the batteries die I&#x27;ll just get new ones.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes. I will never use another type of toothbrush. I will probably not order them from amazon, but the product is awesome. They leave your teeth with that just left the dentist feeling every time.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve got this on Subscribe &amp; Save and over all like them very much. I&#x27;m taking one star away because one time one of them came broken. The rest have all been fine, though.</li>
            <li> I like using pulsating toothbrushes for a reason I can&#x27;t quite articulate, but this one is weak. The pulsating action is barely noticeable, and the battery in mine starting dying after about three uses. Maybe it&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse for too long and battery starting dying. I don&#x27;t know. But I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> It needs to be clearly labeled &amp;#34;small size&amp;#34; in the title of the item. I guess the letter &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; next to &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; in the photo might mean that -- but I had just assumed that was a label for &amp;#34;Soft.&amp;#34; At a glance, there was no reason for me NOT to assume that this is a standard, adult-sized tooth brush,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner/smoother. A little pricey because it&#x27;s brand name. Could probably get similar toothbrushes from a generic brand but for what you get, these are great toothbrushes and do exactly what you expect them to do. Last the estimated 2 months before needing replacing.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little big but they work like they&#x27;re supposed to and get teeth clean. Will probably try another one next time...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these. They used to be good, I had one from years ago that was still working but threw it out because the bristles wore down. These new ones however don&#x27;t last more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I order these every 3 months for me and my wife and we love them. The battery starts running out after about 3 months, but that is really when you should replace anyways. Definitely feels like it gets my teeth cleaner than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are a waste of money. The battery died after a few weeks, didn&#x27;t even make it to the month mark. I do brush longer than the recommended two minutes, so that could explain it. On the package it does say that it &amp;#34;vibrates&amp;#34; and really thats ALL that it does. None of the bristles move back and forth, not even the rubber flaps. It just vibrates... So this brush is not more efficient than a regular toothbrush and doesn&#x27;t help clean your mouth any more than normally. Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> These are usually good toothbrushes but my most recent shipment was worthless because the batteries were already dead when the package arrived. Not worth the hassle of sending back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also not happy with Amazon practice of refusing to post negative reviews claiming they don&#x27;t meet guidelines.</li>
            <li> Nice simple well made toothbrush.  I had a $50 sonic toothbrush but the bristles were too soft.  I actually like this one better, we are on a subscription with this toothbrush. The battery last longer than the toothbrush, we usually will take the old one and use it in the kitchen when we swap them out for a new brush.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles are gentle on gums while the soft vibration adds to the cleaning power.  I like the whitening aspect also since it is gentle on gums and enamel.  So far I am enjoying this toothbrush and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My favorite tooth brushes! Ever since I use the first one years ago I now have to have them. Well recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I love it! I really like! This Teme is great! More than a very good price! I thought to buy more. I plant your life in Europe beauty shop, tanning, manicure, pedicure. Beauty valuable vitamins but now seek out for sale to buy more supplies. I hope you will be a good deal. Thank you.</li>
            <li> When these arrived, one of them was completely dead.  The other one is kinda feeble, and there are thin slots in the design of the head which will make cleaning difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened unscrewed the end to change the battery, it made a horrible clicking noise.  I could get it to work if I held a new battery in place and the end cap off, but I couldn&#x27;t get the contact to stay down if I screwed it shut again.</li>
            <li> I guess for the price this isn&#x27;t a horrible toothbrush, but I won&#x27;t buy it ever again.  The vibration seems almost pointless.  I don&#x27;t feel my teeth any cleaner because of it.</li>
            <li> This is a very interesting toothbrush.  Easy to use - Reaches all parts of the mouth - Cleans better than regular toothbrush - Battery has good life -  Most of all very good for gum care  Would recommend for quality and price.</li>
            <li> I love them, ever since I first used, never changed to anything else. It is nicely shaped and the pulsar works great.</li>
            <li> Good battery powered brush.  Easy to pack for travel.</li>
            <li> Great seller, will use again.</li>
            <li> My favorite tb  My teeth feel much cleaner.  This is my first Soft style purchase, I read they are better for your teeth.  I&#x27;ll say they don&#x27;t feel too soft, so I still feel they clean well.  Wish they were a little less expensive but we splurge for them.  We used to use the oral b rechargeable electric tb....can&#x27;t remember the name like the sonicare I guess and I feel these do a better job than those.</li>
            <li> rarely do the batteries in this product last 3 weeks.  so sad as I love the product otherwise.  does a great job for easy brushing</li>
            <li> Batteries are built in and cannot be replaced. Lasts about 4-6 months depending how much you use&lt;br /&gt;it. Cleans great!</li>
            <li> This is one great invention I look forward to brushing my teeth these days. It feels wonderful on my gums and actually helps with my morning sinus problems. The brush and batteries last about the same amount of time, then you toss it out and start with a clean new one. The price is wonderful so is the product  TRY IT :-)</li>
            <li> We love these!  Brushing your teeth with a plain toothbrush just doesn&#x27;t get the job done after using these. We also travel often and they&#x27;re way easier to transport than some older models I&#x27;ve tried in the past. They also don&#x27;t turn themselves on in the bag like older models.</li>
            <li> Cleans well.  Great his and her package or 6 month supply for one person since I guess you are supposed to change toothbrushes every 3 months.  Cost was a good deal compared to the normal 6 or 7 dollars per brush.</li>
            <li> - With the two-pack I keep one toothbrush in the kitchen to use after meals (apologies to those of you with weak stomachs), while the second is in the bathroom for morning and nighttime use.  The brush is immediately available in the places I&#x27;m most likely to need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The soft bristles and gentle vibration mean:&lt;br /&gt;  Longer brushing without damaging the tooth enamel,&lt;br /&gt;  Concentration along the gum-line with the rubber stimulators to reduce periodontal issues, and&lt;br /&gt;  Easy cleaning of the roof of the mouth and tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The price is perfect for placing this as a subscribe-and-save item on a four-month cycle to replace the brushes as frequently your dental professional prefers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- For me, the price also means I always have a spare set for company, or travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great set, priced right, with the fine Oral-B reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Please remember to remove the battery for recycling before discarding your old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush in good health!</li>
            <li> Bought one in the grocery store first, liked it, so I added it to my subscription.  I haven&#x27;t had the problems people talked about with the battery.  I only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a toothbrush, not an .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s usually $3-4 in the store, and if you&#x27;re buying on subscription you can get it down to $4.25 each.  You&#x27;re supposed to change your brush every 3 months so it&#x27;s perfect for the 6 month window.  The point of these items are to rack up you item subscription count.  If you get 6 or more items in a delivery, you get 15% off instead of 5%.  If you have higher priced items in your order, spending a little more on these little items still puts you over the top, so you actually save more money on the stuff you normally buy.</li>
            <li> Battery died within 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my teeth feel after using it and how it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my gums.  It definitely gets my toothbrushing done faster than with my manual to get the same squeaky clean feel.</li>
            <li> very disappointed -  brushes didn&#x27;t do more than vibrate - waste of money</li>
            <li> This has to be the next best thing to having an electric toothbrush.  I feel like it has to be doing a better job of brushing my teeth than my old toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I am not a religious flosser and these help make up for that a bit.  I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush may be why my teeth fall out in my 80&#x27;s instead of in my 60&#x27;s!  I&#x27;ve never been properly habitual with teeth care, but this toothbrush makes me want to brush my teeth!  We&#x27;ve had Sonicare toothbrushes for years, and I&#x27;ve used them, but they are very annoying when you&#x27;re trying to get those hard-to-reach places and the hard plastic vibrates against my teeth.  They&#x27;ve had years to fix that, but now someone else comes along with a brush that does the same thing and is made of soft rubber/plastic and is the same size as a normal toothbrush, and when the battery finally dies can be used as a conventional toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is one of the great advances of the 21st century.  Sci-Fi come to life!  One hint though, shop around and don&#x27;t pay too much.  Prices for these toothbrushes seem to vary a lot.</li>
            <li> They are reasonably good. But, I didn&#x27;t see any X-factor in this one. Little bit disappointed but I got used to it now. :)</li>
            <li> This is a vibrating tothbrush. Your teeth do feel very clean after you use it. Because it vibrates, it stimulates blood flow in your gums, and healthy gums make for healthy teeth. The battery dies between 2 1/2 to 3 months, which is great since you are supposed to change toothbrushes every three months. I highly recommend these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> One of the best toothbush i ever used in my life. I dont go crazy blowing money on tooth brushes but this one is a solid 5 star. Works great and for some od reason makes you want to brush longer for about 3 mins. I usually brush like 1 min or almost 2 but now i go for 3 to 4 tops. I use this with the Crest 3d white Glamorous white teeth whitening Vibrant Mint Toothpaste and it really helps them get white within 1 month total time. Brush twice a day and you will see a major difference.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are actually surprisingly good. I was pretty skeptical that they were anything other than a gimmick, but upon trying them, was pleasantly surprised at just how well they worked. Then it dawned on me that, for travel, they are perfect because they are light and effective. If you have a moderately short trip or vacation, say, less than a month, this toothbrush will do a more than adequate job without you having to carry your electric toothbrush, it&#x27;s holder, and it&#x27;s recharger, not to mention the brush head itself ... This one little light item will do it all. Will it clean your teeth as well as the Braun or Philips electric models? Of course not. But it&#x27;s not terribly worse, either, if you take a little time and use the right technique. And, as I say, the lightness is really great for travel. The built-in battery on these things runs for at least a month or more with regular twice-a-day use (maybe longer), and the button mechanism is well built to keep the internal components sealed away from water (there is no need to worry about getting the toothbrush totally wet, because it is completely sealed). So, as surprised as I am, this is an easy five star recommendation, and particularly so for the traveler.</li>
            <li> These are disposable, good toothbrushes. At a check-up at the dentist&#x27;s recently, our children were complimented on how well they brushed - I believe we have these to thank.</li>
            <li> These were exactly as expected, I think for the price they are on par.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and have used it for years.  My teeth have never been cleaner and in fact, despite my continued high candy intake and soft teeth, my cavities have decreased as well.  The rubber things on the side make all the difference.  Also, the battery lasts longer than they say it will.</li>
            <li> Update:  Great toothbrush but expect the battery to work for maybe 2-3 weeks which we found to be the battery life of the 2 we bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good but have only been using for 2 weeks.  As far as cleaning, our teeth feel cleaner and look fine but I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any significant whitening going on.  One thing I did notice is that when you &#x27;tap&#x27; the water out of the toothbrush, there is a split through the middle and the water flies all over the mirror because it comes through the split at the back of the brush head so watch out for that.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush works great....until the battery stops in less than 30 days!!! I want my money back!!! Not worth the $10 I spent....</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new and I&#x27;m glad I did. This tooth brush cleans your teeth better than a regular one. the handle feels nice and the bristles aren&#x27;t too soft.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel squeky clean after brushing with this toothbrush!  Very soft and gentle!  Not abrasive.  Dentist reccommended.  Love it!</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This item was packaged well, is exactly what I wanted, arrived on time and is performing fine.</li>
            <li> Worked fine while it worked. You should be able to get at least 3 months out of these brushes. I brushing 3x a day for less than a minute each time. Anyone familiar with these toothbrushes knows you can&#x27;t replace the battery after they die. Not a good investment. Cheaper in warehouse stores also.</li>
            <li> Two wins for the price of one. Just wish the colors were different. Finally had to mark the toothbrushes to tell them apart - ah the joys of sharing a bathroom with your daughters!</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes would have been great for the price, except the battery in mine only lasted 6 or 7 weeks. My husband&#x27;s is still working, and they came in the same package.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I could have bought a plain toothbrush for less, but that&#x27;s what I have now that it doesn&#x27;t pulsate.  I wonder if the merchandise had been around too long before it was sold... guess that&#x27;s the risk when you buy things with batteries already in them - and you can&#x27;t replace them.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothbrush and I have a subscription for them. I like these quite a bit better than the Colgate MaxWhite toothbrush, which is similar. I like the stiffness of the bristles, and the battery lasts about as long as I usually keep a toothbrush anyway.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Useless when the battery dies. No, i am not an idiot who couldn&#x27;t think about replacing the battery. You literally cannot change the battery because of the flawed design. You have to bend the metal frame to remove the battery and you cannot bend it back properly for it to make contact with battery&#x27;s ends. In short, when the battery is dead you cannot use it with pulsing anymore.</li>
            <li> I am brand loyal (in this case to Proctor &amp; Gamble), so I have to confess that I am extremely biased. I am brand loyal to P&amp;G because their products are outstanding and their customer service is even better. I know what to expect from companies that I know, and P&amp;G offers a good product, good promotions, and backs everything they make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that that is out of the way, onto the toothbrush. I buy 4 of these brushes a year and replace the one I am using every 90 days. I brush at least once a day. These brushes are everything you could ask for; They are comfortable, and I really feel a deep clean. I am not a dentist, but my dentist says this is a great brush and he recommends it, so that&#x27;s good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple. Buy two packs of these when theres a good deal or promotion, and four packs of Crest 3D White and every time you run out of toothpaste, throw away a toothbrush. Buy some more when you run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned some mid-range toothbrushes with the removable heads, but honestly, the design of a toothbrush is simply not meant to last forever. Batteries don&#x27;t last forever, bristles don&#x27;t last forever, and I really don&#x27;t want to shove the same piece of plastic in my mouth for a decade.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand/kind of toothbrush for a few years now and I just decided to check out the pricing on Amazon. It is a much better buy than if you were to purchase it from Target, Wal-Mart, etc. The toothbrushes are battery powered, but the batteries cannot be replaced, which would be my only complaint. They are guaranteed to last about 3 months, which holds true. I like this because I will forget to change my toothbrush after a while of use. This is the perfect reminder. The bristles are soft and I like this because I have sensitive gums. I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone looking for an &amp;#34;pulsing/vibrating&amp;#34; toothbrush, without wanting to pay [$$$] for the Sonicare brushes. Eventually, I will cave and buy one, but for now this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Really a dumb and ineffective gimmick to charge extra for a battery and a simple motor.  This is toothbrush bloat and the supposed vibrating bristles (the ones that have enough contact to actually vibrate which many do not) do not do anything but make buz your gums like a vibrator.  They are not helping you clean more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money avoid the gimmick.</li>
            <li> I am still getting used to this pulsar brush, it&#x27;s smaller than my reg. toothbrush but it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of electric toothbrushes since they do most of the work and you can&#x27;t really brush &amp;#34;too hard&amp;#34; if you use the right bristle texture.I&#x27;ve been using mine for six months (admittedly not as much as I should) and haven&#x27;t needed to replace the battery yet.</li>
            <li> Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t buy toothbrushes online, but since I needed them, and was already ordering a few things, I thought, why not. I have braces, so these are great for fishing out the little food pieces that like to hide in and around the wires and between teeth. Easy to use, and gentle on the mouth.</li>
            <li> suitable for ppl like me...when the battery is down (last ard 3 mth)...i know its time to change a new toothbrush...US$9 for half a year is consider reasonable i guess</li>
            <li> I love this item and the multi colors available.  In addition the batteries are a reminder that it is time to change your toothbrush as they will slow down.  I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I like using a Pulsar toothbrush, with its motorized bristles and plaque-busting paddles, but the one I had before was larger and had harder bristles. Over time, using it every day, my teeth started getting very sensitive and I had to get special toothpaste if I hoped to be able to eat anything cold. (I hadn&#x27;t realized being too vigorous with a too-hard toothbrush could cause this problem until I started reading product reviews here by people suffering from sensitive teeth.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am using the excellent [[ASIN:B0036ZA40W Dr. Collins  Perio Toothbrush,  (colors vary) (Pack of 3)]] as my daily toothbrush, and I use the Oral B Pulsar once or twice a week to whack the plaque and give my gums a massage. The head on these Pulsars is smaller and the bristles are soft, so it&#x27;s working better for me. I love these toothbrushes, but you have to be careful not to go at your teeth too aggressively with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would caution you about is not to press down too hard when you are brushing, for the reasons above but also because you can break open the toothbrush&#x27;s casing. I did that with one of these, making it pretty useless because it would bend open when I brushed, but a dot of superglue carefully applied fixed it.</li>
            <li> While I do like this toothbrush, I&#x27;m very disappointed that I have only been using it for a month and the battery is already low &amp; almost dead (with normal twice per day brushing). The packaging indicates that the non-replaceable battery should last 3 months (&amp;#34;should&amp;#34; being the keyword I suppose).</li>
            <li> I have purchased these tooth brushes in the local pharmacy in the past and the batteries lasted a good 2-3 months, these purchased on Amazon lasted 3 weeks. I am very conscious of conserving the battery so I never turn it on until I have applied the toothpaste, I brush quickly and immediately turn it off before I rinse my mouth and rinse the residual toothpaste from the brush.  Add to this that I unfortunately do not brush each night because I have a bad habit of falling asleep and waking up the next morning on the sofa. The short battery life prompted me to go to look at the packaging which was in my drawer with the remaining tooth brush and examine it more closely.  It had a slightly yellow tinge to it and the year 2013 was printed on the back.  Considering that my purchase was on December 4th of 2014 (almost 2015) I was surprised. My guess is that these have been sitting around, and the battery has slowly discharged.  I also visited the Oral-B website and strangely this tooth brush received 63 reviews and was rated 2.5 starts out of 5 stars , yet on Amazon it is a 4 star product.  Very strange.  I will never purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link to Oral-B http://www.oralb.com/products/pulsar-toothbrush/</li>
            <li> I like this product due to the feeling it gives me and I consider it cost effective vs products with replacement brush heads. Considering that the cheapest replacement brush heads for the most popular powered brush run at around $15, the ~$8 cost for this product makes sense to me. My biggest criticism, and as others have mentioned, is the short life of the battery and no easy way to replace it, although if you are determined, you can get it done.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you try this product if you have not &amp;#34;committed&amp;#34; yourself to a powered toothbrush set.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes, they do a great job cleaning.  My dental hygienist asked what I changed when I started using these, it actually took her less time to finish the cleaning.  She purchased some herself for her family.</li>
            <li> These look great and were such a great price.  The kids are all excited to get new toothbrushes.  Great product and price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years now and can immediately tell the difference if I have to use a travel toothbrush. The little plastic thingys in the head are amazing at getting the plague in-between your teeth. Before using this toothbrush, I had one of those S100+ rechargeable ones and it doesn&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite toothbrush... I vow I will never run out....these folks did good with deliver.....enough said about this said</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is good, cleans well and has good feeling. The only problem is the battery life. Don&#x27;t expect it to last more than 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li> One of the two did not work, but it is still usable as a toothbrush so I guess it is not a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like them but they wear out pretty fast. We change every 3 months. This last batch wore out quickly</li>
            <li> ive been using these for a couple months with crest 3d whight and can tell it makes a difference with cleaning plaque and whiting teeth</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric toothbrush for several years, but decided to try this brush to reduce the amount of paraphernalia I have to pack when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY happy with this.  The vibration works with the little flexible plastic paddles among the bristles to knock the plaque out.  They last longer than I thought they would, too (my first one lasted almost 4 months, was used twice a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  They work like an electric brush but are much cheaper and lighter weight.  Just be  aware that the battery is not replaceable and lasts about 3 months pet brush.</li>
            <li> Oral B makes a great brush and these have that bit extra.</li>
            <li> Do not hesitate to get the top notch in toothbrushes. Smooth with optimum efficiency. Oral-B, the right choice to take care of your teeth</li>
            <li> I have the subscription for this item and will usually keep extras in my closet at home.  This last order was shipped with a batch that contained old batteries.  The toothbrush usually lasts 3 months but this last one ran out of juice in less than a month.  I opened up the battery case and found that the battery had expired in 2013.  Also, you can&#x27;t replace the old battery.  Toothbrush was designed to break if you try to take the battery out.  I ordered this item in 2014 so I shouldn&#x27;t have received an expired batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately there is no expiration date on the package so you have no idea when the toothbrush was manufactured.  I can&#x27;t return this item because it didn&#x27;t open it until pass the expiration date.</li>
            <li> the vibrating is nice until it stops working (3 weeks after i purchased it). :-( i essentially paid $10 for two regular toothbrushes... i want my money back!</li>
            <li> These toothbruses feel so good when you clean your teeth.  They are great to take on a trip.  You don&#x27;t have to charge them, and the battery is supposed to last three months (I haven&#x27;t owned them that long).  Your mouth feels really clean after you use them-definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually realize this toothbrush vibrated.  I thought it was the same as the one I was replacing.  However I like the massaging action on my gums.  I only wish the bristles were a bit less sparse.  Otherwise good toothbrush with fast delivery</li>
            <li> One of the brushes only ran for a day then quit!</li>
            <li> My favourite, I use 3 years, not rigid, comfortable. I change it on new once in 3 months (the recommendation of the dentist), but the half of year  will works well</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Have it on a automatic 3 month subscription and does its job. No issues with it.</li>
            <li> Cheap electric toothbrushes, indeed.</li>
            <li> Thank you! I wish battery was changeable :(</li>
            <li> Although it is great to have the opportunity to have this double Oral-B Pulsar on save and subscribe and auto-delivery,  I am one of the unfortunate customers who got the &amp;#34;almost dead&amp;#34; battery in my first shipment! I have been using the toothbrush for a month and the battery is already dying! It happened before when I purchase the same item from the pharmacy so I thought Amazon might have something better...well, apparently I was wrong. I have tried to replace the AAAA battery inside but as mentioned by another customer it does damage the connections and does not work every time. I like this toothbrush, I think it cleans teeth very well and it is great for traveling instead of the rechargeable one but please Oral B put a decent battery in it!</li>
