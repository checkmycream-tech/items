            <li>Great price for a ton of lashes, shipping much faster than what was indicated.</li>
            <li>they are ok, just not what i was expecting</li>
            <li>UGLIEST MOST UNNATURAL LASHES</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure once I get the lashes</li>
            <li>Do not get as many as promised</li>
            <li>They can get pricey and I love the fact that these are so inexpensive and I don&#x27;t have to reuse them to save money.</li>
            <li>Nice n full lashes.</li>
            <li>love them always keep them on hand always get compliments and they can be reused easy to apply I use hair bonding glue and the stay all day</li>
            <li>they are prefect and curly and very full I will reorder from them again</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than expected and are the perfect length.</li>
            <li>I love my lashes, they are the full look I love</li>
            <li>Easy strip for the adhesive to be applied on.</li>
            <li>And They Bend Over AND Break Easily.</li>
            <li>THEY strong too</li>
            <li>In order for them to fit your eyelids you do have to snip them a lil but over all, great purchase especially for the price.</li>
            <li>cheaply made and fell to pieces.</li>
            <li>But once I cut them to fit my eye and put my glue on it.</li>
            <li>Look good, easy to apply, and can be used multiple times.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it!</li>
            <li>but they are extremely worth it for the price!</li>
            <li>Just clean and reuse.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re not going to give me much issues keeping them on.</li>
            <li>They cant really be used more than once</li>
            <li>They are full of volume and lushish lashes</li>
            <li>I like them a lot cool</li>
            <li>They feel &amp; are super plasticky.</li>
            <li>but seriously they are perfect in every way and worth the money just buy them</li>
            <li>You also have to make sure you have little scissors handy to cut them to your eye length cause there</li>
            <li>it was worth waiting for.</li>
            <li>Loved them money well spent .</li>
            <li>Overall I must say I liked them,and that are as described in the picture.</li>
            <li>and I had to laugh</li>
            <li>Good quality and just what I expected!</li>
            <li>Beautiful long lashes last me all day and for continue use.</li>
            <li>The strip is also comfortable and pliable, not stiff, and does not poke you in the corners of your eyes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them I purchased 3 packs of the same eyelashes</li>
            <li>I love these lashes and you get soo many for such a low price , cheaper than one pair at a drugstore</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more again</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t argue with this price ;)</li>
            <li>I will be back for more</li>
            <li>4 stars only cause I have not tried them on yet, even though they do have a plastic look to them that is ok with me.</li>
            <li>I got sooooo many compliments on how long my eyelashes were</li>
            <li>shipping was surprisingly fast , I was expecting alot longer considering it was over seas and that can take a bit of time but this came to me pretty fast for over seas , all and all</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that the band is super soft, but it&#x27;s also not the hardest band like some lashes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and I also had to double layer the lashes to get more of a thicker look and a little more length also the edges hurt</li>
            <li>They look really plastic and shiny...</li>
            <li>They rip really fast.</li>
            <li>I REVEIW IS REAL AD</li>
            <li>THANKS AGAIN</li>
            <li>That an I had to use so much glue to try to put it on and they still wouldn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li>I really like them</li>
            <li>They are really plastic looking don&#x27;t even look real</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t bend very well</li>
            <li>These looked way better than I expected</li>
            <li>Got them two days late but its okey hope they work good</li>
            <li>They are pretty long but look sturdy enough to use a pair more than one time.</li>
            <li>They do have a shine to them that makes them look more synthetic rather than more natural looking false eyelashes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with these the band&#x27;s r a little thick</li>
            <li>They remind me of the ardell double up lashes I buy from walgreens except for half the price I&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
            <li>u won&#x27;t be disappointed so cheap to buy and the quality is great</li>
            <li>Omg i absolutely love the eyelashes they do not look cheap or fake</li>
            <li>I placed my order on March 2nd just received my lashes to day&#x27;s ago on the 28th, im very very UPSET with my order it looked nothing like the picture they are verythin and natural looking</li>
            <li>A little more curve than others I have seen but still need to shape prior to putting on</li>
            <li>I received my eyelashes before the marked date.</li>
            <li>Came a week early.</li>
            <li>They also look natural too.</li>
            <li>pretty long</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised considering what I paid.  </li>
            <li>they blend well with my natural lashes</li>
            <li>They are thick, full, pretty lashes.</li>
            <li>Recommend mainly for big eyes.</li>
            <li>I keep seeing reviews stating that they&#x27;re not thick enough ?</li>
            <li>But, they&#x27;re not thick enough for me.</li>
            <li>Like this style because they are thick and all one length and aren&#x27;t too long or over the top.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but there fine I also bought a pair of bottom lashes I can&#x27;t wait to see them together !</li>

            <li> the very rnd parts were so stiff that it wouldn&#x27;t bind to the curve of my eye.</li>
            <li> And when I did most of the lashes was bent and not same size and the lashes are so thick makes it hard to stay on, will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The band on these is a little tougher than the more expensive lashes but bending and playing with it prior to applying it</li>
            <li> Just wish I didn&#x27;t have to wait so long</li>
            <li> Shipping was too long.</li>
            <li> Decent, not as thick or long as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I try buying a couple of boxes every other month so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to go to my local beauty supply and spend 3$ on one pair of eyes lashes.</li>
            <li> they just weren&#x27;t as long as I expected them to be</li>
            <li> they look super fake, feels like im wearing plastic</li>
            <li> Maybe if you&#x27;re going for the drag look they&#x27;re not but these are plenty thick but still have that natural look!</li>
            <li> I am a huge makeup fanatic and I wear false lashes every time I put makeup on.</li>
            <li> And they are harder 2 put on that the store bought Brand&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> they are thin and they don&#x27;t stick very well</li>
            <li> I did receive them before my expected delivery date</li>
            <li> BIG LONG AD THICK JUS</li>
            <li> But I thought that I was ordering the other style.</li>
            <li> The lashes are super stiff &amp; uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;ll become a natural thick look !</li>

            <li> looks great! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> The lashes are super stiff &amp; uncomfortable. They feel &amp; are super plasticky.</li>
            <li> Heavy and very fake !</li>
            <li> They are ok lashes for a day</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible. Waxy,stiff, unnatural,unattractive.</li>
            <li> Cute but doesn&#x27;t come with glue</li>
            <li> They rip really fast. Didn&#x27;t like them</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as thick as I would like them to be or as thick as the picture but they&#x27;re nice</li>
            <li> I love the eyelashes would buy more</li>
            <li> This time was a waste..they wouldn&#x27;t hold even with extra glue</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them I purchased 3 packs of the same eyelashes 😍 yes they&#x27;re thin but once&lt;br /&gt;you put them on they&#x27;ll become a natural thick look ! A Few Dollars Spent Well 😉👌👌</li>
            <li> I received my eyelashes before the marked date. They are pretty long but look sturdy enough to use a pair more than one time. I have yet to wear them but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re not going to give me much issues keeping them on. In order for them to fit your eyelids you do have to snip them a lil but over all, great purchase especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Loved them ,they dont look are feel plastic it&#x27;s so comfortable to wear! Just wish I didn&#x27;t have to wait so long but it was worth it!</li>

            <li> I love my eye lashes! There cute yet affordable. I try buying a couple of boxes every other month so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to go to my local beauty supply and spend 3$ on one pair of eyes lashes.</li>
            <li> they look super fake, feels like im wearing plastic</li>
            <li> not so great. cheaply made and fell to pieces.</li>
            <li> I so Iove my lashes.I was scare to order them at first.i just had to cut the excess off that holds them to the box.but I am so glad I did.love it</li>
            <li> Idk if its just me but I got them In their really soft I thought they would be perfect. But once I cut them to fit my eye and put my glue on it. it wouldnt even curve and stick to my eye an I used the duo adhesive it was like the very rnd parts were so stiff that it wouldn&#x27;t bind to the curve of my eye. That an I had to use so much glue to try to put it on and they still wouldn&#x27;t stay. Not worth it at all ill be buying the rest of my false eyelashes at the drug store. So sad that this didnt work.</li>
            <li> These are not the best lashes but they work&lt;br /&gt;  Chandell Arsenault&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Great and easy to put on! They remind me of the ardell double up lashes I buy from walgreens except for half the price I&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
            <li> these lashes are the perfect shape and length for some hair styles I wear . I absolutely love them. thank you !!!!</li>
            <li> Came a week early. I love them. They can keep being reused. YES the track is hard but if you run your finger nail over it it&#x27;ll become softer. They also look natural too. Recommend mainly for big eyes.</li>
            <li> There okay not the best eyelashes but you get what you pay for. They cant really be used more than once and i had to wait one month maybe since there from hong cong.</li>
            <li> they are prefect and curly and very full I will reorder from them again</li>
            <li> love them always keep them on hand always get compliments and they can be reused easy to apply I use hair bonding glue and the stay all day</li>
            <li> Shipping was too long. Box was smashed.</li>
            <li> Really really really really cheap! It doesn&#x27;t even look like hair. IT Looks Like paper :/</li>
            <li> Not good. Once their on your eye they take a weird shape.they don&#x27;t stay very well. And they are harder 2 put on that the store bought Brand&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> cheap quality, had to cut em down, thin, not thick enough so I had to wear two pair at once</li>
            <li> They may not be human but they make my eyes pop... I really like them</li>
            <li> I like them nice effect !&lt;br /&gt;Light and thin not to thick and stiff, you know how lashes that are stiff tend to poke you in the corner of your eye ?&lt;br /&gt;these aren&#x27;t it lol ! I was skeptical but there fine I also bought a pair of bottom lashes I can&#x27;t wait to see them together ! You also have to make sure you have little scissors handy to cut them to your eye length cause there pretty long but that&#x27;s understandable everybody doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt; have the same size eye and I commend them for there quality and quick shipping all 10 count pair of lashes :D thank you expect another order soon</li>
            <li> Great lashes for the price! They do have a shine to them that makes them look more synthetic rather than more natural looking false eyelashes but they are extremely worth it for the price! And shipping wasnt so bad considering it came across the planet</li>
            <li> These look awesome when you put them on,definitely would buy more.</li>
            <li> They were really cheap lashes and looked like plastic.. hated them</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Very uncomfortable .</li>
            <li> i love it, one thing is some boxes are crashed. im in love with these lashes ill be ordering from this seller thanks</li>
            <li> This product I would order again. I like that they are thicker and u can trim them to the size you like. Easy strip for the adhesive to be applied on. If you like thick lashes order these. You can also reuse them.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE LASHES!!! They are full of volume and lushish lashes it gives you I need to order more!!!!</li>
            <li> I get great lashes to wear weekly and more for a good price it was worth waiting for. thank you</li>
            <li> I wear these everyday!</li>
            <li> Great price for a ton of lashes, shipping much faster than what was indicated. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Like this style because they are thick and all one length and aren&#x27;t too long or over the top. The strip is also comfortable and pliable, not stiff, and does not poke you in the corners of your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes and you get soo many for such a low price , cheaper than one pair at a drugstore you can&#x27;t beat that . I keep seeing reviews stating that they&#x27;re not thick enough ? Maybe if you&#x27;re going for the drag look they&#x27;re not but these are plenty thick but still have that natural look! I have gotten plenty compliments on them , I would compare them to nyc brand lashes that you get for 4 bucks at cvs anywhos shipping was surprisingly fast , I was expecting alot longer considering it was over seas and that can take a bit of time but this came to me pretty fast for over seas , all and all I will definitely buy more again I can&#x27;t argue with this price ;)</li>
            <li> they are ok, just not what i was expecting</li>
            <li> They are so thin do not purchase these you are wasting your moneyI had to put to peer on one eye</li>
            <li> good looking and very good price</li>
            <li> UGLIEST MOST UNNATURAL LASHES I EVER ORDERED. TOO DRAMATIC AND UNREALISTIC!</li>
            <li> Extremely slow shipping but I&#x27;m sure once I get the lashes I&#x27;ll be happy</li>
            <li> Loved them money well spent .</li>
            <li> They were fairly good. Bought them for my sis and she loves them.</li>
            <li> Was actually thinner than the pictures.</li>
            <li> Do not get as many as promised</li>
            <li> Received these dont mind them being stiff they just weren&#x27;t as long as I expected them to be I felt like I was wearing regular length eyelashes they weren&#x27;t a dramatic look at all and I also had to double layer the lashes to get more of a thicker look and a little more length also the edges hurt had to trim the extra string on the edges</li>
            <li> They are really plastic looking don&#x27;t even look real</li>
            <li> Good value for price. Box is a bit flimsy but who cares about the box...nobody is going to wear the box on their face! They are thick, full, pretty lashes. Just wiggle the band around a bit to soften it up. I wouldn&#x27;t say that the band is super soft, but it&#x27;s also not the hardest band like some lashes I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s a medium feel band. I like them.</li>
            <li> This Product was Not At My Liking. This Are Plastic. And They Bend Over AND Break Easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with these the band&#x27;s r a little thick and they don&#x27;t bend very well but if u play with then the loosen up</li>
            <li> These looked way better than I expected and they&#x27;re durable I will be back for more</li>
            <li> good value...nice set...</li>
            <li> Great with being reused</li>
            <li> My neice loves these lashes.  But, they&#x27;re not thick enough for me.</li>
            <li> I love my lashes, they are the full look I love and the price is great, I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> bad quality very stiff. would give no stars but i dont let me</li>
            <li> Theyre the ugliest eyelashes ive ever bought. You can so tell theyre fake. The texture is so fake they feel like toy doll&#x27;s eyelashes. I would not recommend them at all.</li>
            <li> I stay stocked up with these lashes. I am a huge makeup fanatic and I wear false lashes every time I put makeup on. They can get pricey and I love the fact that these are so inexpensive and I don&#x27;t have to reuse them to save money. I use them with my lash duo eyelash glue. The band on these is a little tougher than the more expensive lashes but bending and playing with it prior to applying it softens it up. These are the perfect length. It gives you great length and volume without looking unnatural!</li>
            <li> Must trim edges in order to get out.  Very nice and full.  A little more curve than others I have seen but still need to shape prior to putting on</li>
            <li> Beautiful long lashes last me all day and for continue use. Just clean and reuse. Beautiful length compliment my brown eyes</li>
            <li> they are thin and they don&#x27;t stick very well</li>
            <li> Overall I must say I liked them,and that are as described in the picture. But I thought that I was ordering the other style.</li>
            <li> Good quality and just what I expected!</li>
            <li> Omg i absolutely love the eyelashes they do not look cheap or fake I have blond eyelashes and when I used these you could not tell they were false I got sooooo many compliments on how long my eyelashes were and I had to laugh cause no one knew my little secret lol but seriously they are perfect in every way and worth the money just buy them u won&#x27;t be disappointed so cheap to buy and the quality is great</li>
            <li> I placed my order on March 2nd just received my lashes to day&#x27;s ago on the 28th, im very very UPSET with my order it looked nothing like the picture they are verythin and natural looking dont spend your money or time they are LIARS. very very cheap looking lashes NEVER AGAIN</li>
            <li> 4 stars only cause I have not tried them on yet, even though they do have a plastic look to them that is ok with me. They are similar to the ones i purchase at the 99cent store so I can definitely work with these. It did take a while to receive but what can you expect when purchasing out of the USA. I did receive them before my expected delivery date so I am very happy about that, can&#x27;t wait to wear them this weekend. Thank you!</li>
            <li> fabulous, great deal, go on well these are the best&lt;br /&gt;Will order again</li>
            <li> Great deal. But I should have went with a different type of eyelash</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised considering what I paid.  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> A pair of lashes were missing</li>
            <li> They are very thick and long I don&#x27;t like them</li>
            <li> These are great they blend well with my natural lashes</li>
            <li> I like them a lot cool</li>
            <li> My daughter wears these. Loves them.</li>
            <li> Took forever to receive And when I did most of the lashes was bent and not same size and the lashes are so thick makes it hard to stay on, will not buy again.</li>
