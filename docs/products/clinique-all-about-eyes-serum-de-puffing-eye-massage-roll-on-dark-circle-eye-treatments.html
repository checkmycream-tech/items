            <li>I love clinique, all this products are perfect, the serum is perfect you can feel it acting in your skin immediately</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>The rollerball feels great on your eyes and it appears to be great even for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I consider them to be top of the line, while maintaining affordability.  </li>
            <li>I would reccommend the all about eyes cream because that works so much better than this.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is refreshing, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s $10 cheaper on amazon compared to the retail stores here in Canada.</li>
            <li>This product was stunning for me.</li>
            <li>but that is just me. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have tried several others and this one works the best.</li>
            <li>The result are almost immediate and are even more noticeable it</li>
            <li>but for puffy eyed mornings, there is nothing I have found that works better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I always make sure I have it on hand.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>when I wake up and within about 10 minutes I feel more awake and the puffiness in my eyes is reduced signifcantly.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it does not absorb very quickly and sat on top of my skin for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I guess they could be more effective if I was more consistent...</li>
            <li>It *feels* really good for a minute or two but does absolutely nothing for the puffiness.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply; just rolls on.</li>
            <li>All about eyes sounded like the perfect product because Clinique claims to have hypo-allergenic products, and I have problems with dark circles and puffy eyes from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels cool and refreshing going on.  </li>
            <li>My skin under my eye got caught in rollerball and got all cut up with fine cuts.</li>
            <li>After reading about this product in a ladies magazine, that explained how applying caffeine topically could greatly reduce puffiness</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light weight liquid that goes on with a roller ball.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different eye treatments for puffiness and Clinique All About Eyes is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Just ok--nothing special.</li>
            <li>The roller ball is cool and it wakes you up and depuffes your eye</li>
            <li>Good product and delivered on time, the same as I order</li>
            <li>and I love it much.</li>
            <li>She says that the product works very well and when she has needed it the most, it did the job.</li>
            <li>Many companies have a rollerball eye product applicator now, but the other ones I have tried get stuck easily.</li>
            <li>Really helps with puffy eyes in the morning and it is mildly moisturizing but not greasy.</li>
            <li>bought the ROC product first.</li>
            <li>Really takes care of the eye puffiness!</li>
            <li>Use it daily as a routine and it there and others notice the difference after 6 weeks and more as you keep using it.</li>
            <li>but alas, it was too good to be true!</li>
            <li>I love this product because it really works and you definitely see the improvement,  </li>
            <li>This is light and refreshing and wakes you up (especially if you store it in the refrigerator for an extra oomph!).  </li>
            <li>This serum produced such a huge difference for me, it&#x27;s like I had some sort of eye-lift.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed with the fast results....</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it alone for my eyes, but I don&#x27;t really believe that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s intended for -</li>
            <li>Very painful.&lt;br /&gt;Had to return it.</li>
            <li>I really am getting results with this product.</li>
            <li>When I got the trial size Clinique product, I used the Garnier on one eye and the Clinique on the other, just to see which product worked better.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes, I cannot not use certain sunscreens and mascaras because my eyes water profusely when applied.</li>
            <li>My main problem with aging is sagging eyelids and puffy under eye area.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Visible results right away, don&#x27;t expect miracles, but definitely some help.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real pleasure to see results in removing the puffiness and dark circles associated with lack of sleep or just a little too much of a good time.</li>
            <li>only positive thing I can say about this product is the applicator.</li>
            <li>And old lady I know says that this stuff does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really surprised about the reviews.</li>
            <li>The only thing I have noticed is that if applied to heavily it does leave a light residue so to avoid this I gently tap the serum around my eyes after applying it with the wand.</li>
            <li>when I first purchased it, from the Clinique counter at my local Belk&#x27;s, I definitely got the impression it was meant as a supplement product, and that&#x27;s how I use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting old and my eyes are starting to look like I always need a nap.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I have a difficult time finding eye creams-especially effective ones.</li>
            <li>i am not sure about using it at night time since it seems like quick fix, immediate type of product.</li>
            <li>Female that was hoping this product would get rid of puffiness and dark circle that for whatever reason is only under my right eye?</li>
            <li>The rolling ball is cold and itÂ´s very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It does make my eyes water and made the skin around them very sensitive to sunlight and other products.</li>

            <li> acne prone, few lines, oily-very oily, sensitive, semi pigmented</li>
            <li> (check)lllllll used the product faithfully for a long period of time (check)</li>
            <li> but i mean ,you can depuff your eye with the ring finger and gently massaging the area.</li>
            <li> The Garnier worked better, the puffiness wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad, though the circles were still dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally, I find eye creams to be too heavy during the day with eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on one eye with the Garnier on the other for two weeks.</li>
            <li> The Garnier was thrown in the drawer with the other failures.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove wrinkles like other creams, it just de-puffs.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the product is very sticky-and this makes it difficult to apply other products or make up over this serum.</li>
            <li> I suffer with seasonal allergies and chronic insomnia, hence the dark, puffy circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> product did not help with my dark circles or my puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> Reduces my puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> so I cannot speak to its ability to reduce dark circles (there is concealer for that)</li>
            <li> That being said, the bags under my eyes are the size of your typical piece of carry-on luggage.</li>
            <li> I use it on my eyes and on my forehead, around my mouth - anywhere it is tight and/or wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizes the eye area but there really is no significant effect that takes place.</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles both under my eyes and in the corners by my nose.  </li>
            <li> This eye serum really does nothing at all and for the price and brand name, is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Seriously a waste of money.</li>
            <li> look heavy and swollen.</li>
            <li> i think the online price is a few bucks cheaper than macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The only complaint was it is a little bit expensive for the 0.5 ounces</li>
            <li> After two weeks, the darkness has faded, the small lines at the corners of my eyes have lessened and within 30 minutes of use, the puffiness is almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> keep the bottle in the refrigerator, as the cold further enhances the process).</li>
            <li> They should take it off the market and refund the money everyone spent on this useless product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to get rid of the embarrassing problem, spending lots of unnecessary money and wasting time.  </li>
            <li> They seem to be broken and worn out.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but works.</li>
            <li> They circles under my eyes are still puffy regardless of whether or not I use this expensive product.</li>
            <li> I,m sorry</li>
            <li> This stuff works as well as cold cream or a popsicle applied to your face.</li>
            <li> but this is worthless.  </li>
            <li> worst product ever.</li>

            <li> I suffer with seasonal allergies and chronic insomnia, hence the dark, puffy circles under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to get rid of the embarrassing problem, spending lots of unnecessary money and wasting time.  After reading about this product in a ladies magazine, that explained how applying caffeine topically could greatly reduce puffiness I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my hands on this product.  I was absolutely amazed with the fast results....I&#x27;m a big fan of Clinique products.  I consider them to be top of the line, while maintaining affordability.  I highly recommend this product.  (The salesperson gave me a pointer that seems to add to the depuffing results, keep the bottle in the refrigerator, as the cold further enhances the process).</li>
            <li> I like the soothing effect this product has on my puffy eyes! Try it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48, have chronic insomnia, work at a computer all day and don&#x27;t drink enough water. That being said, the bags under my eyes are the size of your typical piece of carry-on luggage. Over the last six months, I&#x27;ve tried four types of \\&quot;anti-puff\\&quot;, \\&quot;anti-dark circles\\&quot; and \\&quot;serums\\&quot;: ROC Retinol Correction Eye Cream, Garnier Skin Renew Anti-Puff Eye Roll-On, Clinique All About Eyes Serum and last month, I bought and tried L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Micro-Pulse Eye Correction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the ROC product first. I followed all the directions and used it every day. I saw no change at all. Then I got the Garnier product. It seemed to work somewhat. When I got the trial size Clinique product, I used the Garnier on one eye and the Clinique on the other, just to see which product worked better. The Garnier worked better, the puffiness wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad, though the circles were still dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While on shopping trip at Ulta, looking for eye makeup remover, I stumbled on the L&#x27;Oreal product. It was around $12 and I had a 50% off of any product coupon. I&#x27;ve been using it on one eye with the Garnier on the other for two weeks. The Garnier was thrown in the drawer with the other failures. The L&#x27;Oreal product works. After two weeks, the darkness has faded, the small lines at the corners of my eyes have lessened and within 30 minutes of use, the puffiness is almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> This moisturizes the eye area but there really is no significant effect that takes place.The roller ball is cool and it wakes you up and depuffes your eye but i mean ,you can depuff your eye with the ring finger and gently massaging the area.You dont need to buy something to do that.I would reccommend the all about eyes cream because that works so much better than this.</li>
            <li> Both items are great!</li>
            <li> Really takes care of the eye puffiness!</li>
            <li> Just ok--nothing special.</li>
            <li> Please spend your money on a different eye product.   This eye serum really does nothing at all and for the price and brand name, is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Truly works.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes, I cannot not use certain sunscreens and mascaras because my eyes water profusely when applied. Because of this, I have a difficult time finding eye creams-especially effective ones. All about eyes sounded like the perfect product because Clinique claims to have hypo-allergenic products, and I have problems with dark circles and puffy eyes from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did not help with my dark circles or my puffy eyes. I also tried keeping the tube in the fridge (as suggested by one of the counter girls) and this had no effect. It does make my eyes water and made the skin around them very sensitive to sunlight and other products. The consistency of the product is very sticky-and this makes it difficult to apply other products or make up over this serum. Additionally, it does not absorb very quickly and sat on top of my skin for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive thing I can say about this product is the applicator. Many companies have a rollerball eye product applicator now, but the other ones I have tried get stuck easily. I used this until the tube was gone and the roller ball worked just as well as the day I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;skin type: 20-something, acne prone, few lines, oily-very oily, sensitive, semi pigmented</li>
            <li> This is one of the most useless Clinique products I have ever tried. Yes, it is refreshing, but that&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s been zero effect on my skin. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I use an eye cream at night and this for day.  Personally, I find eye creams to be too heavy during the day with eye makeup.  This is light and refreshing and wakes you up (especially if you store it in the refrigerator for an extra oomph!).  I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it alone for my eyes, but I don&#x27;t really believe that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s intended for - when I first purchased it, from the Clinique counter at my local Belk&#x27;s, I definitely got the impression it was meant as a supplement product, and that&#x27;s how I use it.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but works. The puffy goes away, the roller is soothing, and it works! It will last awhile so it sort of balances out the price. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting old and my eyes are starting to look like I always need a nap. And old lady I know says that this stuff does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just a fancy tube of uselessness.</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles both under my eyes and in the corners by my nose.  I&amp;#34;ve used Clinique for years and trusted their products but this is worthless.  They should take it off the market and refund the money everyone spent on this useless product.  I used it for a month and didn&#x27;t see one tiny bit of difference.</li>
            <li> I love clinique, all this products are perfect, the serum is perfect you can feel it acting in your skin immediately</li>
            <li> Good product and delivered on time, the same as I order and I love it much.</li>
            <li> Seriously a waste of money. I used it every morning before makeup and before bed after a washed cleaned face, I left it in the fridge like recommended by the women who sold it to me. I&#x27;m a 28yrs. Female that was hoping this product would get rid of puffiness and dark circle that for whatever reason is only under my right eye? anyhow it did none of the things it promised. I&#x27;m vegetarian that only eats organically, I ONLY drink water that sometimes I put a hint of lemon and a stevia extract for sweetness, so.... DIET (check)lllllll sleep (check)lllllll followed directions and advice (check)lllllll used the product faithfully for a long period of time (check) (check) aaaand (check)lllllll throw Clinique all about Eye Serum for all skin types in the trash (check check!!!)</li>
            <li> Love this product! Been using it for years and I definitely notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use it for a couple of days - eyes look heavy and swollen. Love that it&#x27;s $10 cheaper on amazon compared to the retail stores here in Canada.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the eyes but it takes a while and I have personally not had any bags under the eyes. Use it daily as a routine and it there and others notice the difference after 6 weeks and more as you keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of eye serums and creams but this is the best. It&#x27;s a light weight liquid that goes on with a roller ball. It reduces puffiness and adds moisture under makeup.</li>
            <li> This product was stunning for me. My main problem with aging is sagging eyelids and puffy under eye area. This serum produced such a huge difference for me, it&#x27;s like I had some sort of eye-lift. I look years younger. I am really surprised about the reviews. Maybe the others did not understand what this product does. It doesn&#x27;t remove wrinkles like other creams, it just de-puffs. I even let my husband use it!</li>
            <li> This stuff works as well as cold cream or a popsicle applied to your face. Don&#x27;t bother to buy it. There was no change to my undereye bags.</li>
            <li> Great as all Clinique products.  Reduces severity of wrinkles.  Feels cool and refreshing going on.  Easy to apply; just rolls on.</li>
            <li> There are no plastic covers on two items. They seem to be broken and worn out.</li>
            <li> I have the product for almost a year now and use it as often as i can remember. They work well, I guess they could be more effective if I was more consistent... but that is just me. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this product because it really works and you definitely see the improvement,  but I only paid $28 at Macy&#x27;s (and got a bonus gift to boot)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not noticing any difference in the skin under my eyes.  They circles under my eyes are still puffy regardless of whether or not I use this expensive product.</li>
            <li> Works great. I have tried several others and this one works the best.</li>
            <li> Keep this in the refridgerator and pull it out anytime you need a refresher.  I use it on my eyes and on my forehead, around my mouth - anywhere it is tight and/or wrinkled.  Love this!</li>
            <li> My friend got me hooked on this product. I put this on about 5-10 minutes before applying my makeup. It&#x27;s great. Reduces my puffiness and dark circles. It&#x27;s one of the only products I buy every time I&#x27;m running out!</li>
            <li> IÂ´d buy it over and over again. ItÂ´s a great product. Helps with the bags under my eyes. The rolling ball is cold and itÂ´s very refreshing.</li>
            <li> worst product ever. My skin under my eye got caught in rollerball and got all cut up with fine cuts. Very painful.&lt;br /&gt;Had to return it.</li>
            <li> I,m sorry but I never seen any different,s when using it.I would not buy it again or tell anyone else to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real pleasure to see results in removing the puffiness and dark circles associated with lack of sleep or just a little too much of a good time. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visible results right away, don&#x27;t expect miracles, but definitely some help. sometimes dark circles result from sinus issues, but for the normal stuff like stress or lack of rest, this product helps relax the area around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Good for the puffy eyes. I use it for years.</li>
            <li> i think the online price is a few bucks cheaper than macy&#x27;s so that&#x27;s a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this helps to reduce puffiness. i use it in the morning before i put on my makeup. i am not sure about using it at night time since it seems like quick fix, immediate type of product. so i use an eye gel at night. from different company.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different eye treatments for puffiness and Clinique All About Eyes is by far the best. The result are almost immediate and are even more noticeable it you store this serum in the refrigerator. I do not use this serum on a daily basis so I cannot speak to its ability to reduce dark circles (there is concealer for that) but for puffy eyed mornings, there is nothing I have found that works better. The only thing I have noticed is that if applied to heavily it does leave a light residue so to avoid this I gently tap the serum around my eyes after applying it with the wand. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift for my sister. I must say she was very happy with it. She says that the product works very well and when she has needed it the most, it did the job. The only complaint was it is a little bit expensive for the 0.5 ounces</li>
            <li> Really helps with puffy eyes in the morning and it is mildly moisturizing but not greasy. I always make sure I have it on hand.</li>
            <li> It *feels* really good for a minute or two but does absolutely nothing for the puffiness.  I was so optimistic but alas, it was too good to be true!</li>
            <li> I really am getting results with this product. It reduces the puffiness under my eyes when I awake.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I use it every morning when I wake up and within about 10 minutes I feel more awake and the puffiness in my eyes is reduced signifcantly. The rollerball feels great on your eyes and it appears to be great even for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and helps with puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> treat your eyes to this product it works to reduce the puffyness around the eyes def a great product Love it!!!</li>
