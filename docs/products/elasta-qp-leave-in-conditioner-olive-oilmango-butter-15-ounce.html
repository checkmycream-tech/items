            <li>It works great for twist-outs.leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>

            <li>It leaves my hair moisturized, soft and smelling amazing!</li>
            <li>At first it feels nice on the hair.</li>
            <li>But if you have fine hair, it will just make your hair look oily.</li>
            <li>You can also get a huge 32 oz tub from Sally&#x27;s for $7.99.</li>
            <li>I primarily use it as the L (Leave in) while doing the LOC method on my twistouts.</li>

            <li>the smell is not bad and makes my hair more manageable I really like it!</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair feel nice and soft and</li>
            <li>but I think I put to much in my hair with more oil...</li>
            <li>and this is most definitely going to be part of my regimen :)</li>
            <li>If they take it out of this product, then I will be so happy and in-reluctant to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>If used with a small amount of coconut oil you can achieve a great definded style for a few days I dont like crunchy hair but want definition so this is affordable and great on natrual kinky coils.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected :) Love it on my hair and makes it so manageable.</li>
            <li>So I thought okay, maybe it will get better once my hair dried.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells kind of like pink lemonade, which I like.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a better deep conditioning product and this was the wonders.</li>
            <li>Used this for a twist out and love the smell its is a very citrus smell and a little strong</li>
            <li>The ingredients looked promising.</li>
            <li>my hair was curly, really really defined</li>
            <li>All the Elasta OP products have worked very well for me</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much product to do the trick...</li>

            <li>Highly recommended for natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have spent quite a bit of money on my healthy hair journey but this was very well spent</li>
            <li>Leaves my 4C hair so soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s light in consistency therefore, it won&#x27;t cause build up on the hair when placed on slightly unsparingly.</li>
            <li>and I have 4a-c natural hair.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, oily at all for me.</li>
            <li>I got this to transition from relaxed to natural to help soften both textures of my hair.</li>
            <li>Also, it will leave clumps of white sticky residue in you hair if you use too much.</li>

            <li> I went to work the next day looking a hot mess!</li>
            <li> A day later my hair feels super dried as if I washed it in hard water and my hair completely stripped.</li>
            <li> A little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I recommend however that you purchase this at walgreens because it&#x27;s usually sold at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> today i went about my wash routine, put the product on freshly washed hair , separated my hair in large  sections and twisted my hair and allowed to partially  air dry.</li>
            <li> I use to have a problem with dry brittle ends and moderate shedding</li>
            <li> whether you air dry, blow dry or hood dry, after washing, just a quarter size on each side of my hair is plenty.</li>
            <li> I have African American, curly ringlets and I like a heavy product.</li>
            <li> But I used it twice along with the QP curl defining, and my hair became very dry by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> I needed something to make my hair a bit softer, less dry</li>
            <li> I think a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way though, so don&#x27;t over do it.</li>
            <li> , the product price is not expensive and you get 15 ounces cant go wrong ladiess.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount of this in my hand and starting form the tips I work my way up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find products that don&#x27;t smell gross or plastic-y.</li>
            <li> I am Cherokee and Italian, I have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Yet, I scrolled down the ingredients list and noticed that it has one non-water soluble cone in it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, 4a hair that tends to get dry.  </li>
            <li> I dont often find a product that works so well on both textures and that is not full of \\&quot;cones\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> If you have hair that can take a heavy product - that will weigh down the hair, then it will work.</li>
            <li> I also use a little bit to rejuvenate my hair once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> It completely dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> i said i had to let all the 4c natural hair girls know about this discovery because its so difficult to get curls without using gel.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s been little to no shedding!</li>
            <li> i cant say if this product will work for processed hair or other hair types sorry, but i guess you&#x27;ll can still give it a try</li>

            <li> I am a big fan of Elasta QP Olive oil &amp; mango butter moisturizer. So I thought the leave in conditioner would be great. The ingredients looked promising. I have relaxed hair, after washing I used this conditioner. Never again! It left a film on my hair (I did not use a lot). So I thought okay, maybe it will get better once my hair dried. NOT! I went to work the next day looking a hot mess! It completely dried out my hair. Now I have a new $6.00 jar of conditioner that is going in the trash!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! I primarily use it as the L (Leave in) while doing the LOC method on my twistouts. I also use a little bit to rejuvenate my hair once or twice a week. Leaves my 4C hair so soft and moisturized! I use to have a problem with dry brittle ends and moderate shedding but since I&#x27;ve started using this product my hair has had elasticity and there&#x27;s been little to no shedding! You can also get a huge 32 oz tub from Sally&#x27;s for $7.99.</li>
            <li> this leaves my hair feeling and looking moisturized the smell is not bad and makes my hair more manageable I really like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Elasta QP creme conditioning shampoo so I thought I would give this a try. At first it feels nice on the hair. A day later my hair feels super dried as if I washed it in hard water and my hair completely stripped. Plus I don&#x27;t like the smell, it sort of smell like lemongrass and chemical like. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> OMG,  i  was looking for a leave in to put in my hair after i have  washed it, so i purchased this product because it is loaded with  great ingredients. today i went about my wash routine, put the product on freshly washed hair , separated my hair in large  sections and twisted my hair and allowed to partially  air dry. now it was time to style my hair so i  untwisted my hair and finger detangled and there it was the  most amazing surprise, my hair was curly, really really defined i was in  shock  because i was not intending to define my curls like woww. i said i had to let all the 4c natural hair girls know about this discovery because its so difficult to get curls without using gel. , by the way the product smells wonderful, but it is a bit strong but i don&#x27;t mind. i cant say if this product will work for processed hair or other hair types sorry, but i guess you&#x27;ll can still give it a try, the product price is not expensive and you get 15 ounces cant go wrong ladiess.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for natural hair. I bought this product for the first time and was very happy with results. It works great for twist-outs.leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It got there on time! Exactly what I expected :) Love it on my hair and makes it so manageable. Even more so than Cantu Shea butter which is what I used before.</li>
            <li> Love the olive oil &amp; mango butter on my hair. This is a great leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great. Really great. If you have hair that can take a heavy product - that will weigh down the hair, then it will work. But if you have fine hair, it will just make your hair look oily. So I guess it depends on your type of hair. I have African American, curly ringlets and I like a heavy product. I use this in conjunction with Paul Mitchell Curling Lotion. I would definitely re-purchase this product when it runs out. I am happy with it. It&#x27;s hard to find products that don&#x27;t smell gross or plastic-y.</li>
            <li> All the Elasta OP products have worked very well for me and I have 4a-c natural hair. I love using this as a styler and it has a great smell.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and I must say do love the results I am getting. It makes my hair softer and hair do look fuller and well maintained. I am also using the hair moisturizer and it keeps my scalp conditioned.</li>
            <li> I am Cherokee and Italian, I have thick hair.  I needed something to make my hair a bit softer, less dry and I gave this a try.  After I towel-dry my hair I put a small amount of this in my hand and starting form the tips I work my way up.  It gave my hair a bit more wave as well.  Not heavy, oily at all for me. Nor did it leave any residue.  Smells good and leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner in my opinion is by far the best leave in I&#x27;ve ever used for my 3a/b hair texture! It leaves my hair moisturized, soft and smelling amazing! I recommend however that you purchase this at walgreens because it&#x27;s usually sold at a reasonable price. I&#x27;d say from $5.99-$7.99.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days but I already see and feel a big difference.  I have very thick, long, 4a hair that tends to get dry.  It doesn&#x27;t take much product to do the trick...and it makes my hair feel nice and soft and it looks moisturized.  Also, it smells kind of like pink lemonade, which I like.</li>
            <li> Would not buy again not compatible with my hair</li>
            <li> Best conditioner/gel in history of hair style!! The smell is amazing! 100% recommended</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used some from my daughter and since then I&#x27;ve been buying it. It softens my hair and brings the curls out.</li>
            <li> Today, I purchased this for my 4c hair. It is to soon to rate high. However, I immediately saw my hair look softer but I think I put to much in my hair with more oil...my mistake. I think a little goes a long way. I will go to bed and see how this creme of glory look in the morning. I am happy that my hair isn&#x27;t dry looking, but I don&#x27;t want the greasy look either...time will tell, and I will reflect to you later-sign healthy growing!</li>
            <li> I got this to transition from relaxed to natural to help soften both textures of my hair.

It is still great, probably better than before, and does exactly what i want it to do. Moisturizes well and makes hair more manageable. A little goes a long way though, so don&#x27;t over do it. And the smell is sooooooooo goooooood!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a better deep conditioning product and this was the wonders. Yet, I scrolled down the ingredients list and noticed that it has one non-water soluble cone in it. If they take it out of this product, then I will be so happy and in-reluctant to use it everyday. Other than that it smells wonderful and it&#x27;s light in consistency therefore, it won&#x27;t cause build up on the hair when placed on slightly unsparingly.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and keeps the more coarse hair manageable. Glad I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is perfect for adding moisture to damaged hair, it add resilience, elasticity, manageability and strength, great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product just to experiment with different leave-in conditioners and wooooow!!! First off the smell is sensational. But most importantly it keeps my hair perfectly moisturized without weighing it down at all. I have relaxed hair but I stretch for6 months at a time. I dont often find a product that works so well on both textures and that is not full of \\&quot;cones\\&quot;. Plus it has done miracles for keeping my ends healthy throughout my stretches. The shine is OUT OF THIS WORLD!! whether you air dry, blow dry or hood dry, after washing, just a quarter size on each side of my hair is plenty. A little really goes a long way. I have spent quite a bit of money on my healthy hair journey but this was very well spent and this is most definitely going to be part of my regimen :)</li>
            <li> Used this for a twist out and love the smell its is a very citrus smell and a little strong but I didnt mind. If used with a small amount of coconut oil you can achieve a great definded style for a few days I dont like crunchy hair but want definition so this is affordable and great on natrual kinky coils. It added shine and enouph oil for these winter months. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I brought this specifically for the olive oil conditioning.  But I used it twice along with the QP curl defining, and my hair became very dry by the end of the day. Also, it will leave clumps of white sticky residue in you hair if you use too much. My hair was also very frizzy, and pouffy.  I can not use it, but it does smell good!</li>
            <li> Man this stuff is SOOOO good. made my 500C hair SMOOOOOOOOTH up in this piece and it smell scrumptious. Yes SIIRRRRRR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;P</li>
