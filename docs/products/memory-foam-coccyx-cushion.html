            <li>/&gt;We ended up being very pleased with it for my daughter!</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>This product has been a great aid for me.</li>
            <li>and I now have a happy butt.</li>
            <li>It felt great when it arrived</li>
            <li>Great for prolonged sitting - like with a desk job.</li>
            <li>I think it was a great relief for him</li>
            <li>The two have saved me a great deal of pain.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>this cushion does a good job for the price.  </li>
            <li>I purchased one of these almost 10 years ago for my wife and she loved it.</li>
            <li>I know this is memory foam, but memory foam is not any good if it compresses all the way and provides zero support.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s still good for your tailbone?  </li>
            <li>I purchased  a cushion from another company and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>great item,  very comfortable for my car</li>
            <li>I was expecting great things from this cushion because of my love of my memory foam mattress.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this cushion...</li>
            <li>LOVE IT! ...</li>
            <li>The firmer ones are better!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how it got so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Il liked this cushion.</li>
            <li>The tail bone cut-out is a nice touch</li>
            <li>The carrying handle comes in handy.  </li>
            <li>you are having tailbone pain of your own, this pillow might help you.</li>
            <li>The absolute best cushion for both coccyx pain and pudendal nerve compression.</li>
            <li>It effectively relieves the tailbone pressure so that I no longer have the pain I used to have.</li>
            <li>Nice on the tail bone.</li>
            <li>did great, got them right out to me.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it worked great right from the start.  </li>
            <li>I found this to be very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable and helps.</li>
            <li>This cushion is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable, hasn&#x27;t lost its cushion.  </li>
            <li>Have ordered another brand and hope it works out better.</li>
            <li>The cushion looked and sat OK, but the smell from the foam was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I think the tush cush is a much better product.</li>
            <li>so I spend many hours a day in my chair teaching.  </li>
            <li>Part of the problem is that teaching guitar requires you to lean forward and put most of your weight on the front of the cushion where it is the thinnest.</li>
            <li>But it is still better than no cushion.  </li>
            <li>If I double the cushioning it just might be perfect.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Amazon let me return it!  : )</li>
            <li>Somethign is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I have cheaper pillows that I keep in stationary locations, but this one is my favorite and travels with me.</li>
            <li>I just LOVE it.</li>
            <li>stumbled on this product and, boy, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok , but I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>I have one in my car and three in the house where I sit the most.</li>
            <li>I have a couple different kinds and this is the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>The one I had at home seems to work better than the one at work.</li>
            <li>I have many others but the contour and design of the Coccyx</li>
            <li>This pillow is very comfortable, easy to carry and has a washable zip off cover.</li>
            <li>After recovering from surgery, this pillow is the best one I purchased to help me sit for long periods of time.  </li>
            <li>Worth every cent!!</li>
            <li>With a Memory Foam Coccyx Cushion, you&#x27;ll be more comfortable and have the support you need.</li>
            <li>Sculpted design is anatomically correct making it more comfortable for your thighs and bottom&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since day one I have told her that it is the problem with the way and position that she sit on the chair and of course the cheap chair in the office, she does feel much better now.</li>
            <li>This cushion makes my husband&#x27;s life much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>This cushion would be great if it didn&#x27;t compress completely after sitting on it.  </li>
            <li>Think she will be plesantly surprised and happy with this seat that has memory foam..</li>
            <li>did e-mail Amazon right away and the seller contacted me immediately and was eager to do whatever was necessary to make me happy (which I was VERY pleased with!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so its easy to see the road.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Purchased the Memory Foam Coccyx Cushion orders through Amazon and they were received very quickly.  </li>
            <li>and  I like the added convience of the strap/handle which makes it easy to take along anywhere and for travel.</li>
            <li>It does sqwish down when you sit on it, but the memory foam is wonderful at feeling like your rear is floating (almost)on the chair.</li>
            <li>My hip is fine now, but I still keep it on my chair at work.  </li>
            <li>This is an almost perfect little pillow.</li>
            <li>Solves the sore butt problem, much better than I expected, and great for the price..</li>
            <li>The U-shaped cutout on the back of the cushion allows your tailbone to float, greatly reducing discomfort in this area.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought the Matrix and have had comfortable driving ever since.  </li>
            <li>i could have gone out into the garden &amp; picked one out for free.</li>
            <li>The one in the car helps a great deal when we attend meetings in a site that has folding wooden chairs.</li>
            <li>If you work at a desk all day like me this is a great addition for your back and bottom.  </li>
            <li>My husband is disabled and uses his wheelchair and does a lot of sitting so this was wonderful for him!</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>and I would imagine that sitting at a desk in a more normal manner would make this cushion more comfortable than how I have to use it.</li>
            <li>This cushion is very comfortable, my back is much better now!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really skinny &amp; need a cushion for most every seat @</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this pillow.  </li>
            <li>So wont complain too much :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only good for the car, or a well padded chair.</li>
            <li>Great little cushion for the car its comfortable and raises me up</li>
            <li>Experienced extreme pain while sitting with problems getting up.  </li>
            <li>Buyer very much beware!</li>
            <li>so I think it is better than the other nice foam I had on my desk chair that didn&#x27;t have the coccyx hole.</li>
            <li>the price is right, the service is quick and your tailbone will thank you.</li>
            <li>I purchased this pad before a road trip from San Diego to Seattle and back on my own.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone with the same kind of issues.</li>
            <li>Used this cushion only for a week or so for coccyx pain- makes sitting for prolonged periods a bit more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Great for the first 5 seconds, till it squishes down to nothing.</li>
            <li>It says right on the label that it is 100% urethane foam.  </li>
            <li>, it turned out to be just perfect for my daughter, who weighs a bit less than I do, and also has back</li>
            <li>Actually, my mother-in-law LOVED this and finds it very useful for driving (she&#x27;s short and it helps with visibility as well as comfort.)  </li>
            <li>The cushion does tend to flatten out after time and it isn&#x27;t as comfortable as it was new.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this item as it has been a great help for me in relieving low back pain.</li>
            <li>This incredibly comfortable cushion gives you a truly personal fit.</li>
            <li>Alleviates back pain on coccyx, is durable, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I put it on the wooden chair and feel very comfortable.</li>
            <li>We used these one recent weekend at a civic center and found that we were able to enjoy more comfort in being seated for both morning and afternoon sessions.</li>
            <li>This is my first one.</li>
            <li>I will say this first.  </li>
            <li>And it really does help to adjust my posture!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, the cut-out at the back helps to ease rectal pain.</li>
            <li>Really takes pressure off those sitz bones!</li>
            <li>It is a pain to have to use this, but I&#x27;m glad to have finally found something to help!</li>
            <li>My tail bone would have felt better if I just used a regular bed pillow.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This cushion is very comfortable to sit on for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he really says it makes traveling much more comfortable than he previously had without it.</li>
            <li>I brought this for my wife to use in the office, she feeling pain in the hip area recently and see so much doctor and everyone of them couldn&#x27;t really help her because all test showing she is  healthy.</li>
            <li>It is the only reason I can sit right now!!</li>
            <li>It reacts to your body heat, molding itself to your curves while you sit and goes right back to its original shape when you stand</li>
            <li>It flattens quickly and doesn&#x27;t bounce back as much as when first purchased - right within the first week.</li>
            <li>This is, at least, a good outcome, but I am still without the item that I was looking for, and I certainly won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
            <li>Goes flat very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I work in a virtual call center and have been looking for a product that would allow me to be able to sit for longer periods of time without being in excruciating pain.</li>
            <li>My Dad uses this cushion to sit on in the car, not only is it extremely comfortable but it also makes it easier for him to get in and out of the car.</li>
            <li>Under my weight it doesn&#x27;t sink much even after sitting on it for 3+ hours straight.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be very durable.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to this cushion</li>
            <li>Has really helped pressure sores from my husband sleeping in his recliner.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my elderly parent and the cushion did not have enough softness for them to sit comfortably.</li>
            <li>and this really helped me by taking g the pressure off my spine as I sit.</li>
            <li>I use it in congruence with a lumbar support that I secure to the back of my chairs.</li>
            <li>This so called &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; gives you about as much padding as a piece of paper.</li>
            <li>Fits on my office chair well and really helped by tailbone out during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>very uncomfotable  </li>
            <li>I really hesitated buying this because of the reviews and expense.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that wants to sit in comfort, plus I can take it anywhere</li>
            <li>Thank you solo much.</li>
            <li>cushion itself is comfortable and actually helps with my posture because of its design.</li>
            <li>My tailbone hurt too much to sit on it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the slant shape of this pillow.</li>
            <li>In fact I used a pillow on the return trip and was much happier.</li>
            <li>I use it for my work chair and really like it.</li>
            <li>It made me comfortable the entire time.</li>
            <li>it works but the hole where the coccyx area goes can be uncomfortabe due to the seams.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s better than none, but i will most likely buy a different one.</li>
            <li>Better than nothing slightly.</li>
            <li>Recently took a 12 hour trip and it helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The cut out in the back is a great idea; it makes a big difference for low back pain sufferers reducing the pressure on your tailbone while sitting at your desk.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This cushion has done nothing for me because of its high compressability.  </li>
            <li>I am incredibly happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone who feels sharp, shooting and long term lower back pain.</li>
            <li>This goes flat quick..</li>
            <li>Much too soft.</li>
            <li>It feels good to sit on when at the computer, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s helping my back pain in the long-run.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would help on long plane rides but it flattens out to quickly and moves around under you if you squirm in the seat like I do.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my sister&#x27;s birthday for her new car..</li>
            <li>Ever since I lost over 100 pounds, I have newly discovered bones that I never knew existed.</li>
            <li>Good but not as firm as I expected</li>
            <li>I got it and as soon as I sat on it, I thought, those people are right, it squishes all the way flat.</li>
            <li>exactly as described would definitely buy again</li>
            <li>This is the medium firmness, I am contemplating getting the extra firm model to see if it holds its shape any better but don&#x27;t want to waste more money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping it and hoping it keeps popping back into position long enough for the expense to be worthwhile.</li>
            <li>The item received is, as stated before, a slab pillow made of cheap egg crate foam, flat on one side, bumpy on the other, cutout at the back, with a very cheap black</li>
            <li>It has honestly fixed every problem I feel from sitting 8 hours a day at my desk.  </li>
            <li>but none have helped reduce my back pain as much as this cushion has.</li>
            <li>The pillow&#x27;s gradual slope helps correct posture by tilting your pelvis forward to restore the natural lumbar curve.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my back hurt so much after one way.</li>
            <li>We bought two -- one for home and one for the car, but will be buying at least one more, so that he can have one for the living/dining room and one for the office.</li>
            <li>If I had known this cushion was so soft</li>
            <li>really makes a big difference.</li>
            <li>It is better than another one that I bought that was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li>I really was disappointed and was not disappointed at all when I lost it on my latest trip.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those back end problems.</li>
            <li>But doesn&#x27;t really hold its firmness for too long.</li>
            <li>When she rises, it goes back to it normal shape.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although this wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected (it flattened out when I first sat on it)</li>
            <li>Seems to smash down more than other ones I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>May have to order one for myself when I get my next new car.</li>
            <li>We even have special ergonomic chairs, but they dip down in the back and it causes me to hunch over.  </li>
            <li>cushion is easy to carry around with you--very portable--and gives just enough support if you are a small framed person.  </li>
            <li>And if you have any issues with your hemroids or butt in general, it&#x27;s not going to help you.  </li>
            <li>It is simple, light-as-air \\&quot;egg crate\\&quot; foam that compresses completely just being squeezed between thumb and fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cushion is not firm enough.</li>
            <li>I have a back problem that shoots pain down a nerve in my right leg.  </li>
            <li>For all I know, the other sellers may be selling the real thing, but this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>My problem lies not only with my coccyx and lower back but also, due to very severe injuries with my buttocks and thighs, I need a lot of extra cushioning!</li>
            <li>Also a little large to carry around when traveling.</li>
            <li>Also the zipper to remove the cover has the head right at one of the front corners, so a person could end up with the back of their leg pressing down on that head unless careful of how you&#x27;re sitting.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I know this is memory foam, but memory foam is not any good if it compresses all the way and provides zero support.  </li>

            <li> Very comfortable and helps.</li>
            <li> This cushion is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable, hasn&#x27;t lost its cushion.  </li>
            <li> Have ordered another brand and hope it works out better.</li>
            <li> The cushion looked and sat OK, but the smell from the foam was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I think the tush cush is a much better product.</li>
            <li> so I spend many hours a day in my chair teaching.  </li>
            <li> Part of the problem is that teaching guitar requires you to lean forward and put most of your weight on the front of the cushion where it is the thinnest.</li>
            <li> But it is still better than no cushion.  </li>
            <li> If I double the cushioning it just might be perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Amazon let me return it!  : )</li>
            <li> Somethign is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I have cheaper pillows that I keep in stationary locations, but this one is my favorite and travels with me.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE it.</li>
            <li> stumbled on this product and, boy, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok , but I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I have one in my car and three in the house where I sit the most.</li>
            <li> I have a couple different kinds and this is the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> The one I had at home seems to work better than the one at work.</li>
            <li> I have many others but the contour and design of the Coccyx</li>
            <li> This pillow is very comfortable, easy to carry and has a washable zip off cover.</li>
            <li> After recovering from surgery, this pillow is the best one I purchased to help me sit for long periods of time.  </li>
            <li> Worth every cent!!</li>
            <li> With a Memory Foam Coccyx Cushion, you&#x27;ll be more comfortable and have the support you need.</li>
            <li> Sculpted design is anatomically correct making it more comfortable for your thighs and bottom&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since day one I have told her that it is the problem with the way and position that she sit on the chair and of course the cheap chair in the office, she does feel much better now.</li>
            <li> This cushion makes my husband&#x27;s life much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This cushion would be great if it didn&#x27;t compress completely after sitting on it.  </li>
            <li> Think she will be plesantly surprised and happy with this seat that has memory foam..</li>
            <li> did e-mail Amazon right away and the seller contacted me immediately and was eager to do whatever was necessary to make me happy (which I was VERY pleased with!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so its easy to see the road.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Purchased the Memory Foam Coccyx Cushion orders through Amazon and they were received very quickly.  </li>
            <li> and  I like the added convience of the strap/handle which makes it easy to take along anywhere and for travel.</li>
            <li> It does sqwish down when you sit on it, but the memory foam is wonderful at feeling like your rear is floating (almost)on the chair.</li>
            <li> My hip is fine now, but I still keep it on my chair at work.  </li>
            <li> This is an almost perfect little pillow.</li>
            <li> Solves the sore butt problem, much better than I expected, and great for the price..</li>
            <li> The U-shaped cutout on the back of the cushion allows your tailbone to float, greatly reducing discomfort in this area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought the Matrix and have had comfortable driving ever since.  </li>
            <li> i could have gone out into the garden &amp; picked one out for free.</li>
            <li> The one in the car helps a great deal when we attend meetings in a site that has folding wooden chairs.</li>
            <li> If you work at a desk all day like me this is a great addition for your back and bottom.  </li>
            <li> My husband is disabled and uses his wheelchair and does a lot of sitting so this was wonderful for him!</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> and I would imagine that sitting at a desk in a more normal manner would make this cushion more comfortable than how I have to use it.</li>
            <li> This cushion is very comfortable, my back is much better now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really skinny &amp; need a cushion for most every seat @</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this pillow.  </li>
            <li> So wont complain too much :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only good for the car, or a well padded chair.</li>
            <li> Great little cushion for the car its comfortable and raises me up</li>
            <li> Experienced extreme pain while sitting with problems getting up.  </li>
            <li> Buyer very much beware!</li>
            <li> so I think it is better than the other nice foam I had on my desk chair that didn&#x27;t have the coccyx hole.</li>
            <li> the price is right, the service is quick and your tailbone will thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pad before a road trip from San Diego to Seattle and back on my own.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with the same kind of issues.</li>
            <li> Used this cushion only for a week or so for coccyx pain- makes sitting for prolonged periods a bit more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great for the first 5 seconds, till it squishes down to nothing.</li>
            <li> It says right on the label that it is 100% urethane foam.  </li>
            <li> , it turned out to be just perfect for my daughter, who weighs a bit less than I do, and also has back</li>
            <li> Actually, my mother-in-law LOVED this and finds it very useful for driving (she&#x27;s short and it helps with visibility as well as comfort.)  </li>
            <li> The cushion does tend to flatten out after time and it isn&#x27;t as comfortable as it was new.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this item as it has been a great help for me in relieving low back pain.</li>
            <li> This incredibly comfortable cushion gives you a truly personal fit.</li>
            <li> Alleviates back pain on coccyx, is durable, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I put it on the wooden chair and feel very comfortable.</li>
            <li> We used these one recent weekend at a civic center and found that we were able to enjoy more comfort in being seated for both morning and afternoon sessions.</li>
            <li> This is my first one.</li>
            <li> I will say this first.  </li>
            <li> And it really does help to adjust my posture!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, the cut-out at the back helps to ease rectal pain.</li>
            <li> Really takes pressure off those sitz bones!</li>
            <li> It is a pain to have to use this, but I&#x27;m glad to have finally found something to help!</li>
            <li> My tail bone would have felt better if I just used a regular bed pillow.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This cushion is very comfortable to sit on for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he really says it makes traveling much more comfortable than he previously had without it.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my wife to use in the office, she feeling pain in the hip area recently and see so much doctor and everyone of them couldn&#x27;t really help her because all test showing she is  healthy.</li>
            <li> It is the only reason I can sit right now!!</li>
            <li> It reacts to your body heat, molding itself to your curves while you sit and goes right back to its original shape when you stand</li>
            <li> It flattens quickly and doesn&#x27;t bounce back as much as when first purchased - right within the first week.</li>
            <li> This is, at least, a good outcome, but I am still without the item that I was looking for, and I certainly won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> Goes flat very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I work in a virtual call center and have been looking for a product that would allow me to be able to sit for longer periods of time without being in excruciating pain.</li>
            <li> My Dad uses this cushion to sit on in the car, not only is it extremely comfortable but it also makes it easier for him to get in and out of the car.</li>
            <li> Under my weight it doesn&#x27;t sink much even after sitting on it for 3+ hours straight.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be very durable.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to this cushion</li>
            <li> Has really helped pressure sores from my husband sleeping in his recliner.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my elderly parent and the cushion did not have enough softness for them to sit comfortably.</li>
            <li> and this really helped me by taking g the pressure off my spine as I sit.</li>
            <li> I use it in congruence with a lumbar support that I secure to the back of my chairs.</li>
            <li> This so called &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; gives you about as much padding as a piece of paper.</li>
            <li> Fits on my office chair well and really helped by tailbone out during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> very uncomfotable  </li>
            <li> I really hesitated buying this because of the reviews and expense.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that wants to sit in comfort, plus I can take it anywhere</li>
            <li> Thank you solo much.</li>
            <li> cushion itself is comfortable and actually helps with my posture because of its design.</li>
            <li> My tailbone hurt too much to sit on it.  </li>
            <li> I really like the slant shape of this pillow.</li>
            <li> In fact I used a pillow on the return trip and was much happier.</li>
            <li> I use it for my work chair and really like it.</li>
            <li> It made me comfortable the entire time.</li>
            <li> it works but the hole where the coccyx area goes can be uncomfortabe due to the seams.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s better than none, but i will most likely buy a different one.</li>
            <li> Better than nothing slightly.</li>
            <li> Recently took a 12 hour trip and it helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The cut out in the back is a great idea; it makes a big difference for low back pain sufferers reducing the pressure on your tailbone while sitting at your desk.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This cushion has done nothing for me because of its high compressability.  </li>
            <li> I am incredibly happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone who feels sharp, shooting and long term lower back pain.</li>
            <li> This goes flat quick..</li>
            <li> Much too soft.</li>
            <li> It feels good to sit on when at the computer, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s helping my back pain in the long-run.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would help on long plane rides but it flattens out to quickly and moves around under you if you squirm in the seat like I do.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my sister&#x27;s birthday for her new car..</li>
            <li> Ever since I lost over 100 pounds, I have newly discovered bones that I never knew existed.</li>
            <li> Good but not as firm as I expected</li>
            <li> I got it and as soon as I sat on it, I thought, those people are right, it squishes all the way flat.</li>
            <li> exactly as described would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> This is the medium firmness, I am contemplating getting the extra firm model to see if it holds its shape any better but don&#x27;t want to waste more money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping it and hoping it keeps popping back into position long enough for the expense to be worthwhile.</li>
            <li> The item received is, as stated before, a slab pillow made of cheap egg crate foam, flat on one side, bumpy on the other, cutout at the back, with a very cheap black</li>
            <li> It has honestly fixed every problem I feel from sitting 8 hours a day at my desk.  </li>
            <li> but none have helped reduce my back pain as much as this cushion has.</li>
            <li> The pillow&#x27;s gradual slope helps correct posture by tilting your pelvis forward to restore the natural lumbar curve.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my back hurt so much after one way.</li>
            <li> We bought two -- one for home and one for the car, but will be buying at least one more, so that he can have one for the living/dining room and one for the office.</li>
            <li> If I had known this cushion was so soft</li>
            <li> really makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> It is better than another one that I bought that was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I really was disappointed and was not disappointed at all when I lost it on my latest trip.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those back end problems.</li>
            <li> But doesn&#x27;t really hold its firmness for too long.</li>
            <li> When she rises, it goes back to it normal shape.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected (it flattened out when I first sat on it)</li>
            <li> Seems to smash down more than other ones I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> May have to order one for myself when I get my next new car.</li>
            <li> We even have special ergonomic chairs, but they dip down in the back and it causes me to hunch over.  </li>
            <li> cushion is easy to carry around with you--very portable--and gives just enough support if you are a small framed person.  </li>
            <li> And if you have any issues with your hemroids or butt in general, it&#x27;s not going to help you.  </li>
            <li> It is simple, light-as-air \\&quot;egg crate\\&quot; foam that compresses completely just being squeezed between thumb and fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cushion is not firm enough.</li>
            <li> I have a back problem that shoots pain down a nerve in my right leg.  </li>
            <li> For all I know, the other sellers may be selling the real thing, but this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> My problem lies not only with my coccyx and lower back but also, due to very severe injuries with my buttocks and thighs, I need a lot of extra cushioning!</li>
            <li> Also a little large to carry around when traveling.</li>
            <li> Also the zipper to remove the cover has the head right at one of the front corners, so a person could end up with the back of their leg pressing down on that head unless careful of how you&#x27;re sitting.</li>
            <li> and I used it at work because I drive for a living and by the the third day it was flat</li>
            <li> and it is totally flat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a flat slab pillow made of urethane foam with no sculpting of any sort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It went completely flat as soon as I sat on it</li>
            <li> , Did not keep its shape, smashed flat after sitting on it for a while.</li>
            <li> It collapes flat when my wife, all ninety pounds, sits on it providing no support.</li>
            <li> It does alleviate some pressure on the tailbone but it does go somewhat flat.</li>
            <li> Even with all the use, it hasn&#x27;t gotten flat over time.</li>
            <li> and I felt like a little old lady (I&#x27;m in my 20s)!</li>
            <li> Cushion cover description mentions it comes in 3 levels of firmness- soft, regular&amp; firm.</li>
            <li> Although the picture was the same the cushion was smaller and harder when you sit on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other back supports</li>
            <li> I have had 3 low back surgery&#x27;s &amp; multiple abdominal surgery&#x27;s due to Chronic Pancreatitis &amp; I have know idea how I ever survived b4 this pillow!?!  </li>
            <li> I bought this cushion for my Dad who has lost a lot of weight and cannot sit for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> So far, after a few weeks of use, I have not noticed any deflation in the cushion</li>
            <li> I expected this one to be the same</li>
            <li> I have a little concern about the longevity as she mentioned it is starting to compress after only 4 months.</li>
            <li> It is super hard, uncomfortable and sloped so much that sitting feels like doing a sit-up just to keep from sliding off.  </li>
            <li> Did not live uo to my expectations</li>
            <li> cushion was way to thick and high for my comfort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin enough for a car seat but offers enough support to function.  </li>
            <li> They could&#x27;ve easily solved this design stupidity by running the zipper up the side where the thicker end of the wedge would keep this from happening.</li>
            <li> The foam squished down so flat that it did not support the tail bone and the tail bone touches the chair.  </li>
            <li> helps to relieve my tailbone and gives a little extra cushioning to the chairs i sit in.</li>
            <li> I test drove several compact, fuel-efficient cars, including the Toyota Matrix, and felt pain in my tailbone after less than 30 minutes of driving, due to insufficient padding in the front seats.  </li>
            <li> I researched similar cushions quite extensively and noticed that a common complaint--the cushion flattens quickly--is not an issue here.  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble with my office chair and my back for ages until I took this to work.  </li>
            <li> I work at a desk, so the majority of my day is spent sitting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s typically quite painful to drive long distances, but the pad eliminates most of the pain during even a 8 hour drive.</li>
            <li> Larger than I expected and very firm.  </li>
            <li> I do like the cushion and would recommend it to someone who does not have extremely sever coccyx pain and nerve pain.</li>
            <li> Whether your lower back pain is caused by an injury, pregnancy or just working too hard, it can be hard to find relief - especially when you&#x27;re sitting down!</li>
            <li> so it falls flat and as hard as the surface you&#x27;re sitting on in no time at all.  </li>
            <li> Seller didn&#x27;t mention this in the description-But he also charged half the price of other sellers!</li>
            <li> would like a little less pressure on the sciatic though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s even a neat little velcro strap you can use to attach it to a chair or to carry it with you to a restaurant.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with my sacrum</li>
            <li> have a 14 hour plane ride in a few weeks</li>
            <li> I picked the firm pillow for added support.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does flatten down, but I still think any small bit of elevation of your tush and not the coccyx can&#x27;t help but relieve pressure on your tailbone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and is flat all around.</li>
            <li> But does help for a little bit!</li>
            <li> and you can bet that this little treasure will be making the trip with me!</li>
            <li> I have no more tail bone pain.</li>
            <li> Too small and too uncomfortable had to send it back-</li>
            <li> Maybe for a small lightweight person.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s to small</li>
            <li> only flaw is it is stiff for a couple of minutes when its cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;overall</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like how the memory foam smashes down to a thin cushion.</li>
            <li> I used in car and on hard curface.</li>
            <li> This thing is hard as a rock-</li>
            <li> It was confusingly advertised.</li>
            <li> I have a Lumbar Spine disc problem and driving a car is the WORST! - Causes me considerable back pain and some leg symptoms ...</li>
            <li> This cushion has a thick pad that holds up well under my 140lb frame.  </li>
            <li> Was using a worn out cushion, so when this thick cushion came, it was like heaven.  </li>
            <li> I have tried adjsuting the lumbar support on the chair to no avail, and decided it was time for a serious change.</li>
            <li> This cushion has made those hours less uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous waist of money.</li>
            <li> I have some bad disc in my lower back</li>
            <li> I bruised my tailbone and the round donut pillow I had purchased at the store was totally wrong for this type of injury.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I left it on a Southwest flight :(</li>
            <li> The memory pillow is fairly thin.</li>
            <li> it does not impove sittimg posture if anything it is worse would not recommend purcse of this product</li>
            <li> After some research, I realized I was putting unnecessary pressure on my tailbone and started on a search for some cushiony</li>
            <li> and it enables me to drive for longer periods with a broken tailbone.</li>
            <li> have requested a return with no cost to me, because they have engaged in false advertising.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortable and potentially not good if for someone who&#x27;s got diminished sensation.</li>
            <li> those new Airbus A380 Economy section seat bottoms are dreadful...</li>
            <li> The cushion does what its supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to dislike with the cushion, the problem is what it is, a pain in the butt.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for those unfortunate folks like me with a broken coccyx</li>
            <li> this caused sitting down to be EXTREMELY painful after a mere 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product at all.</li>
            <li> my fingers crossed that this cushion helps relieve the terrible pregnancy related coccyx pain I have!</li>
            <li> It was silly</li>
            <li> Product is virtually useless</li>
            <li> I am a very unhappy customer and what&#x27;s worse is that it came with a tag that said it was not returnable.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Also the cover has a very creepy feel to it.  </li>
            <li> but I am very disappointed  that it looks nothing like the photo online.</li>

            <li> I like the cushion. I&#x27;m really skinny &amp; need a cushion for most every seat @ home &amp; I keep one in the car too. I some times need to bring one of these cushions into a restaurant .The only thing that bothers me is the Velcro used for the handle...it pokes me so I put the pillow in a big pillow case. Problem solved!</li>
            <li> Memory foam isnt dense enough so seem to sink it - would be betterif it were a firmer tempur memory foam</li>
            <li> Got this item and put in my leather chair where I use the computer.  This SEAT cushions just flattens out, sitting on it now and it is totally flat. I am avg ht and weight so I don&#x27;t know how it got so many good reviews.  Have ordered another brand and hope it works out better.</li>
            <li> Just received this product.  Experienced extreme pain while sitting with problems getting up.  Since I received this product I do not have the pain I once had.</li>
            <li> This cushion did not work well.  When I sat on it, it flattened to the point that I felt like I was just sitting on the seat of the car and not the cushion at all.  Also, do not buy from this seller ASTAR.  I am returning the cushions and they are charging a $5 per cushion re-stocking fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After contacting ASTAR by email and complaining about the re-stocking fee, they ended up waiving the fee.</li>
            <li> Il liked this cushion. This is my first one. I used in car and on hard curface.</li>
            <li> I found this to be very comfortable.  I took it to movies, on airplanes etc.  Unfortunately, I left it on a Southwest flight :(</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Recently took a 12 hour trip and it helped tremendously. Highly recommend. Well made.</li>
            <li> I will say this first.  The cushion is great!  I have had trouble with my office chair and my back for ages until I took this to work.  I haven&#x27;t had a pain since!  That said, here is why I gave the product 3 instead of 5 stars.    This cushion was shrink wrapped when it arrived. When I opened it there was a horrid chemical smell.  The cushion looked and sat OK, but the smell from the foam was overwhelming.  I put it in the back room and left it to air, assuming that it was the shrink wrap that had held in the smell post-production.  It took almost a month before I could begin to use it.  Even at that, I am considering buying another for home.</li>
            <li> After experiencing weeks of lower back pain I decided to invest in this Coccyx pillow on the recommendation of a co-worker.  It has honestly fixed every problem I feel from sitting 8 hours a day at my desk.  We even have special ergonomic chairs, but they dip down in the back and it causes me to hunch over.  I have tried adjsuting the lumbar support on the chair to no avail, and decided it was time for a serious change. I am incredibly happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone who feels sharp, shooting and long term lower back pain.</li>
            <li> I recommend this item as it has been a great help for me in relieving low back pain. I work in a virtual call center and have been looking for a product that would allow me to be able to sit for longer periods of time without being in excruciating pain. I fractured my L4 vertebra years ago and sitting for extended time periods has been a problem for me. This product has been a great aid for me.</li>
            <li> My husband had a portion of his tailbone removed, and this let him sit in comfort in any chair, or car seat he chose.</li>
            <li> Seems to smash down more than other ones I&#x27;ve had.  I think the tush cush is a much better product.</li>
            <li> Great for the first 5 seconds, till it squishes down to nothing. &amp; I&#x27;m 110 lbs.  Weight not the issue. Better than nothing slightly.</li>
            <li> Not a glowing recommendation but this cushion does a good job for the price.  I teach guitar so I spend many hours a day in my chair teaching.  This cushion has made those hours less uncomfortable.  The cushion does tend to flatten out after time and it isn&#x27;t as comfortable as it was new.  Part of the problem is that teaching guitar requires you to lean forward and put most of your weight on the front of the cushion where it is the thinnest. But it is still better than no cushion.  The tail bone cut-out is a nice touch and I would imagine that sitting at a desk in a more normal manner would make this cushion more comfortable than how I have to use it.</li>
            <li> This is an almost perfect little pillow. My problem lies not only with my coccyx and lower back but also, due to very severe injuries with my buttocks and thighs, I need a lot of extra cushioning! The memory pillow is fairly thin. That is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars. In fact, the pillow works just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It molds to the shape of my body, providing much-needed support and comfort. And it really does help to adjust my posture! What&#x27;s more, the cut-out at the back helps to ease rectal pain. There&#x27;s even a neat little velcro strap you can use to attach it to a chair or to carry it with you to a restaurant. I am thinking of buying another one for stacking purposes. If I double the cushioning it just might be perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought the Brookstone version of this cushion. I think it was offered here at the time, but I no longer see it on their website either - it&#x27;s been replaced by a newer version at twice the price and no cut out.  Anyway, the cushion I have is identical to this one. The cut out in the back is a great idea; it makes a big difference for low back pain sufferers reducing the pressure on your tailbone while sitting at your desk. It does sqwish down when you sit on it, but the memory foam is wonderful at feeling like your rear is floating (almost)on the chair. I&#x27;ve tried several other back supports but none have helped reduce my back pain as much as this cushion has. I even use it at home on my recliner &amp; couch. It helps a lot. I&#x27;d recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this cushion for my Dad who has lost a lot of weight and cannot sit for long periods of time. My Dad uses this cushion to sit on in the car, not only is it extremely comfortable but it also makes it easier for him to get in and out of the car. This is a quality Memory Foam Cushion and I plan to buy another one for a chair in my Dad&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li> You need to change your picture and you need to let people know you can not return this item. I don&#x27;t know how it works but I am very disappointed  that it looks nothing like the photo online.</li>
            <li> Brought this when I injured my back in an accident. Very comfortable and helps. I use it in my chair while I sit at the computer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several days and I now have a happy butt. I have ordered another cushion from this company.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase and recommend it to others.  I researched similar cushions quite extensively and noticed that a common complaint--the cushion flattens quickly--is not an issue here.  This cushion works well and looks presentable.  Try it; you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I received this item from the seller medical department stores.&lt;br /&gt;I have requested this return through amazon as well as sending the same request to the seller, for the simple reason that the item advertised on amazon bears no resemblance, in looks or function, to the item I was sent. The item I received remains unopened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought an item that on amazon was described as follows (this is copy/paste from the page):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Whether your lower back pain is caused by an injury, pregnancy or just working too hard, it can be hard to find relief - especially when you&#x27;re sitting down! With a Memory Foam Coccyx Cushion, you&#x27;ll be more comfortable and have the support you need. It feels like you&#x27;re sitting on a cloud!&lt;br /&gt;  The U-shaped cutout on the back of the cushion allows your tailbone to float, greatly reducing discomfort in this area.&lt;br /&gt;  The pillow&#x27;s gradual slope helps correct posture by tilting your pelvis forward to restore the natural lumbar curve.&lt;br /&gt;  Sculpted design is anatomically correct making it more comfortable for your thighs and bottom&lt;br /&gt;  This incredibly comfortable cushion gives you a truly personal fit. It reacts to your body heat, molding itself to your curves while you sit and goes right back to its original shape when you stand up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems:&lt;br /&gt;The item received is not made of memory foam. It is simple, light-as-air \\&quot;egg crate\\&quot; foam that compresses completely just being squeezed between thumb and fingers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a flat slab pillow made of urethane foam with no sculpting of any sort.&lt;br /&gt;There is zero possibility for reaction to body heat, since it would be immediately flattened if anyone sits on the pillow. In addition, seeing as it is simple urethane foam as opposed to heavier memory foam, it cannot accomplish the molding function noted in the last bullet point,&lt;br /&gt;The item is completely different from the item in the picture. The item received is, as stated before, a slab pillow made of cheap egg crate foam, flat on one side, bumpy on the other, cutout at the back, with a very cheap black cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have requested a return with no cost to me, because they have engaged in false advertising. This item is nothing like what they described. Do not buy this item from medical department stores. For all I know, the other sellers may be selling the real thing, but this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I returned the item with a prepaid label sent to me by the seller, and have today received an email from amazon indicating that I will receive a refund for my entire purchase price. This is, at least, a good outcome, but I am still without the item that I was looking for, and I certainly won&#x27;t be buying this one again. Buyer very much beware!</li>
            <li> I brought this for my wife to use in the office, she feeling pain in the hip area recently and see so much doctor and everyone of them couldn&#x27;t really help her because all test showing she is  healthy. Since day one I have told her that it is the problem with the way and position that she sit on the chair and of course the cheap chair in the office, she does feel much better now.</li>
            <li> It felt great when it arrived and I used it at work because I drive for a living and by the the third day it was flat</li>
            <li> This cushion has a thick pad that holds up well under my 140lb frame.  Under my weight it doesn&#x27;t sink much even after sitting on it for 3+ hours straight.  I have a back problem that shoots pain down a nerve in my right leg.  It&#x27;s typically quite painful to drive long distances, but the pad eliminates most of the pain during even a 8 hour drive.</li>
            <li> It went completely flat as soon as I sat on it</li>
            <li> Actually, my mother-in-law LOVED this and finds it very useful for driving (she&#x27;s short and it helps with visibility as well as comfort.)  I have a little concern about the longevity as she mentioned it is starting to compress after only 4 months.</li>
            <li> This cushion helps me both at home and in my car with my tailbone problems. Highly recommended for those back end problems.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Bought two. One for home and one for work. Thinking about getting another one for a spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vend did great, got them right out to me.</li>
            <li> This cushion is not firm enough. If you have problems with your back or neck like I do don&#x27;t buy this one!</li>
            <li> Did not live uo to my expectations, Did not keep its shape, smashed flat after sitting on it for a while.</li>
            <li> It feels good to sit on when at the computer, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s helping my back pain in the long-run.  I would recommend giving it a try, however.</li>
            <li> I test drove several compact, fuel-efficient cars, including the Toyota Matrix, and felt pain in my tailbone after less than 30 minutes of driving, due to insufficient padding in the front seats.  This would have been a deal breaker, so I went on the Internet and found this memory-foam tailbone cushion (bought 2).  Went back to the dealership for a second test drive with the seat cushion in hand, placed it on the seat and took off.  Problem solved!  Bought the Matrix and have had comfortable driving ever since.  I did report the seat problem to the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Best purchase I have made in YEAR&#x27;S!  I have had 3 low back surgery&#x27;s &amp; multiple abdominal surgery&#x27;s due to Chronic Pancreatitis &amp; I have know idea how I ever survived b4 this pillow!?!  I NEVER leave home w/o it.  I even sleep w/it &amp; I can sleep thru the night w/o pain f/my back!!  The cover come&#x27;s off so you can wash it as well...everything about it is amazing!!  Worth every cent!!</li>
            <li> The foam squished down so flat that it did not support the tail bone and the tail bone touches the chair.  I returned this item.</li>
            <li> I rated this memory foam coccyx cushion five stars because it does what it claims to do.  It relieves stress from the lower back and coccyx area and has a removable, washable cover.  The cushion compresses in use but still gives plenty of support, and then it decompresses after use.  It seems to be very durable.  Thanks to this cushion I have no more tail bone pain.</li>
            <li> I got this for those 5 to 8 HR. flights sitting in a Helicopter in 120 degrees.  Solves the sore butt problem, much better than I expected, and great for the price..some folks buy those big name brand aviation type.  Save your money and get this one.</li>
            <li> I like this cushion.  I saw a review complaining about the smell, but I don&#x27;t smell at all.  I put it on the wooden chair and feel very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Too small and too uncomfortable had to send it back- just wasn&#x27;t for me.  Maybe for a small lightweight person.</li>
            <li> realy i do not like it , it make me feel uncomfortable, i found one in Walmart better,i recommend not to  buy it</li>
            <li> I purchased this pad before a road trip from San Diego to Seattle and back on my own. The last time I made the drive my back hurt so much after one way. This simple purchase literally saved my backside! I had no lower back soreness the entire trip. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great for prolonged sitting - like with a desk job. Really takes pressure off those sitz bones! Memory foam marvel.</li>
            <li> Has really helped pressure sores from my husband sleeping in his recliner. I think it was a great relief for him and he uses it constantly.</li>
            <li> This thing is hard as a rock- i could have gone out into the garden &amp; picked one out for free. It was confusingly advertised. I ended up not using it as a seat but as a yoga seat - for that it worked. This is why i almost never buy things online.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my elderly parent and the cushion did not have enough softness for them to sit comfortably.</li>
            <li> This is not memory foam.  It says right on the label that it is 100% urethane foam.  It is super hard, uncomfortable and sloped so much that sitting feels like doing a sit-up just to keep from sliding off.  Also the cover has a very creepy feel to it.  I am a very unhappy customer and what&#x27;s worse is that it came with a tag that said it was not returnable.  UPDATE:  Amazon let me return it!  : )</li>
            <li> What a difference a cushion makes! It relieves pressure off my back. I am getting another one for my car!</li>
            <li> This cushion is very comfortable to sit on for a long period of time. I use it in my vehicle when driving and it helps reduce fatigue.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this because I had injured my hip.  My hip is fine now, but I still keep it on my chair at work.  Yes, it does flatten down, but I still think any small bit of elevation of your tush and not the coccyx can&#x27;t help but relieve pressure on your tailbone.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with my sacrum and this really helped me by taking g the pressure off my spine as I sit. I would recommend it to anyone with the same kind of issues. I use it in congruence with a lumbar support that I secure to the back of my chairs. The two have saved me a great deal of pain.</li>
            <li> This cushion is not tapered at an angle like this picture shows. It&#x27;s very thick and is flat all around. Disappointing. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother. This so called &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; gives you about as much padding as a piece of paper. Ridiculous waist of money.</li>
            <li> cushion was way to thick and high for my comfort.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be softer</li>
            <li> This cushion is very comfortable, my back is much better now! I am even thinking of purchasing another one for my car.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these almost 10 years ago for my wife and she loved it. It finally needed to be replaced. The 2nd unit arrived in January 2014. It collapes flat when my wife, all ninety pounds, sits on it providing no support. When she rises, it goes back to it normal shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I offered to return it but she decided to place a pillow under it. Somethign is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Fits on my office chair well and really helped by tailbone out during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> very uncomfotable  it does not impove sittimg posture if anything it is worse would not recommend purcse of this product</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product at all. It flattens quickly and doesn&#x27;t bounce back as much as when first purchased - right within the first week. Also the zipper to remove the cover has the head right at one of the front corners, so a person could end up with the back of their leg pressing down on that head unless careful of how you&#x27;re sitting. It&#x27;s uncomfortable and potentially not good if for someone who&#x27;s got diminished sensation. Pokey things being something to avoid. They could&#x27;ve easily solved this design stupidity by running the zipper up the side where the thicker end of the wedge would keep this from happening.</li>
            <li> great item,  very comfortable for my car and wherever you need  a cushion!</li>
            <li> I ordered the medium firmness to use in the car. This was not enough padding to help with the problem.</li>
            <li> This cushion makes my husband&#x27;s life much more comfortable. We bought two -- one for home and one for the car, but will be buying at least one more, so that he can have one for the living/dining room and one for the office. The one in the car helps a great deal when we attend meetings in a site that has folding wooden chairs.</li>
            <li> I really hesitated buying this because of the reviews and expense. I got it and as soon as I sat on it, I thought, those people are right, it squishes all the way flat. It does, but that hole at the back doesn&#x27;t squish ENTIRELY (I weigh 140) so I think it is better than the other nice foam I had on my desk chair that didn&#x27;t have the coccyx hole. I&#x27;m keeping it and hoping it keeps popping back into position long enough for the expense to be worthwhile. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Although this wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected (it flattened out when I first sat on it), it turned out to be just perfect for my daughter, who weighs a bit less than I do, and also has back issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did e-mail Amazon right away and the seller contacted me immediately and was eager to do whatever was necessary to make me happy (which I was VERY pleased with!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cushion is easy to carry around with you--very portable--and gives just enough support if you are a small framed person.  Good price!  Perfect if you don&#x27;t need something \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ended up being very pleased with it for my daughter!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this pillow.  After recovering from surgery, this pillow is the best one I purchased to help me sit for long periods of time.  I keep it in my car and carry it into the office.  It&#x27;s thin enough for a car seat but offers enough support to function.  The carrying handle comes in handy.  I have cheaper pillows that I keep in stationary locations, but this one is my favorite and travels with me.</li>
            <li> This cushion would be great if it didn&#x27;t compress completely after sitting on it.  I have tailbone issues and was looking to get a cushion for my office chair to take the pressure off of my tailbone when working at my desk.  This cushion has done nothing for me because of its high compressability.  This is the medium firmness, I am contemplating getting the extra firm model to see if it holds its shape any better but don&#x27;t want to waste more money.  I know this is memory foam, but memory foam is not any good if it compresses all the way and provides zero support.  Memory foam is supposed to compress and mold to your shape and still provide support and cushion.  This does not.  Keep looking if you are trying to find something that will alleviate the pressure on your tailbone, like I am.</li>
            <li> I have a Lumbar Spine disc problem and driving a car is the WORST! - Causes me considerable back pain and some leg symptoms ... I purchased this cushion for my car ... LOVE IT! ... purchased another to use as passenger in my husband&#x27;s car ... Alleviates back pain on coccyx, is durable, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my sister&#x27;s birthday for her new car..Think she will be plesantly surprised and happy with this seat that has memory foam..May have to order one for myself when I get my next new car.</li>
            <li> We used these one recent weekend at a civic center and found that we were able to enjoy more comfort in being seated for both morning and afternoon sessions. We wish we had purchased these years earlier.</li>
            <li> I thought this would help on long plane rides but it flattens out to quickly and moves around under you if you squirm in the seat like I do. Also a little large to carry around when traveling.</li>
            <li> it works but the hole where the coccyx area goes can be uncomfortabe due to the seams.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s better than none, but i will most likely buy a different one.</li>
            <li> helps to relieve my tailbone and gives a little extra cushioning to the chairs i sit in. would like a little less pressure on the sciatic though.&lt;br /&gt;if you are having tailbone pain of your own, this pillow might help you. the price is right, the service is quick and your tailbone will thank you.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t increase my comfort at all. got it because I have Sciatic nerve issues, was no help. A 1&amp;#34; chunk of memory foam will work just as well.</li>
            <li> Great little cushion for the car its comfortable and raises me up so its easy to see the road.&lt;br /&gt;I like the removable cover to.</li>
            <li> Larger than I expected and very firm.  I sit at a desk all day and my seat gets sore by end of day.  Do not feel any benefit to coccyx as it claims.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I didn&#x27;t know what else to try.  Sitting had become unbearable.  I noticed that it worked great right from the start.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants to sit in comfort, plus I can take it anywhere I go.</li>
            <li> I use this cushion for rides longer than two hours.  It does work great.&lt;br /&gt;The only flaw is it is stiff for a couple of minutes when its cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;overall does the job.</li>
            <li> The absolute best cushion for both coccyx pain and pudendal nerve compression. Thank you solo much. It is the only reason I can sit right now!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he really says it makes traveling much more comfortable than he previously had without it.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE it. My coccyx has never been happier. Went on a 2100 mile trip, no pain at all!</li>
            <li> Used this cushion only for a week or so for coccyx pain- makes sitting for prolonged periods a bit more comfortable. But doesn&#x27;t really hold its firmness for too long.Cushion cover description mentions it comes in 3 levels of firmness- soft, regular&amp; firm. I was sent the regular one.Seller didn&#x27;t mention this in the description-But he also charged half the price of other sellers! So wont complain too much :)&lt;br /&gt;Have my fingers crossed that this cushion helps relieve the terrible pregnancy related coccyx pain I have!</li>
            <li> This goes flat quick.. But does help for a little bit!</li>
            <li> Ever since I lost over 100 pounds, I have newly discovered bones that I never knew existed. this caused sitting down to be EXTREMELY painful after a mere 10 minutes. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what the issue was, but standing up after sitting was a 3 minute ordeal. It was silly and I felt like a little old lady (I&#x27;m in my 20s)! After some research, I realized I was putting unnecessary pressure on my tailbone and started on a search for some cushiony relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled on this product and, boy, am I glad I did. This thing has been a godsend. It effectively relieves the tailbone pressure so that I no longer have the pain I used to have. I work at a desk, so the majority of my day is spent sitting. I no longer have to stop what I&#x27;m doing and stand up every 5 minutes to avoid the butt pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cushion itself is comfortable and actually helps with my posture because of its design. So far, after a few weeks of use, I have not noticed any deflation in the cushion and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 14 hour plane ride in a few weeks and you can bet that this little treasure will be making the trip with me!</li>
            <li> This cushion is just what I need for 12 - 15 hour  international flights....those new Airbus A380 Economy section seat bottoms are dreadful...my back hurt almost the entire trip....the wedge cutout relieves the pressure on the coccyx.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Took the pain off my tailbone instantly</li>
            <li> helps use it every day no signs of wear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok , but I don&#x27;t like it b/c it&#x27;s to small and I don&#x27;t like how the memory foam smashes down to a thin cushion.</li>
            <li> This cushion is memory foam so it falls flat and as hard as the surface you&#x27;re sitting on in no time at all.  And if you have any issues with your hemroids or butt in general, it&#x27;s not going to help you.  There&#x27;s no hole in the middle.  Maybe it&#x27;s still good for your tailbone?  There&#x27;s a hole for that only.</li>
            <li> Nice on the tail bone. Got this for my car and it enables me to drive for longer periods with a broken tailbone.</li>
            <li> I purchased  a cushion from another company and I loved it.  I wanted one for work also, so I purchased this one.  I expected this one to be the same and it was not.  Although the picture was the same the cushion was smaller and harder when you sit on it.</li>
            <li> Good but not as firm as I expected</li>
            <li> Purchased the Memory Foam Coccyx Cushion orders through Amazon and they were received very quickly.  I have four now and they relieve the pressure that causes pain and discomfort sitting.  I have one in my car and three in the house where I sit the most. The seat cut-out section has a velcro attached carry handle and I take one of the cushions to sit on at church, doctor&#x27;s office, etc. Melvin B.</li>
            <li> I used to have pain whenever I would do abdominal exercises on the floor.  My tailbone hurt too much to sit on it.  I bought this so I can now sit on my yoga mat and do various yoga poses and ab work without pain in my tailbone.  It is a pain to have to use this, but I&#x27;m glad to have finally found something to help!</li>
            <li> If you work at a desk all day like me this is a great addition for your back and bottom.  I have a couple different kinds and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cushion because, obviously, I have a problem with my coccyx.  This cushion is very comfortable.  The memory foam goes back into sghape after use.  I only weigh 109 lbs. and when I sit on the cushion I can still feel my tail bone resting on the chair.  If I had known this cushion was so soft then I would probably have gone with a firmer cushion.  I do like the cushion and would recommend it to someone who does not have extremely sever coccyx pain and nerve pain.</li>
            <li> Much too soft. Product is virtually useless</li>
            <li> This pillow is very comfortable, easy to carry and has a washable zip off cover. I picked the firm pillow for added support. I bruised my tailbone and the round donut pillow I had purchased at the store was totally wrong for this type of injury. I really like the slant shape of this pillow. It fits well on the computer chair, in the car and makes sitting and watching TV a painless experience. I even take it to the movies with me. I don&#x27;t know if I will heal faster with this pillow but it is definitely making life easier!</li>
            <li> I was expecting great things from this cushion because of my love of my memory foam mattress.  I really was disappointed and was not disappointed at all when I lost it on my latest trip.  My tail bone would have felt better if I just used a regular bed pillow.  In fact I used a pillow on the return trip and was much happier.</li>
            <li> I have some bad disc in my lower back and it allows me to drive further than before. Works great.</li>
            <li> The cushion does what its supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to dislike with the cushion, the problem is what it is, a pain in the butt.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for those unfortunate folks like me with a broken coccyx</li>
            <li> I use it for my work chair and really like it. Helped me a lot with my tailbone pain. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> exactly as described would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Goes flat very quickly.  It&#x27;s only good for the car, or a well padded chair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay. It helps as a barrier when my leather seats are too hot/cold, but that&#x27;s about it!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these. One for the house and one for home. I&#x27;ve lost over 128 lbs and my tailbone was just excruciating to sit on because it lost the cushion it has been used to for years.  The one I had at home seems to work better than the one at work. It does alleviate some pressure on the tailbone but it does go somewhat flat. It will immediately return to shape when you get up, though. It is better than another one that I bought that was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Was using a worn out cushion, so when this thick cushion came, it was like heaven.  My back and bottom has not given me any problems since.  If this is for a gift, please let them know, otherwise they ship in a box that advertises the contents and I knew 3 days before Christmas what one of my gifts were.</li>
            <li> Works great!  My husband is disabled and uses his wheelchair and does a lot of sitting so this was wonderful for him! I am going to order another so we can leave one in his recliner and have one to transfer back and forth between his wheelchair and the car.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, hasn&#x27;t lost its cushion.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this product since I bought it and it seems to have helped my back. I use it at work.</li>
            <li> The Coccyx cushion made it possible for me to keep working while my damaged tailbone healed.&lt;br /&gt;Phyl Chisholm</li>
            <li> The firmer ones are better!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for. Helps with my lower back pain. I love it! Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The seats in my car are bearable for shorter trips, but I bought this for my road trip across the country. It made me comfortable the entire time. Even with all the use, it hasn&#x27;t gotten flat over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this cushion. I use it in my chair at work. It raises me up a bit and has eased the pressure on my tailbone.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this cushion... I have many others but the contour and design of the Coccyx really makes a big difference. I had searched everywhere and  I like the added convience of the strap/handle which makes it easy to take along anywhere and for travel. I suffer with a back/siatic nerve problem so must have a cushion whereever I go. It fits well in the car for driving also. Thank you!!</li>
