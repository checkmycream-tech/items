    <ol>
            <li>Awesome mug!</li>
            <li>Has nice will nubs at the bottom that hold shave soap perfectly in my experience.</li>
            <li>Works great as a shave cup, has a lip on the bottom to hold my shave soap in place.  </li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaving mug, looks good and is not breakable.</li>
            <li>A perfect fit to my soap den.  </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it was made in the U.S.A.  </li>
            <li>He liked the design on the face and the weight of the cup.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered and works great with the shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I love this thing I have had it for 2 years</li>
            <li>I wish they had more designs.</li>
            <li>even more so if you travel and have concerns about breaking ceramic mugs.</li>
            <li>had I seen and held it, however it should suit its purpose just fine,</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this mug.</li>
            <li>I am cheap, that&#x27;s why I go through the DE thing.]  </li>
            <li>The design on the front of the mug is cheaply done.</li>
            <li>mug.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special but does the job and</li>
            <li>Feels more plasticky cheap when it arrived, and has a clear mold line showing this was a two-piece manufactured assembly.  </li>
            <li>You might have to shave off the sides of some of your pucks , but it will fit the smaller ones just fine.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap plastic mug that is only worth one dollar!</li>
            <li>Will be buying agin for sure definitely</li>
            <li>even if you do drop it you certainly wont break it.</li>
            <li>It is made of some unbreakable plastic, and it has many rough edges from the plastic molding.  </li>
            <li>I got this because too many of my mugs have gone for a fall and covered my bathroom floor in pieces of sharp ceramic.  </li>
            <li>it was a high quality ceramic shaving mug.</li>
            <li>Nice hard plastic unbreakable</li>
            <li>Although the plastic seems sturdy, and it was apparently made in the USA, it appears as cheap Chinese junk.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the Green mug is rubber and handmade; however, the opal mug appears machine made and looks/feels more like plastic.  </li>
            <li>So I just have to make a second batch of froth if I want to lay down another coat of shave soap and have it be warm.  </li>
            <li>I would fill my ceramic shave cups with boiling water from our water filter and they would keep that heat to keep the contents of the mug hot for a second application.  </li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s one thing you can&#x27;t really notice from the description is that, it&#x27;s reeaaaally white.</li>
            <li>Put a soap cake in and I can barely make lather with my brush.  </li>

            <li> I really enjoy using this mug. It doesnt bother me at all that it is plastic. Easier to hold and even if you do drop it you certainly wont break it. Has nice will nubs at the bottom that hold shave soap perfectly in my experience. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This is a cheap plastic mug that is only worth one dollar! I am so disappointed in the quality of this mug.  It looks like a china mug, but it is not!  If it was not so close to Christmas, I would return it.  You can even see the seams where the mug was put together. This is not a good value. Beware.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it was a high quality ceramic shaving mug. Although the plastic seems sturdy, and it was apparently made in the USA, it appears as cheap Chinese junk. The screen print isn&#x27;t sharp. Unless you&#x27;re looking for a travel cup, i would avoid it on appearance alone.</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose.  Maybe a bit pricey for a plastic mug.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special but does the job and because it&#x27;s plastic, I needn&#x27;t worry about it slipping from my hand and smashing in the sink.</li>
            <li> What can I say it&#x27;s a shaving mug, it does it&#x27;s job and was not an outrageous price and it not anything fancy</li>
            <li> I love this thing I have had it for 2 years I always keep a puck in this</li>
            <li> Works great as a shave cup, has a lip on the bottom to hold my shave soap in place.  I got this because too many of my mugs have gone for a fall and covered my bathroom floor in pieces of sharp ceramic.  The downside is that it doesn&#x27;t retain heat as well.  I would fill my ceramic shave cups with boiling water from our water filter and they would keep that heat to keep the contents of the mug hot for a second application.  So I just have to make a second batch of froth if I want to lay down another coat of shave soap and have it be warm.  Which is nicer than stepping on broken pieces of ceramic while barefoot.</li>
            <li> You might have to shave off the sides of some of your pucks , but it will fit the smaller ones just fine.</li>
            <li> Holds my soap cake in place without any fuss.  A perfect fit to my soap den.  If there&#x27;s one thing you can&#x27;t really notice from the description is that, it&#x27;s reeaaaally white.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving mug, looks good and is not breakable.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for our son-in-law.  I liked the fact that it was made in the U.S.A.  It is a tough material that I didn&#x27;t think will break when his hands got soapy.  He liked the design on the face and the weight of the cup.</li>
            <li> I have the green Marvy mug. That&#x27;s why I bought this one. I like them a lot.I wish they had more designs.</li>
            <li> Way too deep.  Put a soap cake in and I can barely make lather with my brush.  I&#x27;ll end up DIY cutting the handle off and 1/2&amp;#34; in height, so I don&#x27;t ruin my brush.  Any body have a suggestion?[I know, put two cakes in.  I know, it&#x27;s only $10.  I am cheap, that&#x27;s why I go through the DE thing.]  I&#x27;m thinking Dremel, this could end up hideous. LOL.</li>
            <li> I returned this product the day I received it.  It is made of some unbreakable plastic, and it has many rough edges from the plastic molding.  The design on the front of the mug is cheaply done.</li>
            <li> I needed one and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Awesome mug! Exactly what I ordered and works great with the shaving soap. Will be buying agin for sure definitely</li>
            <li> Feels more plasticky cheap when it arrived, and has a clear mold line showing this was a two-piece manufactured assembly.  Would not have purchased had I seen and held it, however it should suit its purpose just fine, even more so if you travel and have concerns about breaking ceramic mugs.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the Green mug is rubber and handmade; however, the opal mug appears machine made and looks/feels more like plastic.  If I would have handled this in a retail store, I do not believe that I would have made the online purchase (for the $12 price that I paid).</li>
            <li> Nice hard plastic unbreakable</li>
            <li> Just as we expected.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
