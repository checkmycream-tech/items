            <li>Love these gloves!  </li>
            <li>Outstanding customer service!</li>
            <li>These gloves fit great and for those of us who remember or may even still be using wash rags</li>
            <li>These are amazing, will buy again.</li>
            <li>They foam up nicely when I rub on the soap or soap gel</li>
            <li>They hold their form nicely.</li>
            <li>and they are holding up quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I love these gloves for my face to use with a exfoliate wash.  </li>
            <li>These exfoliating gloves are okay.</li>
            <li>I ordered these, but they didn&#x27;t come on time, most probably USPS&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li>Great product really.</li>
            <li>I really love my skin feels now.</li>
            <li>love these for keeping my skin glowing</li>
            <li>Nice fit.</li>
            <li>Skip this buy and just use your hand, you will get better results.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to have a little stash of them, especially at a nice price.</li>
            <li>Hand washing in a net bag is best and quick.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I did that so easily</li>
            <li>The gloves are fine...</li>
            <li>Okay.... Some gloves just aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Gloves fit snug.</li>
            <li>They fit snugly and have just the right texture to make a shower a refreshing, invigorating experience.</li>
            <li>this will make sliding them on real easy, but of course everyone knows already but us old timers need those easy to use instructions from time to time.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to get off, but they do a great job.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;exfoliate.&amp;#34;  They simply drag the soap on your body and they don&#x27;t even do a very good job of that.  </li>
            <li>These are thin, cheaply made and at best mildly exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I kinda feel like I would prefer a more high quality item over these.</li>
            <li>Great for removing dead skin.</li>
            <li>these are the best replacement right next to your electric toothbruch, and if your using bar soap just get the gloves wet rub well with the bar of soap</li>
            <li>I think they seem more like a dollar store item, personally.</li>
            <li>These work pretty well</li>
            <li>I was willing to deal with the color if the gloves lived up to the reviews</li>
            <li>The gloves are tight enough to fit but are easily removed and able to be rinsed out.</li>
            <li>I also ordered moisturizer from the same producer and works fabulous on my skin.</li>
            <li>I feel they really exfoliate my skin well.</li>
            <li>the glove work great, the only problem is they are too small.</li>
            <li>Highly suggested</li>
            <li>The only reason it doesn&#x27;t have a score of 5 stars is that it isn&#x27;t an organic product (that I am aware of!?).</li>
            <li>With these, it&#x27;s easy to know exactly how hard</li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>They also lather soap up as well as can be expected for a glove at this price, which is not bad for the pack.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for for so long.</li>
            <li>My husband has his own pair and he&#x27;s addicted too.</li>
            <li>As some reviewers say, the gloves are a bit small indeed; but that works perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li>I use this with a mild soap and have noticed my skin breaking out less.</li>
            <li>Affordable, quality as expected, fast shipping.</li>

            <li> Affordable, quality as expected, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and releaves that dry skin feeling</li>
            <li> Dry by hanging up with laundry pegs.</li>
            <li> First, the color white is not a true white, it&#x27;s a &#x27;dirty&#x27; white.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t scrub too roughly</li>
            <li> Also they do increase the lather of the shower gel compared to other shower gloves I used before.</li>
            <li> For washing, use a net laundry bag and wash on a delicate cycle or hand wash in the bag, it will save the gloves from getting &amp;#34;caught&amp;#34; or snagged&amp;#34; if you use a washing machine.</li>
            <li> I ended up going to Bed Bath and Beyond and bought a pair of gloves for less than $5.</li>
            <li> I tend to be a little &amp;#34;careful&amp;#34; but they still worked well.</li>
            <li> But I have large-ish hands and square palms, and these gloves are a little snug for me.</li>
            <li> Purchased after a surgery to remove dead skin.  </li>
            <li> but it comes with a few pairs so if that happens you can just use another.</li>
            <li> gloves,,,,,they work to get the dead skin off</li>
            <li> Same quality and much less expensive than others I have seen.</li>
            <li> Too small for my man hands.</li>
            <li> So disappointed because I fell for the high rates.</li>
            <li> I hate using loofas because it&#x27;s hard to tell if I&#x27;m scrubbing properly or I can&#x27;t detail my body the Wayne want.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of three based on the rave reviews and sadly, I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> terrible gloves.  </li>

HAPPY BATHING.</li>

            <li> Great for removing dead skin. and releaves that dry skin feeling</li>
            <li> I love these gloves for my face to use with a exfoliate wash.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Work like they are supposed to .  Highly suggested</li>
            <li> Love these gloves!  They foam up nicely when I rub on the soap or soap gel and they leave the skin humming...</li>
            <li> Same quality and much less expensive than others I have seen. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Too small for my man hands.</li>
            <li> These gloves work well at exfoliating my skin.  Purchased after a surgery to remove dead skin.  I tend to be a little &amp;#34;careful&amp;#34; but they still worked well.</li>
            <li> Gloves have a tendency to tear.</li>
            <li> These gloves are great. They fit snugly and have just the right texture to make a shower a refreshing, invigorating experience.</li>
            <li> Okay.... Some gloves just aren&#x27;t worth it. I know. But I feel like ordering 10 of these before they run out!! Best shower gloves EVER!</li>
            <li> the glove work great, the only problem is they are too small. they started to stretch out after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Great product. As some reviewers say, the gloves are a bit small indeed; but that works perfectly fine for me. Also they do increase the lather of the shower gel compared to other shower gloves I used before.</li>
            <li> These exfoliating gloves are okay. I kinda feel like I would prefer a more high quality item over these. I think they seem more like a dollar store item, personally.</li>
            <li> Outstanding customer service! I ordered these, but they didn&#x27;t come on time, most probably USPS&#x27;s fault. The seller contacted me with apologies, refunded my order and sent me another pair just as a gift. Great product really. I also ordered moisturizer from the same producer and works fabulous on my skin. The feel is really good and freshening. My skin is moisturized but is not greasy or oily. This is exactly what I was looking for for so long. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> If you have never bathed with exfoliating gloves you are in for a treat.  My husband has his own pair and he&#x27;s addicted too.</li>
            <li> The bath gloves are incredible. I hate using loofas because it&#x27;s hard to tell if I&#x27;m scrubbing properly or I can&#x27;t detail my body the Wayne want. With these, it&#x27;s easy to know exactly how hard and where I&#x27;ve scrubbed. I use this with a mild soap and have noticed my skin breaking out less. Don&#x27;t scrub too roughly or you&#x27;ll rip a hole in the finger. I don&#x27;t know how I did that so easily but it comes with a few pairs so if that happens you can just use another. These are amazing, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really love my skin feels now. So soft! The only reason it doesn&#x27;t have a score of 5 stars is that it isn&#x27;t an organic product (that I am aware of!?). These hold up well, but do not scratch the skin. I am still so happy with everything I buy and thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li> love these for keeping my skin glowing I feel they really exfoliate my skin well.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well and it&#x27;s nice to have a little stash of them, especially at a nice price. But I have large-ish hands and square palms, and these gloves are a little snug for me. I feel like I&#x27;m going to tear them when I take them off.</li>
            <li> I like these gloves,,,,,they work to get the dead skin off</li>
            <li> Nice fit. Greta feel on the skin. The gloves are tight enough to fit but are easily removed and able to be rinsed out. They hold their form nicely.</li>
            <li> Excellent exfoliating gloves, I purchased these with my second order, including a repeat of the moisturizer, (I also doubled up on the facial wash, conditioner, shampoo and soaps and gloves).&lt;br /&gt;A tip for the gloves, use rubber- tipped clothes pegs to hang them up in the shower. For washing, use a net laundry bag and wash on a delicate cycle or hand wash in the bag, it will save the gloves from getting &amp;#34;caught&amp;#34; or snagged&amp;#34; if you use a washing machine. Hand washing in a net bag is best and quick. Dry by hanging up with laundry pegs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a while now and they are holding up quite nicely. They also lather soap up as well as can be expected for a glove at this price, which is not bad for the pack.</li>
            <li> Gloves fit snug. Kind of hard to get off, but they do a great job.</li>
            <li> I use exfoliating gloves daily and I needed to replenish my stock. I purchased this set of three based on the rave reviews and sadly, I am not impressed. First, the color white is not a true white, it&#x27;s a &#x27;dirty&#x27; white. I was willing to deal with the color if the gloves lived up to the reviews but they do not. These are thin, cheaply made and at best mildly exfoliating. These are going in the garbage and I will be purchasing my regular exfoliating gloves. (I have not received the soap I ordered from Christina Moss Naturals yet, also based on the rave reviews, and I hope it lives up to the hype.)</li>
            <li> So disappointed because I fell for the high rates. I had to return them...these totally sucked! I wished I took a picture of what they looked like after 3 days of use. The gloves strings were pulling out and my skin was not feeling exfoliated at all. I ended up going to Bed Bath and Beyond and bought a pair of gloves for less than $5.</li>
            <li> The gloves are fine... but  the item description states three pairs and I only received one pair</li>
            <li> terrible gloves.  they are already coming apart.  They don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;exfoliate.&amp;#34;  They simply drag the soap on your body and they don&#x27;t even do a very good job of that.  Skip this buy and just use your hand, you will get better results.</li>
