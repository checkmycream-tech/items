            <li>I just go to sleep and wake up with a lovely bright face.</li>
            <li>My favorites are rose and cucumber.</li>
            <li>Really, I was never too impressed with sheet masks, they just didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They smell nice, they&#x27;re saturated in product, they leave the skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>Nice pack to try them all</li>
            <li>: I really liked the sample lotions that came with the pack.</li>
            <li>Still, it was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>Great deal I am excited to give one of the packages I bought to my mother for mothers day.</li>
            <li>Awesome makes your face feel soft,</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the rose mask.</li>
            <li>Skin is very moist and bright afterward!</li>
            <li>Face has been more brightly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>but my face feels very smooth after applying it.</li>
            <li>I prefer My Beauty Diary which moisturizes much better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these masks.  </li>
            <li>I can feel skin is more moisture after each use.</li>
            <li>I love these moisturizing masks.  </li>
            <li>Some have a creamier essence, others are lighter/more liquid, but going through all the packets is what I am enjoying the most aboutthis sampler.  </li>
            <li>a lot better than the face shop.</li>
            <li>Some are better than others, of course.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;d probably be money better</li>
            <li>I am planning purchase again for more packages.</li>
            <li>Paraben free!</li>
            <li>Face shop masks have paraben which I&#x27;m cautious of, but unlike Face shop masks, I think Innisfree are more fragrant which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I prefer more natural/herbal scents which Face Shop fulfills.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of Korean face masks and the innisfree ones are my favorite.</li>
            <li>so I feel like they stick to my face better.</li>
            <li>Love these masks.</li>
            <li>variety is interesting</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good things about cloth face masks, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything worth purchasing in nearby stores.</li>
            <li>Love it so many flavors to choose from&lt;br /&gt;Great price</li>
            <li>Like that they tell you (in english) what each is best for.</li>
            <li>; list, especially after my best friend introduced me to them.</li>
            <li>But I still enjoyed them.</li>
            <li>I love using these masks.</li>
            <li>Easy un-fold, easy apply!</li>
            <li>I have to say it is better than Fresh rose.</li>
            <li>And it feels more comfortable that way.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>There are eye, nose and mouth holes and positioning the mask is quite easy.</li>
            <li>Although these masks are very moisturizing and refreshing, they give me break outs!</li>
            <li>These Innifree sheet masks are by far the best smelling masks I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
            <li>I think that they&#x27;re great for maintaining moisture levels and softness if you already have the skin texture you want, but I hesitate to recommend them to someone who is looking for a way to occasionally treat themselves.</li>
            <li>Its hidrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>These masks are so nice after cleansing and very relaxing to sit with one on.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes your skin and keeps it shiny and healthy, not to mention they smell yummy and fresh.</li>
            <li>These Innisfree masks are cheap and you get a ton of em</li>
            <li>The masks are really good, make my skin better, already 2nd purchase&lt;</li>
            <li>These masks were cool, soothing, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>There are so many different kinds and they smell really good and leave the face nice and soft.</li>
            <li>have been using the products for few weeks, these are very nice masks, smells good, gentle, even good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Spend a little more on a really great product (like Sulhwasoo&#x27;s Snowise, $13 per mask) for WOW results... then use these Innisfree cheapies every week (or more) to keep things on track!  </li>
            <li>have spent a fair amount of time in Korea browsing the beauty shops for cute cosmetics and miracle face masks.</li>
            <li>Natural facial mask I make is the best by using Yogurt, honey, and apricot&#x27;s seed powder.</li>
            <li>The price is really good for the amount of masks that are included and considering Innisfree is like a low-mid range cosmetics company similar to Faceshop but not as easily available in the US.</li>
            <li>The different scents are so lovely and soothing, such a great plus on top of the nutrients these masks provide your skin.</li>
            <li>Also, maybe this was just a fluke, but I ended up with 16 masks rather than 15, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with these overall.</li>
            <li>It feels extremely cool when you put on it.</li>
            <li>Whole family enjoyed them.</li>
            <li>One of my friends recommended these masks to me, the price is not bad at all, so I decided to give a try.</li>
            <li>No miracle skin improvements, but no bad breakouts either.</li>
            <li>I always feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I really like these Innisfree masks because they&#x27;re cheap, made without parabens and fit well on my face.</li>
            <li>My favorites so far are the cucumber (light and refreshing) and the aÃ§ai.</li>
            <li>Masks don&#x27;t fit my high nose bridge very well, but these fit slightly better than others.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>The snail and lightening creams were great, but the CC cream was a little chalky for my tastes.</li>
            <li>Overall the masks fit fairly well as far as the one-piece masks go..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>&amp;I so far I love them ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>Nicely packed and comes in various flavors without repeating.</li>
            <li>spent just getting more of the better ones rather than the variety.</li>
            <li>All natural and preservatives free!</li>
            <li>all I know is that I wake up with a fresh face.</li>
            <li>The only redeeming quality of the masks were that they fit my face well.</li>
            <li>Love that they are natural.</li>
            <li>so excited that I opened the package to fast and nicked a mask so</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking around for the right mask, give these a try.</li>
            <li>The size of the mask is just right.</li>
            <li>It also took way less time than Amazon said it would, which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>Facial sheets are moist and refreshing.</li>
            <li>This facial mask is great!!!&lt;br /&gt;i am gong to buy more...</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this product immensely as it give my skin the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of newness.</li>
            <li>Since one should use a sheet mask about 1-2 times a week, this can really add up!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely purchase more once I run out.</li>
            <li>Now am starting to include this mask to my routine, and my face is really getting better.</li>
            <li>Innisfree seemed to have a lot of positive feedback, so I decided to give their 15-sheet pack a try.</li>
            <li>Its a moist facial masks, easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>Because they are smaller and thicker (not so flimsy), I can easily unfold them and just place it on my face in a jiffy.</li>
            <li>The only criticism that I have is that some of the fruit masks are too strongly scented.</li>
            <li>The Face Shop masks are really large and I always get bubbles with them</li>
            <li>really works!&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>She really like it.</li>
            <li>Some of the masks in this set also have like a milkiness type quality to them which I found really moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Each time I use one of these masks my complexion is brighter, recives intense moisturazation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To use the mask, wash your face and tear off the top of the package carefully.</li>
            <li>After 20 minutes, discard the mask and gently massage the leftover liquid into your face.</li>
            <li>Overall I liked the variety of the masks in the set, no two were the same.</li>
            <li>different &#x27;flavor&#x27; has different uses, but I gotta say it&#x27;s kind of like splitting hairs..</li>
            <li>With Innisfree it feels more natural, slight chillish feeling because I leave them in the fridge and the masks are generally thicker, more gel-like.</li>
            <li>Pop your mask in the fridge for a few minutes prior to application for a nice cooling sensation when you put it on!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these kind of masks for dry skin, especially for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I have an oval face with a larger than average nose and they fit fine.  </li>
            <li>It is soooo refreshing and lovely to lie down with a lovely cold mask, it really feels like a spa night!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Such a fun pampering tool.</li>
            <li>They make my skin glow, honestly, and the thick formula coating the masks feels blissful on your skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, Innisfree seems to be the better match, minus the fragrance &#x3D;[</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that this brand is any better than any of the other Korean Facial Masks,</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try these facial masks and add them to my daily routine.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks (I used one every other night), my skin was soft, smooth, and glowing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after using it....</li>
            <li>None of them have irritated my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really buying into the Korean skincare hype so sheet masks were definitely on my &amp;#34;to buy&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The masks always leave my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recently been laid up in bed with a high fever, and needed to cool down.</li>
            <li>I gave them a second change and oddly enough I noticed the serum changed color and became very watery.</li>
            <li>Literally took me half the time I would with a Face shop mask even though it was my first</li>
            <li>Innisfree masks are my favorite sheet masks - they&#x27;re not thin enough to rip, but aren&#x27;t thick and uncomfortably heavy.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that I ran out a while ago so my skin has reverted back to its normal state, but I will definitely be purchasing again soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>my skin is fresh and it seems to be very tight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one of these so far, but as soon as I took it off there was an obvious difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price I paid,</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The different scents are so lovely and soothing, such a great plus on top of the nutrients these masks provide your skin.</li>
            <li> Also, maybe this was just a fluke, but I ended up with 16 masks rather than 15, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with these overall.</li>
            <li> It feels extremely cool when you put on it.</li>
            <li> Whole family enjoyed them.</li>
            <li> One of my friends recommended these masks to me, the price is not bad at all, so I decided to give a try.</li>
            <li> No miracle skin improvements, but no bad breakouts either.</li>
            <li> I always feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I really like these Innisfree masks because they&#x27;re cheap, made without parabens and fit well on my face.</li>
            <li> My favorites so far are the cucumber (light and refreshing) and the aÃ§ai.</li>
            <li> Masks don&#x27;t fit my high nose bridge very well, but these fit slightly better than others.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> The snail and lightening creams were great, but the CC cream was a little chalky for my tastes.</li>
            <li> Overall the masks fit fairly well as far as the one-piece masks go..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> &amp;I so far I love them ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Nicely packed and comes in various flavors without repeating.</li>
            <li> spent just getting more of the better ones rather than the variety.</li>
            <li> All natural and preservatives free!</li>
            <li> all I know is that I wake up with a fresh face.</li>
            <li> The only redeeming quality of the masks were that they fit my face well.</li>
            <li> Love that they are natural.</li>
            <li> so excited that I opened the package to fast and nicked a mask so</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking around for the right mask, give these a try.</li>
            <li> The size of the mask is just right.</li>
            <li> It also took way less time than Amazon said it would, which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Facial sheets are moist and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This facial mask is great!!!&lt;br /&gt;i am gong to buy more...</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product immensely as it give my skin the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of newness.</li>
            <li> Since one should use a sheet mask about 1-2 times a week, this can really add up!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely purchase more once I run out.</li>
            <li> Now am starting to include this mask to my routine, and my face is really getting better.</li>
            <li> Innisfree seemed to have a lot of positive feedback, so I decided to give their 15-sheet pack a try.</li>
            <li> Its a moist facial masks, easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> Because they are smaller and thicker (not so flimsy), I can easily unfold them and just place it on my face in a jiffy.</li>
            <li> The only criticism that I have is that some of the fruit masks are too strongly scented.</li>
            <li> The Face Shop masks are really large and I always get bubbles with them</li>
            <li> really works!&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> She really like it.</li>
            <li> Some of the masks in this set also have like a milkiness type quality to them which I found really moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Each time I use one of these masks my complexion is brighter, recives intense moisturazation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use the mask, wash your face and tear off the top of the package carefully.</li>
            <li> After 20 minutes, discard the mask and gently massage the leftover liquid into your face.</li>
            <li> Overall I liked the variety of the masks in the set, no two were the same.</li>
            <li> different &#x27;flavor&#x27; has different uses, but I gotta say it&#x27;s kind of like splitting hairs..</li>
            <li> With Innisfree it feels more natural, slight chillish feeling because I leave them in the fridge and the masks are generally thicker, more gel-like.</li>
            <li> Pop your mask in the fridge for a few minutes prior to application for a nice cooling sensation when you put it on!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these kind of masks for dry skin, especially for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I have an oval face with a larger than average nose and they fit fine.  </li>
            <li> It is soooo refreshing and lovely to lie down with a lovely cold mask, it really feels like a spa night!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Such a fun pampering tool.</li>
            <li> They make my skin glow, honestly, and the thick formula coating the masks feels blissful on your skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, Innisfree seems to be the better match, minus the fragrance &#x3D;[</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that this brand is any better than any of the other Korean Facial Masks,</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try these facial masks and add them to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks (I used one every other night), my skin was soft, smooth, and glowing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after using it....</li>
            <li> None of them have irritated my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really buying into the Korean skincare hype so sheet masks were definitely on my &amp;#34;to buy&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The masks always leave my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently been laid up in bed with a high fever, and needed to cool down.</li>
            <li> I gave them a second change and oddly enough I noticed the serum changed color and became very watery.</li>
            <li> Literally took me half the time I would with a Face shop mask even though it was my first</li>
            <li> Innisfree masks are my favorite sheet masks - they&#x27;re not thin enough to rip, but aren&#x27;t thick and uncomfortably heavy.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I ran out a while ago so my skin has reverted back to its normal state, but I will definitely be purchasing again soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> my skin is fresh and it seems to be very tight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one of these so far, but as soon as I took it off there was an obvious difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price I paid,</li>
            <li> Using them for the first time might be a bit tricky especially since they are delicate and susceptible to tearing, but I would rather use these than a traditional face mask that you have to apply with your</li>
            <li> Needless to say my super sensitive skin did not like that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t last long what I feel on my face.</li>
            <li> I love that they don&#x27;t leave behind a sticky, gummy feeling mess on my face after removing them.</li>
            <li> There are so many different Asian sheet masks, and some of them are very expensive.</li>
            <li> If you are prone to breakouts or have sensitive skin, I would recommend using a small patch of the mask to test before you actually use it.</li>
            <li> However after using 3 masks for 3 days, they didn&#x27;t dry out [today], and it was windy</li>
            <li> Cold compresses always leave my skin dehydrated, so I tried the green tea sheet mask as a cooling alternative, which felt amazing while laying under my ceiling fan.</li>
            <li> I have been using fresh for a long time and it is really expensive.</li>
            <li> it is not overpowering and the mask is thicker then some I have previously bought at the Asian market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, samples!</li>
            <li> Innisfree is just less expensive and really comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> but I wish they had a little info on which skin issues to use the different packs for.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Unlike other masks I&#x27;ve tried, they don&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on my face which can break out my skin.</li>
            <li> thin enough to tear very easily, so be careful to unfold it properly!</li>
            <li> Perhaps due to the citric elements that were too acidic for my skin.</li>
            <li> have sensitive combination skin with frequent hormonal acne, so I&#x27;m wary of using anything too harsh.</li>
            <li> The liquid clings to the mask and to the face, and once you adjust it, lie down and relax for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> In the winter my skin usually peels in extremely dry areas despite the amount and loads of lotion I wear.</li>
            <li> In my typical skincare routine before bed, I apply the mask after my essence and ampoule and before my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For some reason The Face Shop masks give me this burning sensation during the first 2-3 mins and also feel really cold when I walk around.</li>
            <li> You can wash your face, but it would be a waste (it does feel a little sticky).</li>
            <li> When I smell artificial strawberry I don&#x27;t really think &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> And after continuously putting them on for a few days, your skin feels smoother than before.</li>
            <li> Eye holes are a little too small.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this use as well as for replenishing after a day at the beach, working up a sweat, cold winter activities, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The essence is a little thick and it takes a bit of time to absorb</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the alcohol derivatives.</li>
            <li> for results for Innisfree, not sure yet, will update.</li>
            <li> Not amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that thick lotion feeling on my face</li>
            <li> I mean for $1.50 a mask, I&#x27;m not expecting miracles here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very ordinary mask.</li>
            <li> Expired items seriously?</li>
            <li> I mean it is ridiculous!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they did not get along with my skin so well...</li>
            <li> Im obsessed now.</li>
            <li> Inside would be a very thin mask..</li>
            <li> Looks like fake!</li>
            <li> These sheet masks are no-no&#x27;s for acne prone skin. :(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very ordinary mask. I prefer My Beauty Diary which moisturizes much better.</li>
            <li> Came on time and even had an extra mask sheet (intentional or not, oh well!). I&#x27;ve bought this product multiple times in both Korea and in the states. Love them to death!</li>
            <li> These are so refreshing! Masks don&#x27;t fit my high nose bridge very well, but these fit slightly better than others. Eye holes are a little too small. Lots of forehead coverage, though. I love that they don&#x27;t leave behind a sticky, gummy feeling mess on my face after removing them. I always feel fresh and clean. My favorites are rose and cucumber.</li>
            <li> Expired items seriously? I found out after used two sheets. I have to trash all of them. I mean it is ridiculous!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these masks.  It&#x27;s totally worth it. It feels extremely cool when you put on it. And after continuously putting them on for a few days, your skin feels smoother than before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that this brand is any better than any of the other Korean Facial Masks, (and it&#x27;s more expensive) but it DOES work.  My skin feels so soft after using it....and the feeling lasts!  I wish you could select the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; rather than just taking what you get.  All in all a good product that I will be using again!</li>
            <li> I use sheet masks almost every day (in place of a morning skincare routine) and have tried the gamut; from the more expensive, like SK-II, to at-home soaked sheets.  I really like these Innisfree masks because they&#x27;re cheap, made without parabens and fit well on my face. I think that they&#x27;re great for maintaining moisture levels and softness if you already have the skin texture you want, but I hesitate to recommend them to someone who is looking for a way to occasionally treat themselves. Spend a little more on a really great product (like Sulhwasoo&#x27;s Snowise, $13 per mask) for WOW results... then use these Innisfree cheapies every week (or more) to keep things on track!  The only criticism that I have is that some of the fruit masks are too strongly scented. When I smell artificial strawberry I don&#x27;t really think &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have to say it is better than Fresh rose. I have been using fresh for a long time and it is really expensive. Innisfree is just less expensive and really comfortable to use. Love it! Will buy again</li>
            <li> The face mask is nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one of these so far, but as soon as I took it off there was an obvious difference in my skin. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the one I used ( the bija one) was specifically meant to do, but if it was for whitening, then it definitely worked. There was a noticeable difference  between the skin on my face and the skin on my neck where the mask didn&#x27;t touch. Also, maybe this was just a fluke, but I ended up with 16 masks rather than 15, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with these overall.</li>
            <li> This is great as a gift because they&#x27;re all moisturizing, I like innisfree.</li>
            <li> This mask is totally different with my another which ship from Korean. Looks like fake!</li>
            <li> I received the 15 sheets and all the flavors that appears in the picture. Now am starting to include this mask to my routine, and my face is really getting better. Its hidrated and smooth. Worth it!</li>
            <li> Although these masks are very moisturizing and refreshing, they give me break outs! Such a bummer. These sheet masks are no-no&#x27;s for acne prone skin. :(</li>
            <li> Facial sheets are moist and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I got them. &amp;I so far I love them ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Nicely packed and comes in various flavors without repeating. I can feel skin is more moisture after each use. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The best sheet masks - hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent a fair amount of time in Korea browsing the beauty shops for cute cosmetics and miracle face masks. Really, I was never too impressed with sheet masks, they just didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT THEN. Then I tried these. They make my skin glow, honestly, and the thick formula coating the masks feels blissful on your skin. If you&#x27;re looking around for the right mask, give these a try.</li>
            <li> I love these moisturizing masks.  Some have a creamier essence, others are lighter/more liquid, but going through all the packets is what I am enjoying the most aboutthis sampler.  None of them have irritated my sensitive skin.  I have an oval face with a larger than average nose and they fit fine.  My favorites so far are the cucumber (light and refreshing) and the aÃ§ai.</li>
            <li> OMG! This facial mask is great!!!&lt;br /&gt;i am gong to buy more...really works!&lt;br /&gt;thank you Innisfree for these great masks</li>
            <li> I love these masks! It also took way less time than Amazon said it would, which was a pleasant surprise. Good price as well. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> love it!!! a lot better than the face shop. perfect cut</li>
            <li> These are alright sheet masks. Not amazing. They smell nice, they&#x27;re saturated in product, they leave the skin feeling hydrated. Some are better than others, of course. Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price I paid, and it&#x27;d probably be money better spent just getting more of the better ones rather than the variety.</li>
            <li> I love using this! Fast shipping. Thank you. Will shop again next time.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t last long what I feel on my face. Natural facial mask I make is the best by using Yogurt, honey, and apricot&#x27;s seed powder.</li>
            <li> Face has been more brightly and smoothly. I am planning purchase again for more packages.</li>
            <li> These masks are so nice after cleansing and very relaxing to sit with one on. There are so many different kinds and they smell really good and leave the face nice and soft.</li>
            <li> very good. I just tried a bamboo one. the mask feel thin and comfortable. And it also give me many gifts which makes me feel very happy. I will continue to purchase in this store!!</li>
            <li> These masks do wonders on your skin. Its a moist facial masks, easy to apply and remove. It moisturizes your skin and keeps it shiny and healthy, not to mention they smell yummy and fresh. I highly recommend these kind of masks for dry skin, especially for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely repurchase them.</li>
            <li> Great masks! My favorite! All natural and preservatives free! Skin is very moist and bright afterward!</li>
            <li> Everything perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;the best shopping experience I have ever had!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that thick lotion feeling on my face</li>
            <li> Awesome makes your face feel soft,</li>
            <li> I bought them as a gift for a friend. She really like it.</li>
            <li> The innisfree cucumber pack came with The Face Shop mask sheets I bought so I decided to try it out and do a comparison. I&#x27;m gravitating towards Innisfree because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Paraben free! Face shop masks have paraben which I&#x27;m cautious of, but unlike Face shop masks, I think Innisfree are more fragrant which I don&#x27;t like. I prefer more natural/herbal scents which Face Shop fulfills. But overall I prefer health over fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s a perfect fit! The Face Shop masks are really large and I always get bubbles with them b/c they overlap everywhere. The Innisface masks are PERFECT, as if they were made for my face! And it feels more comfortable that way.&lt;br /&gt;3. They don&#x27;t have a burning sensation. For some reason The Face Shop masks give me this burning sensation during the first 2-3 mins and also feel really cold when I walk around. Not sure if it&#x27;s the alcohol derivatives. With Innisfree it feels more natural, slight chillish feeling because I leave them in the fridge and the masks are generally thicker, more gel-like. With the eye-flaps, I can literally fall asleep in these! With Face Shop&#x27;s, not as much.&lt;br /&gt;4. Easy un-fold, easy apply! Because they are smaller and thicker (not so flimsy), I can easily unfold them and just place it on my face in a jiffy. Literally took me half the time I would with a Face shop mask even though it was my first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for results for Innisfree, not sure yet, will update. But the Face shop masks has shown results. In the winter my skin usually peels in extremely dry areas despite the amount and loads of lotion I wear. However after using 3 masks for 3 days, they didn&#x27;t dry out [today], and it was windy + snow! Overall, Innisfree seems to be the better match, minus the fragrance &#x3D;[</li>
            <li> my skin is fresh and it seems to be very tight--looks like I maybe loosing my malasma YIPPIE</li>
            <li> These are great! Nice pack to try them all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of Korean face masks and the innisfree ones are my favorite. Unlike other masks I&#x27;ve tried, they don&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on my face which can break out my skin. The masks themselves seem to be made of thinner  material so I feel like they stick to my face better. Some of the masks in this set also have like a milkiness type quality to them which I found really moisturizing. Overall I liked the variety of the masks in the set, no two were the same. The price is really good for the amount of masks that are included and considering Innisfree is like a low-mid range cosmetics company similar to Faceshop but not as easily available in the US.</li>
            <li> Always packed with moisture and with a great range of masks. Innisfree masks are my favorite sheet masks - they&#x27;re not thin enough to rip, but aren&#x27;t thick and uncomfortably heavy. You also cannot beat the value.</li>
            <li> Just received today, I did think it would come earlier but my packaging indicated South Korea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was so excited that I opened the package to fast and nicked a mask so of course I had to use it tonight; the rose mask is wonderful it is not overpowering and the mask is thicker then some I have previously bought at the Asian market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, samples! of things that I have wanted to try for awhile like skin food peach sake, and even eye cream. Great deal I am excited to give one of the packages I bought to my mother for mothers day. Would totally buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product immensely as it give my skin the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of newness. Each time I use one of these masks my complexion is brighter, recives intense moisturazation. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love these masks. I also tried a mask from The Face Shop, which I later found out had parabens in it. Needless to say my super sensitive skin did not like that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently been laid up in bed with a high fever, and needed to cool down. Cold compresses always leave my skin dehydrated, so I tried the green tea sheet mask as a cooling alternative, which felt amazing while laying under my ceiling fan. Highly recommend this use as well as for replenishing after a day at the beach, working up a sweat, cold winter activities, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variety is interesting but I wish they had a little info on which skin issues to use the different packs for.</li>
            <li> Korean stuffs are always good.</li>
            <li> There are so many different Asian sheet masks, and some of them are very expensive. Since one should use a sheet mask about 1-2 times a week, this can really add up! These Innisfree masks are cheap and you get a ton of em so it&#x27;s a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;Each different &#x27;flavor&#x27; has different uses, but I gotta say it&#x27;s kind of like splitting hairs.. all I know is that I wake up with a fresh face. I take the promises written on the packaging with a grain of salt.. I mean for $1.50 a mask, I&#x27;m not expecting miracles here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use the mask, wash your face and tear off the top of the package carefully. Inside would be a very thin mask.. thin enough to tear very easily, so be careful to unfold it properly! There are eye, nose and mouth holes and positioning the mask is quite easy. The liquid clings to the mask and to the face, and once you adjust it, lie down and relax for about 20 minutes. It is soooo refreshing and lovely to lie down with a lovely cold mask, it really feels like a spa night! After 20 minutes, discard the mask and gently massage the leftover liquid into your face. You can wash your face, but it would be a waste (it does feel a little sticky). I just go to sleep and wake up with a lovely bright face.</li>
            <li> The masks are really good, make my skin better, already 2nd purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try these facial masks and add them to my daily routine. Unfortunately they did not get along with my skin so well...Perhaps due to the citric elements that were too acidic for my skin. After using 2 masks, my face broke out. Therefore, I went on a hiatus. Refusing to throw them out I gave them a second change and oddly enough I noticed the serum changed color and became very watery. The result was the same. The only redeeming quality of the masks were that they fit my face well.</li>
            <li> The size of the mask is just right. It fits perfectly. Even though i dont know if it can do what it says but my face feels very smooth after applying it. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Whole family enjoyed them.</li>
            <li> One of my friends recommended these masks to me, the price is not bad at all, so I decided to give a try. It shipped from Korea, I guess thatâ€™s why it takes a while.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the products for few weeks, these are very nice masks, smells good, gentle, even good for my sensitive skin. I will repurchase again.</li>
            <li> Great way to find your favorite mask. I absolutely love the rose mask. Leaves skin plump and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with these face masks. I&#x27;ve heard good things about cloth face masks, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything worth purchasing in nearby stores. Innisfree seemed to have a lot of positive feedback, so I decided to give their 15-sheet pack a try. I&#x27;m very glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive combination skin with frequent hormonal acne, so I&#x27;m wary of using anything too harsh. These masks were cool, soothing, and easy to use. After a couple of weeks (I used one every other night), my skin was soft, smooth, and glowing. The only downside is that I ran out a while ago so my skin has reverted back to its normal state, but I will definitely be purchasing again soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I really liked the sample lotions that came with the pack. The snail and lightening creams were great, but the CC cream was a little chalky for my tastes. Still, it was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Love it so many flavors to choose from&lt;br /&gt;Great price</li>
            <li> Im obsessed now. Love that they are natural. Like that they tell you (in english) what each is best for. Such a fun pampering tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really buying into the Korean skincare hype so sheet masks were definitely on my &amp;#34;to buy&amp;#34; list, especially after my best friend introduced me to them. These Innifree sheet masks are by far the best smelling masks I&#x27;ve tried so far! The different scents are so lovely and soothing, such a great plus on top of the nutrients these masks provide your skin. I have not found any of them to be cause any skin irritations or clog my pores in any way. In my typical skincare routine before bed, I apply the mask after my essence and ampoule and before my moisturizer. The masks always leave my skin soft and supple. Overall the masks fit fairly well as far as the one-piece masks go.. I definitely recommend these to anyone looking to pamper themselves a bit at home! Happy masking :)  Tip: Pop your mask in the fridge for a few minutes prior to application for a nice cooling sensation when you put it on!</li>
            <li> Some of sheet masks I like some I don&#x27;t. But for the price, they are what they are. My skin always feels soothed after using, and ample essence leaves my skin hydrated. If I had to complain I would say they are to scented for a Korean brand. But I still enjoyed them. No miracle skin improvements, but no bad breakouts either.</li>
            <li> Great products will continuos buy</li>
            <li> I love using these masks. Using them for the first time might be a bit tricky especially since they are delicate and susceptible to tearing, but I would rather use these than a traditional face mask that you have to apply with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulk of the information on the back of the packet is in Korean but from what I can understand is that you would apply the mask and leave it on for 10-20 minutes. After you discard the mask, massage the essence into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is normal/combination skin (oily t-zone and occasional hormonal pimples) and I can use almost anything without having issues. If you are prone to breakouts or have sensitive skin, I would recommend using a small patch of the mask to test before you actually use it. The essence is a little thick and it takes a bit of time to absorb but I didn&#x27;t need to moisturize afterwards and my skin felt hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase more once I run out.</li>
