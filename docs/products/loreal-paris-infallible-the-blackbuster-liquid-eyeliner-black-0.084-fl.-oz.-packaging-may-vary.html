            <li>if I try to use warm water remove it.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>This is very easy to control</li>
            <li>And because it&#x27;s like a marker, applying it is so easy to do!</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is easy to put on and that&#x27;s what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>This eyeliner is the best, but the one i got comes out watery and not black.</li>
            <li>Decided to give this one a try since the original is pretty damn awesome.</li>
            <li>Good quick tool</li>
            <li>easy to use, effective</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I really liked the big felt tip and how easy it was to trace perfect wings with it.</li>
            <li>Love it and I will purchase again</li>
            <li>and I am always on the lookout for a bolder and better eyeliner.</li>
            <li>When I spotted this one, I figure it should work because it looks more like a sharpie.</li>
            <li>Being a makeup artist &amp; having tried &amp; purchased every type of makeup under the sun I have to say I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>i ended up buying the NYX marker anyway since the quality is better.</li>
            <li>LOVE the thickness and precision of this...</li>
            <li>Stays nice and smooth all day.</li>
            <li>You are fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I will have one of these on hand for Halloween for sure, and my daughter now uses this every day.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The differences are drastic, and mostly in quality.</li>
            <li>So easy to work with.</li>
            <li>It smudges easily.</li>
            <li>Easy and smooth application, though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to tell you more about this item, but unfortunately I never got to use it.</li>
            <li>With a name like &amp;#34;Blackbuster&amp;#34; I&#x27;d think this would be more bold.  </li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t get the liquid to the top</li>
            <li>Both came in bubble wrap, without the original package.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used soft waxy pencils, brush-on liners, cake liners you use with a brush and a drop of water,  but this product slides to the top of my all time list of favorite eyeliner products.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through countless brands of eyeliner and this one is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It gives good coverage on my lids that last all day.</li>
            <li>Nice tapered sponge-ish tip great for dramatic eyeliner looks like cat eyes.</li>
            <li>That is why I bought it, typically their products are great.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and works very well.</li>
            <li>Love this, I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>No mess, no nasty powder</li>
            <li>Thin, clean lines, looks good, stays put!</li>
            <li>Nice rich black color....</li>
            <li>It applies dark on the first time for me, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It has decent staying power &amp; for me I really feel that the shape of the pen &amp; tip makes for really easy use.</li>
            <li>So, I am a huge fan of the original (skinny) infallible eyeliner that I use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Pleased, I like the larger applicator.</li>
            <li>Very strong, and the ink doesn&#x27;t dry off on the tip</li>
            <li>This liquid eyeliner in a tube is easy to use, goes on nicely but a little spotty requiring a tiny touch up here and there but w/o any hassle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this eyeliner because I have used so many other loreal products in the past and loved them</li>
            <li>Nib too hard turn a good pain</li>
            <li>But this is much cheaper and easier to use.</li>
            <li>Thanks for fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Expected more from L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>.. doesn&#x27;t go on very well,</li>
            <li>great to cover the line from false lashes</li>
            <li>So good for who likes thick eyeliners</li>
            <li>I normally purchase Lancome and Clinique eyeliners, but this is very comparable.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and extremely long lasting.</li>
            <li>A little chunky, but overall a good marker.</li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and stays moist, unlike other marker type eyeliners.</li>
            <li>Liner seems to wear very well when a finger might get near it to rub an itch</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely, but is not really that super-saturating, intense, inky black</li>
            <li>Great stuff for dramatic eyes!  </li>
            <li>this is easy to use, but doesnt seem to last long.</li>
            <li>Dried too fast, It didn&#x27;t last more then 2 weeks</li>
            <li>One is a nice black color, the 2-nd one is very watery and messy.</li>
            <li>Goes on super black and can be easily remidied with a little spit and a q-tip.</li>
            <li>Think a marker that is near the end of its life; that is this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>and so far I have not had it smear or smudge from any dampness.  </li>
            <li>I love liquid liner and have been using Stila lately because it is waterproof.  </li>
            <li>My 17 year old daughter swiped it from me before I had the chance for even one application.</li>
            <li>This product did not last as long as advertised after being applied, nor does the volume of the product last for more than 2-3 weeks after daily use, which requires touch-ups to maintain the desired effect throughout the day.</li>
            <li>You do have to go over twice to make it dark but this is great for drawing the wings as the tip is thin.</li>
            <li>Used it yesterday in major heat and it stayed.</li>
            <li>This one does not have as much pigment, so I need at least 3 layers for pitch black line &amp; wipes off much easer than the original.</li>
            <li>but it came out as this watered down grayish color if it even came out and this was on my first try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and you can make a thin or thick line really easily.</li>
            <li>i bought this because it was less expensive than the NYX super fat eye marker that i love and looked like it would be the same thing.</li>
            <li>I stored it upside down so the ink would flow to the tip and shook it really</li>
            <li>Create thick or thin lines quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I still prefer my wet n wild liners for $2 from Wally World!</li>
            <li>If I had any complaint it might be that the black top edge is not as &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;  as it could be so</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If I had any complaint it might be that the black top edge is not as &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;  as it could be so</li>
            <li> The tip is not too soft so gives a steady line and not too hard so you don&#x27;t scratch yourself.</li>
            <li> long it will last, I can&#x27;t say yet since I just started using it.  </li>
            <li> , no waxy pencil leads that break off and no struggling with a shaky hand to get that dang wet brush to go in the right direction across the eyelid!  </li>
            <li> Color is not consistent plus the size of the applier is too big.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it smudges way too easily and looks messy in the inner corners of your eyes.</li>
            <li> It rubs off every few hours at the part closest to my eye, it&#x27;s a little too thick to be precise, and the formula is a bit watery.</li>
            <li> I have it a couple of shakes and left it too down for an hour</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a marker that was totally watered down.</li>
            <li> The color is quite a bit lighter/sheerer than expected.</li>
            <li> It came out empty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely empty.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as I expected</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the worlds steadiest hand and the thicker nib makes it so much easier to use this than the thin little floppy ones.  </li>
            <li> Not as dark as I was expecting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a marker, however when you go to turn it upside down to apply, it won&#x27;t apply.</li>
            <li> and she couldn&#x27;t find this type of eye liner ( in dark black )</li>
            <li> It is a wimpy black marker.  </li>
            <li> The eyeliner is not too black.</li>
            <li> so it was actually black and</li>
            <li> The point is rigid so it doesn&#x27;t bend all over and cause a mess.</li>
            <li> I just got this out of the package and the liquid is a gray watery mess.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> so I freaked that it had dried out.</li>
            <li> but I still wouldnt waste anymore money on this product.</li>
            <li> I wear eyeliner practically everyday</li>
            <li> So it dried out a bit.</li>
            <li> maybe the one I received was dried up?</li>
            <li> so it was still a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but sadly it was complete waste of money for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have darker skin but the black stands out so well!</li>
            <li> I use Stila and Lancome liquid eyeliner usually and I&#x27;ve been trying to find something that costs less but is comparable to these eyeliners.</li>
            <li> This stuff it very black..</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I always seem to buy eyeliner with little brushes, and I feel like the application is no good, but I don&#x27;t have this problem with this item.  </li>
            <li> Hard to apply but will stay on</li>
            <li> Hard to draw on unless you think a really thick line on your eyelid.</li>
            <li> like a thick sharpie.</li>
            <li> and you can go from a thin, everyday sort of line to something very dramatic for nighttime and also for costume.  </li>
            <li> I am having a difficult time getting the hang of this liner because it is so thick.</li>
            <li> Worst money I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> I do not like how ink looks on skin, looks like bad marker on whiteboard.</li>
            <li> The one I got from amazon this time is defective:(</li>
            <li> but now Amazon doesn&#x27;t have this option anymore :(</li>
            <li> worst eyeliner ever, trashed it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst liquid eyeliner I ever purchased.</li>

            <li> This eyeliner is great for the price. At first I couldn&#x27;t get the liquid to the top so I freaked that it had dried out. I have it a couple of shakes and left it too down for an hour and it had been perfectly moist since. This stuff it very black..like a thick sharpie. I love it!! I get compliments and lasts all day!!</li>
            <li> i loved it , it is great.</li>
            <li> Perfect if you want an eyeliner whose tip doesn&#x27;t wither. Very strong, and the ink doesn&#x27;t dry off on the tip so you can take your time drawing it.</li>
            <li> this is easy to use, but doesnt seem to last long. Could be my oily skin, but i had flakes through the day (tried without mascara to ensure that was not the issue.</li>
            <li> Love it and I will purchase again</li>
            <li> It applies dark on the first time for me, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> worst eyeliner ever, trashed it</li>
            <li> So good for who likes thick eyeliners</li>
            <li> Nib too hard turn a good pain</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner ever. It goes on neatly. The point is rigid so it doesn&#x27;t bend all over and cause a mess.</li>
            <li> No complaints. I love this pen! It&#x27;s easy to use, and you can make a thin or thick line really easily.</li>
            <li> I do not like how ink looks on skin, looks like bad marker on whiteboard. Color is not consistent plus the size of the applier is too big.</li>
            <li> great to cover the line from false lashes</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner i have ever used</li>
            <li> This is an awesome eyeliner. It gives good coverage on my lids that last all day.</li>
            <li> With a name like &amp;#34;Blackbuster&amp;#34; I&#x27;d think this would be more bold.  It is a wimpy black marker.  Think a marker that is near the end of its life; that is this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Worst money I have ever spent. It&#x27;s like a marker, however when you go to turn it upside down to apply, it won&#x27;t apply. It&#x27;s not even. I have to put on eyeliner (the crayon type) and then just highlight my eyes. Oh well, live and learn!</li>
            <li> The color is quite a bit lighter/sheerer than expected. Easy and smooth application, though.</li>
            <li> Nice tapered sponge-ish tip great for dramatic eyeliner looks like cat eyes. I normally purchase Lancome and Clinique eyeliners, but this is very comparable.</li>
            <li> I am having a difficult time getting the hang of this liner because it is so thick. I still prefer my wet n wild liners for $2 from Wally World!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this eyeliner because I have used so many other loreal products in the past and loved them but it came out as this watered down grayish color if it even came out and this was on my first try. I might have just got a defective one but I still wouldnt waste anymore money on this product.</li>
            <li> This product did not last as long as advertised after being applied, nor does the volume of the product last for more than 2-3 weeks after daily use, which requires touch-ups to maintain the desired effect throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I do not like the way it goes on. Hard to apply but will stay on</li>
            <li> lid comes off but the inside lid is still there. Have to use my teeth to get the inside lid off.</li>
            <li> I wear eyeliner practically everyday and I am always on the lookout for a bolder and better eyeliner. When I spotted this one, I figure it should work because it looks more like a sharpie. It works wonderfully! I have darker skin but the black stands out so well! And because it&#x27;s like a marker, applying it is so easy to do! Everyone compliments me constantly. Definitely buying this from now on!</li>
            <li> Perfect, The best eyeliner ever. I will not change. I hope they never go out of business or stop making it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only eyeliner I use</li>
            <li> Love this, I have sensitive eyes an this works great for me, easy to apply an will use it again an agian</li>
            <li> A little chunky, but overall a good marker. Goes on super black and can be easily remidied with a little spit and a q-tip. I find it irrates my eyes though  if I try to use warm water remove it.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price. Good quick tool</li>
            <li> Being a makeup artist &amp; having tried &amp; purchased every type of makeup under the sun I have to say I really love this stuff. It has decent staying power &amp; for me I really feel that the shape of the pen &amp; tip makes for really easy use. Create thick or thin lines quickly and easily. Nice rich black color....hope to find it in brown also!</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is not too black. You do have to go over twice to make it dark but this is great for drawing the wings as the tip is thin. I was satisfied with this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used soft waxy pencils, brush-on liners, cake liners you use with a brush and a drop of water,  but this product slides to the top of my all time list of favorite eyeliner products.  No mess, no nasty powder, no waxy pencil leads that break off and no struggling with a shaky hand to get that dang wet brush to go in the right direction across the eyelid!  This liquid eyeliner in a tube is easy to use, goes on nicely but a little spotty requiring a tiny touch up here and there but w/o any hassle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long it will last, I can&#x27;t say yet since I just started using it.  If I had any complaint it might be that the black top edge is not as &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;  as it could be so what I do is take an artist&#x27;s brush with a touch of gray eyebrow powder and run that along the edge.  Liner seems to wear very well when a finger might get near it to rub an itch and so far I have not had it smear or smudge from any dampness.  Very happy and will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> its a good product for a store brand. but just be reeeeeaaallly patient applying it</li>
            <li> i bought this because it was less expensive than the NYX super fat eye marker that i love and looked like it would be the same thing. unfortunately it smudges way too easily and looks messy in the inner corners of your eyes. i ended up buying the NYX marker anyway since the quality is better. stay away from this one!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the worlds steadiest hand and the thicker nib makes it so much easier to use this than the thin little floppy ones.  I jsut wish I&#x27;d ordered the waterproof version.</li>
            <li> I love liquid liner and have been using Stila lately because it is waterproof.  But this is much cheaper and easier to use. Used it yesterday in major heat and it stayed. Winner.</li>
            <li> I use this any day I wear eyeliner.  It goes on smooth and works very well.</li>
            <li> LOVE the thickness and precision of this... I can use this in a hurry and it is perfect for creating &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34;. Second time buying!</li>
            <li> Save your money. It makes your eyes look like raccoons. Waste of money! And it is so runny! Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you, save your money It&#x27;s like a marker that was totally watered down. It&#x27;s the worst liquid eyeliner I ever purchased.</li>
            <li> excellent eye liner. Stays nice and smooth all day. Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Thin, clean lines, looks good, stays put!</li>
            <li> This sucked yeah the brush was good but mine didnt come with any ink in it</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is the best, but the one i got comes out watery and not black. I have bought this item before and it is so awesome, so if this happens to you don&#x27;t let it be your final judgement... The one I got from amazon this time is defective:(</li>
            <li> I oder 2 L&#x27;Oreal Paris The Blackbuster Eyeliner by Infallible, 0.084 Ounces. One is a nice black color, the 2-nd one is very watery and messy. Both came in bubble wrap, without the original package.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to attach a picture, so you can see the difference but now Amazon doesn&#x27;t have this option anymore :(</li>
            <li> It came out empty. I thought I had to shake it or something but no, mine It&#x27;s completely empty.</li>
            <li> Was in the stores with girlfriend and she couldn&#x27;t find this type of eye liner ( in dark black ) so I got this one for her on Amazon . Just what she wanted so she is happy with it .</li>
            <li> The color looks watery and it was a big dissatisfaction</li>
            <li> Thanks for fast delivery. You are fabulous!</li>
            <li> So easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, but is not really that super-saturating, intense, inky black I like and expect in liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner. Easy to use and stays moist, unlike other marker type eyeliners.</li>
            <li> It smudges easily. Expected more from L&#x27;Oreal. That is why I bought it, typically their products are great. This one is run of the mill, I can get the same results from a dollar eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I use Stila and Lancome liquid eyeliner usually and I&#x27;ve been trying to find something that costs less but is comparable to these eyeliners. This L&#x27;Oreal eyeliner doesn&#x27;t come close. It rubs off every few hours at the part closest to my eye, it&#x27;s a little too thick to be precise, and the formula is a bit watery. The search goes on...</li>
            <li> Loved it but the lid separated after just a month.  So it dried out a bit.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for dramatic eyes!  This is very easy to control and you can go from a thin, everyday sort of line to something very dramatic for nighttime and also for costume.  I will have one of these on hand for Halloween for sure, and my daughter now uses this every day.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof....</li>
            <li> great eyeliner, just what I wanted</li>
            <li> easy to use, effective</li>
            <li> It is very nice&lt;br /&gt;I like it</li>
            <li> Love it. The best eyeliner for me. The tip is not too soft so gives a steady line and not too hard so you don&#x27;t scratch yourself.</li>
            <li> So, I am a huge fan of the original (skinny) infallible eyeliner that I use on a daily basis. Decided to give this one a try since the original is pretty damn awesome. The differences are drastic, and mostly in quality. This one does not have as much pigment, so I need at least 3 layers for pitch black line &amp; wipes off much easer than the original. I never had a smudge issue with the skinny eyeliner but this is is not smudge proof. Although it is usable, i would not be buying another one once i run out.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and extremely long lasting. I have gone through countless brands of eyeliner and this one is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> easy to use, looks great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to tell you more about this item, but unfortunately I never got to use it. My 17 year old daughter swiped it from me before I had the chance for even one application. I have however noticed her cat eyes look amazing, so it must be good.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as I expected.. doesn&#x27;t go on very well, maybe the one I received was dried up?</li>
            <li> The tip of this is basically equivalent to a marker. Hard to draw on unless you think a really thick line on your eyelid.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as I was expecting</li>
            <li> I just got this out of the package and the liquid is a gray watery mess. Shaking it or doing multiple passes doesn&#x27;t help. I do like the brush so I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars rather than 1 but it&#x27;s unusable. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s defective or what but sadly it was complete waste of money for me.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I stored it upside down so the ink would flow to the tip and shook it really well so it was actually black and the consistency was decent the next day, however it smudges and comes off after less than an hour of wear so it was still a waste of money. It&#x27;s a shame because I really liked the big felt tip and how easy it was to trace perfect wings with it.</li>
            <li> Pleased, I like the larger applicator.</li>
            <li> Dried too fast, It didn&#x27;t last more then 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is easy to put on and that&#x27;s what I was looking for!  I always seem to buy eyeliner with little brushes, and I feel like the application is no good, but I don&#x27;t have this problem with this item.  I&#x27;m planning on buying again when I need another!</li>
