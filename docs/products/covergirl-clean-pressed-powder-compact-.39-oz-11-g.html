            <li>Make my complexion clear and minimizes pores.</li>

            <li> These seem dried out.  </li>
            <li> I got a headache after wearing this for a few hours and had to remove it.  </li>
            <li> I tried this instead of the green container and the color seems slightly lighter than the equivalent green box but not enough to make much of a difference on my (winter) skin; however, the smell is downright nasty.  </li>
            <li> One cant go wrong when purchasing CoverGirl products.</li>

            <li> Good quality product for the price!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Make my complexion clear and minimizes pores.</li>
            <li> One cant go wrong when purchasing CoverGirl products. I am happy to find the perfect shade. Classic beige appears to vary from batch to batch. I dont know why, but it does. When I find the perfect Classic Beige shade, I like to purchase as many as I can afford.</li>
            <li> These seem dried out.  Oil collects on the powder.  Too solid.  Not powdery enough</li>
            <li> like it just what I want it, I will get another one in the future, little bit darker</li>
            <li> The color is a bit mis-leading on the screen, in my opinion, but for anyone who needs to use something over their base or foundation, this is a great brand of face powder.  I do recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I have been using CoverGirl powder since I was young.  I have tried others, but always go back to CoverGirl.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I love the coverage of this and the color was a spot on match.  It is a very natural look, blends in very nicely to cover flaws as it should but doesn&#x27;t look cakey.  Great, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes but... I can&#x27;t use this because the smell is so very over powering.  It smells like a mixture of musk and baby powder.  I got a headache after wearing this for a few hours and had to remove it.  I see no reason that a make-up product should smell so strong.  It is awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, I really like the natural look it provided.</li>
            <li> How nice to have things delivered to my home and save $$$ at the same time. Will always use this method.</li>
            <li> True to color! My only problem is that the powder has an aromatic scent to it. Other than that, I really love the product!</li>
            <li> I normally like this product and have used it for many years. However, for some reason, the one I received through Amazon was different. The powder does not take away any shine.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this powder.  Great scent, I do not break out and it is great at setting foundation.</li>
            <li> This is the long-time favorite I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I tried this instead of the green container and the color seems slightly lighter than the equivalent green box but not enough to make much of a difference on my (winter) skin; however, the smell is downright nasty.  I wonder if powder can spoil.  Since I have yet to see other complaints about this issue, I will check with Cover Girl to see what the deal is.</li>
