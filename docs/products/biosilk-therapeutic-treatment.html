            <li>Good product, real deal.</li>
            <li>you so much you have a good weekeand</li>
            <li>This has a great smell, adds a lot of shine to your hair, and absorbs quickly but didn&#x27;t really do anything for my split ends.</li>
            <li>I expect a full refund!</li>
            <li>that breaks easily.</li>
            <li>My hair gets tangled easily, so I use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does wonders for the hair.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very mild to non-existing.</li>
            <li>Smells great, makes your hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>This product however is pretty amazing.  </li>

            <li>and it looks good as new, not something I could do when I used hair spray.  </li>
            <li>My hair would not survive without this fabulous concoction.</li>
            <li>I also put a dime size amount in my hand, rub my hands together and run it lightly over my hair to get rid of the frizzies.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth in my hair, on my skin, my face, it doesn&#x27;t matter where I apply it</li>

            <li>This is a great value in this bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>so good for my daughters,they need it every early morning.</li>
            <li>super EASY to detangle</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because it had an overwhelming number of positive reviews and the fact that it was relatively cheap, I went ahead and took the risk and bought it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the original BioSilk, and I know it because I used to use the original one.</li>
            <li>This IS the original Biosilk product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2.It says 12oz (355mml), But the original one is 12oz (350mml).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a dime sized drop and add more if needed after trying that first.</li>
            <li>And I plan on ordering some more at the first of Feburary</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>This is not like the original 2 bottles I bought at a salon.  </li>

            <li>Works great for my loose curl hair.  </li>
            <li>Also great on dry skin!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it and it lasts a really long time making the purchase price even better!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do anything special except, Silk Therapy...</li>
            <li>Love this so much.</li>
            <li>This can&#x27;t be true &amp;#34;Biosilk&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very helpful in the winter with static.</li>
            <li>already contacted with customer service, and luckily got the full refund of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a tremendous difference in the texture and health of</li>
            <li>It was shipped quick and wrapped well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loyal to it ever since.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t soak in as quickly as I&#x27;d like</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s not fake!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Quick and easy shipment, exact same as if I bought it in a store, but with a much better price.</li>
            <li>I would suggest the nexus pro-mend which is probably around the same price as this and work amazingly</li>
            <li>and so I really needed something to help smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>It helps calm the frizz and hold the style.</li>
            <li>So worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love this makes my hair really soft</li>
            <li>how much is going to be good enough for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an old favorite.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this non greasy, light weight oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my dry naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product, makes my hair so soft and shiny, even if your hair is dry and full of hairspray !!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much at all, maybe a nickel sized portion</li>
            <li>I have \\&quot;fine hair but lots of it\\&quot; according to professional hair stylists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With heat styling, or just leaving my hair natural, I notice a huge difference with and without the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real people!</li>
            <li>Thanks, BioSilk and Amazon!</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Thank you for the FAST delivery!</li>
            <li>I do admit the bigger one does smell a bit more like alcohol</li>
            <li>I stopped using this product and my hair began to break so much!</li>
            <li>Very pricey for the amount BUT worth the price!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been coloring, blow drying and using a hot curling iron on my hair for years.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that gives me that healthy shine but still retains the volume.</li>
            <li>/&gt;smells exactly like rave hair spray.</li>
            <li>Love this for second day curly hair and for my kids after their shower.</li>
            <li>After a couple months of consistent use we noticed her hair is not breaking and is growing longer.</li>
            <li>First observation.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>Excellent price for a typically expensive product.</li>
            <li>Good for dried out hair, chemically processed hair, puts the softness and shine your hair needs.</li>
            <li>I have curly long hair that is sometimes, most times, unmanageable and</li>
            <li>long hairs like mine, I suggest you to use it on the top to reduce \\</li>
            <li>I love this product for my very long hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel silky soft and gives my hair super shine.</li>
            <li>so this bottle will last me all year, easily.</li>
            <li>I only use a nickel size amount and apply it to the front (around my face) and ends first, then smooth out over my roots.</li>
            <li>good thing it last a long time</li>
            <li>have noticed there is a fine line from just enough to too much with this product.  </li>
            <li>keeps my hair very moisturized</li>
            <li>I recommend it for whoever has a really tangled hair</li>
            <li>Really tames the freezy hair.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t remember.  </li>
            <li>- it made my hair feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the real Biosilk, not a knockoff like some have stated.</li>
            <li>I believe this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>plus it was Cheap compared to my local store prices.</li>
            <li>My hair is soooo much smoother and healthier looking now that I use this.</li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit of this makes my hair so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>This is a very helpful product to use in order to avoid losing hair.  </li>
            <li>I have use it for a number of years and it really helps.  </li>
            <li>Too much alcohol -- dries your hair.</li>
            <li>My Hair Is Still Straight..</li>
            <li>I am really low-maintenance with my hair</li>
            <li>If you use too much it will make your hair appear oily and became a bit sticky.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>I found it to be the real thing.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when the bottle arrived, as pictured and described, and it was the same product I&#x27;ve been using for years but paying more than twice the price for.</li>
            <li>I used my neighbors Biosilk a few times and noticed how nice my hair felt afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, thick hair that tends to have a lot of fly aways.</li>
            <li>I put it in my hair when it&#x27;s damp and then again to smooth flyaways after flat ironing or curling.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use many of their other hair care products because of skin sensitivities but can still use this.</li>
            <li>trademark is not same as the original one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great, I swim in a pool all the time and my hair gets dry, a little of this in the palm of your hand, rub in all over and through your hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone that wants silky hair.</li>
            <li>I have bought Biosilk Therapy in the past 8 years many times; this time, it seems to me after the second use it is the real deal, not a fake version of the original.</li>
            <li>now i have nothing bad to say about it , ordering was easy , packaging great.</li>
            <li>It also seems to dry my hair out instead of making it soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>hair is generally rough and frizzy but this one keeps them very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using Biosilk for over 10 years and LOVE how it protects, smooths (without weighing down) and shines.</li>
            <li>It is hands down my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>I could live without it!</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate and need something to protect my hair from the heat and sun.</li>
            <li>and I mix it with my favorite fragrance (black poppy)</li>
            <li>I try to err on the side of less is more.  </li>
            <li>Biosilk is a good product if you have long hair that is somewhat fine or thin.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a while and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly reccomended product</li>
            <li>It takes a very small amount daily to keep my hair in great shape.</li>
            <li>I was so surprise about the size of the bottle, for just a little more money,</li>
            <li>Shake it up good and A LITTLE goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair and this really helps control my curls without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>I have used it for several years and it is always my first go-to product as I get ready for my day.</li>
            <li>I have waist-length hair and have tried many products to get the sleek without being limp look.</li>
            <li>But if u wash ur hair everyday u should be ok</li>
            <li>I used to buy this all the time, this does not seem like the original product, it makes my hair feel extremely dry!</li>
            <li>I love it, I only have to use a small drop and it leaves my hair super silky.</li>
            <li>Just love this product to tame frizz by treating hair cuticle and impart shine.  </li>
            <li>I think it is so discounted because BioSilk came out with a new bottle design.</li>
            <li>The curve design on the bottle (and on the product page) is the new design shown on Farouk&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>&amp; i Live In Texas &amp;</li>
            <li>For me, it helps to control the frizz some in the humidity I live in.</li>
            <li>for me, my hair cannot live without my Biosilk Therapy.</li>
            <li>Works great in cold and very humid climates.</li>
            <li>Product feels exactly the same on my hair, too.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my legs after a shave....makes them so soft!  </li>
            <li>And EVERYTHING Is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>the Biosilk works in both styles keeping my hair soft!</li>
            <li>The liquid in my bottle moved very freely and wasn&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use it when my hair is damp, right before I blow it dry.</li>
            <li>Thought this was the smaller size and to my surprise it was huge, for the the same cost as the smaller size found in stores.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky soft and I don&#x27;t need to use a lot,</li>
            <li>The consistency of their product was very different - the liquid was much thicker.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and shiny but not greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft and flowy</li>
            <li>Leaves my Hair Soft and Silky.</li>
            <li>The bio silk keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Even my hair dresser makes remarks how soft my hair is.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and silky not a lot of shine though.</li>
            <li>It immediately makes my hair soft and shiny and reduces tangles.</li>
            <li>I have an old bottle I purchased from my hair dresser</li>
            <li>/&gt;super soft hair&lt;</li>
            <li>So far this product is working.</li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it&#x27;s very oily</li>
            <li>This helps smooth my hair without leavin it heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel really soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I have used this product for quiet a few years now.</li>
            <li>It is thick; it has a good scent, and seems it will last for long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair that I color, blow dry, flat iron, and use hot curlers on a lot.  </li>
            <li>(Remember: during the weeks or months after you open a new bottle, the water in the product is evaporating, and the product is thickening.</li>
            <li>just a couple of dollars more the bottle was at least three size bigger  than the ones I purchased at beauty saloons</li>
            <li>I bought this without reading the reviews because I currently own a small bottle of the original biosilk that I got from the chi factory itself and after I purchased it I saw the reviews saying it was fake</li>
            <li>I have very thick, corse curly hair - this product smooths my hair - makes it softer and more managable -</li>
            <li>A little expensive but worth it for a nice relaxing afternoon.</li>
            <li>It always leaves my hair soft with just enough shine.</li>
            <li>It take me a long while to use up a bottle, and the end of the bottle is always thicker than when I open a new bottle.)  </li>
            <li>It really helps keep down my frizz</li>
            <li>Light fragrance (not strong like some hair products that give other people headaches when they&#x27;re around</li>
            <li>So, if anybody wants to lose less hair and save your hair, anybody can use it to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favourite hair product, I have dry curly hair and this product relax&#x27;s my hair and does feel soft, use it after each and every shower for over 5 years</li>
            <li>You need only use a small amount on freshly shampooed hair, and work it into the ends before blow-drying.</li>
            <li>but I have long hair and it was getting expensive; I stop using for a while and regret it because I went through so many products trying to compare but had to go back because this is the only product that makes my hair feel, soft, silky and shiny!</li>

            <li> Silk therapy is awesome, but only if it is the genuine product.</li>
            <li> I love it best when I remember to put it in when my hair is wet before blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with a soft hold mousse and it helps keep my hair from being frizzy and fly away.</li>
            <li> Offers great frizz control, sheen and softness ...</li>

            <li> This has a great smell, adds a lot of shine to your hair, and absorbs quickly but didn&#x27;t really do anything for my split ends.</li>
            <li> I expect a full refund!</li>
            <li> that breaks easily.</li>
            <li> My hair gets tangled easily, so I use it every time I wash my hair.</li>

            <li> and it looks good as new, not something I could do when I used hair spray.  </li>
            <li> My hair would not survive without this fabulous concoction.</li>

            <li> so good for my daughters,they need it every early morning.</li>
            <li> super EASY to detangle</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because it had an overwhelming number of positive reviews and the fact that it was relatively cheap, I went ahead and took the risk and bought it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the original BioSilk, and I know it because I used to use the original one.</li>
            <li> This IS the original Biosilk product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2.It says 12oz (355mml), But the original one is 12oz (350mml).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a dime sized drop and add more if needed after trying that first.</li>
            <li> And I plan on ordering some more at the first of Feburary</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is not like the original 2 bottles I bought at a salon.  </li>
            <li> Great after shampoo product for dry and color treated hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is perm and also color this products is excellent to restore back the natural oil from chemical strip.</li>
            <li> Works great for my loose curl hair.  </li>
            <li> Also great on dry skin!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it and it lasts a really long time making the purchase price even better!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do anything special except, Silk Therapy...</li>
            <li> Love this so much.</li>
            <li> This can&#x27;t be true &amp;#34;Biosilk&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very helpful in the winter with static.</li>
            <li> already contacted with customer service, and luckily got the full refund of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a tremendous difference in the texture and health of</li>
            <li> It was shipped quick and wrapped well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loyal to it ever since.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t soak in as quickly as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> This product is great for giving your hair some shine without weighing it down or making it oily.  </li>
            <li> the product is good for age spots and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, does not weigh hair down, leaves a natural shine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not fake!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy shipment, exact same as if I bought it in a store, but with a much better price.</li>
            <li> I would suggest the nexus pro-mend which is probably around the same price as this and work amazingly</li>
            <li> and so I really needed something to help smooth it out.  </li>
            <li> It helps calm the frizz and hold the style.</li>
            <li> So worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this makes my hair really soft</li>
            <li> how much is going to be good enough for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an old favorite.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this non greasy, light weight oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my dry naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, makes my hair so soft and shiny, even if your hair is dry and full of hairspray !!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much at all, maybe a nickel sized portion</li>
            <li> I have \\&quot;fine hair but lots of it\\&quot; according to professional hair stylists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With heat styling, or just leaving my hair natural, I notice a huge difference with and without the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real people!</li>
            <li> Thanks, BioSilk and Amazon!</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Thank you for the FAST delivery!</li>
            <li> I do admit the bigger one does smell a bit more like alcohol</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product and my hair began to break so much!</li>
            <li> Very pricey for the amount BUT worth the price!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been coloring, blow drying and using a hot curling iron on my hair for years.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that gives me that healthy shine but still retains the volume.</li>
            <li> /&gt;smells exactly like rave hair spray.</li>
            <li> Love this for second day curly hair and for my kids after their shower.</li>
            <li> After a couple months of consistent use we noticed her hair is not breaking and is growing longer.</li>
            <li> First observation.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for a typically expensive product.</li>
            <li> Good for dried out hair, chemically processed hair, puts the softness and shine your hair needs.</li>
            <li> I have curly long hair that is sometimes, most times, unmanageable and</li>
            <li> long hairs like mine, I suggest you to use it on the top to reduce \\</li>
            <li> I love this product for my very long hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel silky soft and gives my hair super shine.</li>
            <li> so this bottle will last me all year, easily.</li>
            <li> I only use a nickel size amount and apply it to the front (around my face) and ends first, then smooth out over my roots.</li>
            <li> good thing it last a long time</li>
            <li> have noticed there is a fine line from just enough to too much with this product.  </li>
            <li> keeps my hair very moisturized</li>
            <li> I recommend it for whoever has a really tangled hair</li>
            <li> Really tames the freezy hair.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t remember.  </li>
            <li> - it made my hair feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the real Biosilk, not a knockoff like some have stated.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> plus it was Cheap compared to my local store prices.</li>
            <li> My hair is soooo much smoother and healthier looking now that I use this.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit of this makes my hair so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> This is a very helpful product to use in order to avoid losing hair.  </li>
            <li> I have use it for a number of years and it really helps.  </li>
            <li> Too much alcohol -- dries your hair.</li>
            <li> My Hair Is Still Straight..</li>
            <li> I am really low-maintenance with my hair</li>
            <li> If you use too much it will make your hair appear oily and became a bit sticky.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I found it to be the real thing.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when the bottle arrived, as pictured and described, and it was the same product I&#x27;ve been using for years but paying more than twice the price for.</li>
            <li> I used my neighbors Biosilk a few times and noticed how nice my hair felt afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, thick hair that tends to have a lot of fly aways.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair when it&#x27;s damp and then again to smooth flyaways after flat ironing or curling.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use many of their other hair care products because of skin sensitivities but can still use this.</li>
            <li> trademark is not same as the original one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is great, I swim in a pool all the time and my hair gets dry, a little of this in the palm of your hand, rub in all over and through your hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone that wants silky hair.</li>
            <li> I have bought Biosilk Therapy in the past 8 years many times; this time, it seems to me after the second use it is the real deal, not a fake version of the original.</li>
            <li> now i have nothing bad to say about it , ordering was easy , packaging great.</li>
            <li> It also seems to dry my hair out instead of making it soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> hair is generally rough and frizzy but this one keeps them very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using Biosilk for over 10 years and LOVE how it protects, smooths (without weighing down) and shines.</li>
            <li> It is hands down my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> I could live without it!</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid climate and need something to protect my hair from the heat and sun.</li>
            <li> and I mix it with my favorite fragrance (black poppy)</li>
            <li> I try to err on the side of less is more.  </li>
            <li> Biosilk is a good product if you have long hair that is somewhat fine or thin.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a while and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly reccomended product</li>
            <li> It takes a very small amount daily to keep my hair in great shape.</li>
            <li> I was so surprise about the size of the bottle, for just a little more money,</li>
            <li> Shake it up good and A LITTLE goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair and this really helps control my curls without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have used it for several years and it is always my first go-to product as I get ready for my day.</li>
            <li> I have waist-length hair and have tried many products to get the sleek without being limp look.</li>
            <li> But if u wash ur hair everyday u should be ok</li>
            <li> I used to buy this all the time, this does not seem like the original product, it makes my hair feel extremely dry!</li>
            <li> I love it, I only have to use a small drop and it leaves my hair super silky.</li>
            <li> Just love this product to tame frizz by treating hair cuticle and impart shine.  </li>
            <li> I think it is so discounted because BioSilk came out with a new bottle design.</li>
            <li> The curve design on the bottle (and on the product page) is the new design shown on Farouk&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li> &amp; i Live In Texas &amp;</li>
            <li> For me, it helps to control the frizz some in the humidity I live in.</li>
            <li> for me, my hair cannot live without my Biosilk Therapy.</li>
            <li> Works great in cold and very humid climates.</li>
            <li> Product feels exactly the same on my hair, too.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my legs after a shave....makes them so soft!  </li>
            <li> And EVERYTHING Is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> the Biosilk works in both styles keeping my hair soft!</li>
            <li> The liquid in my bottle moved very freely and wasn&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use it when my hair is damp, right before I blow it dry.</li>
            <li> Thought this was the smaller size and to my surprise it was huge, for the the same cost as the smaller size found in stores.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky soft and I don&#x27;t need to use a lot,</li>
            <li> The consistency of their product was very different - the liquid was much thicker.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and shiny but not greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft and flowy</li>
            <li> Leaves my Hair Soft and Silky.</li>
            <li> The bio silk keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Even my hair dresser makes remarks how soft my hair is.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and silky not a lot of shine though.</li>
            <li> It immediately makes my hair soft and shiny and reduces tangles.</li>
            <li> I have an old bottle I purchased from my hair dresser</li>
            <li> /&gt;super soft hair&lt;</li>
            <li> So far this product is working.</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it&#x27;s very oily</li>
            <li> This helps smooth my hair without leavin it heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel really soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I have used this product for quiet a few years now.</li>
            <li> It is thick; it has a good scent, and seems it will last for long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair that I color, blow dry, flat iron, and use hot curlers on a lot.  </li>
            <li> (Remember: during the weeks or months after you open a new bottle, the water in the product is evaporating, and the product is thickening.</li>
            <li> just a couple of dollars more the bottle was at least three size bigger  than the ones I purchased at beauty saloons</li>
            <li> I bought this without reading the reviews because I currently own a small bottle of the original biosilk that I got from the chi factory itself and after I purchased it I saw the reviews saying it was fake</li>
            <li> I have very thick, corse curly hair - this product smooths my hair - makes it softer and more managable -</li>
            <li> A little expensive but worth it for a nice relaxing afternoon.</li>
            <li> It always leaves my hair soft with just enough shine.</li>
            <li> It take me a long while to use up a bottle, and the end of the bottle is always thicker than when I open a new bottle.)  </li>
            <li> It really helps keep down my frizz</li>
            <li> Light fragrance (not strong like some hair products that give other people headaches when they&#x27;re around</li>
            <li> So, if anybody wants to lose less hair and save your hair, anybody can use it to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favourite hair product, I have dry curly hair and this product relax&#x27;s my hair and does feel soft, use it after each and every shower for over 5 years</li>
            <li> You need only use a small amount on freshly shampooed hair, and work it into the ends before blow-drying.</li>
            <li> but I have long hair and it was getting expensive; I stop using for a while and regret it because I went through so many products trying to compare but had to go back because this is the only product that makes my hair feel, soft, silky and shiny!</li>
            <li> Hers was thick and didnot have a distinct smell.</li>
            <li> I really recommend Biosilk Therapy for those that have brittle, thinning fly-away type of hair, limp, split ends, frizzy, dry, fading of color, a weak hair shaft, easily breaks when combing, over-relaxed (including African American type), colored and permed hairs.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair down and manageable, but these new ingredients are not favorable.</li>
            <li> A large bottle will last about a year you use very little after each washing.</li>
            <li> So maybe it&#x27;s a little older</li>
            <li> flyaway, slightly wavy, easily tangled, breakage prone, split ends, slow to grow, and i dont dye or heat style my hair.</li>
            <li> Dont use too much though as a little goes  a long way.</li>
            <li> I Use this as a hair protectant before I flat iron and there is definitely a difference in the look and smoothness of my hair.</li>
            <li> This products works wonders for me only when flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft and silky, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I either blow dry &amp; flat or let my hair dry naturally and</li>
            <li> I feel like it keeps mohair from being damaged by the flat iron.</li>
            <li> but you only need a dime size and it will go a long way.</li>
            <li> but i havent been using it long enough..</li>
            <li> A bottle of this will last you a long time</li>
            <li> /&gt;the container should really allow it to dispense some other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weighs hair down (pro for me, but con maybe for some curly haired girls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have poured out too much and then didn&#x27;t want to waste it, big mistake as I had weighed down and flat hair later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It last a very long time too.</li>
            <li> The product does pour out somewhat quickly, so I recommend actually putting some back or just wiping some off, because you will have a bad hair day if you use too much.  </li>
            <li> Usually only use it when I have to blow dry my hair or straighten.</li>
            <li> i initially tried this on dry hair years ago and thought it was</li>
            <li> It leaves my fine, flat hair feeling bouncy and shiny without that greasy residue that other products so often leave behind.</li>
            <li> I try other products occasionally but always go back to Biosilk!</li>
            <li> I have thick straight long hair, but for the thin type of hair I would suggest to try just a  small drop to begin( smaller than a dime) and advance as you know more</li>
            <li> I always add a little into my hair and top it off with a little dash for the hands and rub on my arms, neck and the remaining on my face!!!!</li>
            <li> My long silver hair loves it.</li>
            <li> I have used Biosilk a long time.  </li>
            <li> A bottle this size lasts a really long time.  </li>
            <li> have been using this product for a long time....</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> I have a granddaughter who like me has long hair and lots of tangles.</li>
            <li> I have medium Length Thick Straight Hair.</li>
            <li> It used to be very syrup-like texture and thick.</li>
            <li> I usually find products that are raved about don&#x27;t always live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> This helps to protect my hair from heat damage as it takes so long to blow dry and seals ends when straightening.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair,</li>
            <li> It also lasts a very long time</li>
            <li> My dry color treated hair loves this.  </li>
            <li> I have unruley curly dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Its doesn&#x27;t dry my hair or makes me have split ends.</li>
            <li> I just put a quarter size portion in my palm and rub my hands together and distribute throughout my dry hair.</li>
            <li> and before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past 5 years and it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly oily consistency, so if you have any excess left on your hands, you can use it as a body moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It has a scent of alcohol and is slightly runnier than the ones that I currently have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman mixed with a lil hispanic and have curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> yes it has a slight odor, but I actually like it.</li>
            <li> Put a small amount (I use a little less than a \\&quot;dime\\&quot; worth, my hair is just past my shoulders) in your hands, rub together and then apply starting at the bottom of your hair and work up, basically rubbing your hands together with your hair in between.  </li>
            <li> I only need to use a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Before bed, I will put it on the rough spots (bottoms of feet, elbows, knees) for overnight softening.</li>
            <li> (I have used it when my hair was wet as well.)</li>
            <li> It only feel oily but not smooth.</li>
            <li> then i read reviews and tried it on wet hair</li>
            <li> I use it when wet hair after a shower</li>
            <li> so this is one of the few products I use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft and shiny without feeling heavy and limp.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, naturally curly hair and one drop before diffusing makes all the difference in the world.</li>
            <li> It was nowhere near as thick as it should be.</li>
            <li> use a dime size or less even on long hair, trust me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve tried this dry and disliked it, try it wet.</li>
            <li> It does not interfere with other styling products.</li>
            <li> Lower price then her other supplier.</li>
            <li> i also have extremely oily roots.</li>
            <li> other people smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount</li>
            <li> your hair looks extremely oily nd unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I started using this a few years ago when my hair was dry and brittle from color products, and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I am a black female with relaxed hair (past shoulder length)</li>
            <li> Because there&#x27;s a lot of talk about real versus fake, I&#x27;ll describe what I received.  </li>
            <li> The bottle from Amazon is half as thick and a totally different texture.</li>
            <li> Does not weight hair down</li>
            <li> flyaway hair down (a pro for me)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps the hair moisturized but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I have had it weigh down my hair</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my waves at all.  </li>
            <li> just a small amount goes a very long way and makes my hair look like silk.</li>
            <li> Moreover, it stinks like pure alcohol, and damaged my hair!</li>
            <li> I might also add that the price point on Amazon comes in quite less than a garden-variety beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Way less breakage&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> These is slight watery.</li>
            <li> hair way less frizzy</li>
            <li> /&gt;i will seperately previous bottle(60ml).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Now that my bottle is almost empty, I started using a small trial size that I had purchased from a salon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> A little bit each day, but not on your roots or your hair will get too oily.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;only need a little bit at a time...</li>
            <li> A little watery and didn&#x27;t help with the frizz.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few products that will tame frizzy hair with out weighing it down or making it greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after a few tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> /&gt;it hasnt dried out my hair yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to wheat and soy (tocopherol acetate) and tree nuts (coconut and argan oil) and it has been a struggle to find a hair product I can use to tame my hair.  </li>
            <li> She has long, thin hair that tangles.</li>
            <li> It is quite expensive, almost same price as in store.</li>
            <li> I have used Biosilk in the past not just for the hair but, also for&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> A  small 2Oz size goes for $ 13.99 at some Stores.</li>
            <li> Her hair used to get to a length and never seemed to grow past that length.</li>
            <li> Use a small drop and rub it between your palms and then run it through your hair.  </li>
            <li> With all the fake products on Amazon lately, I will only be buying my products from a salon from now on.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s tough to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> but it was too late to cancel the shipment.</li>
            <li> its almost to my bum and thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> As noted by other buyers this product is FAKE.</li>
            <li> She hated the product and wouldn&#x27;t use it after the first try.</li>
            <li> I use it after every shampoo -- just a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I bought this 10 months ago and for the last year I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my hair has looked so coarse and terrible.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product a year or so ago, it had hundreds of reviews, with 1 star reviews talking about this product is fake and dried people&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> and it is a very thick gel.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this doesn&#x27;t leave it oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and am borderline addicted.</li>
            <li> This is my secret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Chi silk infusion, but tired of how expensive it was.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because of all the reviews claiming it was a fake.</li>
            <li> So this is weird.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m thinking the version I got a year or so ago from here was fake.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I used this fake stuff for almost a year.</li>
            <li> Without fail, my boyfriend notices the weeks I use Biosilk.</li>
            <li> It does have a faint chemically smell, but nothing I can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> This is fake.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> to expensive though.</li>
            <li> Fake</li>
            <li> I realized something was wrong.</li>
            <li> gives a lot of body to thin hair!</li>
            <li> Then I poured it in my hand and it was very thin.</li>
            <li> Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> make my hair crazy when I use it.....</li>
            <li> I have crazy curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and I got mad</li>
            <li> really* bad.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel as bad about \\&quot;wasting\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li> If you want some BioSilk, you&#x27;re crazy not to get this deal!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The product is totally fake!!!</li>
            <li> And at worst it might have made it greasy.  </li>
            <li> The worst purchase on Amazon ever!</li>
            <li> Terrible smell.  </li>
            <li> It Has The Worst Humidity..</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and great deal.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this all the time, this does not seem like the original product, it makes my hair feel extremely dry!</li>
            <li> Best product for the hair</li>
            <li> I have to say this has been a godsend for my hair. I have 4a/4b hair texture and this amazing serum smooths out ALL my kinks and tangles. I&#x27;ve tried so many serums whether it be drugstore or high-end (mostly high-end) and this one is the BEST. Paul Mitchell Skinny Serum used to be my holy grail but this smashed that.  I use this to seal in my leave-in conditioner and I&#x27;ve seen a tremendous difference in the texture and health of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Smells great&lt;br /&gt;*Makes hair super EASY to detangle&lt;br /&gt;*Instantly softens hair&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s a lasting product on the hair&lt;br /&gt;*A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;*It keeps my hair very moisturized&lt;br /&gt;* It does not interfere with other styling products. (I&#x27;ve used this with gels, creams, mousse ect.)&lt;br /&gt;* Controls fizz amazingly ( I did a wash n go and it was so defined and I had NO frizz. I couldn&#x27;t believe it b/c I always have frizz.)&lt;br /&gt;* It makes my hair more manageable</li>
            <li> I have been using Biosilk for over 10 years and LOVE how it protects, smooths (without weighing down) and shines. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this product for my very long hair. It keeps the ends healthy and shiny and it smells great. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I used to get it from the salon. It&#x27;s great to save $10.00 on such a great product. It always leaves my hair soft with just enough shine.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! So worth the price. My hair feels silky soft and I don&#x27;t need to use a lot, about a dime size will do it. I prefer to use it when my hair is damp, right before I blow it dry.</li>
            <li> LOVE! I use this everyday</li>
            <li> Very good product I recommend it for whoever has a really tangled hair</li>
            <li> Great product. Really tames the freezy hair.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because of all the reviews claiming it was a fake. I have been using this product for over a decade and it&#x27;s not fake! It&#x27;s real people! I think it is so discounted because BioSilk came out with a new bottle design. So maybe it&#x27;s a little older but I can&#x27;t tell at all. This product is amazing. It is hands down my favorite hair product. I put it in my hair when it&#x27;s damp and then again to smooth flyaways after flat ironing or curling. I did go to Ulta to buy this and it was $43 for this size. If you want some BioSilk, you&#x27;re crazy not to get this deal! Thanks, BioSilk and Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this makes my hair really soft it&#x27;s great can&#x27;t live without it now... &#x27;-)</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> So this is weird.  When I bought this product a year or so ago, it had hundreds of reviews, with 1 star reviews talking about this product is fake and dried people&#x27;s hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it had an overwhelming number of positive reviews and the fact that it was relatively cheap, I went ahead and took the risk and bought it.  When I received it, it looked real enough, and there was a seal.  I tried it on my hair, and I don&#x27;t remember what it did on my hair.  I think at best, it didn&#x27;t do anything.  And at worst it might have made it greasy.  I really don&#x27;t remember.  I stopped using it after a few tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well just this last weekend, I visited family.  When I asked my cousins if I could use any of their hair product, they handed me this.  I asked them, &amp;#34;are you sure?? does this thing work??&amp;#34; and they replied, &amp;#34;yeah absolutely.&amp;#34;  So I gave it a try.  The consistency of their product was very different - the liquid was much thicker.  You don&#x27;t need very much at all, maybe a nickel sized portion and I put it on the ends of my hair.  It worked pretty well - it made my hair feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyways - bottom line - I&#x27;m thinking the version I got a year or so ago from here was fake.  I would caution people against buying Biosilk from Amazon. (And this is definitely the correct product; I went into my order history to find the product to write this review).</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, and it was delivered later on the same day! Packaging was very good, no leaks, nice size box, over-all I give it 6 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this product and I love it. Makes my hair feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li> My hair would not survive without this fabulous concoction. Thank you for the FAST delivery!</li>
            <li> Bought many times and always happy with the service and the product!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and shiny but not greasy looking.  Have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product years ago but I have long hair and it was getting expensive; I stop using for a while and regret it because I went through so many products trying to compare but had to go back because this is the only product that makes my hair feel, soft, silky and shiny! Never will I stop using again.</li>
            <li> I would give 0 stars if I could! The product is totally fake!!! It&#x27;s not the original BioSilk, and I know it because I used to use the original one. Moreover, it stinks like pure alcohol, and damaged my hair! I expect a full refund! The worst purchase on Amazon ever! BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have curly long hair that is sometimes, most times, unmanageable and after I blowdry my hair it is like silk and it shines. Shake it up good and A LITTLE goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered Quickly and works great in my hair!</li>
            <li> Have been using this biosilk for 2 years now. Did recommended this product to most of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is generally rough and frizzy but this one keeps them very smooth and soft. I just love this one!</li>
            <li> My dry color treated hair loves this.  You need only use a small amount on freshly shampooed hair, and work it into the ends before blow-drying. It has a slightly oily consistency, so if you have any excess left on your hands, you can use it as a body moisturizer.  I might also add that the price point on Amazon comes in quite less than a garden-variety beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> My daughter had frizzy tangly hair. She hated the product and wouldn&#x27;t use it after the first try.</li>
            <li> This is the real Biosilk, not a knockoff like some have stated.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Biosilk years ago by my hair stylist. I try other products occasionally but always go back to Biosilk! Makes my hair feel so soft and shiny without feeling heavy and limp. Great for permed and/or colored hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good combination ... great merchant and great product!  These folks take care of their customers</li>
            <li> I believe this is the real thing.  And I love this product!  Because there&#x27;s a lot of talk about real versus fake, I&#x27;ll describe what I received.  The entire item was shrink wrapped.  White inventory sticker on back was spotless.  Under the cap, the top of the bottle was sealed.  The curve design on the bottle (and on the product page) is the new design shown on Farouk&#x27;s website.  The texture and smell of the serum are identical to what I get at the salon.  (Remember: during the weeks or months after you open a new bottle, the water in the product is evaporating, and the product is thickening. It take me a long while to use up a bottle, and the end of the bottle is always thicker than when I open a new bottle.)  Product feels exactly the same on my hair, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Biosilk Silk Therapy Therapeutic Treatment for years and in different ways. After a shower, I will combine it with lotion for a silkening effect on my skin. Before bed, I will put it on the rough spots (bottoms of feet, elbows, knees) for overnight softening. I also put a dime size amount in my hand, rub my hands together and run it lightly over my hair to get rid of the frizzies. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Smells good and helps protect and fix damaged hair!!</li>
            <li> Price is much better on here and the quality is excellent. Very happy I looked here first.</li>
            <li> Great item! Just as promised. Would reorder from this business again!</li>
            <li> Love using this product. I don&#x27;t use it for my hair though, it&#x27;s a great message oil! A little expensive but worth it for a nice relaxing afternoon.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised and the packaging was good.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth in my hair, on my skin, my face, it doesn&#x27;t matter where I apply it I always get that smooth finish! I always add a little into my hair and top it off with a little dash for the hands and rub on my arms, neck and the remaining on my face!!!!</li>
            <li> Best product for your hair and skin. A little goes a long way. My long silver hair loves it. Makes it sparkle.</li>
            <li> the best  have used it for year and wouldn&#x27;t be without it..</li>
            <li> Biosilk is an awesome product, not only for my skin but for my hair as well. It makes my skin feel silky soft and gives my hair super shine. I have used it for several years and it is always my first go-to product as I get ready for my day.</li>
            <li> I have used Biosilk a long time.  I have unruley curly dry hair.  It works wonders .  Makes it smooth and shiney.  I also use it on my legs after a shave....makes them so soft!  I have people ask me all the time what I use that smells so good.</li>
            <li> This product is a requirement in my family&#x27;s grooming ritual and keep it on stock. Excellent product and priced reasonably at Atlas Supply, better than Costco.</li>
            <li> I cannot go a day without Biosilk in my hair! When I found this deal on Amazon, I was worried it was too good to be true. I was pleasantly surprised when the bottle arrived, as pictured and described, and it was the same product I&#x27;ve been using for years but paying more than twice the price for. I will definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> I always love this product!!! plus it was Cheap compared to my local store prices.</li>
            <li> love  this product for my hair</li>
            <li> Love this brand. I can&#x27;t use many of their other hair care products because of skin sensitivities but can still use this. Usually only use it when I have to blow dry my hair or straighten. Smells wonderful. I have very long hair, its almost to my bum and thick and wavy. This helps to protect my hair from heat damage as it takes so long to blow dry and seals ends when straightening.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, corse curly hair - this product smooths my hair - makes it softer and more managable - I love this product and will use it until I die</li>
            <li> I bought this 10 months ago and for the last year I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my hair has looked so coarse and terrible. I attributed it to pregnancy and hormonal related changes. Now that my bottle is almost empty, I started using a small trial size that I had purchased from a salon. It is a different product! The bottle from Amazon is half as thick and a totally different texture. My hair looks good again now that I&#x27;m using the real stuff. I can&#x27;t believe I used this fake stuff for almost a year. Silk therapy is awesome, but only if it is the genuine product. I would recommend only buying from a salon. With all the fake products on Amazon lately, I will only be buying my products from a salon from now on.</li>
            <li> I alternate between this and Organix&#x27;s Moroccan Argan Oil every week. Without fail, my boyfriend notices the weeks I use Biosilk. It leaves my fine, flat hair feeling bouncy and shiny without that greasy residue that other products so often leave behind. It does have a faint chemically smell, but nothing I can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> I bought this without reading the reviews because I currently own a small bottle of the original biosilk that I got from the chi factory itself and after I purchased it I saw the reviews saying it was fake and I got mad but it was too late to cancel the shipment. Once it got here i compared these both in the way they feel and smell and I even read the ingredients in the back And EVERYTHING Is exactly the same. I do admit the bigger one does smell a bit more like alcohol but once its on your hair or rubbed on your skin you can&#x27;t even smell it. I say Its the same thing.</li>
            <li> Love this so much. My hair is soooo much smoother and healthier looking now that I use this.</li>
            <li> I am a black female with relaxed hair (past shoulder length) that breaks easily. I stopped using this product and my hair began to break so much! I went back to using it and now my hair is staying on my head. It&#x27;s that easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Keeps hair strong&lt;br /&gt;2. Way less breakage&lt;br /&gt;3. Not greasy&lt;br /&gt;4. Does not weight hair down&lt;br /&gt;5. Keeps hair soft and flowy&lt;br /&gt;6. Light fragrance (not strong like some hair products that give other people headaches when they&#x27;re around you)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Very pricey for the amount BUT worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never stop using this product ever again! I learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit of this makes my hair so smooth and silky.  A bottle this size lasts a really long time.  And it is also great on skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Biosilk for many years. It makes the white hairs in my brown majority glow.  I was delighted with Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I was hesitant about this purchase, but the newer reviews were good so I took the chance. Good product, real deal. I&#x27;ve always purchased in stores locally but will order again.</li>
            <li> A huge bottle for a sml price! This stuff works great üëç love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my  hair.  It does not add weight but does keep my hair healthy</li>
            <li> Works wonderful, only have to use a dime size amount and my hair is waist lenghth. Will always order.</li>
            <li> best hair treatment ever have used it for years!</li>
            <li> Have have used Silk Therapy for years.  Every time I go to the hairdresser, they always comment on how healthy my hair is.  I don&#x27;t do anything special except, Silk Therapy...its a great product, helps with tangles as well.</li>
            <li> This is a very helpful product to use in order to avoid losing hair.  I have use it for a number of years and it really helps.  So, if anybody wants to lose less hair and save your hair, anybody can use it to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product and that is the reason why I am giving it the max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura</li>
            <li> I use this Daily on Damp Hair and rub it in. Leaves my Hair Soft and Silky. I have medium Length Thick Straight Hair. I love How Biosilk Keeps My Hair Strong and Healthy.</li>
            <li> This product is great for giving your hair some shine without weighing it down or making it oily.  I use it after every shampoo -- just a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product over ten years. I have been coloring, blow drying and using a hot curling iron on my hair for years. The bio silk keeps my hair soft. Even my hair dresser makes remarks how soft my hair is. Buying it on line saves you money than the stores. A large bottle will last about a year you use very little after each washing. Love this product.</li>
            <li> i love the way it smells on ur hair and ur skin... nice and smooth...</li>
            <li> Best price for this that I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my dry naturally curly hair. I mix it with a soft hold mousse and it helps keep my hair from being frizzy and fly away. I either blow dry &amp; flat or let my hair dry naturally and the Biosilk works in both styles keeping my hair soft! I feel like it keeps mohair from being damaged by the flat iron.</li>
            <li> One of my friends recommended this product to me and I&#x27;ve been in love with it ever since. My hair gets tangled easily, so I use it every time I wash my hair. It only takes a nickel sized amount in my palm to cover all of my hair which reaches the middle of my back. With heat styling, or just leaving my hair natural, I notice a huge difference with and without the product.</li>
            <li> Great product and smells great too. Smoothes your hair. Dont use too much though as a little goes  a long way.</li>
            <li> Product is good and the customer service was good as welll!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using it for the past 5 years and it makes my hair soft. Its doesn&#x27;t dry my hair or makes me have split ends. This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does wonders for the hair.  Been using it for a while and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my hair so soft and silky not a lot of shine though. Still have to use oil for shine. But I truly love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product, makes my hair so soft and shiny, even if your hair is dry and full of hairspray !! I was so surprise about the size of the bottle, for just a little more money, just a couple of dollars more the bottle was at least three size bigger  than the ones I purchased at beauty saloons</li>
            <li> I love what it does for my hair. Great after shampoo product for dry and color treated hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair down and manageable, but these new ingredients are not favorable. It used to be very syrup-like texture and thick. These is slight watery. The magic is gone.</li>
            <li> Biosilk is a good product if you have long hair that is somewhat fine or thin. I have blond hair so it&#x27;s tough to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. This one works well and I mix it with my favorite fragrance (black poppy) and it becomes a hair conditioner with scent.</li>
            <li> so good for my daughters,they need it every early morning.</li>
            <li> This saved my hair. I started using this a few years ago when my hair was dry and brittle from color products, and have been using it ever since. It immediately makes my hair soft and shiny and reduces tangles. Over time it has helped my hair look healthy even though I continue to color it. It is a serum that is clear and smells wonderful. I just put a quarter size portion in my palm and rub my hands together and distribute throughout my dry hair. (I have used it when my hair was wet as well.) Then I comb through it. It doesn&#x27;t make it oily, just healthy looking. If there is still some serum on my hands, I&#x27;ll rub it on my elbows and knees to give them some extra moisture. I love this stuff. It last a very long time too.</li>
            <li> Terrible smell.  Too much alcohol -- dries your hair.</li>
            <li> have been using this product for a long time....</li>
            <li> I luv this item use it in all my girls</li>
            <li> Have used Biosilk Treatment for many years. This IS the original Biosilk product. Great price. Definitely will order again.</li>
            <li> I just love this product, and I&#x27;ll never be without it!  It makes my hair silky, shiny, and smooth. I ha be recommended it to my friends and I will be buying it again also!!</li>
            <li> i have been using Biosilk for about 10 years now i have nothing bad to say about it , ordering was easy , packaging great. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product. Lower price then her other supplier.</li>
            <li> I have waist-length hair and have tried many products to get the sleek without being limp look. This is the only product that gives me that healthy shine but still retains the volume. And the added bonus is the amazing fragrance. My search is over! Pricy, but the bottle lasts me about a year.</li>
            <li> Works great for my loose curl hair.  It is the only product that I have found that will hold my curl without having it look like &amp;#34;mall hair&amp;#34; from the 90s.</li>
            <li> This is the great product you&#x27;re expecting to buy.  I&#x27;ve used this product before and this truly IS it!  You&#x27;ll love it and it lasts a really long time making the purchase price even better!  Shipping was prompt and the seller was great with their communication.  Biosilk is an AWESOME product and works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s very light and gives your hair an amazing shine.  I have been using this product for years.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but you only need a dime size and it will go a long way.</li>
            <li> This is fake. I want to throw it away.The scent is very mild to non-existing. It is quite expensive, almost same price as in store. It only feel oily but not smooth. Really disappointing. I should listen to the review on Amazon and not order it.</li>
            <li> Best price around for a great product!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my hair looking very nice when I straighten it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Good for dried out hair, chemically processed hair, puts the softness and shine your hair needs. Can also be used on skin therapeutic smell to it.</li>
            <li> make my hair crazy when I use it.....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I still love it. Your hair are silky...</li>
            <li> My favourite hair product, I have dry curly hair and this product relax&#x27;s my hair and does feel soft, use it after each and every shower for over 5 years</li>
            <li> I have been using this for YEARS -- love it.</li>
            <li> I love it, I only have to use a small drop and it leaves my hair super silky. I am definitely going to re-purchase this when it runs out!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!  It makes my hair very soft and silky, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  A must have!!!</li>
            <li> This has a great smell, adds a lot of shine to your hair, and absorbs quickly but didn&#x27;t really do anything for my split ends. I ended up using it more as a shine serum, for a good split end/dry hair treatment I would suggest the nexus pro-mend which is probably around the same price as this and work amazingly</li>
            <li> Great product for my hair - leaves it soft and smelling really good.</li>
            <li> I have used Biosilk in the past not just for the hair but, also for&lt;br /&gt;my skin it works great.  This was the best price I could find for this&lt;br /&gt;product.  It was shipped quick and wrapped well.</li>
            <li> This Has To Be The Best Product For Frizzy Hair!! I Straighten My Hair In The Morning..Put A Dab Of Biosilk &amp; By The End Of The Nite..My Hair Is Still Straight..&amp; i Live In Texas &amp; It Has The Worst Humidity..But My Hair Has Beat The Odds With This Product. Totally Recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It has kept my hair in great shape in spite of the daily abuse from the hairdryer and curling iron. It takes a very small amount daily to keep my hair in great shape.</li>
            <li> This product is great for hair, skin and especially hands.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product for my hair and my skin and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the way her hair feels after the application of the treatment.</li>
            <li> I tried to upload the image of the item that I received, but it does not uploaded..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but, in summary..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.The trademark is not same as the original one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.It says 12oz (355mml), But the original one is 12oz (350mml).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.It does not have the hologram at the back side of bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already contacted with customer service, and luckily got the full refund of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Thank you for amazon customer service. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I am truly in love with this treatment I use it on my hair and my skin and I just love it!!</li>
            <li> I hate the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this product and how it smells... A little goes a long way but sometimes you may need to reapply depending on the weather.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I wanted at a great price! I have been using this product for a few years and it really makes my hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> So nice and cheap price! I&#x27;m going to buy more</li>
            <li> I hear about this from a customer I was assisting one day. I decided to give it a try since I have frizzy hair. This product is a God send! A very tiny bit goes a loonnnggg way so this bottle will last me all year, easily. It is a greasy, oil so you can only use a tiny bit at a time or your hair will appear to be unwashed and greasy. I use a dime sized drop and add more if needed after trying that first. It adds shine to my hair, gets rid of the frizz, and adds a great scent! I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> This is great, I swim in a pool all the time and my hair gets dry, a little of this in the palm of your hand, rub in all over and through your hair.  The life comes back to your hair, not greasy or sticky at all.  Also great on dry skin!</li>
            <li> I Love this wonderful oil. I use just 2 or 3 drops on my damp shoulder length hair instead of Mousse. It gives it a shine and moisture. It is so gentile,  you can even use a drop on your face. A Hair Dresser introduced me to this product and i&amp;#34;ve been using it ever since. Do your hair a favor and buy it. This big bottle is a steal at this price. A  small 2Oz size goes for $ 13.99 at some Stores. I highly recommend this non greasy, light weight oil.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I order it every year. And I plan on ordering some more at the first of Feburary</li>
            <li> it smells mild and very good (like sour apple) and makes my hairs looks and feels nicely. I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> This can&#x27;t be true &amp;#34;Biosilk&amp;#34;.  I have an old bottle I purchased from my hair dresser and it is a very thick gel.  This stuff is like rubbing alcohol.  I should have looked at the seller before purchasing this.  Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was.</li>
            <li> just good when use it&lt;br /&gt;but i don&#x27;t see the difference between using hair conditioner or treatment stuff.&lt;br /&gt;so.. i don&#x27;t use it anymore&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much you have a good weekeand</li>
            <li> I have been using biosilk for years now and I don&#x27;t thUnk I could live without it! It makes my hair super smooth and shiny. It is a great Anti-frizz. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love the Biosilk Silk Therapy.  I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.  A little bit each day, but not on your roots or your hair will get too oily.  For me, it helps to control the frizz some in the humidity I live in.</li>
            <li> this is good stuff. I bought several bottles already.  My wife loves it and it smells great.  highly reccomended product</li>
            <li> This is not like the original 2 bottles I bought at a salon.  It has a scent of alcohol and is slightly runnier than the ones that I currently have. It also seems to dry my hair out instead of making it soft and healthy looking. Very disappointing. Sorry</li>
            <li> After purchasing sample bottles for my grandgirls, I was asked by them to purchased a larger bottle they could share.  They love this product as do I.</li>
            <li> great price and delivery was very fast</li>
            <li> I have bought Biosilk Therapy in the past 8 years many times; this time, it seems to me after the second use it is the real deal, not a fake version of the original. It is thick; it has a good scent, and seems it will last for long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For long hairs like mine, I suggest you to use it on the top to reduce \\&quot; frizzy  fly-away\\&quot;,  and use on the ends 2 or 3 times a drop the size of a dime. I do it because I have a lot of hair and it looks ok, not greasy. I have thick straight long hair, but for the thin type of hair I would suggest to try just a  small drop to begin( smaller than a dime) and advance as you know more how much is going to be good enough for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run out of this product for 3 weeks a month ago, and you could tell the difference just looking at my hair, and also touching it. I really recommend Biosilk Therapy for those that have brittle, thinning fly-away type of hair, limp, split ends, frizzy, dry, fading of color, a weak hair shaft, easily breaks when combing, over-relaxed (including African American type), colored and permed hairs. For oily type of hair I cannot tell you if this product would work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, my hair cannot live without my Biosilk Therapy. It is just amazingly good!!</li>
            <li> I love this product just a small amount goes a very long way and makes my hair look like silk.</li>
            <li> best hair care product I ever bought. to expensive though. good thing it last a long time</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I have used this product for quiet a few years now. I love it.</li>
            <li> I Use this as a hair protectant before I flat iron and there is definitely a difference in the look and smoothness of my hair. I&#x27;m a black woman mixed with a lil hispanic and have curly, frizzy hair. This products works wonders for me only when flat ironing.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just love this product to tame frizz by treating hair cuticle and impart shine.  Best price is this larger size.</li>
            <li> my hair is very fine, flyaway, slightly wavy, easily tangled, breakage prone, split ends, slow to grow, and i dont dye or heat style my hair. i also have extremely oily roots. now onto the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;makes hair shiny&lt;br /&gt;makes hair way less frizzy&lt;br /&gt;makes my hair straighter and healthier looking&lt;br /&gt;super soft hair&lt;br /&gt;weighs flyaway hair down (a pro for me)&lt;br /&gt;does not make my hair greasy (the way i use it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;smells exactly like rave hair spray. i do not know what this peachy nice smell is that other people smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the container should really allow it to dispense some other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weighs hair down (pro for me, but con maybe for some curly haired girls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very very easy to overdo it. use a dime size or less even on long hair, trust me. dont apply to roots especially if you have oily hair but thats obvious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it breaks me out on my neck, back and sides of jaw but not sure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it hasnt dried out my hair yet but i havent been using it long enough..i initially tried this on dry hair years ago and thought it was *really* bad. then i read reviews and tried it on wet hair and i am so glad i did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;ve tried this dry and disliked it, try it wet. i only give it four stars because its not foolproof, you have to tweak your method until it works for you.</li>
            <li> Truly awesome stuff. I have thin hair and this doesn&#x27;t leave it oily. Just softer. I&#x27;ve used this for years and am borderline addicted.</li>
            <li> I have being use this product for 5 years, it&#x27;s excelent</li>
            <li> Great price for a great size! Also arrived on time</li>
            <li> Love this for second day curly hair and for my kids after their shower.</li>
            <li> item as described and prompt shipment.</li>
            <li> Been using this for several years now...love the way it conditions my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is perm and also color this products is excellent to restore back the natural oil from chemical strip. Strongly recommend. By the way I&#x27;m a hairdresser. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so smooth and so tender.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this oil for several months now. She has long, thin hair that tangles. We started using it after her showers, while her hair is still damp, to help brush through the tangles. After a couple months of consistent use we noticed her hair is not breaking and is growing longer. Her hair used to get to a length and never seemed to grow past that length. Now her hair is growing longer and thicker. Great product, I put a nickel sized amount in my hand, rub them together, then run it through her hair. I do not put it on her roots, that make her hair look oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was package great! No leaks!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my hair so silky without being crunchy. I have extremely thick, naturally curly hair and one drop before diffusing makes all the difference in the world.</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid climate and need something to protect my hair from the heat and sun. So far this product is working. I will continue to watch it and update again. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Fake so beware. I used my neighbors Biosilk a few times and noticed how nice my hair felt afterwards. Hers was thick and didnot have a distinct smell. Well as soon as I opened mine I realized something was wrong. The liquid in my bottle moved very freely and wasn&#x27;t thick. First observation. Next I opened it, it had a deal and arrived with tape over the cap. But when I opened it I immmediately notice the smell of alcohol. Then I poured it in my hand and it was very thin. I should&#x27;ve read the reviews first. As noted by other buyers this product is FAKE. A water downed/ alcohol version at best.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Best serum I have ever used! I have fine curly hair and this really helps control my curls without weighing my hair down. It smells great! It only takes a small amount</li>
            <li> Great product for my hair....gives a lot of body to thin hair!</li>
            <li> I love BioSilk. It is one of the few products that will tame frizzy hair with out weighing it down or making it greasy.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. I don&#x27;t understand reviewers who like the smell and texture. I had a rash from it.</li>
            <li> Great to straighten out kinks in hair...&lt;br /&gt;will straighten the texture of the hair over time...&lt;br /&gt;great shine also...&lt;br /&gt;only need a little bit at a time...&lt;br /&gt;lasts a long time...&lt;br /&gt;seems to work better than the Chi Brand...</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my stylist. I have used it for many years. the product is good for age spots and dry skin. It feels like silk. I have a granddaughter who like me has long hair and lots of tangles. This product takes away all the tangles. It&#x27;s also very helpful in the winter with static. I tell all my friends and family about it. This Christmas it will be for presents to get them started on it also.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and really protects my hair!!  I&#x27;d recomend this to anyone who&#x27;s interested in a great conditioner for their hair</li>
            <li> Got this item to use on my pool cues after cleaning them. It does a great job polishing my cues, it is cheaper than the cue polishing products you can get from pool suppliers.</li>
            <li> I use to work at a hair salon and the hair stylist there recommend me this product. I&#x27;ve been loyal to it ever since. It helps protect ends but I do use it for all over my hair. I use it when wet hair after a shower and before I blow dry. I have really blonde hair. My hair couldn&#x27;t look any healthier. I use a leave in conditioner too. I won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Good size, but great price!</li>
            <li> We have used biosilk products for years. They suit our hair  well.</li>
            <li> This stuff was recommended by a hair dresser friend and it works great. Keeps the hair moisturized but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I only need to use a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> A little watery and didn&#x27;t help with the frizz. I&#x27;ve used it plenty of times before I ordered on amazon.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy shipment, exact same as if I bought it in a store, but with a much better price. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Very good for the skin. I use it after I shave my legs. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it&#x27;s very oily so it doesn&#x27;t soak in as quickly as I&#x27;d like but thats probably why its so good</li>
            <li> this product is very big size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Korean product is most 150ml. this is more than duoble&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will seperately previous bottle(60ml).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for quickly delivery!!!</li>
            <li> Got here on time. Packaged nicely. Seemed to be sealed but the consistency of the product made it seem like it was cut with water. It was nowhere near as thick as it should be.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair that I color, blow dry, flat iron, and use hot curlers on a lot.  This is the only product I put on my hair  besides conditioner. It gives my hair a great shine and keeps my ends from splitting.  It also lasts a very long time so it&#x27;s a great value.  My sister is a hair dresser and she&#x27;s always amazed at how great of condition my hair is.  This is my secret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to wheat and soy (tocopherol acetate) and tree nuts (coconut and argan oil) and it has been a struggle to find a hair product I can use to tame my hair.  After losing all of it to chemotherapy it came back in course and so I really needed something to help smooth it out.  I have found it in this product.  I love it best when I remember to put it in when my hair is wet before blow drying.  My hair is so shiny without added weight and I can go to sleep and brush my hair out the next day and it looks good as new, not something I could do when I used hair spray.  Thank you Biosilk!</li>
            <li> Works great to detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair, and it does not make it greasy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Chi silk infusion, but tired of how expensive it was. I decided to go back to biosilk which I had used for 5-10 years before using Chi. I love it, yes it has a slight odor, but I actually like it. I have naturally curly, thick hair that tends to have a lot of fly aways. This helps smooth my hair without leavin it heavy or greasy. I only use a nickel size amount and apply it to the front (around my face) and ends first, then smooth out over my roots.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, does not weigh hair down, leaves a natural shine. Delivered on time without any problems.</li>
            <li> Offers great frizz control, sheen and softness ... I love the stuff! Works great in cold and very humid climates.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for my naturally curly hair.  It gives it a smooth look and controls friz</li>
            <li> I like this product except after the second day your hair looks extremely oily nd unmanageable. But if u wash ur hair everyday u should be ok</li>
            <li> Excellent price for a typically expensive product.</li>
            <li> best treatment I have ever used and been using it several years.  I have crazy curly hair.  It helps calm the frizz and hold the style.</li>
            <li> I usually find products that are raved about don&#x27;t always live up to the hype.  This product however is pretty amazing.  I have \\&quot;fine hair but lots of it\\&quot; according to professional hair stylists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does help my hair feel \\&quot;silky\\&quot; and seems to curb flyaways.  My hair feels softer and healthier when I style it with this product.  Put a small amount (I use a little less than a \\&quot;dime\\&quot; worth, my hair is just past my shoulders) in your hands, rub together and then apply starting at the bottom of your hair and work up, basically rubbing your hands together with your hair in between.  I stop about 2 inches or so from the roots and I don&#x27;t want to get an oily look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed there is a fine line from just enough to too much with this product.  I try to err on the side of less is more.  I have had it weigh down my hair and then it looks blah.  The product does pour out somewhat quickly, so I recommend actually putting some back or just wiping some off, because you will have a bad hair day if you use too much.  A bottle of this will last you a long time so I don&#x27;t feel as bad about \\&quot;wasting\\&quot; product.  I have poured out too much and then didn&#x27;t want to waste it, big mistake as I had weighed down and flat hair later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product. It really does help your hair look great!  I think it is a good value for the money because you don&#x27;t need that much product to have amazing hair.</li>
            <li> This is an old favorite.  Leaves my hair feeling great and tangles just comb out.  Highly recommend to anyone that wants silky hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product.  I am really low-maintenance with my hair so this is one of the few products I use on a daily basis.  Use a small drop and rub it between your palms and then run it through your hair.  If you use too much it will make your hair appear oily and became a bit sticky.  The smell is amazing, and lingers in your hair all day.  It makes your hair feel really soft.  My hair is naturally wavy and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my waves at all.  It does help control frizz, so during winter it is especially useful!  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> love it and very satisfied customer</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! This is a great value in this bigger bottle. All you need is like a dime to nickel size amount. Smells great, makes your hair soft and smooth. Great for people who straighten their hair or for any every day use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  It really helps keep down my frizz and it makes my hair so shiny and healthy looking.  Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I found it to be the real thing. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Thought this was the smaller size and to my surprise it was huge, for the the same cost as the smaller size found in stores.</li>
