    <ol>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any cons about the Chardonnay Hydrator, although I do agree with another reviewer in saying that it would be awesome to have this in a pump or tube of some sort.</li>
            <li>Happy shopping!</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product!  </li>
            <li>The result is just very good.</li>
            <li>All I know is that it does a great job moisturizing</li>
            <li>nice product!</li>
            <li>Not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is wonderful and it is a wonderful hydrator, especially if you have oily/dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love the scent too!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite lovely!</li>
            <li>Great stuff and suitable for many complexions</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy as everybody else said, and it gives a very smooth, silky texture to your skin.</li>
            <li>Personally, I love the smell    </li>
            <li>Always looking for  the next best thing</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>As for it not having sunscreen, I&#x27;m glad that it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I now use this as more of a &#x27;serum&#x27; with another moisturizer or sunblock applied over.  </li>
            <li>This is a product you can buy at health food or grocery stores but Amazon has much better pricing.  </li>
            <li>More and more I am replacing all of my cosmetics, creams, lotions, shampoos, etc.</li>
            <li>I look forward to trying more of their products.</li>
            <li>I love this cream for daytime.</li>
            <li>Nothing better out there on the market.  </li>
            <li>The texture and feel is wonderfully refreshing.  </li>
            <li>any concealer applied over top did not blend well.  </li>
            <li>This really works for me..have to use the toner first for best result.</li>
            <li>This smells so nice and fresh . . .  </li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate&#x27;s &#x27;Have a Vine Day&#x27; is a fabulous product with a lovely light scent.  </li>
            <li>Smell at first seemed kind of strong</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone wanting a light moisturizer for hydrating their skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely light, almost whipped, and provides good moisture for many different complexions but dries matte.</li>
            <li>with those free of SLS, Parabens, etc.  </li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate has a whole line of products under the umbrella of \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Advanced Care\\&quot; and I plan to continue trying more of their products in this line over time.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, blends and absorbs quickly, and leaves my face refreshed but never greasy.  </li>
            <li>Later found out cranberry is good for your face.</li>
            <li>It blends into my skin on top of the serum really well, leaves my skin feeling &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; (i.e. not greasy), and it does it&#x27;s job of moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the product because it is really hydrating.</li>
            <li>Light and powerful.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and gets absorbed into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very light and fresh when you apply it and it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>It feels good on your skin, absorbs quickly, moisturizes well, and yet leaves absolutely no shine or greasiness to the skin at all.</li>
            <li>My dry, fair, sensitive skin demands moisturizer, and I&#x27;ve tried many over the years.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it after washing my face and applying %100 pure rose water.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be more of a light gel-creme texture than what I was expecting in a regular face cream.  </li>
            <li>It finds the right balance of what your skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Small price to pay for great hydrating lotion.</li>
            <li>like it very much , eatable too</li>
            <li>to my surprise, it is very light and still moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li>it is most effective in leaving the fake smooth feeling of the skin.</li>
            <li>I found Have A Vine Day on Amazon and felt it was worth a try, as it was very well priced.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Nature&#x27;s Gate!</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>it has silica as 1 of the top 3 ingredients, which many people have found not good for skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it and certainly will buy again myself.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand..................</li>
            <li>I alternate between this moisturizer and another light day cream by Emerita.  </li>
            <li>Too much of a perfume smell.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic hydrator and facial shield.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several products before, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I use the C for Yourself serum which normally was all I needed, but this winter I noticed some dry places on my face and needed something more.</li>
            <li>I have found this product hydrates my skin better than any other product I have used.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer has worked really well for me and my normal, 40-yr-old skin.</li>
            <li>It does smell fresh &amp; nice, but does not moisturize well enough for me &amp; left me with dry patches (even when using lots of product).  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know, as my main purpose for getting it was for use as a moisturizer (the soft &amp; dewy effect!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is non greasy and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I was crushed when my local store stopped carrying it, and I was beyond elated to find it on Amazon (also, Amazon&#x27;s price is much more reasonable than what it was sold for in my town).</li>
            <li>I only need a small amount, and my skin has responded remarkably well, soft and moist with no greasiness.  </li>
            <li>I live in Northern California&#x27;s Wine Country, so</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent that is not offensive and fades once dry.</li>
            <li>I have never enjoyed the greasy-heavy feeling on my skin from most moisturizers I have used.</li>
            <li>being in a vineyard in the early morning!</li>
            <li>Price not bad compared to some other brands, organic or otherwise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s often tiresome to see trendy new wine/grape-based body products get so much hype when, in reality, it&#x27;s just a marketing ploy.</li>
            <li>I do love this, but not a big fan of scooping out the lotion with the little spoon.</li>
            <li>Heavy on natural, organic ingredients and light on ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak directly to the effects contributed by the Chardonnay grapes in this hydrator, but I can tell you this about this product:    1)</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it is made with organic and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was looking for natural cream after I break out with adult acne.</li>
            <li>Creates SOFT SILKY skin&lt;</li>
            <li>A cruelty-free, natural product that truly works?  </li>
            <li>I use it for daytime moisture and it makes my skin feel so moist and soft.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve found that some moisturizers can actually cause my skin to dry out even more without regular use or if I use them daily then stop for whatever reason)  4)</li>
            <li>Only downside is the scent is a little strong for me.</li>
            <li>and I felt like it was going to give me a headache, but it quickly dissipates so is not a true con&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find it online, and less expensive!</li>
            <li>It is a little expensive but worth it to me since it is so good and has made a big difference in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I assume the makers chose the jar because the lotion is maybe a bit thick to flow smoothly from a pump or tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is better on Amazon than the other online merchant I have purchased from in the past.</li>

            <li> The price is better on Amazon than the other online merchant I have purchased from in the past.</li>
            <li> I am 43 and have the dreaded combination of partially dry, partially oily, very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered on time (as usual) and came in a very portable container.</li>
            <li> In my quest to go as natural as possible, both with my diet and with my skin care, I have been searching for a face lotion that is &#x27;organic&#x27; and yet shows results on my skin as much as the fancy, expensive, chemical-laden lotions with major advertising campaigns.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to specific products and will break out usually.</li>
            <li> The fresh scent vanishes in a few seconds but at least it&#x27;s there initially.</li>
            <li> I loved it immediately, the scent, the feel, and the way it provided a moisturizing base for my foundation.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the jar will last me for months and months (assuming all that exposure to air every time I open</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s in a jar because it will allow me to scoop out every last bit of the cream when I get down to the end.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company ships the order upon receipt and it only takes a few days to get</li>
            <li> It is not very hydrating &amp;</li>
            <li> I wanted a slightly shiny look, as my skin is ultra dry.</li>
            <li> if it does indeed do those other things, that&#x27;s just</li>
            <li> But still it is not hydrating enough, at least for me.</li>
            <li> Something other heavily perfumed and synthetic ingredient moisturizers have caused.</li>
            <li> I always lose the little spoon, so I wind up just sticking my finger in.     </li>
            <li> ...........nice not to heavy or greasy absorbs well....</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now and not 1 break out from it.</li>
            <li> Did this product produce glowing, firm skin, etc?  </li>
            <li> Not very effective or hydrating.</li>
            <li> And small amounts work as well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations.  </li>
            <li> My skin has not had a bad reaction or a break-out from using Have a Vine Day.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t make it go bad).</li>
            <li> /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> And it has the color like a base, not moisturizer.</li>

            <li> This product was delivered on time (as usual) and came in a very portable container. The smell of this product is wonderful and it is a wonderful hydrator, especially if you have oily/dry skin. It finds the right balance of what your skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for Use:&lt;br /&gt;Use this product with Natures Gate Lite Switch. Along with this, use this product (with the Lite Switch) in the morning of a day where you will not use the night serums and etc. If morning and night creams are used on the same days acne could result.</li>
            <li> like it very much , eatable too</li>
            <li> Not as good as I had hoped. The product doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I&#x27;d like. Plus, no sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product. I was crushed when my local store stopped carrying it, and I was beyond elated to find it on Amazon (also, Amazon&#x27;s price is much more reasonable than what it was sold for in my town). I have used this product for the last three years or so.      I live in Northern California&#x27;s Wine Country, so it&#x27;s often tiresome to see trendy new wine/grape-based body products get so much hype when, in reality, it&#x27;s just a marketing ploy. I can&#x27;t speak directly to the effects contributed by the Chardonnay grapes in this hydrator, but I can tell you this about this product:    1) Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy  2) Has never caused breakouts  3) Doesn&#x27;t have any counter-effects (I&#x27;ve found that some moisturizers can actually cause my skin to dry out even more without regular use or if I use them daily then stop for whatever reason)  4) Personally, I love the smell    I haven&#x27;t found any cons about the Chardonnay Hydrator, although I do agree with another reviewer in saying that it would be awesome to have this in a pump or tube of some sort. I always lose the little spoon, so I wind up just sticking my finger in.     Happy shopping!</li>
            <li> Took a chance on this. Always looking for  the next best thing so I decided to try the moisturizer. I liked it. Later found out cranberry is good for your face. Who knew.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand..................Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Chardonnay Hydrator for Daytime, Have a Vine Day, 1.7 oz (48 g)...........nice not to heavy or greasy absorbs well....Bought 3....nice product!</li>
            <li> Hello All!  I love this product. I have never enjoyed the greasy-heavy feeling on my skin from most moisturizers I have used. However, Have a Vine Day is different. It goes on smoothly and gets absorbed into the skin quickly. It has a mild scent that is not offensive and fades once dry. I also like the fact that it is made with organic and natural ingredients. My skin has not had a bad reaction or a break-out from using Have a Vine Day. Something other heavily perfumed and synthetic ingredient moisturizers have caused. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a light moisturizer for hydrating their skin. It&#x27;s the only product I use.</li>
            <li> I was looking for natural cream after I break out with adult acne. This really works for me..have to use the toner first for best result.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer a lot. It is not greasy as everybody else said, and it gives a very smooth, silky texture to your skin. And small amounts work as well. I personally don&#x27;t like skin care products that finish after couple uses. I also like the fact that it comes with a glass jar.   So far I&#x27;ve used it after washing my face and applying %100 pure rose water. The result is just very good. I would recommend it and certainly will buy again myself.</li>
            <li> In my quest to go as natural as possible, both with my diet and with my skin care, I have been searching for a face lotion that is &#x27;organic&#x27; and yet shows results on my skin as much as the fancy, expensive, chemical-laden lotions with major advertising campaigns. I am 43 and have the dreaded combination of partially dry, partially oily, very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts. I stumbled across this product while browsing Amazon and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a week now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Causes NO breakouts&lt;br /&gt;- Creates SOFT SILKY skin&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t cause my powder to slide or discolor&lt;br /&gt;- Heavy on natural, organic ingredients and light on ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce&lt;br /&gt;- Paraben free&lt;br /&gt;- Price not bad compared to some other brands, organic or otherwise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Smell at first seemed kind of strong and I felt like it was going to give me a headache, but it quickly dissipates so is not a true con&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;d prefer a tube or pump bottle rather than a jar with a twist lid and a plastic spoon, to limit the lotion&#x27;s exposure to air and bacteria. I assume the makers chose the jar because the lotion is maybe a bit thick to flow smoothly from a pump or tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I plan to continue using this lotion. A little goes a long way, so the jar will last me for months and months (assuming all that exposure to air every time I open it won&#x27;t make it go bad). As for it not having sunscreen, I&#x27;m glad that it doesn&#x27;t as I get my sun protection from my SPF 30 powder (Colorescience), plus I find that sunscreen added to lotion increases the chances of irritation. Nature&#x27;s Gate has a whole line of products under the umbrella of \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Advanced Care\\&quot; and I plan to continue trying more of their products in this line over time.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has worked really well for me and my normal, 40-yr-old skin. I use the C for Yourself serum which normally was all I needed, but this winter I noticed some dry places on my face and needed something more. I decided to go ahead and try this and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It blends into my skin on top of the serum really well, leaves my skin feeling &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; (i.e. not greasy), and it does it&#x27;s job of moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if it lives up to all its claims of smoothing, lifting, improves skin tone, etc because I don&#x27;t use it religiously every day. All I know is that it does a great job moisturizing which is what I wanted it to do - if it does indeed do those other things, that&#x27;s just bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the gel-cream texture, and I like that it&#x27;s in a jar because it will allow me to scoop out every last bit of the cream when I get down to the end.</li>
            <li> Not very effective or hydrating. Maybe it&#x27;s my skin, but it disappears as soon as I apply it.  I wanted a slightly shiny look, as my skin is ultra dry.</li>
            <li> it has silica as 1 of the top 3 ingredients, which many people have found not good for skin. it is most effective in leaving the fake smooth feeling of the skin. But still it is not hydrating enough, at least for me. And it has the color like a base, not moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and suitable for many complexions</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product!  I only need a small amount, and my skin has responded remarkably well, soft and moist with no greasiness.  It is such a relief to find something I can use daily without worrying about what chemicals are getting into my system, and knowing that I am not contributing to animal suffering in any way.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was organic and not tested on animals. to my surprise, it is very light and still moisturizing at the same time. I love the scent too!  My skin is very sensitive to specific products and will break out usually. I have been using this for a few months now and not 1 break out from it. YEY!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product before I purchased it on Amazon.com, but my local store stopped carrying it. I was very happy to find it online, and less expensive! I love the product because it is really hydrating. It is very light and fresh when you apply it and it absorbs fast. I have tried several products before, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have found this product hydrates my skin better than any other product I have used.  It is a little expensive but worth it to me since it is so good and has made a big difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company ships the order upon receipt and it only takes a few days to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is non greasy and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on glowing reviews for this moisturizer.  Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations.  It turned out to be more of a light gel-creme texture than what I was expecting in a regular face cream.  It does smell fresh &amp; nice, but does not moisturize well enough for me &amp; left me with dry patches (even when using lots of product).  I would recommend this for someone with oily skin only. I now use this as more of a &#x27;serum&#x27; with another moisturizer or sunblock applied over.  Did this product produce glowing, firm skin, etc?  I really don&#x27;t know, as my main purpose for getting it was for use as a moisturizer (the soft &amp; dewy effect!) and in that respect it did not work out.</li>
            <li> I alternate between this moisturizer and another light day cream by Emerita.  This is a product you can buy at health food or grocery stores but Amazon has much better pricing.  It&#x27;s extremely light, almost whipped, and provides good moisture for many different complexions but dries matte.</li>
            <li> More and more I am replacing all of my cosmetics, creams, lotions, shampoos, etc. with those free of SLS, Parabens, etc.  I found Have A Vine Day on Amazon and felt it was worth a try, as it was very well priced.  I loved it immediately, the scent, the feel, and the way it provided a moisturizing base for my foundation.  It is not oily and kept my face  matte throughout the day. My skin is combination, oily in the T zone only.  I would highly recommend it.  I look forward to trying more of their products.</li>
            <li> A cruelty-free, natural product that truly works?  YES, please!  My dry, fair, sensitive skin demands moisturizer, and I&#x27;ve tried many over the years.  Nature&#x27;s Gate&#x27;s &#x27;Have a Vine Day&#x27; is a fabulous product with a lovely light scent.  It goes on smooth, blends and absorbs quickly, and leaves my face refreshed but never greasy.  I use it daily, under a basic tinted moisturizer, and look forward to the moments we&#x27;re together. (hah!)  I&#x27;m on my third jar and have no plans of switching brands.  Thanks Nature&#x27;s Gate!</li>
            <li> This feels so soothing.  There&#x27;s no fragrance, so nothing to assault my nose.  I use it for daytime moisture and it makes my skin feel so moist and soft.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream for daytime. It relieves that &#x27;tight&amp;#34; feeling my skin gets after washing, but it doesn&#x27;t make my forehead shine like the more expensive creams I have used. The price is better on Amazon than the other online merchant I have purchased from in the past.</li>
            <li> Enough said.  Nothing better out there on the market.  Have even used over make up and no break outs ever.</li>
            <li> This smells so nice and fresh . . .  .like being in a vineyard in the early morning! Aaaahh! The fresh scent vanishes in a few seconds but at least it&#x27;s there initially. Plus! It feels good on your skin, absorbs quickly, moisturizes well, and yet leaves absolutely no shine or greasiness to the skin at all. I do recommend it. It&#x27;s quite lovely!</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and soft. Only downside is the scent is a little strong for me. Too much of a perfume smell.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic hydrator and facial shield.  The texture and feel is wonderfully refreshing.  Light and powerful.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this.  It is not very hydrating &amp; any concealer applied over top did not blend well.  This also broke out my neck.&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
