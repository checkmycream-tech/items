            <li>I LOVE THIS TAPE</li>
            <li>I purchased these Nail Stripes Striping Tapes not quite sure of the quality and amount/colors of striping of each roll.</li>

            <li>as it turns out it is so tiny its probably better to leave it on the nail as the actual design.</li>

            <li> It came faster than expected and there were multiple colors no duplicates. My favorite is the silver.</li>
            <li> These are so cute and fun and the price for 30 of them is amazing!</li>
            <li> Pain the ass to work with.</li>
            <li> I love the look of these on my nails but the product doesn&#x27;t even last 1 day. The strips lift no matter what I do. I even sought out the advice and tips from a professional nail tech and nothing helped. I wish it was different because they are so cute on my nails.</li>
            <li> Great contrast for nail polish</li>
            <li> Was not so pleased with this I had alot of doubles, and not prints like I read about. Over all still a good buy.</li>
            <li> love these so fun! It takes a while tho to put them on your right hand by yourself ;) made my nails look great tho!</li>
            <li> The product was all that it claimed to be,  great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> It stayed on for maybe 10 days. Looked great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TAPE I&#x27;M JUST NOT GREAT WITH IT.</li>
            <li> Been wanting striping tape for a while now, so glad I finally found some good quality tape, with a great variety at a great price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful designs! I love the variety!</li>
            <li> unable to use it. i wanted something to make stripes or patterns with. as it turns out it is so tiny its probably better to leave it on the nail as the actual design.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this. I know it seems iffy, but I was surprised by how good and pretty these tapes were when i got them in the mail. They&#x27;re fine, and the rolls are deep so you will get a lot of use out of them. Worth more than they cost.</li>
            <li> Great selection, Great price. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I purchased these Nail Stripes Striping Tapes not quite sure of the quality and amount/colors of striping of each roll. Needless to say I was so happy to see all the beautiful colors and the large rolls of the striping tape. There are three sets of ten rolls per set. Colors include: white, black, purple, red, green. blue, gold, silver and 2 more. Very nicely packaged with each roll in it&#x27;s own tiny ziplock bag! There is enough striping to last for a very long time even if you are a manicurist. If you are looking for an inexpensive, nice way to dress up your nails these tapes will work out great for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thinner than I had expected. But it adheres well. But withith being so thin at least for me is hard to make stripping I wanted and now I have a lot of it but I will have to make do.</li>
            <li> Very nice. And I love that they were put in their own little baggies. So happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for my niece. There is a great selection so there is something to go with any nail color. They are also handy to section off your nails for designs.</li>
            <li> finally came. I like it it has quite a few doubles but I am just using the pre-cut lines for style no so much the tape. so i am fine with my purchase</li>
            <li> I like it) many ways to put them, looks good</li>
