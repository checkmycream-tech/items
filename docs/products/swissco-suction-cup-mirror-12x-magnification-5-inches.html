            <li>So the price/quality/shipping was good.</li>
            <li>It so good to feel</li>
            <li>This mirror may be waaaay too good.  </li>
            <li>but while it lasted image quality was good</li>
            <li>good quality and design.</li>
            <li>Good magnification.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Also I could bring it on my travel, it&#x27;d be a wonderful tool for a quick check of powder, lipstick and &amp;#34;spinach between the teeth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>It has 12x magnification with perfect clarity, which is what makes it the best - no distortion, and it is about 5 inches in diameter, which makes it large enough to view your face perfectly.</li>
            <li>It has perfect magnification and so far, I&#x27;m happy with the suction.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even appear to be 12x - more like 5x!  </li>
            <li>I have excellent vision and this shows a very distorted image.  </li>
            <li>The suction cups are handy.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li>This is the mirror to have if your looking for a mirror that will give you a good detailed look at your face.</li>
            <li>i did get a great laugh.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied, except possibly for the fact that, at 12X, you see everything in exquisite detail - every pore and imperfection....</li>
            <li>Nice mirror with two strong suction cups holders.  </li>
            <li>Easily attaches to the mirror above his bathroom vanity and provides the perfect magnification to keep his beard nicely groomed.</li>
            <li>This level of magnification is more than enough for me, so I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>This is one of those things that you are better off to spend more money on a better product.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the size of the mirror as I use for applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>OK, I have a 15X lighted FLoxite mirror at home that I dearly love...</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be able to catch any stray hair that appears while I&#x27;m on the road...</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>Be sure to mount it so the suction cups are on the horizontal.  </li>
            <li>it is okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the condensation / heat / house vibrations from highway traffic has a factor in it falling.</li>
            <li>It provides great 12x magnification, has a larger-than-most diameter, and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest that before mounting the mirror on any surface, be sure to moisten the suction cups.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves this size, much better than the 3&amp;#34; Dia she has been using</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Knew immediately I&#x27;d love it</li>
            <li>So, I bought a couple more through Amazon</li>
            <li>Great for shaving, would recommend it to anyone who wants to see what all there shaving up close glad I bought it</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Most of the reflection you get is distorted</li>
            <li>I love using this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did the research before buying this product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The mirror seems kind of cheaply made is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this great travel  anywhere mirror.</li>
            <li>sticks on great and magnifies clearly.</li>
            <li>Clear and in focus with great magnification.  </li>
            <li>surprisingly lightweight mirror will do it, but get ready to run screaming from the room.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>The clarity is great and the mirror is larger in diameter than most</li>
            <li>Compact, lightweight and attaches easily to the inside of my medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>The suction also sticks well and removes easily.</li>
            <li>that are this strong of magnification.</li>
            <li>Its not lighted which I like fine.</li>
            <li>magnification is fantastic, secure fit onto mirror.</li>
            <li>I have plenty of light in my vanity.</li>
            <li>so I could have hands free when applying my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Great for spinning tops if you need a smooth surface with a light curve to the middle.</li>
            <li>but it is very useful.</li>
            <li>Wow , now I can see more than I want to see!</li>
            <li>good magnification and the suction cups actually work!  </li>
            <li>Much better than 15x which distorts too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m baffled as to why this mirror gets such good reviews.</li>
            <li>I can finally see well enough to kind all those pesky hairs on my face that weren&#x27;t there when I had great vision.  </li>
            <li>and I will be able to see my whole face.  </li>
            <li>mirror is not a bad product if the description had listed this I would have known</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well-packaged.</li>
            <li>Nice big mirror, good quality and the suction cups actually stick!</li>
            <li>I have found that many hotels, particularly in other countries, don&#x27;t have much lighting in the rooms and the most light is available by the window.  </li>
            <li>The 2 suction cups are large enough to provide good support.</li>
            <li>Able to see clearly with or without my glasses</li>
            <li>I was recently traveling and brought my mirror with me, but I didn&#x27;t follow my own advice.  </li>
            <li>It is in my basket of rarely used things.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the cost to return it.</li>
            <li>but I was surprised at its more compact size.  </li>
            <li>Its larger than most of suction cup magnifying mirrors i have seen in stores, yet the view is still strong and crisp.</li>
            <li>Attaches easily to any spot you may need, as long as it is a smooth service!</li>
            <li>I can tweeze super easily and see so clearly what I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for a large size high-magnification mirror that isn&#x27;t distorted, can be mounted on a smooth surface, and not outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li>*RIGHT UP ON IT</li>
            <li>Just the right size and strength for putting on eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>It is just the right size for packing.</li>
            <li>I applied the suction cup of this mirror right over one side of the Ikea mirror.</li>
            <li>The suction cups are very strong, but of course they will only stick to glass, tile, or maybe metal</li>
            <li>I have tried several different types of magnifying mirrors and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It sticks real well to my full length mirror I have hanging on my bathroom door.</li>
            <li>A great little item that really sticks to the mirror  and makes those stray hairs POP right out at you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d simply attach it to the window pane where natural light is most adequate for grooming.</li>
            <li>The mirror is 5 inches in diameter, as stated, which is plenty large to view your face (too large for a purse, but fine for a large tote bag).</li>
            <li>I based my purchase on other&#x27;s reviews and am very pleased with the quality of the 12x Swissco mirror.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the 15X travel mirror, it&#x27;s got a larger viewing surface and with bifocals</li>
            <li>I just stick it to the window of my room and take advantage of the natural light outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most likely going to buy another one for our guest bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li>I travel extensively and have more than one magnifying mirror since I can&#x27;t see my face without one.  </li>
            <li>I only wish i had better lighting in our RV.  </li>
            <li>Pefect for mirror magnification, I can see everything whether I want to or not ;) .</li>
            <li>because I broke the first one.</li>
            <li>I wish I had tried this one first.</li>
            <li>I can finally get all the boogies out of my nose.  :)</li>
            <li>It is only ok straight on.  </li>
            <li>Suction cups are large and stay stuck.</li>
            <li>The mirror came loose and fell on the counter top causing it to shatter into a million pieces.  </li>
            <li>These are very distorted unless you get really close.</li>
            <li>I really like the size of this one.  </li>
            <li>you really truly want to see your pores magnified twelve times?&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Have to be very close to the mirror to avoid distortion</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice the size of it.</li>
            <li>Too much magnification</li>
            <li>The suction cups don&#x27;t hold very well on glass.</li>
            <li>you really shouldn&#x27;t view yourself this close up.  </li>
            <li>This was just too much magnification for me.</li>
            <li>This mirror is really good except for the fact that it&#x27;s much larger than I expected.</li>
            <li>We love this mirror...large and clear, with 3 suction cups to hold it securely in place, so it won&#x27;t fall off our bathroom mirror into the sink and break like our small older ones have!</li>
            <li>So much better than the other one I bought on another site.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is very small, but I knew this and thought it would be good for travel.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes too much; I&#x27;ve put it down on the counter for a brief minute and it sticks to the point I have to yank it off; which is a good thing I guess.</li>
            <li>Decided to try this one as it had decent reviews.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll likely buy several more for family members.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be the same as one I had lost - but it is so much better with 2 ample suction cups to keep in attached to a larger mirror and the amplification is not blurry.</li>
            <li>Great for old men with tired eyes</li>
            <li>For an item made in China, it is surprisingly high quality.</li>
            <li>My spouse requested I purchase a portable high magnification mirror.  </li>
            <li>I guess 12x power is a little more than I need/want.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was a little more magnified since it is advertised for brow tweezing, but it is sufficient</li>
            <li>Never realized how much easier it would be to apply eye makeup when you can clearly see your target.  </li>
            <li>Too much magnification to see clearly when it is stuck on a mirror which was our intended purpose.</li>
            <li>Great magnification but lousy suction cups.  </li>
            <li>If your view is distorted, step back or forward until you&#x27;re at the right distance.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it, so I had to buy another one.  </li>
            <li>Mirror is very clear.  </li>
            <li>It makes seeing anthing on your face very clear.  </li>
            <li>I based it on the icon picture which seems very much like my smaller mirror.</li>
            <li>First bought one of these at a discount store, but they only had one.  </li>
            <li>Because of that, the suction cups do no good at all, because the plate mirror above the sink is a good 2 feet away.</li>
            <li>With this little mirror, I can just stick it ON the window and have both hands free.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great, suction cups are just a little weak for holding it on anything other than smooth glass.</li>
            <li>The 12X magnification on the Swissco is clear - no distortion.</li>
            <li>Clearly distorted n stain to the eyes when using .</li>
            <li>It is clear and compact and undistorted.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too far</li>
            <li>But that is too far away from my face</li>
            <li>The suction cups on the back really do hold this thing in place.</li>
            <li>I wish the whole mirror were a bit larger</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for the visually challenged middle-ager who needs magnified vision for makeup application.  </li>
            <li>I stick it on the window with the suction cups that are attached and have direct light to see what I&#x27;m doing while I&#x27;m removing those &#x27;pesky&#x27; little facial hairs.</li>
            <li>the magnification was so strong i looked like an alien!</li>
            <li>and as I&#x27;m getting older, I need the extra help to see properly.  </li>
            <li>At 5&amp;#34; across, I can&#x27;t see my whole face at once, but I can see the center -- both eyes, nose &amp; mouth.</li>
            <li>I needed something at my age for the fine lines, paid a lot for this, it arrived, and although large in size didn&#x27;t magnify any more than those I had that were smaller, much less expensive at Walmart, and less in magnification.</li>
            <li>Not worth the money and too much hassle to return, and not usable.</li>
            <li>A little too small but OK for traveling.</li>
            <li>Mirror projected highly distorted image upside down like something from a joke or novelty store.</li>

            <li> This mirror is a great size.</li>
            <li> An excellent  product with very strong suction.</li>
            <li> 12x magnification is very handy</li>
            <li> Very nice mirror though.</li>
            <li> Great Mirror, nice for travel or home use</li>
            <li> I loved the product</li>
            <li> So the price/quality/shipping was good.</li>
            <li> It so good to feel</li>
            <li> This mirror may be waaaay too good.  </li>
            <li> but while it lasted image quality was good</li>
            <li> good quality and design.</li>
            <li> Good magnification.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Also I could bring it on my travel, it&#x27;d be a wonderful tool for a quick check of powder, lipstick and &amp;#34;spinach between the teeth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It has 12x magnification with perfect clarity, which is what makes it the best - no distortion, and it is about 5 inches in diameter, which makes it large enough to view your face perfectly.</li>
            <li> It has perfect magnification and so far, I&#x27;m happy with the suction.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even appear to be 12x - more like 5x!  </li>
            <li> I have excellent vision and this shows a very distorted image.  </li>
            <li> The suction cups are handy.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li> This is the mirror to have if your looking for a mirror that will give you a good detailed look at your face.</li>
            <li> i did get a great laugh.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied, except possibly for the fact that, at 12X, you see everything in exquisite detail - every pore and imperfection....</li>
            <li> Nice mirror with two strong suction cups holders.  </li>
            <li> Easily attaches to the mirror above his bathroom vanity and provides the perfect magnification to keep his beard nicely groomed.</li>
            <li> This level of magnification is more than enough for me, so I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is one of those things that you are better off to spend more money on a better product.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the size of the mirror as I use for applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> OK, I have a 15X lighted FLoxite mirror at home that I dearly love...</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be able to catch any stray hair that appears while I&#x27;m on the road...</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> Be sure to mount it so the suction cups are on the horizontal.  </li>
            <li> it is okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the condensation / heat / house vibrations from highway traffic has a factor in it falling.</li>
            <li> It provides great 12x magnification, has a larger-than-most diameter, and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest that before mounting the mirror on any surface, be sure to moisten the suction cups.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this size, much better than the 3&amp;#34; Dia she has been using</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Knew immediately I&#x27;d love it</li>
            <li> So, I bought a couple more through Amazon</li>
            <li> Great for shaving, would recommend it to anyone who wants to see what all there shaving up close glad I bought it</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Most of the reflection you get is distorted</li>
            <li> I love using this mirror.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did the research before buying this product.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> The mirror seems kind of cheaply made is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this great travel  anywhere mirror.</li>
            <li> sticks on great and magnifies clearly.</li>
            <li> Clear and in focus with great magnification.  </li>
            <li> surprisingly lightweight mirror will do it, but get ready to run screaming from the room.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> The clarity is great and the mirror is larger in diameter than most</li>
            <li> Compact, lightweight and attaches easily to the inside of my medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li> The suction also sticks well and removes easily.</li>
            <li> that are this strong of magnification.</li>
            <li> Its not lighted which I like fine.</li>
            <li> magnification is fantastic, secure fit onto mirror.</li>
            <li> I have plenty of light in my vanity.</li>
            <li> so I could have hands free when applying my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Great for spinning tops if you need a smooth surface with a light curve to the middle.</li>
            <li> but it is very useful.</li>
            <li> Wow , now I can see more than I want to see!</li>
            <li> good magnification and the suction cups actually work!  </li>
            <li> Much better than 15x which distorts too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m baffled as to why this mirror gets such good reviews.</li>
            <li> I can finally see well enough to kind all those pesky hairs on my face that weren&#x27;t there when I had great vision.  </li>
            <li> and I will be able to see my whole face.  </li>
            <li> mirror is not a bad product if the description had listed this I would have known</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well-packaged.</li>
            <li> Nice big mirror, good quality and the suction cups actually stick!</li>
            <li> I have found that many hotels, particularly in other countries, don&#x27;t have much lighting in the rooms and the most light is available by the window.  </li>
            <li> The 2 suction cups are large enough to provide good support.</li>
            <li> Able to see clearly with or without my glasses</li>
            <li> I was recently traveling and brought my mirror with me, but I didn&#x27;t follow my own advice.  </li>
            <li> It is in my basket of rarely used things.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the cost to return it.</li>
            <li> but I was surprised at its more compact size.  </li>
            <li> Its larger than most of suction cup magnifying mirrors i have seen in stores, yet the view is still strong and crisp.</li>
            <li> Attaches easily to any spot you may need, as long as it is a smooth service!</li>
            <li> I can tweeze super easily and see so clearly what I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a large size high-magnification mirror that isn&#x27;t distorted, can be mounted on a smooth surface, and not outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> *RIGHT UP ON IT</li>
            <li> Just the right size and strength for putting on eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> It is just the right size for packing.</li>
            <li> I applied the suction cup of this mirror right over one side of the Ikea mirror.</li>
            <li> The suction cups are very strong, but of course they will only stick to glass, tile, or maybe metal</li>
            <li> I have tried several different types of magnifying mirrors and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It sticks real well to my full length mirror I have hanging on my bathroom door.</li>
            <li> A great little item that really sticks to the mirror  and makes those stray hairs POP right out at you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d simply attach it to the window pane where natural light is most adequate for grooming.</li>
            <li> The mirror is 5 inches in diameter, as stated, which is plenty large to view your face (too large for a purse, but fine for a large tote bag).</li>
            <li> I based my purchase on other&#x27;s reviews and am very pleased with the quality of the 12x Swissco mirror.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the 15X travel mirror, it&#x27;s got a larger viewing surface and with bifocals</li>
            <li> I just stick it to the window of my room and take advantage of the natural light outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most likely going to buy another one for our guest bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> I travel extensively and have more than one magnifying mirror since I can&#x27;t see my face without one.  </li>
            <li> I only wish i had better lighting in our RV.  </li>
            <li> Pefect for mirror magnification, I can see everything whether I want to or not ;) .</li>
            <li> because I broke the first one.</li>
            <li> I wish I had tried this one first.</li>
            <li> I can finally get all the boogies out of my nose.  :)</li>
            <li> It is only ok straight on.  </li>
            <li> Suction cups are large and stay stuck.</li>
            <li> The mirror came loose and fell on the counter top causing it to shatter into a million pieces.  </li>
            <li> These are very distorted unless you get really close.</li>
            <li> I really like the size of this one.  </li>
            <li> you really truly want to see your pores magnified twelve times?&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Have to be very close to the mirror to avoid distortion</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice the size of it.</li>
            <li> Too much magnification</li>
            <li> The suction cups don&#x27;t hold very well on glass.</li>
            <li> you really shouldn&#x27;t view yourself this close up.  </li>
            <li> This was just too much magnification for me.</li>
            <li> This mirror is really good except for the fact that it&#x27;s much larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> We love this mirror...large and clear, with 3 suction cups to hold it securely in place, so it won&#x27;t fall off our bathroom mirror into the sink and break like our small older ones have!</li>
            <li> So much better than the other one I bought on another site.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is very small, but I knew this and thought it would be good for travel.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes too much; I&#x27;ve put it down on the counter for a brief minute and it sticks to the point I have to yank it off; which is a good thing I guess.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this one as it had decent reviews.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll likely buy several more for family members.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be the same as one I had lost - but it is so much better with 2 ample suction cups to keep in attached to a larger mirror and the amplification is not blurry.</li>
            <li> Great for old men with tired eyes</li>
            <li> For an item made in China, it is surprisingly high quality.</li>
            <li> My spouse requested I purchase a portable high magnification mirror.  </li>
            <li> I guess 12x power is a little more than I need/want.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was a little more magnified since it is advertised for brow tweezing, but it is sufficient</li>
            <li> Never realized how much easier it would be to apply eye makeup when you can clearly see your target.  </li>
            <li> Too much magnification to see clearly when it is stuck on a mirror which was our intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Great magnification but lousy suction cups.  </li>
            <li> If your view is distorted, step back or forward until you&#x27;re at the right distance.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without it, so I had to buy another one.  </li>
            <li> Mirror is very clear.  </li>
            <li> It makes seeing anthing on your face very clear.  </li>
            <li> I based it on the icon picture which seems very much like my smaller mirror.</li>
            <li> First bought one of these at a discount store, but they only had one.  </li>
            <li> Because of that, the suction cups do no good at all, because the plate mirror above the sink is a good 2 feet away.</li>
            <li> With this little mirror, I can just stick it ON the window and have both hands free.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great, suction cups are just a little weak for holding it on anything other than smooth glass.</li>
            <li> The 12X magnification on the Swissco is clear - no distortion.</li>
            <li> Clearly distorted n stain to the eyes when using .</li>
            <li> It is clear and compact and undistorted.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too far</li>
            <li> But that is too far away from my face</li>
            <li> The suction cups on the back really do hold this thing in place.</li>
            <li> I wish the whole mirror were a bit larger</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for the visually challenged middle-ager who needs magnified vision for makeup application.  </li>
            <li> I stick it on the window with the suction cups that are attached and have direct light to see what I&#x27;m doing while I&#x27;m removing those &#x27;pesky&#x27; little facial hairs.</li>
            <li> the magnification was so strong i looked like an alien!</li>
            <li> and as I&#x27;m getting older, I need the extra help to see properly.  </li>
            <li> At 5&amp;#34; across, I can&#x27;t see my whole face at once, but I can see the center -- both eyes, nose &amp; mouth.</li>
            <li> I needed something at my age for the fine lines, paid a lot for this, it arrived, and although large in size didn&#x27;t magnify any more than those I had that were smaller, much less expensive at Walmart, and less in magnification.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money and too much hassle to return, and not usable.</li>
            <li> A little too small but OK for traveling.</li>
            <li> Mirror projected highly distorted image upside down like something from a joke or novelty store.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it too if you need a little help with putting on your eye makeup without your glasses.</li>
            <li> Pores, stray hairs, eyeliner skips and newly formed wrinkles are no match for this little guy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several other suction mirrors similar to this</li>
            <li> Way bigger than I expected it to be.. also if you clip it to a mirror the sink is in the way</li>
            <li> This mirror is not a clear mirror.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is small, the image very distorted, don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Finally fell off the mirror one time too many and broke :-(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the selection of 12x or more magnifying mirrors with suction cups is pretty meager.  </li>
            <li> The mirror was not what I expected, so it&#x27;s unusable.</li>
            <li> That is a big help when you have trouble trying to wear glasses and put on makeup.</li>
            <li> Be careful what you ask for.&lt;br /&gt;Think</li>
            <li> carefully, fellow Amazonians...</li>
            <li> The small (~1-inch) spot in the center of the mirror is the only part where your body part is in focus, and you have to be</li>
            <li> I bought two, one for myself and the other for my BFF.</li>
            <li> You can only see a small portion of your face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t really suck all that well.</li>
            <li> so my image is upside down.  </li>
            <li> Any smaller would be useless and any bigger would be too cumbersome for travel.</li>
            <li> it seems to have less power than my 10X.  </li>
            <li> Sticks tight</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t see to apply my eye makeup until I got this invaluable little mirror.</li>
            <li> and it was way too weak, too small, and I could barely see anything - returned it.  </li>
            <li> well even when the door is sometimes closed rather hard.</li>
            <li> Turning it slightly to one side or the other to side something, the image is totally distorted and unable to see anything.  </li>
            <li> - well let&#x27;s just say I missed a few stray hairs while I was gone</li>
            <li> Never has fallen in a few months.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks and the lighting it gives, but was disappointed with the weak level of magnification.</li>
            <li> It is 5 &amp;#34; in diameter and way too small.  </li>
            <li> This one serves the purpose but at 5 inches in diameter, its &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; of clarity and magnification is quite small.  </li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve bought because I keep leaving them behind in hotel rooms!  </li>
            <li> Too small, but I made use of it.</li>
            <li> While they all work perfectly, it is very difficult to apply makeup while holding the mirror in your other hand (especially eyeliner).  </li>
            <li> ; diameter, maybe then I&#x27;ll get at least a 7 inch diameter</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably not a great shower mirror because of fogging, and too small for shaving.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> The suction cups work well, have not had a fail yet.</li>
            <li> And every eyebrow hair poking weirdly out of place.</li>
            <li> I stick it up in a spot on my medicine cabinet mirror and it helps me obsess every night over all the stuff going wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the magnification of this mirror.  </li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Bought a couple and they are going in the yard sale stuff, too annoying to use.</li>
            <li> terrible suction--does not stick to wall</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Mirror projected highly distorted image upside down like something from a joke or novelty store. Useless.</li>
            <li> Mirror is very clear.  Suction cups are large and stay stuck.</li>
            <li> Great Mirror, nice for travel or home use</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could have hands-free magnification to put on my eyeliner and pluck my brows while I travel. This meets those needs perfectly. Any smaller would be useless and any bigger would be too cumbersome for travel. At 5&amp;#34; across, I can&#x27;t see my whole face at once, but I can see the center -- both eyes, nose &amp; mouth. But I am only looking at one eye at a time anyway, so this works for me. I stuck it on my bathroom mirror at home so I can use it all the time, and it makes things a lot easier for me. The suction cups are very strong, but of course they will only stick to glass, tile, or maybe metal (it won&#x27;t stick to a wall). As for distortion, I don&#x27;t find that at all, but it depends where you stand. If your view is distorted, step back or forward until you&#x27;re at the right distance. This level of magnification is more than enough for me, so I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> good magnification and the suction cups actually work!  I thought maybe it would fall off after awhile but seems to be hanging on.</li>
            <li> terrible suction--does not stick to wall</li>
            <li> AWESOME...best mirror on the market!!</li>
            <li> These are very distorted unless you get really close. Bought a couple and they are going in the yard sale stuff, too annoying to use. This is one of those things that you are better off to spend more money on a better product.</li>
            <li> A little too small but OK for traveling.</li>
            <li> 2nd time to purchase this item.  Have one for different locations.  Pleased with the size of the mirror as I use for applying makeup.  The suction cups work well, have not had a fail yet.</li>
            <li> Perfect for seeing imperfections.</li>
            <li> Way bigger than I expected it to be.. also if you clip it to a mirror the sink is in the way and it&#x27;s too far and it gets distorted...</li>
            <li> Perfect mirror for makeup without glasses. This is my third one. Check the suction periodically or it might fall and break. Much better than 15x which distorts too much.</li>
            <li> OK, I have a 15X lighted FLoxite mirror at home that I dearly love... but it&#x27;s too big to take on the road.  So... I started with a 7X for the road - well let&#x27;s just say I missed a few stray hairs while I was gone and that&#x27;s not what I want to happen.  Ordered the 15X travel one on Amz and it was way too weak, too small, and I could barely see anything - returned it.  Decided to try this one as it had decent reviews.  It&#x27;s better than the 15X travel mirror, it&#x27;s got a larger viewing surface and with bifocals I think I&#x27;ll be able to catch any stray hair that appears while I&#x27;m on the road... I&#x27;ll let you know!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. I bought one and don&#x27;t remember where I found it. I dropped it this morning and broke it. I am purchasing 2 today. One for me and one for a Christmas present for my sister.</li>
            <li> I based my purchase on other&#x27;s reviews and am very pleased with the quality of the 12x Swissco mirror.  I ordered two for our family. Both arrived well-packaged in bubble wrap.  I have been searching for a large size high-magnification mirror that isn&#x27;t distorted, can be mounted on a smooth surface, and not outrageously expensive. The 12X magnification on the Swissco is clear - no distortion. The mirror is 5 inches in diameter, as stated, which is plenty large to view your face (too large for a purse, but fine for a large tote bag). The 12x magnification is perfect for grooming chores or cosmetics applications that your eyes may miss. We attached the Swissco to our vanity wall mirror. The 2 suction cups are large enough to provide good support. Be sure to mount it so the suction cups are on the horizontal.  If you mount the suction cups vertically, it is possible for the mirror to fall if the suction cups loosen over time.  We plan on taking one along when traveling. For an item made in China, it is surprisingly high quality. Thank you to fellow reviewers and the packers at Amazon.</li>
            <li> The mirror is small, the image very distorted, don&#x27;t waste your money.  The mirror is very small, but I knew this and thought it would be good for travel.  I will order another brand.</li>
            <li> The small (~1-inch) spot in the center of the mirror is the only part where your body part is in focus, and you have to be *RIGHT UP ON IT* to see. Because of that, the suction cups do no good at all, because the plate mirror above the sink is a good 2 feet away. I&#x27;m baffled as to why this mirror gets such good reviews.</li>
            <li> This 5 inch mirror is a great size. The mirror itself is great quality with no wavy areas. The mirror is attached to glass door and the suction cups have held onto the glass well even when the door is sometimes closed rather hard.</li>
            <li> The mirror was not what I expected, so it&#x27;s unusable.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to use this and so is my husband who keeps using it.  We can see and without glasses</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t stick to anything but glass.  I sent it back and got one with a stand.</li>
            <li> After using a 3\\&quot; 5x magnification travel mirror for years, I found this on Amazon. At 5\\&quot;, it&#x27;s the perfect size for makeup application. I just stick it to the window of my room and take advantage of the natural light outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably not a great shower mirror because of fogging, and too small for shaving. But great for makeup application. A great find for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little to no distortion, BTW.</li>
            <li> We love this mirror...large and clear, with 3 suction cups to hold it securely in place, so it won&#x27;t fall off our bathroom mirror into the sink and break like our small older ones have!</li>
            <li> If you are a person experiencing difficulty seeing up close, this is the mirror for you.  Never realized how much easier it would be to apply eye makeup when you can clearly see your target.  I don&#x27;t even get mascara on my lids anymore!  Will keep this with me whenever I travel.</li>
            <li> This is the mirror to have if your looking for a mirror that will give you a good detailed look at your face.</li>
            <li> An excellent  product with very strong suction. Great magnification without any distortion. Would highly recommend this great travel  anywhere mirror.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I loved the product</li>
            <li> I rated this a 5 star because it is what I hoped it&#x27;d be. It suctions well to the mirror &amp; to the height that I choose &amp; the magnification is sufficient for my needs. I&#x27;m most likely going to buy another one for our guest bathroom mirror. I had purchased a 3 1/2&amp;#34; last year via Amazon &amp; it is okay but it keeps falling off the mirror &amp; into the sink. I&#x27;ll have to keep watch on this one &amp; hope it doesn&#x27;t break if it falls. I&#x27;m sure the condensation / heat / house vibrations from highway traffic has a factor in it falling. I recommend this one for convenience &amp; profeciency.</li>
            <li> When I try to use the mirror the reflection is distorted in some areas of the mirror.  I would not recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> Clearly distorted n stain to the eyes when using . Item was not as claimed .</li>
            <li> My spouse requested I purchase a portable high magnification mirror.  These are inexpensive mirrors and the glass has no imperfections.  The suction cup on the back sticks well.  Very satisfied, except possibly for the fact that, at 12X, you see everything in exquisite detail - every pore and imperfection....</li>
            <li> It shows every flaw in magnified reflection. That is a big help when you have trouble trying to wear glasses and put on makeup. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Magnification is great for putting on eye makeup, and I can use it when I travel. Great idea!</li>
            <li> works greats and stays attached to mirror</li>
            <li> I can finally see well enough to kind all those pesky hairs on my face that weren&#x27;t there when I had great vision.  Able to see clearly with or without my glasses</li>
            <li> Great magnifying mirror</li>
            <li> I needed something at my age for the fine lines, paid a lot for this, it arrived, and although large in size didn&#x27;t magnify any more than those I had that were smaller, much less expensive at Walmart, and less in magnification.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror with two strong suction cups holders.  12x magnification is very handy and when I travel I can just pop it off and take it with me.  I have another one but it&#x27;s smaller.  I really like the size of this one.  Now have one in both bathrooms.</li>
            <li> I have excellent vision and this shows a very distorted image.  It is only ok straight on.  Turning it slightly to one side or the other to side something, the image is totally distorted and unable to see anything.  I am very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for the visually challenged middle-ager who needs magnified vision for makeup application.  It provides great 12x magnification, has a larger-than-most diameter, and is reasonably priced.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.  I would suggest that before mounting the mirror on any surface, be sure to moisten the suction cups.  I was recently traveling and brought my mirror with me, but I didn&#x27;t follow my own advice.  The mirror came loose and fell on the counter top causing it to shatter into a million pieces.  I couldn&#x27;t live without it, so I had to buy another one.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this size, much better than the 3&amp;#34; Dia she has been using</li>
            <li> Excellent! So much better than the other one I bought on another site.  This one will truly show you all the hairs you need to tweeze. And every eyebrow hair poking weirdly out of place.</li>
            <li> I travel extensively and have more than one magnifying mirror since I can&#x27;t see my face without one.  While they all work perfectly, it is very difficult to apply makeup while holding the mirror in your other hand (especially eyeliner).  I have found that many hotels, particularly in other countries, don&#x27;t have much lighting in the rooms and the most light is available by the window.  With this little mirror, I can just stick it ON the window and have both hands free.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Just the right size and strength for putting on eye makeup.  I placed it on my big mirror to just magnify what I need to see without having to find my glasses.  Sticks tight</li>
            <li> this mirror works great I only wish i had better lighting in our RV.  It is great to tweeze eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Excellent in all regards</li>
            <li> Pefect for mirror magnification, I can see everything whether I want to or not ;) . The suction doesn&#x27;t last forever so I reapply every so often to insure safety. Its not lighted which I like fine. I have plenty of light in my vanity. So the price/quality/shipping was good.</li>
            <li> I like it as it&#x27;s 12 x the magnification and as I&#x27;m getting older, I need the extra help to see properly.  I stick it on the window with the suction cups that are attached and have direct light to see what I&#x27;m doing while I&#x27;m removing those &#x27;pesky&#x27; little facial hairs.</li>
            <li> It so good to feel like I know where I am putting my mascara.  Now if only it could perform miracles!</li>
            <li> Perfect for eyebrows and eye makeup!  The size is perfect, as well.</li>
            <li> When you eye sight is fading you need that mirror. The suction cups are handy. A must for a makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Too much magnification to see clearly when it is stuck on a mirror which was our intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Mirror surface is smaller than imagined, but performs as state.</li>
            <li> It is what it is. Simple magnification.</li>
            <li> This mirror may be waaaay too good.  Be careful what you ask for.&lt;br /&gt;Think carefully, fellow Amazonians...&lt;br /&gt;Do you really truly want to see your pores magnified twelve times?&lt;br /&gt;This surprisingly lightweight mirror will do it, but get ready to run screaming from the room.&lt;br /&gt;And please don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you.  Seriously.</li>
            <li> First bought one of these at a discount store, but they only had one.  Knew immediately I&#x27;d love it and I did.  So, I bought a couple more through Amazon and I&#x27;ll likely buy several more for family members.  The clarity is great and the mirror is larger in diameter than most that are this strong of magnification.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t see to apply my eye makeup until I got this invaluable little mirror. Where I go ... it goes.</li>
            <li> Not enough magnification for my needs.  Very nice mirror though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to stick to my bathroom mirror so I could have hands free when applying my makeup.  But that is too far away from my face so my image is upside down.  The mirror is a 5 inch mirror meaning you must have it 5 inches from your face. Anything farther and you are upside down.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is not a bad product if the description had listed this I would have known it was not what I was looking for.  If you just want a close up image of your face then you will like the mirror.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 50+ eyesight</li>
            <li> This mirror is amazing!!1</li>
            <li> Have to be very close to the mirror to avoid distortion</li>
            <li> sticks on great and magnifies clearly.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best magnifying mirror.  It is perfect for putting on makeup or tweezing eyebrows. I have tried several different types of magnifying mirrors and this one is by far the best. It has 12x magnification with perfect clarity, which is what makes it the best - no distortion, and it is about 5 inches in diameter, which makes it large enough to view your face perfectly. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy here - works just like it should, which is all I ask!  Compact, lightweight and attaches easily to the inside of my medicine cabinet.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Its larger than most of suction cup magnifying mirrors i have seen in stores, yet the view is still strong and crisp. This is especially great when i put make-up on without wearing glasses!</li>
            <li> This mirror is really good except for the fact that it&#x27;s much larger than I expected. I didn&#x27;t really notice the size of it. I based it on the icon picture which seems very much like my smaller mirror. The 12x is very good. The suction cups on the back really do hold this thing in place. Sometimes too much; I&#x27;ve put it down on the counter for a brief minute and it sticks to the point I have to yank it off; which is a good thing I guess. I would recommend this mirror just remember it is 5&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving, would recommend it to anyone who wants to see what all there shaving up close glad I bought it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually bigger than I wanted it but that&#x27;s ok. It has perfect magnification and so far, I&#x27;m happy with the suction. I&#x27;ve gone through several other suction mirrors similar to this and they always fall and break. This looks like it has very good &amp;#34;staying&amp;#34; power. Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Works great on the bathroom mirror.  Second one I bought, because I broke the first one.</li>
            <li> stayed up for about 6 months before it fell off and broke but while it lasted image quality was good</li>
            <li> Too much magnification</li>
            <li> magnification is fantastic, secure fit onto mirror. seems well made, would recommend it, may get another one for a gift</li>
            <li> It sticks real well to my full length mirror I have hanging on my bathroom door. And, it works just as described on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Found stuff I didn&#x27;t know was there.....damn</li>
            <li> This product is grossly misrepresented.  It said it was 6.5&amp;#34; in diameter.  It is not.  It is 5 &amp;#34; in diameter and way too small.  You can see one eye at a time. Not what I was looking for.  I guess I will be looking for something that says 9&amp;#34; diameter, maybe then I&#x27;ll get at least a 7 inch diameter and I will be able to see my whole face.  Not happy with this product.  I am returning.</li>
            <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the selection of 12x or more magnifying mirrors with suction cups is pretty meager.  This one serves the purpose but at 5 inches in diameter, its &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; of clarity and magnification is quite small.  Most of the reflection you get is distorted</li>
            <li> Sticks  to our mirror well.  Never has fallen in a few months.</li>
            <li> I guess 12x power is a little more than I need/want.  Unless held close, distorts.</li>
            <li> This mirror is not a clear mirror.  It give you distorted facial features.  It doesn&#x27;t even appear to be 12x - more like 5x!  Not worth the money and too much hassle to return, and not usable.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve bought because I keep leaving them behind in hotel rooms!  I find this the perfect magnification for plucking.</li>
            <li> Bought this for traveling and it works perfect!!  Attaches easily to any spot you may need, as long as it is a smooth service!</li>
            <li> The magnification on this was a bit extreme.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Wow , now I can see more than I want to see! A great little item that really sticks to the mirror  and makes those stray hairs POP right out at you.</li>
            <li> Clear and in focus with great magnification.  A great help to my wife who has macular degeneration.</li>
            <li> I love using this mirror.  It makes seeing anthing on your face very clear.  The suction also sticks well and removes easily.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works perfectly. Glad I did the research before buying this product. Very pleased. A+</li>
            <li> Good magnification. Allows me to see my face close up without my glasses. But I subsequently saw it at the grocery store for $10.</li>
            <li> I bought two, one for myself and the other for my BFF. I&#x27;d simply attach it to the window pane where natural light is most adequate for grooming. Also I could bring it on my travel, it&#x27;d be a wonderful tool for a quick check of powder, lipstick and &amp;#34;spinach between the teeth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The suction cups don&#x27;t hold very well on glass.</li>
            <li> Once you hit 40 you really shouldn&#x27;t view yourself this close up.  Pores, stray hairs, eyeliner skips and newly formed wrinkles are no match for this little guy.  I stick it up in a spot on my medicine cabinet mirror and it helps me obsess every night over all the stuff going wrong.  It does the job with a low profile and price tag.  It was delivered in perfect condition and on time.  I highly recommend it too if you need a little help with putting on your eye makeup without your glasses.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be the same as one I had lost - but it is so much better with 2 ample suction cups to keep in attached to a larger mirror and the amplification is not blurry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t really suck all that well. It is in my basket of rarely used things. It wasn&#x27;t worth the cost to return it.</li>
            <li> This is the one you want.  It is clear and compact and undistorted.  Has two suction cups that help it stay up.  I thought it would be too big but I was surprised at its more compact size.  I bought several for home and travel.  I wish I had tried this one first.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little more magnified since it is advertised for brow tweezing, but it is sufficient</li>
            <li> Excellent mirror. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the magnification of this mirror.  I use a 10X in another brand and needed a bit stronger so tried this one.  it seems to have less power than my 10X.  It is smaller diameter so perhaps that alters the magnification factor.</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected...I wanted a mirror that would extend towards me not just stick to a wall or mirror.</li>
            <li> I can finally get all the boogies out of my nose.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, suction cups are just a little weak for holding it on anything other than smooth glass.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Arrived quickly and well-packaged.</li>
            <li> I wish the whole mirror were a bit larger but it is very useful.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror for traveling. Being in the airline industry this is a great mirror to have. It is just the right size for packing.</li>
            <li> This is the largest suction cup mirror I have found and the 12x is perfect for applying makeup or using tweezers.</li>
            <li> Great magnification but lousy suction cups.  Finally fell off the mirror one time too many and broke :-(</li>
            <li> great mirror.  i did get a great laugh.  the magnification was so strong i looked like an alien!</li>
            <li> This was just too much magnification for me. You can only see a small portion of your face. I put it in a drawwer in case I ever need it, but I don&#x27;t use it. It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my hubby and he loves it. Easily attaches to the mirror above his bathroom vanity and provides the perfect magnification to keep his beard nicely groomed.</li>
            <li> Suction cup works well, does the job</li>
            <li> Great for old men with tired eyes</li>
            <li> Best mirror ever!  After eye surgery, I couldn&#x27;t see close up anymore...this mirror does the trick!  Love it</li>
            <li> Great for spinning tops if you need a smooth surface with a light curve to the middle.</li>
            <li> Great mirror!  I suction-cupped it onto a &amp;#34;pull-out&amp;#34; mirror I have that also magnifies, but at a lesser level.  I can tweeze super easily and see so clearly what I&#x27;m doing.  Really great mirror and at a great price!</li>
            <li> Too small, but I made use of it.</li>
            <li> I purchased a lighted vanity mirror from Ikea. I love the way it looks and the lighting it gives, but was disappointed with the weak level of magnification. I applied the suction cup of this mirror right over one side of the Ikea mirror. Problem solved!</li>
            <li> This mirror is a great size. Perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;I hung it on the back door of my bathroom on the mirror that is already there. I needed magnification and this mirror does the job....&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Distortion personified! Returned the item immediately.</li>
            <li> Nice big mirror, good quality and the suction cups actually stick!</li>
            <li> Mirror is perfect size of 5 inches and has great optics. The mirror seems kind of cheaply made is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. I would buy it again.</li>
