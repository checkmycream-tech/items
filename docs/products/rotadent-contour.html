    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The plus side is that some people and dentists rave about the motion of this toothbrush as being the best there is.</li>
            <li>As a toothbrush its still the best I&#x27;ve found for managing gum issues.</li>
            <li>The Plus was the best.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST TOOTHBRUSH IN EXISTENCE.</li>
            <li>This is the best model.  </li>
            <li>Like the \\&quot;legacy\\&quot; or \\&quot;classic\\&quot; model, this one cleans teeth and gums marvelously.  </li>
            <li>but they are the best for teeth .</li>
            <li>It would be a perfect brush, but the charging stand is flimsy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a great Rotodent that I bought from a dentist that lasted for 10 years.  </li>
            <li>It had a great charger and a place to store your brushes.  </li>
            <li>Great service</li>
            <li>We&#x27;d both be happy.</li>
            <li>I think they are great.  </li>
            <li>We use 4 of them now, and everyone&#x27;s dental health has improved remarkably.</li>
            <li>Was expecting more impressive cleaning as well as smoother rotation.</li>
            <li>What good is an electric toothbrush if it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I used the Phillips and it was good - not circular though.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the good news.</li>
            <li>but it is a good product.</li>
            <li>the reviews are good and my wife loves hers.</li>
            <li>The original Rotadent is the best.</li>
            <li>was also happy with the warranty service and how quickly DenMat replaced my unit after 15 months, despite my problems with registration, they promptly called and followed-up, leaving me happy to keep this brand and keep going with it.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush has the best action of any electric toothbrush I think - circular is good.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>insufficient rotational power to work effectively</li>
            <li>I am hoping to get as good or better results from this Rotadent.  </li>
            <li>Used Rotadent Classic for many years and was very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I would not have bought a Rotadent based on these reviews alone, but even with it not living up to the first model and seeing how well it cleans, I am still happy with it and am considering buying three more for my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I all I can say is I&#x27;m glad I had bought it at the dentist&#x27;s office and got the warranty because I thought I was just a jinxed person.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush quit so many times</li>
            <li>But do they have better luck than me?</li>
            <li>They said that they did not send receipts but assured me that they keep excellent records and that it was not necessary.  </li>
            <li>Much better reputations</li>
            <li>My manual toothbrush works a million times better.  </li>
            <li>to add:  We have been using the Rotadent for most of the year</li>
            <li>and they informed me that it had been replaced with the Contour model and they would gladly send me one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the naysayers.</li>
            <li>More often than not, I would get a package that contained a defective brush</li>
            <li>The charger creates static on my bathroom radio.  </li>
            <li>I find it interesting that on eBay</li>
            <li>For the money could be better</li>
            <li>there a better brush than this one?</li>
            <li>Liked the original Rotodent better.</li>
            <li>One thing most folks don&#x27;t sem to notice is Zila&#x27;s (manufacturer) strong suggestion to fully discharge the battery every 3-4 months.</li>
            <li>Buy only from  someone with a very good return policy.</li>
            <li>I am glad Amazon still had them available since my dentist has discontinued carrying this item.</li>
            <li>I have a strong feeling there&#x27;re some user issues involved.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush, it&#x27;s the softest on your gums based on reviewing all the other popular brushes, and it has the most micro filaments for getting in and around the gums quickly.  </li>
            <li>Besides that, this toothbrush is good so far so upping it to 3 stars for now!</li>
            <li>Buy an Oral B for a fraction of the cost and enjoy.</li>
            <li>6/11/15 - So far so good.</li>
            <li>However, after asking my husband about his experience with the toothbrush and the brush head he was using, I determined that mine had been defective since my first use!!</li>
            <li>I could brush at my pace with the original.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I turn it on to use it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I have had the original Rotodent and the Plus Rotodent.  </li>
            <li>I had the original rotadent for a number of years, and when they came out with the newer Revolation</li>
            <li>It certainly works better than the original.</li>
            <li>Never had major problems but with all my Rotadents, my teeth and gums (especially) are in perfect shape.</li>
            <li>They have started to cheap out, way too much on this product!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the Contour long enough to pass an opinion; however, if it is anything like the  others I will be very happy.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you charge it for 24 hours prior to first use, it states this to get the most out of the battery.  </li>
            <li>The charging station is so flimsy you really have to push it firmly on a smooth countertop.</li>
            <li>And it stayed powerful too.</li>
            <li>This met my needs as a replacement for my old one which lasted for many years.  </li>
            <li>I  don,t like it as much as the original</li>
            <li>I returned this one right away.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s tempting to use it right away, but wait the 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>What I liked about the Phillips a lot is that it stayed charged a long time.</li>
            <li>I loved my first one, but the replacement ones are not worth anything.</li>
            <li>the outmoded old Classic model, if you can find and buy one (I did), is going for more $$ than the so called \\&quot;better\\&quot; Contour model.  </li>
            <li>I would have rated this 4 stars if it worked with international power as most electronic devices do these days.</li>
            <li>The Contour has performed much better than the Plus, but is still pretty pitiful overall.  </li>
            <li>I regretted the purchase after using the toothbrush for the first time.</li>
            <li>because when I talked about this with my dentist&#x27;s staff, they said that&#x27;s the consistent feedback they get.    </li>
            <li>First, it was an issue of the power button.  </li>
            <li>When a company discontinues something, they should be certain that customers will like the newer version (such as the Contour) better.</li>
            <li>pretty much suck at removing the chalk dust.  </li>
            <li>; Contour is more difficult to use, is cheaply made, and has just as many defective brushheads as the older versions.</li>
            <li>and I called Zila and reordered a new one so many times that I finally gave up and started using another electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The instructions are so basic you must go online to read any detailed information on how to use this thing.  </li>
            <li>If you apply a tad too much pressure it stops spinning.</li>
            <li>I really gave it all I could as it was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>It feels like one of those cheap plastic electric toothbrushes that you can get at your local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>The contacts were also a different type of material from my old unit, perhaps it is more water resistant?  </li>
            <li>Just this year, I&#x27;ve had THREE replacements,  &amp; the most recent one (one week old)</li>
            <li>Rodent sure beats any other electric brush and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li>Also, I received several faulty brush heads that didn&#x27;t work right out of the package ($30 for two!).</li>
            <li>The first two were the &#x27;Plus&#x27; model, both of which completely stopped working after about a month of use, and were replaced under warranty through my dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>Recently, when the original Rotadent would no longer hold a charge or power up, I contacted customer service and was told they would replace it with the new Rotadent Contour.</li>
            <li>Unless you have been following one of the top 3 essential oil scientists (for lack of better title) on fb or linkedin, just don&#x27;t buy essential oils, and for heaven&#x27;s sake NEVER INGEST ESSENTIAL OILS!!  </li>
            <li>The Contour works better than the older Rotadent I previously owned.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it so that we could use it at home and use the older one for travel.</li>
            <li>PLEASE CONTINUE TO MAKE THE ROTADENT CLASSIC.  </li>
            <li>The classic and plus models Maybe 6 .</li>
            <li>Very noisy, much more so than their previous models that did not last very long (4 - 6 months, at most).</li>
            <li>herbal oils only - essential oils are in so great demand that the quality is horrible at best !!!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it seems a little more robust than the older versions.</li>
            <li>Being a parent of a 17 and a 22 year old, I know that the Rotadent is much cheaper than filling cavities and dealing with gum issues.</li>
            <li>The old design made cleaning much easier.</li>
            <li>Really, the only positive thing I can offer is that the Contour is still &#x27;working&#x27; after 1 year.  </li>
            <li>It actually works pretty well as far as the goal of gently cleansing without damaging gums.  </li>
            <li>This last one seems like it will last a month, seems to be cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I thought that since it was brand new, direct from the manufacturer, it must be the way the new brush worked.</li>
            <li>(the Rotadent may not work long but at least it&#x27;s paid for) and low and behold - a new model they say is better than the old one is a available.</li>
            <li>I am surprised that a product is sold on Amazon without any warranty.</li>
            <li>It is extremely loud.  </li>
            <li>So far after a couple weeks I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Now that this has been fixed, the charge stand is flimsy.  </li>
            <li>On the second use, the device no longer generated enough power - on full charge - to rotate the standard head.</li>
            <li>The charger is a small donut design and is too light, e.g. it&#x27;s flimsy.</li>
            <li>I hunger for information about using this new toothbrush, yet only in the wrap around packing is a synopsis of its usage.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>I remove the brush with the new Contour when I&#x27;m finished or can it be left on?</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it seems that science is finding out that a lot of illness comes from bad oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>The straight brush heads are more difficult to use than the well designs angled brushes.  </li>
            <li>Now I have the contour model and Amazon wants 21$ to replace a single head.</li>
            <li>This is not the same old product it used to be, so beware!</li>
            <li>I believe my general health has improved since using a Roatadent.</li>
            <li>Even my Dentist&#x27;s staff, who all use them, hadn&#x27;t read the instructions far enough to notice that.</li>
            <li>By running my tongue along the teeth I have never felt such a complete cleaning.</li>
            <li>$16 later and about two weeks later, my new replacement came in.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so much bad information out there that can cause so much damage thanks to the zillion or so MLMs and over-zealous healthy spokespeople who have zero science training or academic knowledge of essential oils.</li>
            <li>On and off button is more difficult to use than the old model.</li>

            <li> Unless you have been following one of the top 3 essential oil scientists (for lack of better title) on fb or linkedin, just don&#x27;t buy essential oils, and for heaven&#x27;s sake NEVER INGEST ESSENTIAL OILS!!  </li>
            <li> The Contour works better than the older Rotadent I previously owned.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it so that we could use it at home and use the older one for travel.</li>
            <li> PLEASE CONTINUE TO MAKE THE ROTADENT CLASSIC.  </li>
            <li> The classic and plus models Maybe 6 .</li>
            <li> Very noisy, much more so than their previous models that did not last very long (4 - 6 months, at most).</li>
            <li> herbal oils only - essential oils are in so great demand that the quality is horrible at best !!!  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it seems a little more robust than the older versions.</li>
            <li> Being a parent of a 17 and a 22 year old, I know that the Rotadent is much cheaper than filling cavities and dealing with gum issues.</li>
            <li> The old design made cleaning much easier.</li>
            <li> Really, the only positive thing I can offer is that the Contour is still &#x27;working&#x27; after 1 year.  </li>
            <li> It actually works pretty well as far as the goal of gently cleansing without damaging gums.  </li>
            <li> This last one seems like it will last a month, seems to be cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I thought that since it was brand new, direct from the manufacturer, it must be the way the new brush worked.</li>
            <li> (the Rotadent may not work long but at least it&#x27;s paid for) and low and behold - a new model they say is better than the old one is a available.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that a product is sold on Amazon without any warranty.</li>
            <li> It is extremely loud.  </li>
            <li> So far after a couple weeks I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Now that this has been fixed, the charge stand is flimsy.  </li>
            <li> On the second use, the device no longer generated enough power - on full charge - to rotate the standard head.</li>
            <li> The charger is a small donut design and is too light, e.g. it&#x27;s flimsy.</li>
            <li> I hunger for information about using this new toothbrush, yet only in the wrap around packing is a synopsis of its usage.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> I remove the brush with the new Contour when I&#x27;m finished or can it be left on?</li>
            <li> And most importantly, it seems that science is finding out that a lot of illness comes from bad oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> The straight brush heads are more difficult to use than the well designs angled brushes.  </li>
            <li> Now I have the contour model and Amazon wants 21$ to replace a single head.</li>
            <li> This is not the same old product it used to be, so beware!</li>
            <li> I believe my general health has improved since using a Roatadent.</li>
            <li> Even my Dentist&#x27;s staff, who all use them, hadn&#x27;t read the instructions far enough to notice that.</li>
            <li> By running my tongue along the teeth I have never felt such a complete cleaning.</li>
            <li> $16 later and about two weeks later, my new replacement came in.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much bad information out there that can cause so much damage thanks to the zillion or so MLMs and over-zealous healthy spokespeople who have zero science training or academic knowledge of essential oils.</li>
            <li> On and off button is more difficult to use than the old model.</li>
            <li> This new brush would only have a 4 year warranty, instead of the lifetime warranty previously offered</li>
            <li> Old design is what made the difference between Rotadent and other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> (Rotadent has been purchased by a new company that will no longer honor the lifetime warranty on previously purchased products) For the Contour the quality has been dramatically reduced.</li>
            <li> and although I&#x27;ve had a few problems (defective brushes, dead battery once), they&#x27;ve always replaced things quickly and without question.</li>
            <li> Because unfortunately I haven&#x27;t been able to find a toothbrush that cleans my teeth as effectively as this one does, no matter how bad the quality of the product is.</li>
            <li> No way would it last that long.  </li>
            <li> but they do not last long.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to read so many poor reviews and was seriously considering not purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a Rotadent  as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> DenMat, the company that manufactures it replaced it without question for a nominal shipping charge with my receipt from the dental office, even though it was not properly registered due to a problem with the post office</li>
            <li> Keep the charging contacts dry, if they sit in a puddle of water all the time eventually they will rust out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third Rotadent in less than a year.</li>
            <li> I mean loud!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush uses different brush heads than the Rotadent Plus, which sucks, because I had several packages of brush heads.</li>
            <li> but there would be a minimal shipping charge of $16.85.</li>
            <li> I find customer service to be very nice; it&#x27;s the product that is terrible.</li>
            <li> The user instructions are pretty much worthless in that the user is left to kind of trial and error about the blasted thing.  </li>
            <li> The new contour has a smaller base and is much easier to tip over.</li>
            <li> I have owned various models of Rotadent for the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> (the USPS sent back the warranty card stating the size of the warranty card was too small to mail).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In every other respect, it is not as desirable.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been brushing with a mix of coconut oil and peppermint oil -- NOTE:  NOT AN ESSENTIAL OIL.  </li>
            <li> I do not understand the negative reviews, especially regarding their customer service.</li>
            <li> Their quality has gone down hill, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Wipe it down after each use.  </li>
            <li> This will prevent water from dripping down the brush and puddling, which rusts out the charging contacts.  </li>
            <li> Water drips down the unit into the charger - rotting out the connectors and making a shock hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now less than two months after purchase the unit stopped working.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s timed for two and a half minutes.  </li>
            <li> The charger is a piece of junk compared to previous models.  </li>
            <li> I just got sent the Contour as a replacement for the previous model that died.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to purchase a Rotadent for several years and was unable to because they were sold only by dentists.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing when you can easily spend over $30 for two brush heads.</li>
            <li> I regret that I wasted money on this toothbrush and the previous version.</li>
            <li> Consider the landfill waste (it should be disposed of in electronic waste which is yet another thing to add to the list of to dos).</li>
            <li> What a waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The marketplace is a harsh, but reliable, judge of product value.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Rotodent I&#x27;ve bought from Zila that is useless.  </li>
            <li> They told me about the Rotadent which I wanted to buy (anything to help with my teeth is a no-brainer) but they still pulled out a small chalk board with some chalk on it and had me hold a Sonic tooth brush and then a Rotadent toothbrush on the board to see for myself which one cleaned off the chalk.  </li>
            <li> As the &#x27;Plus&#x27; was discontinued, I received the &#x27;Contour&#x27; as a warranty replacement for my second failed toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I find I need to wrap my hand around it and pull hard in order to disconnect the brush from the handle.</li>
            <li> I have a habit of brushing my teeth too hard and it wore away my gum.</li>
            <li> WHen the brush is attached to the handle, it loses power.  </li>
            <li> But my biggest complaint is still the brush heads.</li>
            <li> With this new design, it turns off every 2 minutes which is very inconvenient.    </li>
            <li> The Zila company should be fined for contributing to useless waste.</li>
            <li> It is hard to turn on and the stand it junkie!</li>
            <li> It fits poorly inside the recharger too.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how much people hate this product!  </li>
            <li> Between taking care of the brush and DenMat standing behind it, I don&#x27;t see any reason to run away.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute worst toothbrush EVER.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t work for them or have anything to do with them; I just hate to see people missing out due to unwarranted lousy (uninformed?) reviews.</li>
            <li> The new model is terrible.  </li>
            <li> When you put it in your mouth to brush your teeth it vibrates your head so hard it is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> the battery failed and they do not have my warranty registration but told me that if my dentist provided a receipt that they would honor the warranty.  </li>
            <li> ; sorry, unfortunately, we can not replace the battery.</li>
            <li> Also I noticed that the switch was difficult to engage.</li>
            <li> It was sad to see the Sonic brand (the one I had been using for years)</li>
            <li> Online warranty was also difficult too, and  I had to call an operator to get it done.</li>
            <li> Too expensive to replace that often</li>
            <li> The brush heads are expensive, and are inconsistent.  </li>
            <li> The Contour is the third Rotadent toothbrush I have owned, and I consider it to be the worst of the three.</li>
            <li> Removing the brush heads is also extremely difficult.</li>
            <li> An expensive thing to keep on account that you have to keep replacing</li>
            <li> The motor is dreadfully underpowered and shuts off under minimal loading.  </li>

            <li> For both versions, I was always unhappy with the quality of the brushes, because they always seemed to be defective.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the charger base.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have not used the Contour model yet. Just got it and am charging it. I all I can say is I&#x27;m glad I had bought it at the dentist&#x27;s office and got the warranty because I thought I was just a jinxed person. The toothbrush quit so many times and I called Zila and reordered a new one so many times that I finally gave up and started using another electric toothbrush. Consider the landfill waste (it should be disposed of in electronic waste which is yet another thing to add to the list of to dos). The Zila company should be fined for contributing to useless waste. So I finally called them when my trusty electric toothbrush finally quit (the Rotadent may not work long but at least it&#x27;s paid for) and low and behold - a new model they say is better than the old one is a available. The plus side is that some people and dentists rave about the motion of this toothbrush as being the best there is. But do they have better luck than me? What good is an electric toothbrush if it doesn&#x27;t work.  6/11/15 - So far so good. The toothbrush has the best action of any electric toothbrush I think - circular is good. I used the Phillips and it was good - not circular though. What I liked about the Phillips a lot is that it stayed charged a long time. If I went away for the weekend or even the week (heck probably 2 weeks) the toothbrush stayed charged. Never brought a charger with me on short trips. And it stayed powerful too. With the Rotadent you have to bring the charger. It will not do as well even the next day. It needs continual charging. I wish they could improve that. Besides that, this toothbrush is good so far so upping it to 3 stars for now! Let&#x27;s see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Rota-dent refused to honor their lifetime warranty on the battery.  I purchased two Rota-Dents from my dentist about 3-4 years ago and Rota-dent promised a lifetime warranty on the battery if I turned in my warranty registration before their specified deadline.  Can&#x27;t remember, might have been within 30 days of purchase.  I called and asked them before sending in my warranty registration card if somehow I could get a confirmation.  They said that they did not send receipts but assured me that they keep excellent records and that it was not necessary.  Guess what....the battery failed and they do not have my warranty registration but told me that if my dentist provided a receipt that they would honor the warranty.  My dentist retired and I no longer have access to my file.  Bottom line; sorry, unfortunately, we can not replace the battery.</li>
            <li> Very noisy, much more so than their previous models that did not last very long (4 - 6 months, at most). Also I noticed that the switch was difficult to engage. The switch was the main culprit on my previous Rotadent&#x27;s. I returned this one right away.  I am going with Oral B or Sonicare. Much better reputations and, I understand they even have a warranty that they honor!</li>
            <li> I would have rated this 4 stars if it worked with international power as most electronic devices do these days. Otherwise, it seems a little more robust than the older versions. The carrying case is a nice feature. As a toothbrush its still the best I&#x27;ve found for managing gum issues.</li>
            <li> The original Rotadent is the best. I could brush at my pace with the original. This 2013 model shuts off too soon. I have to turn it on again 3-4 times.</li>
            <li> WHen the brush is attached to the handle, it loses power.  My manual toothbrush works a million times better.  I&#x27;ve had a great Rotodent that I bought from a dentist that lasted for 10 years.  This is the 2nd Rotodent I&#x27;ve bought from Zila that is useless.  I&#x27;ve tried different heads to no avail.  It&#x27;s a dud.</li>
            <li> I just bought one thru my biological dentist..now that I know the difference between a regular dentist and a biological one I will never go back to a regular dentist!  They told me about the Rotadent which I wanted to buy (anything to help with my teeth is a no-brainer) but they still pulled out a small chalk board with some chalk on it and had me hold a Sonic tooth brush and then a Rotadent toothbrush on the board to see for myself which one cleaned off the chalk.  It was sad to see the Sonic brand (the one I had been using for years) pretty much suck at removing the chalk dust.  I would not have bought a Rotadent based on these reviews alone, but even with it not living up to the first model and seeing how well it cleans, I am still happy with it and am considering buying three more for my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit to add:  We have been using the Rotadent for most of the year and I can&#x27;t complain!  I have bought one set of toothbrush heads because we share two bases among four of us.  Lately, I&#x27;ve been brushing with a mix of coconut oil and peppermint oil -- NOTE:  NOT AN ESSENTIAL OIL.  I buy herbal oils only - essential oils are in so great demand that the quality is horrible at best !!!  Unless you have been following one of the top 3 essential oil scientists (for lack of better title) on fb or linkedin, just don&#x27;t buy essential oils, and for heaven&#x27;s sake NEVER INGEST ESSENTIAL OILS!!  There&#x27;s so much bad information out there that can cause so much damage thanks to the zillion or so MLMs and over-zealous healthy spokespeople who have zero science training or academic knowledge of essential oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this product two months ago. After two weeks a piece fell out of the charging base. Unit kept working with lights flashing all the while. Now less than two months after purchase the unit stopped working. I called the manufacturer only to find out that there is no warranty unless one purchases it from a dentist. I am surprised that a product is sold on Amazon without any warranty. I would not recommend this product or the supplier.</li>
            <li> I have owned various models of Rotadent for the past 15 years. This contour model is the worst piece of junk ever. My Rotadent Plus gave out and of course it has a lifetime warranty. So I contacted a Rotadent and they informed me that it had been replaced with the Contour model and they would gladly send me one but there would be a minimal shipping charge of $16.85. I agreed. They should have paid me $16.95 to take this piece of junk. By the way Rotadent is no longer owned by Zila. They are now owned by Den Mat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Contour and charged it for the recommended 24 hours before using. The charging station is so flimsy you really have to push it firmly on a smooth countertop. There is no place to store extra brush heads.  The instructions are so basic you must go online to read any detailed information on how to use this thing.  Okay, so I turn it on to use it for the first time.  It is extremely loud.  I mean loud! When you put it in your mouth to brush your teeth it vibrates your head so hard it is very uncomfortable. And the loudness intensifies. If you apply a tad too much pressure it stops spinning. Oh, and you must use gel toothpaste. Something you have to read on their website. This information is not in the packaging.  Rotadents always had a lifetime warranty if you purchased them through a dentist office, which I always did. This one only has a 4 year warranty. No kidding!  No way would it last that long.  Besides who could use this beast?  Not me. Mine is in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor, DO NOT BUY IS PRODUCT. it is junk.</li>
            <li> The new contour has a smaller base and is much easier to tip over. It fits poorly inside the recharger too. The package does not even come with instructions, or a warranty card. They have started to cheap out, way too much on this product! Online warranty was also difficult too, and  I had to call an operator to get it done. Buy it only from a dentist, &amp;#34;that allows you to return it&amp;#34;, i.e. assuming you don&#x27;t use it or put it  in your mouth. This is not the same old product it used to be, so beware! Their quality has gone down hill, in my opinion. Buy only from  someone with a very good return policy. You&#x27;ve been warned!</li>
            <li> The Contour works better than the older Rotadent I previously owned.  I was surprised to read so many poor reviews and was seriously considering not purchasing this product.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the naysayers.</li>
            <li> This company just cannot produce a reliable product. My fifth brush gave out on me this week. I have finally given up... Please avoid at all cost. I really gave it all I could as it was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th and last brush. My teeth never felt cleaner but they always break after a couple months! (the Rotadent that is, not my teeth) Too expensive to replace that often</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how much people hate this product!  It actually works pretty well as far as the goal of gently cleansing without damaging gums.  But you cannot get service.  The flimsy charger that came with the Contour that my dentist sold me for $185.00, falied within 2 months.  One of the two tiny foil contacts just fell off.  People complain that no one calls back from customer service.  I cannot even find a number for customer service or for any source for a replacement charger.  What now, anybody??</li>
            <li> Battery died after like a month of using it and could not get a refund. What a waste of money</li>
            <li> I have had the original Rotodent and the Plus Rotodent.  The Plus was the best.  It had a great charger and a place to store your brushes.  When my Plus died I ordered the Contour.  It is the worst brush ever.  I don&#x27;t even get to all my teeth and the brush shuts off. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s timed for two and a half minutes.  Plus it sounds like it is going to die any minute.  The charger is a piece of junk compared to previous models.  Wish they would bring the plus model back.  This Contour is total junk for the price.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd rotodent tooth brush. I loved my first one, but the replacement ones are not worth anything. This last one seems like it will last a month, seems to be cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Liked the original Rotodent better. The warrantee stinks as it&#x27;s void since I didn&#x27;t buy this through my dentist. My dental hygienist recommended a child&#x27;s G.U.M electric tooth brush, will try that next time. 6.00$</li>
            <li> I just got sent the Contour as a replacement for the previous model that died. But it wasn&#x27;t the brush/handle&#x27;s fault. Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using Rotadents for probably 6 years (?) and although I&#x27;ve had a few problems (defective brushes, dead battery once), they&#x27;ve always replaced things quickly and without question. All that aside THIS IS THE BEST TOOTHBRUSH IN EXISTENCE. I know because of what it&#x27;s done for my dental health. Never had major problems but with all my Rotadents, my teeth and gums (especially) are in perfect shape. Was never so with Sonicaire, or Oral B before that. I do not understand the negative reviews, especially regarding their customer service. I have a strong feeling there&#x27;re some user issues involved. One thing most folks don&#x27;t sem to notice is Zila&#x27;s (manufacturer) strong suggestion to fully discharge the battery every 3-4 months. Even my Dentist&#x27;s staff, who all use them, hadn&#x27;t read the instructions far enough to notice that. We use 4 of them now, and everyone&#x27;s dental health has improved remarkably. Being a parent of a 17 and a 22 year old, I know that the Rotadent is much cheaper than filling cavities and dealing with gum issues. And most importantly, it seems that science is finding out that a lot of illness comes from bad oral hygiene. I believe my general health has improved since using a Roatadent. I don&#x27;t work for them or have anything to do with them; I just hate to see people missing out due to unwarranted lousy (uninformed?) reviews.</li>
            <li> $16 later and about two weeks later, my new replacement came in. It certainly works better than the original. By running my tongue along the teeth I have never felt such a complete cleaning. That&#x27;s the good news. My complaints are the following: trying to open the white styrene case can be a challenge at times. There is no wall mount lmplied. The charger is a small donut design and is too light, e.g. it&#x27;s flimsy. As a tooth brush it&#x27;s cleaning power is second to none, yet I feel they didn&#x27;t do their homework on the rest. I hunger for information about using this new toothbrush, yet only in the wrap around packing is a synopsis of its usage.&lt;br /&gt;Must I remove the brush with the new Contour when I&#x27;m finished or can it be left on? Is there a stand for extra brushes? Is there a wall mount? Does it recharge continuously or must I remove the charger plug? These are some of the questions I have.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they don&#x27;t know either.</li>
            <li> This is my third Rotadent.  The first two were the &#x27;Plus&#x27; model, both of which completely stopped working after about a month of use, and were replaced under warranty through my dentist&#x27;s office.  As the &#x27;Plus&#x27; was discontinued, I received the &#x27;Contour&#x27; as a warranty replacement for my second failed toothbrush.  The Contour has performed much better than the Plus, but is still pretty pitiful overall.  The brush heads are expensive, and are inconsistent.  The motor is dreadfully underpowered and shuts off under minimal loading.  Really, the only positive thing I can offer is that the Contour is still &#x27;working&#x27; after 1 year.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The Contour is the third Rotadent toothbrush I have owned, and I consider it to be the worst of the three. I had the original rotadent for a number of years, and when they came out with the newer Revolation I purchased it so that we could use it at home and use the older one for travel. For both versions, I was always unhappy with the quality of the brushes, because they always seemed to be defective. More often than not, I would get a package that contained a defective brush and I would need to battle with customer service for replacements. Very disappointing when you can easily spend over $30 for two brush heads. Recently, when the original Rotadent would no longer hold a charge or power up, I contacted customer service and was told they would replace it with the new Rotadent Contour. This new brush would only have a 4 year warranty, instead of the lifetime warranty previously offered (Rotadent has been purchased by a new company that will no longer honor the lifetime warranty on previously purchased products) For the Contour the quality has been dramatically reduced. It feels like one of those cheap plastic electric toothbrushes that you can get at your local pharmacy. Removing the brush heads is also extremely difficult. With the Revolation, it was a simple turn and pull, but to remove a brush head from the Contour I find I need to wrap my hand around it and pull hard in order to disconnect the brush from the handle. But my biggest complaint is still the brush heads. Whenever I would put the slightest bit of pressure on the brush of the Contour it would stop rotating. I thought that since it was brand new, direct from the manufacturer, it must be the way the new brush worked. However, after asking my husband about his experience with the toothbrush and the brush head he was using, I determined that mine had been defective since my first use!! So the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; Contour is more difficult to use, is cheaply made, and has just as many defective brushheads as the older versions. Why do I stay with Rotadent? Because unfortunately I haven&#x27;t been able to find a toothbrush that cleans my teeth as effectively as this one does, no matter how bad the quality of the product is.</li>
            <li> I  don,t like it as much as the original but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> This is the best model.  Great service</li>
            <li> Used Rotadent Classic for many years and was very happy with the product.  The new model is terrible.  Old design is what made the difference between Rotadent and other electric toothbrushes.  The old design made cleaning much easier. With this new design, it turns off every 2 minutes which is very inconvenient.    On and off button is more difficult to use than the old model. The straight brush heads are more difficult to use than the well designs angled brushes.  PLEASE CONTINUE TO MAKE THE ROTADENT CLASSIC.  I will not use this product again.  Extremely disappointed.  Would have been a life time consumer and recommended the product but not anymore.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the charger base. It should be wider to prevent the toothbrush from tipping over.</li>
            <li> This met my needs as a replacement for my old one which lasted for many years.  I am glad Amazon still had them available since my dentist has discontinued carrying this item.</li>
            <li> Product is one of the worst I&#x27;ve owned. On the second use, the device no longer generated enough power - on full charge - to rotate the standard head. On the 25th use or so, the second head cracked. Aside from faulty heads, the battery struggles to hold a charge. Buy an Oral B for a fraction of the cost and enjoy.</li>
            <li> insufficient rotational power to work effectively</li>
            <li> This is a great brush, it&#x27;s the softest on your gums based on reviewing all the other popular brushes, and it has the most micro filaments for getting in and around the gums quickly.  As others have stated it has some quality issues, but none that can&#x27;t be prevented. I had to replace mine after 15 months because it came apart at the handle and the charging contacts rusted out. DenMat, the company that manufactures it replaced it without question for a nominal shipping charge with my receipt from the dental office, even though it was not properly registered due to a problem with the post office (the USPS sent back the warranty card stating the size of the warranty card was too small to mail).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1) Make sure you charge it for 24 hours prior to first use, it states this to get the most out of the battery.  It comes charged out of the box so it&#x27;s tempting to use it right away, but wait the 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;2) Wipe it down after each use.  If you continually leave water on it over time it will degrade the glue in the handle.&lt;br /&gt;3) Keep the charging contacts dry, if they sit in a puddle of water all the time eventually they will rust out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to see the replacement unit has suction contacts on the charging base now to keep it elevated from water.  This will prevent water from dripping down the brush and puddling, which rusts out the charging contacts.  The contacts were also a different type of material from my old unit, perhaps it is more water resistant?  This should handle issue #3 above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also happy with the warranty service and how quickly DenMat replaced my unit after 15 months, despite my problems with registration, they promptly called and followed-up, leaving me happy to keep this brand and keep going with it.  I notice it has a 4 year warranty. Between taking care of the brush and DenMat standing behind it, I don&#x27;t see any reason to run away.</li>
            <li> I wish Amazon offered the opportunity to rate a product with ZERO stars.  This is the absolute worst toothbrush EVER.  I truly wish I had my money back, and the developer for rotadrn r had this toothbrush up his/her ass.  We&#x27;d both be happy.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever.  Just this year, I&#x27;ve had THREE replacements,  &amp; the most recent one (one week old) isn&#x27;t working properly.  The battery &amp; battery charger system is the problem.  I find customer service to be very nice; it&#x27;s the product that is terrible.</li>
            <li> Water drips down the unit into the charger - rotting out the connectors and making a shock hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasted for six months.</li>
            <li> It is hard to turn on and the stand it junkie!</li>
            <li> I have a habit of brushing my teeth too hard and it wore away my gum. My dentist recommended this brush to me and I won&#x27;t use anything else but this from now on. The only thing is it is not warranty by the manufacturer if you purchase the brush somewhere else beside on their website or at the dentist office.</li>
            <li> This is the worst toothbrush I have ever used. I bought the Rotadent Plus on a whim from my dentist&#x27;s office. I regretted the purchase after using the toothbrush for the first time. Also, I received several faulty brush heads that didn&#x27;t work right out of the package ($30 for two!). After a while, the Rotadent Plus stopped working. I called Customer Service (DenMat) and they told me they would send out a replacement. The Rotadent Plus was discontinued and replaced with this toothbrush. This toothbrush uses different brush heads than the Rotadent Plus, which sucks, because I had several packages of brush heads. DenMat charged me $16 to ship this toothbrush. When I received it, I read all of the instructions, and charged it properly. The brush spins, until it touches my teeth, and then it does nothing. I find myself brushing my teeth manually, after trying to use this toothbrush. Also, it needs to be charged constantly. I will never purchase another Rotadent product! NEVER! I regret that I wasted money on this toothbrush and the previous version. Buy a Sonicare instead!</li>
            <li> Like the \\&quot;legacy\\&quot; or \\&quot;classic\\&quot; model, this one cleans teeth and gums marvelously.  In every other respect, it is not as desirable. Doesn&#x27;t hold the charge as well.  The charger creates static on my bathroom radio.  The variable speeds are simply a nuisance.  The user instructions are pretty much worthless in that the user is left to kind of trial and error about the blasted thing.  When a company discontinues something, they should be certain that customers will like the newer version (such as the Contour) better. I don&#x27;t think I will be in the minority here, because when I talked about this with my dentist&#x27;s staff, they said that&#x27;s the consistent feedback they get.    I find it interesting that on eBay the outmoded old Classic model, if you can find and buy one (I did), is going for more $$ than the so called \\&quot;better\\&quot; Contour model.  The marketplace is a harsh, but reliable, judge of product value.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Rotadent  as long as I can remember.  I just received the contour and I like it except for the charging stand.  This is probably my 8th Rotadent.  I think they are great.  I haven&#x27;t had the Contour long enough to pass an opinion; however, if it is anything like the  others I will be very happy.  Rodent sure beats any other electric brush and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Millie ,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third Rotadent in less than a year. The Rotadent Zila did a thorough job of cleaning my teeth but they do not last long. Now I have the contour model and Amazon wants 21$ to replace a single head. The heads generally last about three weeks in my experience. I&#x27;m going to try a Phillips Sonicare next time... the reviews are good and my wife loves hers. Stay away from Rotadent.</li>
            <li> Was expecting more impressive cleaning as well as smoother rotation. For the money could be better</li>
            <li> Had 4-5 rotadents. The classic and plus models Maybe 6 . They don&#x27;t last but they are the best for teeth . An expensive thing to keep on account that you have to keep replacing&lt;br /&gt;Is there a better brush than this one?</li>
            <li> I have been trying to purchase a Rotadent for several years and was unable to because they were sold only by dentists.  I am hoping to get as good or better results from this Rotadent.  So far after a couple weeks I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> It would be a perfect brush, but the charging stand is flimsy.  I purchased an Oral B and have had it for years.  This is my 5th Rotadent.  First, it was an issue of the power button.  Now that this has been fixed, the charge stand is flimsy.  I wish they would follow the lead of Oral B and make their product to last.</li>
