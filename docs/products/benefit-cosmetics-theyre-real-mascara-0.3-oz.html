            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Save your money, drugstore brands are better</li>
            <li>It is mandatory that it stands up and is kept in a nice cool room temperature or the mascara gel will be gooky causing gook.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell as I&#x27;m new to the product and had just heard so many great things about it.</li>
            <li>Great seller replies back rite away.</li>
            <li>Of course I wish it were cheaper, but it is still worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Even though it is pricey, it is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I also love that it stays on throughout the day, but comes off easily with my facial cleansing cloths.</li>
            <li>had it within a few days and even got it at a great price.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>first tried it from Sephora as a bestseller trial size kit.</li>
            <li>This is not the real thing!</li>
            <li>I have bought this mascara several times before from Sephora, and you can&#x27;t convince me that this is authentic.</li>
            <li>I have used many different kinds of mascara but have never found one that even comes close to this one.  </li>
            <li>The formula is very sticky and my lashes get stuck together.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for delivering the product just like you described.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really thought BENEFIT didn&#x27;t do as all on this product as they have on all the rest ones..</li>
            <li>By far, Benefit They&#x27;re Real!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken more than usual.</li>
            <li>The texture is different than the real Benefit mascara.</li>
            <li>I put this mascara on, continued to get ready, came back to do my eyeshadow 5 minutes later...</li>
            <li>The brush is different, the mascara stays wet FOREVER, and it does not give the same volume the real product does.</li>
            <li>The color of the container is slightly darker than the real one, and the sticker on the bottom is different.</li>
            <li>I bought it under the high recommendation of a friend and thought it to perform only mildly above average.</li>

            <li> perfect item excellent shipping time!!</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt. Product itself was disappointing. I bought it under the high recommendation of a friend and thought it to perform only mildly above average. May have actually arrived a little on the dry side? Can&#x27;t really tell as I&#x27;m new to the product and had just heard so many great things about it.</li>
            <li> All I have to say this is the best mascara I have ever used.I have tried most mascara out there but none can do anything for lashes like this one.</li>
            <li> The best mascara ever!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this mascara!  Have used others, but keep coming back to this!</li>
            <li> excellent worth getting it lasts all day and evening</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara from Sephora, loved it, so purchased it here because it was cheaper (~$16). Well that was a mistake. The brush is different, the mascara stays wet FOREVER, and it does not give the same volume the real product does. I put this mascara on, continued to get ready, came back to do my eyeshadow 5 minutes later...still wet. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> By far, Benefit They&#x27;re Real! Mascara is the best mascara I have ever used. It thickens and extends my lashes flawlessly. I will be a lifetime customer!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I first tried it from Sephora as a bestseller trial size kit. Therefore, I have tried the best of the best. This was and is the BEST!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product through my local chain store before and I&#x27;ve been happy with it.  But its hard to rate this product through Amazon when I&#x27;ve never received it.  The vendor that said they sent it, but I&#x27;ve never received it is not worth buying from again.  I will go back to purchasing it from my local vendor from now on.</li>
            <li> This is not the real thing! The texture is different than the real Benefit mascara. I compared the one I bought at Sephora and this one.  The color of the container is slightly darker than the real one, and the sticker on the bottom is different. I have bought this mascara several times before from Sephora, and you can&#x27;t convince me that this is authentic. What&#x27;s funny is that you can buy the real thing at Sephora for less than what you pay on here for a fake one!</li>
            <li> Great mascara. It is mandatory that it stands up and is kept in a nice cool room temperature or the mascara gel will be gooky causing gook.</li>
            <li> Love it. I plan to re-order</li>
            <li> i was very excited but was disappointed. The formula is very sticky and my lashes get stuck together. Plus  The stopper that removes the excess formula from the wand pops out, so often I pull out the wand to find massive amounts of excess glook stuck to the mascara brush. Save your money, drugstore brands are better</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara! It is a bit pricey but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This was a product that I have been looking for for awhile.  When I found that this person sold it, I was so excited.&lt;br /&gt;I had it within a few days and even got it at a great price.  Thanks so much for delivering the product just like you described.</li>
            <li> Great product does what it should do.</li>
            <li> this stuff is too wet and takes too long to dry, it is all over my eyelids</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never bother using anything else.  This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even dry. Makes a mess. Doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken more than usual.</li>
            <li> This mascara is by far the best I have ever used. It separates my eye lashes, lengthens them, and adds product without it being clumpy. I also the color of the black. My eye lashes are left long and soft and people often make comments asking if they are fake. I also love that it stays on throughout the day, but comes off easily with my facial cleansing cloths. I have used this mascara for about 3 years now and have no desire to change. I recommend it to everyone. Of course I wish it were cheaper, but it is still worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is amazing mascara!  I have used many different kinds of mascara but have never found one that even comes close to this one.  Even though it is pricey, it is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  I bought one for my daughter and me.  It is the best mascara we have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Great seller replies back rite away. I really thought BENEFIT didn&#x27;t do as all on this product as they have on all the rest ones..Again.5***** seller</li>
