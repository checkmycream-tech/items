            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Years ago i had  a chillow that was great.</li>
            <li>Better than jewley, believe it or not!!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better offsleeping with an ice pack wrapped in a towel!!</li>
            <li>Good concept----way cheat product.</li>
            <li>I have night sweats and the chillow helps me to have a good nights sleep.</li>
            <li>honestly can&#x27;t imagine sleeping without my Chillow.</li>
            <li>I am so glad it turned out to be the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; kind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the best way is to drain the water, and put my finger inside and move the foam back in place.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Chillow Pillow for years now and just love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many a chilow over the years.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I used to LOVE my Chillows.</li>
            <li>I  do not hate the product,but I used it for afew days and the belt started to shred!  </li>
            <li>it is nice and cool with the fan blowing on it.</li>
            <li>It stays cool and allows me to stay so comfortable that I am sleeping much better!  </li>
            <li>My 7 year old son thinks it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>it stays cool for WEEKS!</li>
            <li>The instructions say this is &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; to fix, but their method isn&#x27;t easy and doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t comfortable.  </li>
            <li>guess is that now they are made cheaply in China or they are skimping on productions.</li>
            <li>They should send someone out free of charge to fix their mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The chillow does feel cool and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>However, in the past, I&#x27;ve ordered the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; and it was perfect!</li>
            <li>I wanted another Chillow to use on my back because my first one works so great.  </li>
            <li>the pillow stays cool all night.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t stay cool</li>
            <li>He love it so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough to fall asleep however so meets the need.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it just doesn&#x27;t stay cool</li>
            <li>and it does not stay cool.  </li>
            <li>This pillow will keep your head cool while you sleep.  </li>
            <li>, so I called and they gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li>When activated, it weighs about 5 pounds, so when I placed it on top of my feather pillows, they were compressed them much.</li>
            <li>If you examine it every week or so, you can see the tears and put a drop of super glue on them.  </li>
            <li>they quickly sent another.</li>
            <li>It does cool some, but as others have said it only absorbs heat for a while and then becomes warm in that spot.</li>
            <li>I was really happy to receive this as a Christmas gift but the cap does not seal well and the chillow leaks...slowly...but who wants a wet bed?</li>
            <li>It works great when new and it does stay cool although after a few days it bunches up in side with no way to effectively smooth out for practical use.  </li>
            <li>If you do not have a sense of smell this might be the right thing for you.  </li>
            <li>It leaked immediately - water would just run right out the sides.</li>
            <li>First of all, I put it directly on top of my pillow and sleep with my head directly on it.  </li>
            <li>I will say the product has helped me greatly now waking up no more than twice as oppose to every 1-2 hours nightly.  </li>
            <li>This pillow does keep my head cool, but it off-gasses so much that I can&#x27;t sleep because my pillow smells like plastic.</li>
            <li>It really does stay cool.</li>
            <li>I ordered several more.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 of these, hoping the problem I had with the first one was just an isolated incident.</li>
            <li>I am menopausal at 36 suffering from hot flashes.</li>
            <li>I can not sleep at night for having hot flashes, I ordered the Chillow Cooling Pillow and it has helped.</li>
            <li>and I am hot.</li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift to a friend who was hot flashing.</li>
            <li>for the first 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>A girlfriend who I work with is always hot at night.  </li>
            <li>When I wake w/a hot flash, I simply lean over, pick it up, and lay it on top of me.  </li>
            <li>have periodic hot flashes.</li>
            <li>Maybe a hot water bottle with ice?</li>
            <li>it gets warm just like any other pillow after you lay on it.</li>
            <li>My wife uses it to cool her feet after work because she got nauseous when her head got anywhere near the item.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have hot flashes, i just run hot, so to me this was cool enough-</li>
            <li>REAL Chillow is made by SoothSoft ([...]</li>
            <li>The Chillow felt nice at first, but it only stays cool for a few hours.</li>
            <li>An absolute fraud...</li>
            <li>I wake up rested and ready for the day.</li>
            <li>It truely helps with those middle of the night hot flashes with an instant cool.</li>
            <li>The ORIGINAL is the only one.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying more for other friends.</li>
            <li>Not only does the Chillow not stay cool for longer than 10 mins.</li>
            <li>It does not stay cool for the entire night</li>
            <li>I have simply placed it on my lap while playing cards or otherwise occupied just to keep cool.  </li>
            <li>, so we keep it on the high side of the pillow.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a cheaper , smaller less effective version .</li>
            <li>so i ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>and they said they would send me a new belt.  </li>
            <li>I was able to Crazy Glue the caps on - so was able to use them for about 2 months until they needed to be &#x27;refreshed&#x27;</li>
            <li>This would be especially wonderful for women who are dealing with those horrible hot flashes!!  </li>
            <li>, you can rotate it 180 degrees and it will be fine for another few hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is not a real Chillow, it is a cheap made in China knockoff and a total rip off.</li>
            <li>The instructions clearly say not to put it in the frig or freezer.  </li>
            <li>To me the benefits of the chillow far outweigh the downside.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old and my husband is 76.</li>
            <li>Our friends were also surprised about Bowflex&#x27;s response.</li>
            <li>SO sad though, as i LOVED my Chillow.</li>
            <li>A little disappointed...this isn&#x27;t staying cool</li>
            <li>I tried several times and each time after I filled with water and followed the directions it still was  not cool.</li>
            <li>I have had these in the past and this new chillow leaked on the first night.</li>
            <li>First night it leaked water, and unfortunately didn&#x27;t cool like advertised.</li>
            <li>SO SAD because it really was cool, pun</li>

            <li> Our friends were also surprised about Bowflex&#x27;s response.</li>
            <li> SO sad though, as i LOVED my Chillow.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed...this isn&#x27;t staying cool</li>
            <li> I tried several times and each time after I filled with water and followed the directions it still was  not cool.</li>
            <li> I have had these in the past and this new chillow leaked on the first night.</li>
            <li> First night it leaked water, and unfortunately didn&#x27;t cool like advertised.</li>
            <li> SO SAD because it really was cool, pun</li>
            <li> You have to lay flat and cannot move on it in order to get the benefits.  </li>
            <li> I have had lots of these in the past and I am dissapointed at the new plug design.</li>
            <li> enjoy the chillow but will never deal with &amp;#34;As seen on TV guys&amp;#34; again due to their poor customer service!</li>
            <li> Am I doing something wrong that it doesnt&#x27; stay cool all night?</li>
            <li> So the \\&quot;Never too hot, never too cold\\&quot; is false advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plug fits so loose</li>
            <li> but if you wake up and it&#x27;s not cool enough</li>
            <li> Works very well to keep the head or body chilled for at least a few hours at night.</li>
            <li> The one pictured is the one I expected.</li>
            <li> I choose the original chillow which is a pillow sized rectangle that is approximately 2 inches thick when activated by pouring in water.</li>
            <li> It just holds like 5 cups of water and is a flat insert that is heavy and does not stay in the pillow case.</li>
            <li> This works reasonably well but not perfect.</li>
            <li> It did not stay cool and was very difficult to fill with water by myself</li>
            <li> Putting 8-9 cups of water into it, makes it heavy and weighs down any pillow I have tried it with.</li>
            <li> mine has not yet cooled after 1 month, not even a little, and to know that buying this was a sacrifice.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I did something wrong, but the instructions were clear</li>
            <li> and it is not comfortable.    </li>
            <li> This pillow was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> when I got this I read the instructions use it and leaked all over me and the pillow and sheets what a waste of time.</li>
            <li> The negative is that the pillow cools down</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I got tired of waking up with wet sheets and threw them both out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eventually, small tears appear around the edge of the Chillow.  </li>
            <li> Do your self a favor and go to the store and buy a regular pillow that has a chilling insert in it.</li>
            <li> It lasted about 3 years until it got a small tear</li>
            <li> We  are not able to do the things we used to do.  </li>
            <li> I find it unbelievable that this company sent out defective&lt;</li>
            <li> Worse of all, it was too cold when I was not having hot flashes.</li>
            <li> They are NOT the same, and the chillow pillow as seen on TV is very poor quality and leaked after just 5 days.  </li>
            <li> However, what I don&#x27;t like is that I find it too hard a surface to lie on.  </li>
            <li> an hard to roll and get the air out.  </li>
            <li> one for ME &amp; one for my little DOG, who lays on it EVERY day!!....</li>
            <li> This is so dishonest to fool people like this...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll search elsewhere before I ever buy from this false advertised company.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> The chillow was uncomfortable to lay on, smelled like plastic.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for awhile and still use it!!! Works excellent in the summer...</li>
            <li> I wanted another Chillow to use on my back because my first one works so great.  This product is not a real Chillow, it is a cheap made in China knockoff and a total rip off. Even the product picture is faked.  Beware of the website [...]  It is the pirated chillow, or as I call it, Crap-pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The REAL Chillow is made by SoothSoft ([...] I don&#x27;t know why Amazon lets these people sell this pirated crap on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t judge a SoothSoft Chillow by this fake junk!  They can&#x27;t even compare especially in quality.</li>
            <li> great product.  the pillow stays cool all night.  I prefer a thicker pillow so I just stuck it in the same pillowcase as a thinner pillow that I have.</li>
            <li> This was just a way to get your money. It doesn&#x27;t work at ALL!!! I feel really stupid for beleiving that it would work. I tried several times and each time after I filled with water and followed the directions it still was  not cool. Maybe for a minute or so but it doesn&#x27;t stay cool it gets warm just like any other pillow after you lay on it. and it is not comfortable.    SAVE YOUR MONEY DON&#x27;T EVEN BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed...this isn&#x27;t staying cool and it keeps moving around and getting lumpy inside the pillow case.  Am I doing something wrong that it doesnt&#x27; stay cool all night?</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift to my husband.  He love it so much I ordered several more.  Great gift idea</li>
            <li> I will say the product has helped me greatly now waking up no more than twice as oppose to every 1-2 hours nightly.  The negative is that the pillow cools down which is when I wake up during the night.  It&#x27;s still an awesome product when you are experiencing the life change associated with night sweats.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old son thinks it&#x27;s great. It does cool some, but as others have said it only absorbs heat for a while and then becomes warm in that spot. It&#x27;s good enough to fall asleep however so meets the need. The plug leaks a tad, so we keep it on the high side of the pillow. The biggest problem is that the interior foam gets bunched up regularly. The instructions say this is &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; to fix, but their method isn&#x27;t easy and doesn&#x27;t work well. I&#x27;ve found the best way is to drain the water, and put my finger inside and move the foam back in place. This works reasonably well but not perfect. My son likes it so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> THE best gift I ever gave my wife!! Better than jewley, believe it or not!!</li>
            <li> I bought TWO of them....one for ME &amp; one for my little DOG, who lays on it EVERY day!!....it stays cool for WEEKS!</li>
            <li> Not only does the Chillow not stay cool for longer than 10 mins., it isn&#x27;t comfortable.  I put mine in the trash.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Chillow Pillow for years now and just love it.  The coolness puts me to sleep faster.  I actually have extras to travel with and give to others as gifts.</li>
            <li> Maybe I did something wrong, but the instructions were clear so I don&#x27;t see how I could have.  It just didn&#x27;t work. The instructions clearly say not to put it in the frig or freezer.  But that&#x27;s the only way I can think it might actually work.  Otherwise, it just doesn&#x27;t stay cool</li>
            <li> This thing is not a pillow. It just holds like 5 cups of water and is a flat insert that is heavy and does not stay in the pillow case. You have to lay flat and cannot move on it in order to get the benefits.  This is the dumbest thing I have ever bought.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these, hoping the problem I had with the first one was just an isolated incident. I am menopausal at 36 suffering from hot flashes. The Chillow felt nice at first, but it only stays cool for a few hours. The worst problem is that it leaks! I&#x27;ve had two of these and they both leak from the spout. I got tired of waking up with wet sheets and threw them both out. Good concept----way cheat product. You&#x27;re better offsleeping with an ice pack wrapped in a towel!!</li>
            <li> I can not sleep at night for having hot flashes, I ordered the Chillow Cooling Pillow and it has helped. I would tell any one to buy this, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> Works very well to keep the head or body chilled for at least a few hours at night.</li>
            <li> I was really happy to receive this as a Christmas gift but the cap does not seal well and the chillow leaks...slowly...but who wants a wet bed?</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!  It does not work as described.  The pillow does not get any cooler then the water you put in it and it does not stay cool.  I ended up throwing it away - save yourself the money and do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I had a very difficult time getting &amp;#34;As seen on TV guys&amp;#34; to respond to  me when I had a problem with the product. I received the product with a tear in it and requested an exchange. It took the &amp;#34;As seen on TV guys&amp;#34; 3 weeks to respond to me....then I had to pay an additional $13 in shipping to return it which they did not remiburse for. It took an additional 2 weeks and several emails to finally receive my replacement product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the chillow but will never deal with &amp;#34;As seen on TV guys&amp;#34; again due to their poor customer service!</li>
            <li> The chillow does feel cool and comfortable.  However, what I don&#x27;t like is that I find it too hard a surface to lie on.  Putting 8-9 cups of water into it, makes it heavy and weighs down any pillow I have tried it with.</li>
            <li> I use this with my pillow and it heats up a lot at night. To the point of being drenched in sweat. I took it out and lay it next to my pillow it is nice and cool with the fan blowing on it. My yorkie loves it. Must work for him.</li>
            <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;original chillow pillow&amp;#34; and instead received the chillow pillow as seen on TV.  They are NOT the same, and the chillow pillow as seen on TV is very poor quality and leaked after just 5 days.  However, in the past, I&#x27;ve ordered the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; and it was perfect!</li>
            <li> This pillow was a waste of money.  I bought it at Walgreens.  It did not stay cool and was very difficult to fill with water by myself an hard to roll and get the air out.  It also got all twitted up inside my pillow.  What a disappointment!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> An absolute fraud...mine has not yet cooled after 1 month, not even a little, and to know that buying this was a sacrifice.  This is so dishonest to fool people like this... I feel so upset everytime I look at it and know that I can&#x27;t use it and I am hot. I want my money back!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many a chilow over the years. This is NOT THE CHILLOW in the photo , it&#x27;s a cheaper , smaller less effective version . The one pictured is the one I expected. This is not what you want.  Trust me. The ORIGINAL is the only one.  I&#x27;ll search elsewhere before I ever buy from this false advertised company.  Lame. Dissatisfied !!!! Mike</li>
            <li> This pillow will keep your head cool while you sleep.  It is wonderful. I love it.</li>
            <li> First night it leaked water, and unfortunately didn&#x27;t cool like advertised. We were definitely hoping this product would help with migraine headaches, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have night sweats and the chillow helps me to have a good nights sleep. I wake up rested and ready for the day.</li>
            <li> There is this dominant chemical smell that will not go away.  My wife uses it to cool her feet after work because she got nauseous when her head got anywhere near the item. If you do not have a sense of smell this might be the right thing for you.  If you are blessed with that sense then do not order it.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to a friend who was hot flashing. She reported it was so cold she put a terry cloth cover on it! I plan on buying more for other friends.</li>
            <li> This pillow does keep my head cool, but it off-gasses so much that I can&#x27;t sleep because my pillow smells like plastic. Yuck.</li>
            <li> when I got this I read the instructions use it and leaked all over me and the pillow and sheets what a waste of time.</li>
            <li> This is the second Chillow Pillow I&#x27;ve ownerd. It truely helps with those middle of the night hot flashes with an instant cool. Just keep away from your cats claws! lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Chillow for over 5 years.  It&#x27;s not perfect but I&#x27;ve found a way to make it work. First of all, I put it directly on top of my pillow and sleep with my head directly on it.  It does not stay cool for the entire night but if you wake up and it&#x27;s not cool enough, you can rotate it 180 degrees and it will be fine for another few hours.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, small tears appear around the edge of the Chillow.  Eventually, they will start leaking.  If you examine it every week or so, you can see the tears and put a drop of super glue on them.  This will prevent them from leaking.  I get about 6 or 8 months out of each one before I reorder.  To me the benefits of the chillow far outweigh the downside.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#x27;t imagine sleeping without my Chillow.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  It works great when new and it does stay cool although after a few days it bunches up in side with no way to effectively smooth out for practical use.  I am returning my Chillow tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you don&#x27;t have one of these, you need one, especially if you are &amp;#34;of an age&amp;#34; or take medication that causes night sweats.  It really does stay cool.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work!  I wish I could return it, but it says I have waited tooling.  I didn&#x27;t get to use it in the beginning because I was sick and couldn&#x27;t take the time to figure it out!</li>
            <li> I have had these in the past and this new chillow leaked on the first night. It doesn&#x27;t have a hole,,,the plug came out. The plug fits so loose that I even had a problem keeping it in while I was setting it up. I have had lots of these in the past and I am dissapointed at the new plug design.</li>
            <li> It leaks and is generally a piece of crap; very disappointed.  Do your self a favor and go to the store and buy a regular pillow that has a chilling insert in it.</li>
            <li> I used to LOVE my Chillows. Years ago i had  a chillow that was great. I don&#x27;t have hot flashes, i just run hot, so to me this was cool enough- esp. for the first 2-3 hours. It lasted about 3 years until it got a small tear so i ordered a new one. It has a different plug, not a screw in one, just a cap. It leaked immediately - water would just run right out the sides. I called customer service they quickly sent another. That one leaked. I called - repeat this FOUR TIMES. FOUR leaky Chillows in a row, so I called and they gave me a full refund. SO sad though, as i LOVED my Chillow. I was able to Crazy Glue the caps on - so was able to use them for about 2 months until they needed to be &#x27;refreshed&#x27; and since i couldnt take the cap off then they were trash.&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that now they are made cheaply in China or they are skimping on productions. SO SAD because it really was cool, pun intended.&lt;br /&gt;I would pay double for one that worked. I guess they are not reading their reviews.</li>
            <li> I  do not hate the product,but I used it for afew days and the belt started to shred!  I called the company and they said they would send me a new belt.  However, they said I would have to fix it myself or pay $167.00 for someone to come fix it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I think this is unacceptable.  I am 65 years old and my husband is 76. We purchased this equipment to get healthier not to become mechanics.  We  are not able to do the things we used to do.  I find it unbelievable that this company sent out defective&lt;br /&gt;equipment!  They should send someone out free of charge to fix their mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I use the machine daily and have not chaged the belt yet. It&#x27;s ridiculous!  It flops around and around.&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy another product from them. Our friends were also surprised about Bowflex&#x27;s response.</li>
            <li> A girlfriend who I work with is always hot at night.  I decided to get her a chillow pillow insert from Amazon.com.  She loves it!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  It has fully met my expectations, I just wish that I would have purchased one sooner!  It stays cool and allows me to stay so comfortable that I am sleeping much better!  This would be especially wonderful for women who are dealing with those horrible hot flashes!!  Very happy!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this pillow several years ago at the recommendation of my neighbor.  I do not put it in my pillow - - I leave it at the side of my bed.  When I wake w/a hot flash, I simply lean over, pick it up, and lay it on top of me.  It is always room temperature which is cooler than the body.  I have simply placed it on my lap while playing cards or otherwise occupied just to keep cool.  Granted, it eventually warms up.  But, it works for me.</li>
            <li> Dghtr-in law loves this</li>
            <li> I choose the original chillow which is a pillow sized rectangle that is approximately 2 inches thick when activated by pouring in water. When activated, it weighs about 5 pounds, so when I placed it on top of my feather pillows, they were compressed them much. I tried using the chillow alone inserted into a pillow case.&lt;br /&gt;I have periodic hot flashes. The chillow was uncomfortable to lay on, smelled like plastic. Worse of all, it was too cold when I was not having hot flashes. So the \\&quot;Never too hot, never too cold\\&quot; is false advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though they issued a return authorization; they refused to refund our money because it was not received within their 30 day return policy.  Not only did they authorize the return once they received the product back and refused the refund they wanted almost 25% of the cost to return it to us or they would consider the item abandoned.  There is no way I would ever do business with these people again.</li>
            <li> I am so glad it turned out to be the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; kind. Thank you. How did our mothers survive without these? Maybe a hot water bottle with ice? I&#x27;m a Chillow person.</li>
