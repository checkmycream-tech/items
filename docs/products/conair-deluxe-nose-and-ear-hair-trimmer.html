    <ol>
            <li>The Conair NE151R is probably about the best looking nose and ear hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>I too wasnt very impressed until I read the instructions on just what your suppose to do with it.</li>
            <li>After reading the instructions it works perfect.</li>
            <li>and it is a great idea.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for about seven years, it works great</li>
            <li>But to be a good father, I took this beauty along with me on a business trip.</li>

            <li>The &amp;quot;trimmer&amp;quot; looks great, takes a battery, makes the right noises, and does zip.  </li>
            <li>Until there something better on the market, save your money.</li>

            <li>How could Conair mess up a simple nose hair trimmer this much??  </li>

            <li> Too bad there isn&#x27;t a zero in this rating system. I had an old remington that could handle everything I threw at it...until I lost the blade assembly. My wife picked up the conair for me...what a disappointment. It sounds like its working. But when you take it apart for post-op cleaning, there isn&#x27;t a hair to be found! I end up plucking the \\&quot;strays\\&quot; with her tweezers (little does she know)! It uses a pretty dumb design; the blades stick straight out from the axis of rotation. Unless the hair is bent 90 degrees, it&#x27;s simply going to smack off of the blade...just like a card wacking off the spokes of your bike when you wanted to sound like a motorcycle. Junk-air</li>
            <li> I thought ours was defective, but I guess they all work like ours do.  I agree with the other people.  Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> This looks good and the fact that it&#x27;s supposedly a &#x27;deluxe&#x27; model you would think it would work well..., It doesn&#x27;t. Doesn&#x27;t cut the hair. All you get is a shiny plastic nothing.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used this thing it seemed to work.  After that, nothing.  I couldn&#x27;t even see the blades moving so I didn&#x27;t know how it was supposed to cut anything.  It&#x27;s really too bad, because it looks cool and it is a great idea.  I guess that I would suggest just putting some more meat into the thing so that it actually cuts something.  Until there something better on the market, save your money.</li>
            <li> Worked kind of OK the first few times on nose hair. Very inferior performance on ear hair. It simply does not pick up hair reliably, especially from the surface of the ear. The barely passable performance degraded substantially after a few uses. On/off switch is extremely flimsy and now it works only if I keep on holding the switch by exerting pressure from a weird angle. Clearly a case of you get what you pay for. This is a cheap unit overall and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Should have read the reviews here before I purchased this.&lt;BR&gt;No matter what angle I&#x27;ve inserted this into my nostrils it hasn&#x27;t managed to cut a single hair. Very disappointing, a total waste of money. It does warm my nostrils a little and there is an interesting metallic smell whilst using it.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with all the other reviewers - this trimmer isn&#x27;t worth a dime. It barely trims one or two hairs, and only with an excess of effort. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work worth a flip.&lt;br /&gt;Save you $10.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t Really work. Try Wahl Trimmer on Amazon. Much Better.</li>
            <li> This is the worst. New from the package it did not work unless I pressed just so on the battery compartment. Then, once on, it sounded terrible and smelled like it was burning. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s still on the market! Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Just like is says on the tin  .... &amp;quot;Con&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> Says exactly as it does on the tin - &amp;quot;Con&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> Says exactly as it does on the tin - &amp;quot;Con&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> This plastic conair hair trimmer is not only junk, but it does NOT WORK AT ALL!!!! Once turned on, it can not cut anything. I have tried to cut hair in my nose, in my ears, and even hair on my arm, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!! It does not work...</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand all you people trashing this Conair Trimmer. I&#x27;ve had mine for about seven years, it works great and I have no complaints with it. Have you tried reading the instructions, I know guys don&#x27;t like to take the time but it&#x27;s really a nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Conair NE151R is probably about the best looking nose and ear hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. But all this beauty comes at a price, performance. My previous personal trimmer was a Conair MN160CS, which was functionally the greatest trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. My loving family got me a Men&#x27;s 10 piece grooming kit model GK3 from Conair, which includes the NE151R, for an early Fathers Day gift. Nothing beats grooming tools on Fathers Day, except for maybe socks, a tie, or pictures of your wife cheating on you. But my MN160CS was getting old, so with reckless abandon I stepped up to my new trimmer. The first thing I noticed was it came with no battery. It takes a AA, so I now have one more remote that won&#x27;t work. After getting over that, I started using the NE151R.It wasn&#x27;t nearly as high rpm as my MN160CS and it resulted in an almost tearing sensation instead of cutting. Nothing I couldn&#x27;t get used to I guess. But to be a good father, I took this beauty along with me on a business trip. I&#x27;ve never been able to communicate with the young people I travel with for work, mostly because we are from different times, and they never give the old timer his respect. Just like I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t when I started out. On this particular trip my 20 something business associate shared a hotel suite with me. We tried to make small talk about sports and what not, and during that talk he commented on how well groomed my nose and ears were and he wished he was that smooth shaving. So I busted out the NE151R to let him use it. When he saw it he said \\&quot;Man that is sweet!\\&quot; a phrase my 17 year old son often uses. He couldn&#x27;t get over the fact an old timer like me would have such a trendy trimmer. He used it, and his face kind of lit up like my youngest son when I bring him toys home from trips. The next day I got my young freind his very own NE151R during a lunch break, and he now looks at me like a father figure. I can&#x27;t get him to leave me alone! In the end the NE151R ended up being the most useful tool I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Of no value.  The clipper head moves but no hair gets cut.  It is a poor design.  It works like a miniature hair clipper, except that it has &#x27;safety&#x27; bumpers on either side of the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had more success with the rotary style.  The rotary style has a little spinning blade inside a guard. Try the Panasonic instead.  I bought the Conair locally because my Panasonic broke after 2-3 years, and I couldn&#x27;t find one locally.  I&#x27;m tossing the Conair and ordering a Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Fast shiping and wonderful customer service.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be easier and do a better job than using the pop-up sideburn cutters of my electric razor. I had purchased other Conair products and been very pleased with their quality, however this product doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty and looks impressive but it doesn&#x27;t cut nose hair or else mine grow back imediately(but I checked the cutting area inside the hair remover and never saw any hair). This is the first nose and ear hair remover I have ever bought so I can&#x27;t compare it to another one, but the blade on this is not very sharp and the motor doesn&#x27;t have enough power to compensate for the dull blade.&lt;br /&gt;Thus it doesn&#x27;t do the job.It least mine didn&#x27;t.&lt;BR&gt;So if you need one of these you might want to try another brand or like me contiue to use your electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;In any case save your money and avoid this one.&lt;BR&gt;I would give it no stars but that was not an option.</li>
            <li> basically it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut any hair while other models do.  Whoever designed this model didn&#x27;t test it out to see if it actually worked</li>
            <li> This was invented by people who are either totally incompetent or have an off-the-wall sense of humor (or both). The &amp;quot;trimmer&amp;quot; looks great, takes a battery, makes the right noises, and does zip.  Zero.  Zilch.  You can stand there with this up your nose all day and not cut a hair.  I didn&#x27;t make it a day, but after more time then I&#x27;d care to admit,  I looked around thinking I was on candid camera.  Threw it out.</li>
            <li> For all the people having problems with this unit I suggest you read the instructions on how to use it. I too wasnt very impressed until I read the instructions on just what your suppose to do with it. After reading the instructions it works perfect.</li>
            <li> ....but you really are wasting your money on this product.  I bought it several months ago and while it would occasionally work it took an absurd amount of time for any results, and even then the results were uneven.  I just bought a Panasonic and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference: the results were instantaneous and outstanding.  It made me realize what a piece of crap the Conair is.  You could sit there for 45 minutes and still get zero results.  Unbelievable.  I would give it no stars if that was an option.</li>
            <li> Never really worked. Returned it to Bed Bath and Beyond. Got another one thinking it was a fluke. This one doesn&#x27;t work either. How could Conair mess up a simple nose hair trimmer this much??  Now, I will be returning the 2nd one and figured I probably already spent (...) worth of gas and time dealing with this piece of crap. DO NOT BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Small scissors work just as well.</li>
