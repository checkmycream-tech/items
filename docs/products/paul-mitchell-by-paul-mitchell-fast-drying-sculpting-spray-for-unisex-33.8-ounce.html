            <li> I use this to get a flexible hold that does not flake or ball up in my black hair. Perfect!</li>
            <li> been buying this for years.</li>
            <li> This hairspray, when acquired from a salon, is clear in color. The hairspray that I received was brown in color.</li>
            <li> What can you say about it. It works.</li>
            <li> Excellent hold in Texas winds.  One of the few hair care items that haven&#x27;t disappeared, replaced by &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; iterations for marketing purposes.  I&#x27;ve used this for years, and continue to like it!</li>
            <li> I love it.  I have tried other hair sprays but nothing works as well as the Paul Mitchell Fast Drying hair spray. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff but it keeps it in place all day.  Once I do my hair and spray it, at the end of the day, it looks just like it did in the morning.  Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> While some reviewer seem to have received something different, as far as I can tell this is a genuine Paul Mitchell product. It works and smells the same as what I&#x27;ve bought locally.  The price is right and the product is good.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray that I have ever used more than once and I&#x27;ve used it for decades (I think). It holds with adding weight or stickiness to your hair and I have very fine hair so that is important.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years but it is getting harder to find it in the salons in my area. I don&#x27;t like traveling all over to get it, I have an auto immune disease that makes me sensitive to chemicals and especially those with a lot of fragrence to them. I can use this particular Styling Spray without any of the harmful side effects other products give me. Nor does it leave my hair feeling brittle. It keeps it in place, with a soft and gentle touch. So glad I found it here at Amazon and the fact that I can order it and it is delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray with which I am satisfied. You provided quick and easy service for one who lives in a rural ares where shopping is a challenge</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray, plus I can use this large size to fill my travel size bottles.  Works great for trips.</li>
            <li> just what I need in this Summer weather.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell works for my no-body hard to manage head of hair!!  One does not need much to make it work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for decades and wouldn&#x27;t switch for anything. I have baby fine hair and it holds a style without getting rigid or crispy. It&#x27;s great to use throughout the day to lift roots!</li>
            <li> Could not find this in town anymore and I love this hairspray. Live in very humid climate and this does not smell like you have hairspray on plus it holds.</li>
            <li> have used it for years , love it , works well , great hold with a small amount of spray used.</li>
            <li> I would not be without this fast drying sculpting spray.  I use it as a setting lotion when I put rollers in my hair and it gives my hair soft curls.  It also makes a fabulous hair spray.  This stuff is great!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Paul Mitchell Fast Drying Sculpting non-aresol spray for years but always had to stop by an out-of-the-way beauty supply to purchase the 33.8 oz size.  Leaves my hair soft but the hold is firm enough to keep the style.  Delivered to my door within 2-days of the order.</li>
