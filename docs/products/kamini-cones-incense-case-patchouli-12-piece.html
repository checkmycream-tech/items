            <li>We like it better than any fragrance in a spray can on the market.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this incense - it&#x27;s very rich and aromatic.</li>
            <li>The cones are very easy to light, burn very nicely and the fragrance to me is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Patchouli was a favorite then and still is one of my very favorites.</li>
            <li>What a wonderful smell, and how long they last!!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>LARGE cones.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m playing with it to affect this, as it&#x27;s quite a large pack of them.</li>

            <li>While that means a stronger scent, not sure how another reviewer said these weren&#x27;t strong, it also means it burns quickly, much faster than sticks, and is, well, smokey.</li>
            <li>The Knox is more expensive and burns faster but is an overall better experience.</li>
            <li>Come with a little dish to light them on.  </li>
            <li>Definitely only use in a very well ventilated area.</li>

            <li> boy my house smells so nice I don&#x27;t know what to say my wife is into incense I like it.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells yucky.  I can&#x27;t even describe it, but it&#x27;s nothing like patchouli.  It smells like some kind of weird perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought these on Amazon.com, because of a fair price. An I didn&#x27;t have to pay the freight, and tax. So you get a savings that way. Good Deal.  SW</li>
            <li> Reminds me of my teenage years. Patchouli was a favorite then and still is one of my very favorites. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Burns very well. I prefer a stronger scent.</li>
            <li> Great strong scent, burns evenly and all the way through.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this incense - it&#x27;s very rich and aromatic. It seems a bit smokey though, which is why I knocked off one star. If you use this in a small room, you might want to only burn half a cone at a time.</li>
            <li> A bit harsh in that the smoke is irritating and may cause some to cough. We prefer the Knox  German smoker incense. The Knox is more expensive and burns faster but is an overall better experience.</li>
            <li> Love this Patchouli scent and burns nice too. Will definitely buy again. Delivery by carrier AMZL-US was fast and early in the morning, wow! I am impressed with product and the carrier.</li>
            <li> Love this! Wonderful smell. Burns very well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Patchouli. It reminds me of a very expensive designer perfume. The cones are very easy to light, burn very nicely and the fragrance to me is very relaxing. There is no smokey smell in the house, only the very nice odor of wonderful patchouli. I seem to like the cones better than the incense sticks but that&#x27;s only my opinion. They were packaged very securely and arrived sooner than expected. I will definitely order more when I run out. JOB WELL DONE.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted at a good price.</li>
            <li> Have to keep relighting cones.</li>
            <li> LARGE cones.  Come with a little dish to light them on.  Great for expressing your gratitude to the universe..  Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful smell, and how long they last!!! I absolutely love this product, the way it calms me and refreshes my mind, and the wonderful aroma it fills my apartment with. Highly recommended to everybody who likes incense.</li>
            <li> We like it better than any fragrance in a spray can on the market. This incense makes me feel transported to another world when we burn it.</li>
            <li> These smell great. Not as much of a patchouli scent as I am used to/ was looking for.  But the scent is still very nice. The part I&#x27;m working on, the amount of smoke it produces.  It bellows. While that means a stronger scent, not sure how another reviewer said these weren&#x27;t strong, it also means it burns quickly, much faster than sticks, and is, well, smokey. I&#x27;m playing with it to affect this, as it&#x27;s quite a large pack of them. Overall I enjoy these, would recommend but mention the smokey factor. Definitely only use in a very well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> Long lasting. Very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great smell and value!</li>
            <li> They have just arrived and I do think the smell from the box (haven&#x27;t lit one yet) is nice. But there is no accompanying dish to put the cones on as mentioned in one of the reviews.</li>
            <li> Scent is beautiful I will buy again when I run out</li>
            <li> these incense cones bring such peace into the house,,my favorite being sage, They also are in tune with nature, and thespiritual world,,once used to ward off evil,,  be well</li>
            <li> This is a great item. Nice scent. Could be a little stronger smelling.  I will order again. Delivered as expected packed well.</li>
            <li> Very nice Patchouli aroma, puts me to sleep at night.</li>
            <li> I bought the sapphire kids necklace re: titanic and it lost stones the next day..&lt;br /&gt;Feel ripped off!</li>
