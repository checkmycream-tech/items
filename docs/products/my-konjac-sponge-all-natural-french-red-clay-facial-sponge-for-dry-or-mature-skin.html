            <li>My husband is enjoying the one for oily skin I purchased for him.</li>
            <li>Love this sponge.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle yet exfoliating and leaves my skin looking and feeling great.  </li>
            <li>This was great for travel instead of packing yet another appliance with chargers, etc.&lt;br /&gt; -  gentle on my face.  </li>

            <li>Love the product, price and service.</li>
            <li>Love these sponges.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really clean and soft after washing.&lt;br /&gt;thanks for making a great product!</li>
            <li>exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle that you think it can&#x27;t really be effective, but it is!</li>
            <li>Very soft yet does a great job.  </li>
            <li>A wonderful product for dry, aging skin!</li>
            <li>So soothing and yet makes my face feel so clean!</li>
            <li>It works great on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My mother uses this sponge twice a day, and she says it works great for her mature skin.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very good and easy to open.  </li>
            <li>Additionally it arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This sponge is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I like the teardrop shape because it&#x27;s easy to remove makeup from the crevices alongside the nose.</li>
            <li>The shape makes it easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see done differenty, it would be to supply a slightly strong string to hang the sponge with.</li>
            <li>I love that I can just use the sponge and no soap is needed, makes washing your face quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Received it quickly too!</li>
            <li>This sponge is a great gentle way to exfoliate the skin and leave it clean without stripping it if used with a nice natural cleanser.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference between using this or a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go out because it was so embarrassing to take pictures and have people close to see huge bumps, scabs, and redness...</li>
            <li>It gentle but effective for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>An effective and gentle exfoliator that leaves my skin softer and clearer.</li>
            <li>make it sound.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>your free gift</li>
            <li>but this sponge is gentle yet incredibly effective.  </li>
            <li>I bought this sponge in hopes that it would provide light exfoliation and a bit of moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li>Great product, very affordable, thanks for solving my problem.</li>
            <li>Next time I might order a more abrasive one, but this one is exactly as described and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I must admit I didn&#x27;t expect a sponge to leave my skin feeling as clean as the scrub I used, which is no longer available anyway.</li>
            <li>I look forward to the clean and smooth feel of my skin after using mine.</li>
            <li>This is my third order of the konjac sponge; love love love it</li>
            <li>I apply my moisturizer--lotion with sunscreen for day and rich cream at  night.</li>
            <li>Thus far I am very pleased</li>
            <li>After trying my first sponge, I bought more.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin squeaky clean, exfoliates great, and helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea sometimes and this makes my skin feel really clean, and yet doesn&#x27;t damage its sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>My face feels like it is actually clean.</li>
            <li>I have used several kinds of konjac sponges and these are by far the best.</li>
            <li>and it rinses clean.</li>
            <li>great product for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Most AMAZING facial product I have ever used!!  </li>
            <li>It gets my face clean but is not at all abrasive</li>
            <li>My face felt and looked clean.</li>
            <li>, konjac sponge has been doing a great keeping break outs and dry patches at bay.</li>
            <li>Do I remove my makeup with any special cleanser?&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Noticed a huge change in my skin in the first 48 hours!  </li>
            <li>No product from high end to cheap drugstore could make it better.</li>
            <li>Really enjoying this one, and much gentler on my (aging) skin than the charcoal version.  </li>
            <li>I just wish I had bought more because I&#x27;m going through them so fast.</li>
            <li>Stick with it for a full 30 days</li>
            <li>and it is wonderful for dry mature skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I felt like I was getting a good enough clean with my bare hands and using really warm water</li>
            <li>My Konjac Sponge is very easy to use and my face feels really soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I love my sponge, it is very soft yet exfoliates quite well.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t be without when the first one wears out!  </li>
            <li>It does exactly that!</li>
            <li>If I have makeup on, I will remove it first and then use the sponge on clean skin.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy using it every couple of days as a gentle exfoliant.</li>
            <li>and I liked it enough to buy it again.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>Nice big sponge, but dries overnight.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth after using this sponge, and for me, that is saying a lot!</li>
            <li>Even more exciting that it&#x27;s 100% natural.</li>
            <li>Love this sponge; leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Perfect texture for cleaning skin, not too firm and not too soft.</li>
            <li>but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>Still deciding which works best for my skin type (mature, combination) - the green clay is the leader right now.</li>
            <li>Worked great at sloughing off dead skin but yet gentle to not inflame the skin!</li>
            <li>It is easy on my old skin!</li>
            <li>This would only be good for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is  an easy way to gently exfoliate and leaves face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Love this facial sponge and plan on reordering it...</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the shape it&#x27;s cut into.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a recent convert to konjac sponges and am extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Treated my first one ever like a sea sponge</li>
            <li>My skin feel so soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li>Do I wash my face first?</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m pretty bummed</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I like to use hot water with it</li>
            <li>Moisturizer goes on that much easier - just a hit!</li>
            <li>Really like this for washing my face!</li>
            <li>I love using the sponge - my face definitely feels smoother.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the My Konjac Red Clay sponge and absolutely love it .  </li>
            <li>I had been using a Konjac facial sponge made by Boscia, I like this one much better -</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft &amp; smooth without any irritation.</li>
            <li>skin feels clean and looks better than it has looked for months due to illness.</li>
            <li>I have bought similar sponges locally where I live for a great deal more money, and this is the exact same product.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this sponge because it leaves my face feeling clean without drying it, a feat in this harsh New England winter.</li>
            <li>I really do like fact that my skin feels smooth and soft after each use.</li>
            <li>Works very well and my face felt smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and clean after use.</li>
            <li>Great for dry, mature, somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean, soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>and I believe you&#x27;ll notice a positive change in your skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>However, after getting it wet and using it the first time, I fell in love.</li>
            <li>It does take off the top layer of dry skin - or helps it slough off.</li>
            <li>Also appreciate this brand&#x27;s large size.  </li>
            <li>Such an easy way to gently exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure of what time of magic they put into the clay that when you buff your face with this you feel clean but also feel moisturized.</li>
            <li>Its hard to get a good grip on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li>This sponge takes care of them gently with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought one about a month ago, love it, and have now bought two of the lighter pink ones for my daughter and two more of these darker pink ones for myself</li>
            <li>Shipped in a timely manner and works very well.</li>
            <li>This sponge works really well for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li>Gentle exfoliation</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it really hydrates</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, but I like the fact that I get the benefit of some exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>Gentle exfoliation,</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>While you are using it, it is gentle and you think it&#x27;s not doing much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for this.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Dries fast.  </li>
            <li>Will buy again because it doesn&#x27;t take up any room and really does the job.</li>
            <li>However the couple of times I tried using it, even with a makeup remover, it didn&#x27;t seem like it removed much makeup at all.</li>
            <li>but it feels very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I find the shape is nicer in my hand and this company is cruelty free unlike Boscia who recently changed their policy.</li>
            <li>but once you put water on it ... it softens and feels so gentle on your face.  </li>
            <li>but it honestly does not remove any dead skin.</li>
            <li>Removes dead skin effectively and is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if there is a difference in say, the original v. red clay or anything like that.</li>
            <li>In the short period of time that I have been using the My Konjac facial sponge I can see a remarkable difference starting to take place in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have my clean face back.</li>
            <li>I have never been a towel or sponge user, but this sponge exfoliated very gently and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>My face feels very smooth and soft after I&#x27;ve used it, but I&#x27;m not all pink and irritated looking</li>
            <li>it is good on my sensitive skin but the design shape is odd and use on my facial skin is awkward at best when trying to apply the directed use.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is compostable, gentle, doesn&#x27;t leave pollute the waterways with little plastic beads.</li>
            <li>I have been using a complexion brush in the shower every morning for several years now, but it&#x27;s only since I started using this sponge every evening that my skin has evened out more and visible bumps are fading.  </li>
            <li>Now my face is soft and smooth, pores have gotten smaller too.</li>
            <li>I LOVED the green tea one, so thought I&#x27;d try the red clay one, since it was described for maturing skin.</li>
            <li>I knew buffing or using a facial loofa would only cause more dryness or could even cause damage.</li>
            <li>I have only used the sponge for a short time, but love the way my skin feels after using.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very soft on my skin and a gently way to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This sponge came highly recommended with a lot of reviews</li>
            <li>and then SUPER GENTLY squeezing excess moisture out before hanging to dry.  </li>
            <li>It really is soft and gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to order the green tea one again to make myself feel better.</li>
            <li>Anywho, I&#x27;m buying a few more now, two for me and one for my sisters.</li>
            <li>While I liked how this made my skin feel ,it began to crumble and fall apart after only 2 weeks, and considering the price I expected it to last much longer.</li>
            <li>Not only did it not perform as described, it developed that mildew scent within the first week, despite gently but thoroughly squeezing the water out and hanging it by its string after rinsing.</li>
            <li>My skin is also very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>After you finish, you skin feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>My face feels very soft after I use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really strange but worth trying.</li>
            <li>the first one finally &#x27;bit the dust&#x27;...</li>
            <li>Normally, I first apply my toner, next--after waiting for the toner to dry--I apply a serum and my eye moisturizer, after a short wait--to allow the serum to be absorbed--&lt;br</li>
            <li>Noticed helpful healing changes immediately on my 64-year old skin!  </li>
            <li>It was the first red clay one I&#x27;ve used and was unimpressed.</li>
            <li>My face is clean following regular face washing and never irritated.  </li>
            <li>My mature skin saw an improvement after only the first use.</li>
            <li>I have skin which is sensitive with mild rosacea and it tends to get very dry and flake in the winter.</li>
            <li>I am a busy mom trying to use pure and simple products on myself and baby.</li>
            <li>So far my skin looks</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone with mature or problem skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used sponges to wash my face and bought natural sponges for years.</li>
            <li>It makes my face baby butt soft.</li>
            <li>The sponge is so amazingly soft</li>
            <li>This was advertised for mature skin, but dries my skin out.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and looks clearer.</li>
            <li>I apply my cleanser and the use the dampened sponge to complete the cleansing process.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Soft.  </li>
            <li>I use my regular facial soap first to remove makeup and follow up with the sponge.</li>
            <li>I wish I would of had this sponge five years ago when I was in high school and had the same issue.</li>
            <li>The green tea one I got was the full sized one.</li>
            <li>It is not rough.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry, mature skin.</li>
            <li>The green one was slightly moist, lovely.</li>
            <li>It had holes within few days of use and just didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li>I have small blood vessels showing due to liver issues and most products irritate my skin, this sponge doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too rough and it exfoliates really well with the added benefit of red clay.</li>
            <li>i followed the process of keeping sanitized once a week in boiling water, on the daily use to moisten till soft prior to use.  </li>
            <li>After doing some research I decided to try the all natural french red clay sponge.</li>
            <li>All Natural French Red Clay body sponge.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and pretty rough dry skin -</li>
            <li>I treated it (rinsing, squeezing hanging) exactly as I did the little red clay one.</li>
            <li>It is not rough or harsh on my face at all - no abrasive feel - but gently scrubs my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little awkward to use at first but the contouring and slim end works great for little spots I want to focus on.  </li>
            <li>I could see improvement immediately, dry patches were getting smaller with each use, there was less build-up of dead skin cells and my moisturizer absorbs into my face much better.</li>
            <li>I have a couple &amp; alternate use so that they dry out completely between uses.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive, and winter makes it all the worse.</li>

            <li> Will order again :)</li>
            <li> I was even able to buy a lighter moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My husband is enjoying the one for oily skin I purchased for him.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle yet exfoliating and leaves my skin looking and feeling great.  </li>
            <li> This was great for travel instead of packing yet another appliance with chargers, etc.&lt;br /&gt; -  gentle on my face.  </li>

            <li> Love this sponge.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Will order more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Love the product, price and service.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really clean and soft after washing.&lt;br /&gt;thanks for making a great product!</li>
            <li> exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle that you think it can&#x27;t really be effective, but it is!</li>
            <li> Very soft yet does a great job.  </li>
            <li> A wonderful product for dry, aging skin!</li>
            <li> So soothing and yet makes my face feel so clean!</li>
            <li> It works great on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My mother uses this sponge twice a day, and she says it works great for her mature skin.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very good and easy to open.  </li>
            <li> Additionally it arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This sponge is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like the teardrop shape because it&#x27;s easy to remove makeup from the crevices alongside the nose.</li>
            <li> The shape makes it easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to see done differenty, it would be to supply a slightly strong string to hang the sponge with.</li>
            <li> I love that I can just use the sponge and no soap is needed, makes washing your face quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly too!</li>
            <li> This sponge is a great gentle way to exfoliate the skin and leave it clean without stripping it if used with a nice natural cleanser.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference between using this or a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go out because it was so embarrassing to take pictures and have people close to see huge bumps, scabs, and redness...</li>
            <li> It gentle but effective for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> An effective and gentle exfoliator that leaves my skin softer and clearer.</li>
            <li> make it sound.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> your free gift</li>
            <li> but this sponge is gentle yet incredibly effective.  </li>
            <li> I bought this sponge in hopes that it would provide light exfoliation and a bit of moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, very affordable, thanks for solving my problem.</li>
            <li> Next time I might order a more abrasive one, but this one is exactly as described and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I must admit I didn&#x27;t expect a sponge to leave my skin feeling as clean as the scrub I used, which is no longer available anyway.</li>
            <li> I look forward to the clean and smooth feel of my skin after using mine.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of the konjac sponge; love love love it</li>
            <li> I apply my moisturizer--lotion with sunscreen for day and rich cream at  night.</li>
            <li> Thus far I am very pleased</li>
            <li> After trying my first sponge, I bought more.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin squeaky clean, exfoliates great, and helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea sometimes and this makes my skin feel really clean, and yet doesn&#x27;t damage its sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> My face feels like it is actually clean.</li>
            <li> I have used several kinds of konjac sponges and these are by far the best.</li>
            <li> and it rinses clean.</li>
            <li> great product for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Most AMAZING facial product I have ever used!!  </li>
            <li> It gets my face clean but is not at all abrasive</li>
            <li> My face felt and looked clean.</li>
            <li> , konjac sponge has been doing a great keeping break outs and dry patches at bay.</li>
            <li> Do I remove my makeup with any special cleanser?&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Noticed a huge change in my skin in the first 48 hours!  </li>
            <li> No product from high end to cheap drugstore could make it better.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this one, and much gentler on my (aging) skin than the charcoal version.  </li>
            <li> I just wish I had bought more because I&#x27;m going through them so fast.</li>
            <li> Stick with it for a full 30 days</li>
            <li> and it is wonderful for dry mature skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I felt like I was getting a good enough clean with my bare hands and using really warm water</li>
            <li> My Konjac Sponge is very easy to use and my face feels really soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I love my sponge, it is very soft yet exfoliates quite well.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be without when the first one wears out!  </li>
            <li> It does exactly that!</li>
            <li> If I have makeup on, I will remove it first and then use the sponge on clean skin.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy using it every couple of days as a gentle exfoliant.</li>
            <li> and I liked it enough to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Nice big sponge, but dries overnight.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth after using this sponge, and for me, that is saying a lot!</li>
            <li> Even more exciting that it&#x27;s 100% natural.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge; leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li> Perfect texture for cleaning skin, not too firm and not too soft.</li>
            <li> but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> Still deciding which works best for my skin type (mature, combination) - the green clay is the leader right now.</li>
            <li> Worked great at sloughing off dead skin but yet gentle to not inflame the skin!</li>
            <li> It is easy on my old skin!</li>
            <li> This would only be good for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is  an easy way to gently exfoliate and leaves face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Love this facial sponge and plan on reordering it...</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the shape it&#x27;s cut into.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to konjac sponges and am extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Treated my first one ever like a sea sponge</li>
            <li> My skin feel so soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li> Do I wash my face first?</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m pretty bummed</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I like to use hot water with it</li>
            <li> Moisturizer goes on that much easier - just a hit!</li>
            <li> Really like this for washing my face!</li>
            <li> I love using the sponge - my face definitely feels smoother.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the My Konjac Red Clay sponge and absolutely love it .  </li>
            <li> I had been using a Konjac facial sponge made by Boscia, I like this one much better -</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft &amp; smooth without any irritation.</li>
            <li> skin feels clean and looks better than it has looked for months due to illness.</li>
            <li> I have bought similar sponges locally where I live for a great deal more money, and this is the exact same product.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this sponge because it leaves my face feeling clean without drying it, a feat in this harsh New England winter.</li>
            <li> I really do like fact that my skin feels smooth and soft after each use.</li>
            <li> Works very well and my face felt smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and clean after use.</li>
            <li> Great for dry, mature, somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean, soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> and I believe you&#x27;ll notice a positive change in your skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> However, after getting it wet and using it the first time, I fell in love.</li>
            <li> It does take off the top layer of dry skin - or helps it slough off.</li>
            <li> Also appreciate this brand&#x27;s large size.  </li>
            <li> Such an easy way to gently exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of what time of magic they put into the clay that when you buff your face with this you feel clean but also feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> Its hard to get a good grip on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li> This sponge takes care of them gently with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought one about a month ago, love it, and have now bought two of the lighter pink ones for my daughter and two more of these darker pink ones for myself</li>
            <li> Shipped in a timely manner and works very well.</li>
            <li> This sponge works really well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li> Gentle exfoliation</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it really hydrates</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, but I like the fact that I get the benefit of some exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> Gentle exfoliation,</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> While you are using it, it is gentle and you think it&#x27;s not doing much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for this.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Dries fast.  </li>
            <li> Will buy again because it doesn&#x27;t take up any room and really does the job.</li>
            <li> However the couple of times I tried using it, even with a makeup remover, it didn&#x27;t seem like it removed much makeup at all.</li>
            <li> but it feels very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I find the shape is nicer in my hand and this company is cruelty free unlike Boscia who recently changed their policy.</li>
            <li> but once you put water on it ... it softens and feels so gentle on your face.  </li>
            <li> but it honestly does not remove any dead skin.</li>
            <li> Removes dead skin effectively and is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if there is a difference in say, the original v. red clay or anything like that.</li>
            <li> In the short period of time that I have been using the My Konjac facial sponge I can see a remarkable difference starting to take place in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have my clean face back.</li>
            <li> I have never been a towel or sponge user, but this sponge exfoliated very gently and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> My face feels very smooth and soft after I&#x27;ve used it, but I&#x27;m not all pink and irritated looking</li>
            <li> it is good on my sensitive skin but the design shape is odd and use on my facial skin is awkward at best when trying to apply the directed use.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is compostable, gentle, doesn&#x27;t leave pollute the waterways with little plastic beads.</li>
            <li> I have been using a complexion brush in the shower every morning for several years now, but it&#x27;s only since I started using this sponge every evening that my skin has evened out more and visible bumps are fading.  </li>
            <li> Now my face is soft and smooth, pores have gotten smaller too.</li>
            <li> I LOVED the green tea one, so thought I&#x27;d try the red clay one, since it was described for maturing skin.</li>
            <li> I knew buffing or using a facial loofa would only cause more dryness or could even cause damage.</li>
            <li> I have only used the sponge for a short time, but love the way my skin feels after using.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very soft on my skin and a gently way to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This sponge came highly recommended with a lot of reviews</li>
            <li> and then SUPER GENTLY squeezing excess moisture out before hanging to dry.  </li>
            <li> It really is soft and gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to order the green tea one again to make myself feel better.</li>
            <li> Anywho, I&#x27;m buying a few more now, two for me and one for my sisters.</li>
            <li> While I liked how this made my skin feel ,it began to crumble and fall apart after only 2 weeks, and considering the price I expected it to last much longer.</li>
            <li> Not only did it not perform as described, it developed that mildew scent within the first week, despite gently but thoroughly squeezing the water out and hanging it by its string after rinsing.</li>
            <li> My skin is also very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> After you finish, you skin feels very soft.  </li>
            <li> My face feels very soft after I use it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really strange but worth trying.</li>
            <li> the first one finally &#x27;bit the dust&#x27;...</li>
            <li> Normally, I first apply my toner, next--after waiting for the toner to dry--I apply a serum and my eye moisturizer, after a short wait--to allow the serum to be absorbed--&lt;br</li>
            <li> Noticed helpful healing changes immediately on my 64-year old skin!  </li>
            <li> It was the first red clay one I&#x27;ve used and was unimpressed.</li>
            <li> My face is clean following regular face washing and never irritated.  </li>
            <li> My mature skin saw an improvement after only the first use.</li>
            <li> I have skin which is sensitive with mild rosacea and it tends to get very dry and flake in the winter.</li>
            <li> I am a busy mom trying to use pure and simple products on myself and baby.</li>
            <li> So far my skin looks</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with mature or problem skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used sponges to wash my face and bought natural sponges for years.</li>
            <li> It makes my face baby butt soft.</li>
            <li> The sponge is so amazingly soft</li>
            <li> This was advertised for mature skin, but dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and looks clearer.</li>
            <li> I apply my cleanser and the use the dampened sponge to complete the cleansing process.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Soft.  </li>
            <li> I use my regular facial soap first to remove makeup and follow up with the sponge.</li>
            <li> I wish I would of had this sponge five years ago when I was in high school and had the same issue.</li>
            <li> The green tea one I got was the full sized one.</li>
            <li> It is not rough.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry, mature skin.</li>
            <li> The green one was slightly moist, lovely.</li>
            <li> It had holes within few days of use and just didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li> I have small blood vessels showing due to liver issues and most products irritate my skin, this sponge doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too rough and it exfoliates really well with the added benefit of red clay.</li>
            <li> i followed the process of keeping sanitized once a week in boiling water, on the daily use to moisten till soft prior to use.  </li>
            <li> After doing some research I decided to try the all natural french red clay sponge.</li>
            <li> All Natural French Red Clay body sponge.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and pretty rough dry skin -</li>
            <li> I treated it (rinsing, squeezing hanging) exactly as I did the little red clay one.</li>
            <li> It is not rough or harsh on my face at all - no abrasive feel - but gently scrubs my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little awkward to use at first but the contouring and slim end works great for little spots I want to focus on.  </li>
            <li> I could see improvement immediately, dry patches were getting smaller with each use, there was less build-up of dead skin cells and my moisturizer absorbs into my face much better.</li>
            <li> I have a couple &amp; alternate use so that they dry out completely between uses.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive, and winter makes it all the worse.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing I could tell that I needed to buff away the dry build-up I was starting to experience but with dry, mature skin  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far easier to care for and deal with than the description and other reviews</li>
            <li> When you first open it, you think it is too hard to put on your face</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 so far (a regular sponge, a black sponge, and this sponge).</li>
            <li> like it has improved - dead skin has be sloughed away and a few dark spots are becoming lighter.</li>
            <li> The sponge is surprisingly gentle and soft though in the image on amazon makes it look tough.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin but with this sponge my skin never felt tight nor did I have my usual dry patches.</li>
            <li> been using for a few days and so far i like it.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive, and this was still a bit abrasive to use everyday.</li>
            <li> Product received extremely damaged, almost completely cut in half.</li>
            <li> I also put on bio oil because of my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> It has taken care of the dry itchy patches I had.</li>
            <li> If my face is dry</li>
            <li> I always use a sponge to clean my face but, lately, the red sponges I&#x27;ve been ordering have been too thick and rough.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use harsh, abrasive exfoliants due to sensitive skin and rosacea.</li>
            <li> How long do I continue &amp;#34;sponging&amp;#34; my face: 10 sec.?</li>
            <li> Has helped my dry skin, got rid of the rough patches.  </li>
            <li> However, is it used on dry skin or wet skin?</li>
            <li> Not sure what to expect, I decided to use this product daily for several weeks before reviewing....</li>
            <li> should the red clay one be a little moist out of the pkg?</li>
            <li> Want to order the little ones next !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;s supposed to last.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long this will last</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t swell up as you might expect when you wet it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These sponges are smoother and not so rough on my face.</li>
            <li> Do I let the sponge and water do all my facial cleaning...even the removal of heavy makeup?&lt;br /</li>
            <li> 30 sec?</li>
            <li> I used to be harsh on my skin with face cloths but using a product like this, I have seen definite improvements in flakiness.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on the red clay!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this sponge for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have not really noticed a difference between the colors.</li>
            <li> , not sure it makes a difference, but, the red clay and the green tea were different in their packages.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and can see that it does work well to exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> I do hope to try the other types of Konjac sponges.</li>
            <li> Did not like it, used every other day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only been a few days!</li>
            <li> I plan on trying the other types as well, and getting some for my kids.</li>
            <li> total waste of money!</li>
            <li> It has an odd jelly like texture when wet</li>
            <li> And, if you worked on your skin for a little too long, it will feel a little tender.  </li>
            <li> I have such a hard time with skin products but the Konjac sponge has helped.</li>
            <li> The red clay was hard as a rock from the pkg.</li>
            <li> The Konjac Sponge is the simplest to use and least drying facial cleanser that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> After trying this for a few days there is less flaking and my pores seem cleaner.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but they last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other konjac sponges in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give it a little longer to see whether I&#x27;ll upgrade the rating to five stars because I want to see if it gets rid of the redness I have on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer and had a little glow to it after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when this arrived, as it seemed so hard and rough.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that it might be too thin.</li>
            <li> sticking with the green tea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Have tried the green clay and charcoal ones as well.</li>
            <li> It did soften when wet, but it made me feel like it had been old already, since it went bad in so few days.</li>
            <li> Im not really sure what this is supposed to do  </li>
            <li> they cleanse and exfoliate without being harsh!  </li>
            <li> but a hand towel would serve as well if not better</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Some sellers also include a small suction cup with hook</li>
            <li> Getting my boys to wash their faces is next to impossible, but using these is something they can do without complaining.</li>
            <li> It only made it worse and it looked like I had a bad food allergy.</li>
            <li> but, nah, I&#x27;m too chicken to waste another 10 bucks...</li>
            <li> I am finding it difficult to offer any praise for this sponge...</li>
            <li> typically winters are brutal.</li>
            <li> She is 54 and suffers from hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> was just brutal on my face.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had been suffering from terrible breakouts out of nowhere.</li>
            <li> This product was pathetic!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This sponge is great! I&#x27;ve used other konjac sponges in the past but I like the way this one feels on my skin. It&#x27;s not too rough and it exfoliates really well with the added benefit of red clay. I use it in combination with my facial cleanser. So far my skin looks like it has improved - dead skin has be sloughed away and a few dark spots are becoming lighter. My skin is also very sensitive and I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Have the BEST FACIAL EVER every day &amp;amp; night in the comfort of your own home! This Konjac Sponge does just that! Gives you a personal facial every time you use it! I&#x27;ve used it myself after having a facial at a class Spa. Then I purchased one for each family member and friends who I loved! You, too, will love it!&lt;br /&gt;Francine</li>
            <li> I needed something to exfoliate my skin after running out of my last container of scrub. I didn&#x27;t want to buy more scrub so I did some research and found the Konjac sponges.I must admit I didn&#x27;t expect a sponge to leave my skin feeling as clean as the scrub I used, which is no longer available anyway. I&#x27;ve had the sponge for about two weeks now. I use it every other day and can see that it does work well to exfoliate my skin. I&#x27;d like to give it a little longer to see whether I&#x27;ll upgrade the rating to five stars because I want to see if it gets rid of the redness I have on my cheeks. I do want to say that the company deserves five stars for their customer service. I appreciate when I get an email asking if I have any concerns and would I please leave some feedback. I would like to say that I do not have any issues with the size of the sponge. It fits my hand well. My only concern is that it might be too thin. I do hope to try the other types of Konjac sponges.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 so far (a regular sponge, a black sponge, and this sponge). The best way to polish your face that I can think of. I have apricot scruff which tends to acerbated my rosacea. This product doesn&#x27;t and my face is left refreshed and glowing. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This sponge is just ok. It&#x27;s gentle but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference between using this or a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Has helped my dry skin, got rid of the rough patches.  I have small blood vessels showing due to liver issues and most products irritate my skin, this sponge doesn&#x27;t.  Would recommend to anyone with mature or problem skin.  I will be buying this sponge again.  :)</li>
            <li> Good product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> SUCH a soothing sponge. I use it for makeup removal, clay face mask removal, and my spot moisturizing technique!</li>
            <li> Works great.  I have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate it at all.  It gentle but effective for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Im not really sure what this is supposed to do  I use it to wash my face with my regular cleanser. I have no complaints with it , just not a 5 star</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to using this. I have rosacea and pretty rough dry skin - typically winters are brutal. The sponge is surprisingly gentle and soft though in the image on amazon makes it look tough. I&#x27;m not sure of what time of magic they put into the clay that when you buff your face with this you feel clean but also feel moisturized. It&#x27;s really strange but worth trying. It doesn&#x27;t swell up as you might expect when you wet it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I felt like I was getting a good enough clean with my bare hands and using really warm water was just brutal on my face. You can use it with a face wash as well (I use clinque redness solution face wash) and the package says to change it every 3 months. I&#x27;ve never seen it stores so that&#x27;s why I picked one up here.</li>
            <li> Love it! My mature skin saw an improvement after only the first use. I use my regular facial soap first to remove makeup and follow up with the sponge.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd sponge purchased.  I actually got it for my mom...We love it!  Great texture, lasts a long time, feels great on skin.</li>
            <li> My skins dud feel softer for awhile. I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;s supposed to last.</li>
            <li> Love this facial sponge and plan on reordering it...</li>
            <li> I use chemical exfoliants and tretinoin everyday-which leads to skin flakes. This sponge takes care of them gently with no irritation. It works great on my sensitive skin and I plan on using this from now on rather than abrasive skin scrubs. The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the shape it&#x27;s cut into. Its hard to get a good grip on it.</li>
            <li> These sponges are wonderful....they cleanse and exfoliate without being harsh!  They leave the texture of your skin very smooth and clear.&lt;br /&gt;I use Hada Labo and Boscia products from Japan.  The cleansers work wonderful with the sponges.</li>
            <li> Great addition to beauty...!</li>
            <li> Love this product! An effective and gentle exfoliator that leaves my skin softer and clearer.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product is nice. Next time I might order a more abrasive one, but this one is exactly as described and I am happy with my purchase. The seller sent a nice follow up note.</li>
            <li> This sponge is just what I had been searching for. It is not rough. Just let it absorb water, which only takes a few moments, and it is ready to use. It is not rough or harsh on my face at all - no abrasive feel - but gently scrubs my face. There is a string hanger to use for drying. I will buy this same product again.</li>
            <li> it is good on my sensitive skin but the design shape is odd and use on my facial skin is awkward at best when trying to apply the directed use.  i followed the process of keeping sanitized once a week in boiling water, on the daily use to moisten till soft prior to use.  using it for exfoliation is ok but a hand towel would serve as well if not better the konjac sponge is a good idea but the value is not there for me on this one.</li>
            <li> This is my second French Red Clay sponge...the first one finally &#x27;bit the dust&#x27;...and I liked it enough to buy it again. I&#x27;ve always used sponges to wash my face and bought natural sponges for years. These sponges are smoother and not so rough on my face.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of the konjac sponge; love love love it</li>
            <li> I love this sponge. It cleans my face and does not cause dryness. Shipping was quick. I will purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> I literally wanted to cry when I saw the results. I had been suffering from terrible breakouts out of nowhere. No product from high end to cheap drugstore could make it better. It only made it worse and it looked like I had a bad food allergy. I didn&#x27;t want to go out because it was so embarrassing to take pictures and have people close to see huge bumps, scabs, and redness... even with piles of makeup. I wish I would of had this sponge five years ago when I was in high school and had the same issue. It leaves my skin squeaky clean, exfoliates great, and helps my dry skin. I also put on bio oil because of my extremely dry skin. Perfect combo. I have my clean face back.</li>
            <li> I really do like fact that my skin feels smooth and soft after each use.</li>
            <li> I bought one about a month ago, love it, and have now bought two of the lighter pink ones for my daughter and two more of these darker pink ones for myself so I won&#x27;t be without when the first one wears out!  I have been using a complexion brush in the shower every morning for several years now, but it&#x27;s only since I started using this sponge every evening that my skin has evened out more and visible bumps are fading.  It&#x27;s far easier to care for and deal with than the description and other reviews make it sound.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge. It gently sloughs away dead skin on your face. You can feel the smoothness immediately. I will definitely continue to use this product. I will add to my Christmas list for friends and family.</li>
            <li> This is my second set of sponges.  I have rosacea sometimes and this makes my skin feel really clean, and yet doesn&#x27;t damage its sensitivity.  Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Nice big sponge, but dries overnight. Red spots on my cheek are going away after using only a couple weeks. I am really pleased with this product. Will purchase again and plan on encouraging my daughter&#x27;s to use.</li>
            <li> Awesome sponge. I have sensitive, dry, mature skin. This sponge does a great job making my skin feel like silk after washing off the day&#x27;s makeup. My skin products sink into my skin better. Will be trying the body sponge. Give your face a treat and try this sponge.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this one, and much gentler on my (aging) skin than the charcoal version.  Also appreciate this brand&#x27;s large size.  It&#x27;s a little awkward to use at first but the contouring and slim end works great for little spots I want to focus on.  I&#x27;m a recent convert to konjac sponges and am extremely pleased with the results.  I use it twice a day, morning and night, and it has softened and evened the surface of my skin.  I&#x27;ve also found that the key to preserving its life is not over-saturating it for use and then SUPER GENTLY squeezing excess moisture out before hanging to dry.  Treated my first one ever like a sea sponge and it crumbled in a week.  Oops.</li>
            <li> This is  an easy way to gently exfoliate and leaves face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Okay, but overpriced IMHO</li>
            <li> I do like this sponge a lot. My skin feel so soft and smooth after use. I just wish I had bought more because I&#x27;m going through them so fast.</li>
            <li> Love this!  My skin feels so soft and smooth after using this sponge, and for me, that is saying a lot!</li>
            <li> Shipped in a timely manner and works very well. I love that I can just use the sponge and no soap is needed, makes washing your face quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product snob and hoarder. This is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my face. It makes my face baby butt soft. The sponge is so amazingly soft I can&#x27;t believe it exfoliates. I will definitely be ordering again. And again.</li>
            <li> Love love love!! This is fantasic I got the red clay Konjac sponge and it works amazing best thing I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This was advertised for mature skin, but dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> This sponge works really well for me. I have such a hard time with skin products but the Konjac sponge has helped. It has taken care of the dry itchy patches I had. Now my face is soft and smooth, pores have gotten smaller too. I will defiantly continue to use this product and would recommend it as well.</li>
            <li> Worked great at sloughing off dead skin but yet gentle to not inflame the skin!</li>
            <li> While I liked how this made my skin feel ,it began to crumble and fall apart after only 2 weeks, and considering the price I expected it to last much longer.I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting!:(</li>
            <li> This sponge sounded good so I decided to try it.  Turns out it&#x27;s is great!  It really is soft and gentle on my skin.  I have been using it with my regular cleanser and am very happy.  Additionally it arrived very quickly.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product for dry, aging skin!</li>
            <li> Exceptional service. The sponge is gentle on my skin which is feeling very good. I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li> Works very well and my face felt smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have never seen anything quite like these sponges before.  I look forward to the clean and smooth feel of my skin after using mine.</li>
            <li> This sponge came highly recommended with a lot of reviews but it honestly does not remove any dead skin. It also does not remove any makeup at all without soap. This would only be good for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Did not like it, used every other day.</li>
            <li> I like it!...starting to notice a brighter smoother look</li>
            <li> I am finding it difficult to offer any praise for this sponge...probably--no, absolutely--because there are NO INSTRUCTIONS FOR ITS USE !!! You tell me how to take care of the sponge--nice; but you do not offer any instructions for its correct usage--not nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Konjac, what is the proper procedure for using the sponge on my face?&lt;br /&gt;  * Do I wash my face first? With foaming cleanser or cream or oil? Do I remove my makeup with any special cleanser?&lt;br /&gt;  * Do I let the sponge and water do all my facial cleaning...even the removal of heavy makeup?&lt;br /&gt;  * I know that the sponge should be well saturated with water before I use it. However, is it used on dry skin or wet skin? Cleaned skin or &amp;#34;as-is skin&amp;#34;?&lt;br /&gt;  * How long do I continue &amp;#34;sponging&amp;#34; my face: 10 sec.? 30 sec? 1 minute? 2 or 3 minutes? or ???&lt;br /&gt;  * Do I apply my skin care products immediately after sponging? or do I wait? for how long?&lt;br /&gt;  Normally, I first apply my toner, next--after waiting for the toner to dry--I apply a serum and my eye moisturizer, after a short wait--to allow the serum to be absorbed--&lt;br /&gt;  I apply my moisturizer--lotion with sunscreen for day and rich cream at  night. What do you recommend?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know you did not post any instructions on the product page; but, I thought/hoped I would find the answers when the product was delivered;  I DID NOT! Please correct this oversight or if you do have instructions located somewhere on the Web, let me know where to find them.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge! It feels amazing! I have already noticed an improvement in the softness and moisture in my skin and it&#x27;s only been a few days!</li>
            <li> I love this sponge. It leaves my skin very soft. I gave one to a friend and she loves it as well! Great product.</li>
            <li> Works Great for my face. Makes it nice and smooth and no break outs. I do use some soap with it.</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer and smoother after just one use!  Will definitely buy again and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Noticed helpful healing changes immediately on my 64-year old skin!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Love this! Gentle exfoliation, skin feels great after use. Even more exciting that it&#x27;s 100% natural. thanks!</li>
            <li> After I use it. My face feels like it is actually clean. It&#x27;s great for problem pores.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  Face felt softer and had a more even tone after just a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. Absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> A nice sponge that fits right in my hand and the pointed portion is great for getting your eye areas. I don&#x27;t use anything with it, just water. If I have makeup on, I will remove it first and then use the sponge on clean skin. It is easy on my old skin!</li>
            <li> This sponge is perfect for washing and gently exfoliating the face.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This product was pathetic! It had holes within few days of use and just didn&#x27;t feel right. I will never buy this again</li>
            <li> I absolutely love using the Konjac sponge.  Skin feels wonderful .</li>
            <li> Truly LOVE this product! Noticed a huge change in my skin in the first 48 hours!  Will order again :)</li>
            <li> I like this sponge, it&#x27;s very soft on my skin and a gently way to exfoliate. I used to be harsh on my skin with face cloths but using a product like this, I have seen definite improvements in flakiness. I think I was just over scrubbing before I started using this sponge. I have only used this type so I don&#x27;t know if there is a difference in say, the original v. red clay or anything like that.</li>
            <li> I have used several kinds of konjac sponges and these are by far the best. I have the red and it is wonderful for dry mature skin. It does an excellent job while being gentle. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this sponge at all. It was the first red clay one I&#x27;ve used and was unimpressed. Not only did it not perform as described, it developed that mildew scent within the first week, despite gently but thoroughly squeezing the water out and hanging it by its string after rinsing. I LOVED the green tea one, so thought I&#x27;d try the red clay one, since it was described for maturing skin. The green tea one I got was the full sized one. It was awesome. It never did get the mildew scent and it lasted about 6 weeks with daily use on my face. I treated it (rinsing, squeezing hanging) exactly as I did the little red clay one. So, I&#x27;m pretty bummed I wasted my money on the red clay! I&#x27;m about to order the green tea one again to make myself feel better. I wanted to try the others, too, like the charcoal one... but, nah, I&#x27;m too chicken to waste another 10 bucks... sticking with the green tea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, not sure it makes a difference, but, the red clay and the green tea were different in their packages. The green one was slightly moist, lovely. The red clay was hard as a rock from the pkg. It did soften when wet, but it made me feel like it had been old already, since it went bad in so few days. should the red clay one be a little moist out of the pkg? Not sure.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!  Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This sponge is so easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t remove makeup, so I use it in the mornings when I wash my face. I like to use hot water with it, I feel like it opens my pores. I&#x27;ve recommended it to my sister. I plan on trying the other types as well, and getting some for my kids. Getting my boys to wash their faces is next to impossible, but using these is something they can do without complaining.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge; leaves skin soft.  Received it quickly too!</li>
            <li> An excellent product. Removes dead skin effectively and is a real bargain. i will buy again!</li>
            <li> Such an easy way to gently exfoliate. Doesn&#x27;t remove cosmetics without a cleanser, but I use it just before &amp;#34;toner/lotion&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great product! It&#x27;s so gentle that you think it can&#x27;t really be effective, but it is! My skin feels soft and looks clearer. Moisturizer goes on that much easier - just a hit! I bought one for my daughter, too, and she feels the same way. If there was on ething I&#x27;d like to see done differenty, it would be to supply a slightly strong string to hang the sponge with.</li>
            <li> I always use a sponge to clean my face but, lately, the red sponges I&#x27;ve been ordering have been too thick and rough.  I happened to see the Konjac red clay sponge somewhere on Amazon and decided to try. Don&#x27;t know if it really hydrates but it makes my skin feel great and I actually see a smoother appearance. I use it with a cleanser and it rinses clean. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I used this for about three weeks and loved it. My skin felt softer and had a little glow to it after just a few days. I have super dry skin but with this sponge my skin never felt tight nor did I have my usual dry patches. I was even able to buy a lighter moisturizer. I used it every day until I accidently bumped it on my way out the door and came home to find my dog tearing it apart...sigh... Anywho, I&#x27;m buying a few more now, two for me and one for my sisters. Love It!!</li>
            <li> Product received extremely damaged, almost completely cut in half. Not useable.</li>
            <li> Stick with it for a full 30 days and I believe you&#x27;ll notice a positive change in your skin. I also appreciate using this item has saved me time in my daily process. My husband is enjoying the one for oily skin I purchased for him.</li>
            <li> In the short period of time that I have been using the My Konjac facial sponge I can see a remarkable difference starting to take place in the condition of my skin. Before purchasing I could tell that I needed to buff away the dry build-up I was starting to experience but with dry, mature skin  I knew buffing or using a facial loofa would only cause more dryness or could even cause damage. After doing some research I decided to try the all natural french red clay sponge. I could see improvement immediately, dry patches were getting smaller with each use, there was less build-up of dead skin cells and my moisturizer absorbs into my face much better. Now it&#x27;s time to order the My Konjac All Natural French Red Clay body sponge. Great product, very affordable, thanks for solving my problem.</li>
            <li> Really like this for washing my face!</li>
            <li> Perfect texture for cleaning skin, not too firm and not too soft. Recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this sponge for a few weeks.  It&#x27;s gentle, but I like the fact that I get the benefit of some exfoliation.  I apply my cleanser and the use the dampened sponge to complete the cleansing process.  After using the sponge, I use a separate cloth to remove any excess cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping it holds up for several months as it says.  My skin feels soft and clean after use.</li>
            <li> been using for a few days and so far i like it. I will order again.</li>
            <li> All of the Konjac songes I have tried make me feel cleaner than anything else I have tried.  It is nice to have an especially fresh, clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Gentle exfoliation, but, I believe, effective.  i would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love my sponge, it is very soft yet exfoliates quite well. I use facial cleanser with it.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge. So soothing and yet makes my face feel so clean!</li>
            <li> great product for my dry skin. fast shipping. will&lt;br /&gt;buy again.</li>
            <li> My Konjac Sponge is very easy to use and my face feels really soft and clean.  The packaging is very good and easy to open.  The instructions are on the packaging and are very easy to read and follow.  Very good product, will keep in my shopping cart (under &amp;quot;save for later&amp;quot;) and will buy this product again from this company.</li>
            <li> I love using the sponge - my face definitely feels smoother.  I have a question - are you supposed to rinse your face after you use the sponge.  It does not say so on the package so do not rinse - after I sponge I apply my sun lotion and then my makeup.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.  While you are using it, it is gentle and you think it&#x27;s not doing much.  After you finish, you skin feels very soft.  And, if you worked on your skin for a little too long, it will feel a little tender.  It works!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous. Very soft yet does a great job.  I use it with or without a cleanser.  Want to order the little ones next !</li>
            <li> So happy to find this here on Amazon.  I have bought similar sponges locally where I live for a great deal more money, and this is the exact same product.  I love it, and love the results I get from washing my face with this sponge!</li>
            <li> I purchased the My Konjac Red Clay sponge and absolutely love it .  My skin feels really clean and soft after washing.&lt;br /&gt;thanks for making a great product!</li>
            <li> I have never been a towel or sponge user, but this sponge exfoliated very gently and leaves my skin soft. I cannot use harsh, abrasive exfoliants due to sensitive skin and rosacea. Thanks for this.&lt;br /&gt;This came with a name saying &amp;#34;enjoy your free gift but there was nothing in the box except the sponge which I paid to have. ???</li>
            <li> Not sure what to expect, I decided to use this product daily for several weeks before reviewing....I love it!!  It is gentle yet exfoliating and leaves my skin looking and feeling great.  I will be &#x27;gifting&#x27; these wonderful sponges to my daughter and close friends.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when this arrived, as it seemed so hard and rough. However, after getting it wet and using it the first time, I fell in love. It does take off the top layer of dry skin - or helps it slough off. Thus far I am very pleased</li>
            <li> exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> Is excellent! Leaves my skin moist and soft. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Most AMAZING facial product I have ever used!!  I have sensitive skin but this sponge is gentle yet incredibly effective.  It gets my face clean but is not at all abrasive and I have been using it morning and night for 10 days.  I also bought another sponge set from a different company that doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well or have the same texture is this red clay sponge.</li>
            <li> The Konjac Sponge is the simplest to use and least drying facial cleanser that I&#x27;ve tried. I no longer dread nightly removal of makeup  and dirt.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels clean and looks better than it has looked for months due to illness.</li>
            <li> Soft.  Dries fast.  Soothing to skin, not abrasive but does a great job in removing makeup , etc</li>
            <li> This was great for travel instead of packing yet another appliance with chargers, etc.&lt;br /&gt; -  gentle on my face.  Will buy again because it doesn&#x27;t take up any room and really does the job. My face felt and looked clean.</li>
            <li> These are excellent for cleaning your face - with or without a cleanser.  If my face is dry I don&#x27;t use a cleanser.  My face feels very soft after I use it.  I have a couple &amp; alternate use so that they dry out completely between uses.</li>
            <li> total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I am a busy mom trying to use pure and simple products on myself and baby. This sponge meets many needs and now is a go to gift for friends and family!!</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive, and this was still a bit abrasive to use everyday. I do enjoy using it every couple of days as a gentle exfoliant. When I bought this I was also hoping to find an alternative to cotton squares and washcloths to help remove tinted moisturizer or foundation when I occasionally wear it. However the couple of times I tried using it, even with a makeup remover, it didn&#x27;t seem like it removed much makeup at all. I still ended up having to use a cotton square to get the rest off. I love the fact that it is compostable, gentle, doesn&#x27;t leave pollute the waterways with little plastic beads.</li>
            <li> The Konjac sponge feels great on my face and I have noticed fewer breakouts and smooth skin. After trying my first sponge, I bought more. I guess that is the best recommendation I could make!</li>
            <li> I have skin which is sensitive with mild rosacea and it tends to get very dry and flake in the winter. After trying this for a few days there is less flaking and my pores seem cleaner. I have a Clairisonic but like this even better. It has an odd jelly like texture when wet but it feels very relaxing. I use just a dab of cleanser and it foams up well. I like the teardrop shape because it&#x27;s easy to remove makeup from the crevices alongside the nose. It has a short string/thread attached to hang for drying. Some sellers also include a small suction cup with hook but they did not include one here. Not sure how long this will last but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I had been using a Konjac facial sponge made by Boscia, I like this one much better - I find the shape is nicer in my hand and this company is cruelty free unlike Boscia who recently changed their policy.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this sponge because it leaves my face feeling clean without drying it, a feat in this harsh New England winter. The shape makes it easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> My mother uses this sponge twice a day, and she says it works great for her mature skin. She is 54 and suffers from hormonal acne. I also have a Konjac sponge with charcoal.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge. It is abrasive, but doesn&#x27;t over do it. Would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge! My skin is super sensitive, and winter makes it all the worse. I bought this sponge in hopes that it would provide light exfoliation and a bit of moisture to my skin. It does exactly that! My face feels very smooth and soft after I&#x27;ve used it, but I&#x27;m not all pink and irritated looking like I sometimes get after exfoliating. Love it.</li>
            <li> This sponge is a great gentle way to exfoliate the skin and leave it clean without stripping it if used with a nice natural cleanser. After I use the sponge I balance my skin&#x27;s Ph with an apple cider vinegar toner. Loved this!</li>
            <li> I have only used the sponge for a short time, but love the way my skin feels after using.  Plan to continue using.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges, they are the best!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I looked into konjac sponges after Dr. Jessica Wu, renowned dermatologist, recommended them. I&#x27;m extremely happy with My Konjac sponge. My face is clean following regular face washing and never irritated.  I have combination skin, konjac sponge has been doing a great keeping break outs and dry patches at bay.</li>
            <li> When you first open it, you think it is too hard to put on your face but once you put water on it ... it softens and feels so gentle on your face.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Good exfoliating sponge. Gets in all the corners well. I have not really noticed a difference between the colors. They are each supposed to do something different, but I don&#x27;t notice it. I have tried four different ones. A little expensive, but they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, works like a charm. Will order more from this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been exfoliating my skin for years. I starting using these facial sponges on a daily basis about a year ago. Great for dry, mature, somewhat sensitive skin. Leaves my skin soft &amp; smooth without any irritation.</li>
            <li> Love the product, price and service.</li>
            <li> Works great. Smooths skin and cleans so well. Definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges. Leaves my face feeling clean, soft and refreshed. Have tried the green clay and charcoal ones as well. Still deciding which works best for my skin type (mature, combination) - the green clay is the leader right now.</li>
    </ol>
