            <li>I liked this product at first.  </li>
            <li>I hope that they change the description to accurately portray what you will get.</li>
            <li>I used everything to help my combination, acne prone skin and nothing fit the bill.</li>
            <li>of the reviews will say FRAGRANCE FREE,</li>
            <li>Light, greaseless, and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>has a great low price for a four oz bottle.</li>
            <li>It is both fragrance free and has spf 15.</li>
            <li>its light to apply.</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>You know the old saying, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is?</li>
            <li>The original product page offered a pack of two 4oz.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t print out the original product page, so I had no proof of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lotion I have found to be heavier then the original formula.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much :)</li>
            <li>This moisturiser is great because it&#x27;s light and has very little fragrance.</li>
            <li>Now flushing on a black woman looks really attractive</li>
            <li>my face is sensitive, many kinds of cosmetics can&#x27;t be used.but</li>
            <li>I lathered on more of the stuff thinking that I needed more moisture, after a few days my temples started to turn bright red and my cheeks burned.</li>
            <li>Its light and gentle, but really moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>Great product/good price, hard to find in B&amp;M stores,&lt;br /&gt;like</li>
            <li>Most moisturizers irritate my skin or don&#x27;t provide enough moisture.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is smaller than I thought it&#x27;d be, but I love this formula.</li>
            <li>I am also allergic to sunscreen in most facial lotions, and this doesn&#x27;t have it in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shipment was greatly delayed, and had to be shipped separately from the other items I had ordered the same day.  </li>
            <li>Finally found it and was able to conduct a live chat with a customer service agent who offered a $4 refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great lotion but sometimes hard to find the sensitive skin formula</li>
            <li>It is also gentle on sunburned skin.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>I use it after chemical peels, and it is really soothing without the burn or irritation</li>
            <li>And if those three points weren&#x27;t enough, it has an easy to spread light texture that absorbs quickly without being heavy or sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have used this item for quite a long time but it is so easy to just order it and then wait for the delivery......</li>
            <li>i remember when i first used the sensitive lotion, i knew that this was the face moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without it during the winter!</li>
            <li>Less is more with this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It feels really silky and the scent is soft and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>it because it doesn&#x27;t have the normal smell and there</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is becoming difficult to find without the SPF in it which irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>The simple &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; formula with Zinc Oxide is less irritating and more pleasantly scented (unscented) that the newer formula.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and with out the fragrance in it, with less chemicals on your face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth, sinks into my skin, and has not caused a single breakout.</li>
            <li>option was out of stock, but it was clear that was an option</li>
            <li>but I will never go without my Olay sensitive while they still sell it.</li>
            <li>Because this Olay Sensitive skin moisturizing lotion truly does have it all.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>A 35-year old asked me,  &amp;#34;What&#x27;s your secret?&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It is a very light formula that leaves absolutely no greasy feeling, and it spreads so well that I only need a tiny dollop for my entire face.</li>
            <li>Switched to Cerave and my face went back to normal</li>
            <li>I started out using the regular lotion and at some point switched to sensitive.</li>
            <li>so for all the people out there in my similar position of REALLY sensitive skin, this is for you...</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion I have used so far on my face that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.</li>
            <li>Appears this is a bootleg version, and works ok</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and smooth without irritating it.</li>
            <li>No matter how tired I feel, I can look instantly refreshed with the light weight moisture from Olay for Sensitive Skin.  </li>
            <li>I have huge problems with facial lotions irritating my eyes and causing them to burn and water for hours.  </li>

            <li> it leaves my skin moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> I had the same issue as the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I think the other option on the same page was a pack of two 6oz.</li>
            <li> , it makes me break out in tiny little pimples</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58, and really don&#x27;t have a secret.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores likes other moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> other products can cause.  </li>
            <li> Lately, I can only find it online.</li>
            <li> It did not irritate my skin, but is not super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> had trouble figuring out how to contact customer service and had to google it.  </li>
            <li> so I use a few times a week.</li>
            <li> one-pack, then you email them, they ship the missing ones to you</li>
            <li> giving 4 starts because the bottle is small for the price I paid</li>
            <li> Guess not sensitive enough for me :(</li>
            <li> Can be hard to find in the supermarket.</li>
            <li> No SPF&#x27;s, I&#x27;m allergic and that is hard to find!  </li>
            <li> Thank god Amazon sells this very hard to find product.  </li>
            <li> so if you don&#x27;t want unnecessary chemicals on your face, this is the moisturizer to get.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> (sorry, I know the review should reflect that!), but wanted to warn people about Amazon changing product pages.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I liked this product at first.  I put it on and it felt good.  Didn&#x27;t sting or have any fragrance, wasn&#x27;t greasy, etc.  I started getting these tiny bumps, almost like a heat rash across my forehead.  My skin began to discolor with this ungodly flush.  Now flushing on a black woman looks really attractive let me tell you.  I discontinued use and it went away.  So I guess I&#x27;m still looking for a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Most moisturizers irritate my skin or don&#x27;t provide enough moisture.  This is a really good balanced moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I can use on my face and for some reason all stores in Owasso Ok quit carrying it.  PLEASE do not stop making it available on amazon!!!  I will be buying it again and again.  Thank you so much :)</li>
            <li> This moisturiser is great because it&#x27;s light and has very little fragrance. Can be hard to find in the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Great face lotion that&#x27;s cheap. Compared to Eucerin, etc, this is just as good. A bit thinner and oilier than the high-end Olay products--but for a fraction of the price, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> been using this product for years.  happy to have it as a subscribe and save item.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and have been using this lotion (at my mom&#x27;s recommendation) ever since I was 12 or so. I started out using the regular lotion and at some point switched to sensitive. It is a very light formula that leaves absolutely no greasy feeling, and it spreads so well that I only need a tiny dollop for my entire face. One bottle lasts me years. I cannot live without it during the winter! It is also gentle on sunburned skin.</li>
            <li> The product is good. giving 4 starts because the bottle is small for the price I paid</li>
            <li> The bottle is smaller than I thought it&#x27;d be, but I love this formula. It&#x27;s very smooth, sinks into my skin, and has not caused a single breakout. Soooo nice!</li>
            <li> I had the same issue as the other reviewers.  The original product page offered a pack of two 4oz. bottles, which is what I ordered.  I think the other option on the same page was a pack of two 6oz. bottles for a different price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shipment was greatly delayed, and had to be shipped separately from the other items I had ordered the same day.  When I finally received the package, there was only one 4oz. bottle inside instead of 2.  I returned to the Amazon product page just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t going crazy and *did* see the product page list two bottles.  The option was greyed out and not selectable anymore, making it seem like the two pack 4oz. option was out of stock, but it was clear that was an option and I should&#x27;ve received an additional bottle.  I didn&#x27;t have time to figure out how to deal with the issue at the time (e.g., how to contact customer service), but when I did finally have time 1-2 weeks later, I discovered that Amazon CHANGED the product page so the 2 pack option isn&#x27;t reflected or offered anymore!  I didn&#x27;t think Amazon would do this.  I didn&#x27;t print out the original product page, so I had no proof of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had trouble figuring out how to contact customer service and had to google it.  Finally found it and was able to conduct a live chat with a customer service agent who offered a $4 refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t had the chance to try the product yet (sorry, I know the review should reflect that!), but wanted to warn people about Amazon changing product pages.  You may want to consider printing copies of the product page if it involves a quantity greater than 1.</li>
            <li> Can be a tad oily so I use a few times a week. Great for when your skin is thirsty</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin. It did not irritate my skin, but is not super moisturizing. Good for daytime wear though.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer for acne prone skin</li>
            <li> the lotion is very good.I like it.since my face is sensitive, many kinds of cosmetics can&#x27;t be used.but the olay moisturizing lotion is just good for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and was purchasing it at Wal - mart; however Wal - mart stopped carrying this at my local store. I used everything to help my combination, acne prone skin and nothing fit the bill. I was so happy to find this here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the reviews will say FRAGRANCE FREE, so for all the people out there in my similar position of REALLY sensitive skin, this is for you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I must say the formula has changed. The lotion I have found to be heavier then the original formula. I am also allergic to sunscreen in most facial lotions, and this doesn&#x27;t have it in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> Thank god Amazon sells this very hard to find product.  It&#x27;s the best moisturizing lotion on the market today. Not greasy, no breakouts etc.  It&#x27;s light and with out the fragrance in it, with less chemicals on your face.  No SPF&#x27;s, I&#x27;m allergic and that is hard to find!  But the best part of this is your skin has less wrinkles and looks great.  Less is more with this moisturizer.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff since I was a teenager, I&#x27;m now 59 and although I have my fair share of wrinkles, I don&#x27;t look like the crypt keeper either. I now supplement with a night cream but I will never go without my Olay sensitive while they still sell it. I have problems with SPF anything, it makes me break out in tiny little pimples so if you don&#x27;t want unnecessary chemicals on your face, this is the moisturizer to get.</li>
            <li> I have huge problems with facial lotions irritating my eyes and causing them to burn and water for hours.  This is the only lotion I have used so far on my face that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion since I was a Teenager. If you have sensitive skin this lotion is awesome for your face. They also have it with a sunscreen added but that one doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin. Great lotion but sometimes hard to find the sensitive skin formula I&#x27;m so glad I found this on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon :).</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Have used this item for quite a long time but it is so easy to just order it and then wait for the delivery......love online shopping!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. Its light and gentle, but really moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this product - we have had it shipped automatically now for several years.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer</li>
            <li> The order says pack of 2, but when i received and opened the order there was only one. This is something different from what i ordered. Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Always my favorite. Light, greaseless, and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Olay never disappoints!  Been using all my life and my skin is not the same when I don&#x27;t use oil of olay.  I love it always!</li>
            <li> You know the old saying, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is? This defies that saying, nay it tosses that saying out on its head. Because this Olay Sensitive skin moisturizing lotion truly does have it all.&lt;br /&gt;It has a great low price for a four oz bottle. It is both fragrance free and has spf 15. And if those three points weren&#x27;t enough, it has an easy to spread light texture that absorbs quickly without being heavy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Really, this is all that and a bag of chips.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 and have been using this product for years. It keeps my skin soft and smooth without irritating it. Lately, I can only find it online. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive moisturizers, but I always come back to this....it does the best for my skin.</li>
            <li> AWESOME.  Get for sunburns also</li>
            <li> No matter how tired I feel, I can look instantly refreshed with the light weight moisture from Olay for Sensitive Skin.  The simple &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; formula with Zinc Oxide is less irritating and more pleasantly scented (unscented) that the newer formula.  It is also a great gently way to remove remnants of eye makeup.</li>
            <li> i remember when i first used the sensitive lotion, i knew that this was the face moisturizer for me. its light to apply. it really don&#x27;t have a smell to it, which that is good. it leaves my skin moisturized all day long. it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores likes other moisturizers do. it leaves my face shiny and bright.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.  I use it after chemical peels, and it is really soothing without the burn or irritation other products can cause.  No shine, matte.</li>
            <li> Great product/good price, hard to find in B&amp;M stores,&lt;br /&gt;like it because it doesn&#x27;t have the normal smell and there&lt;br /&gt;is no SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered two 2-packs but only received 2 bottles when should have&lt;br /&gt;received 4.&lt;br /&gt;Emailed amazon via this website and they immediately responded&lt;br /&gt;and shipped out 2 more bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a lot of these amazon 2-pack products end up shipping as&lt;br /&gt;a one-pack, then you email them, they ship the missing ones to you&lt;br /&gt;and, eventually, they fix the issue and start shipping the correct&lt;br /&gt;quantity.</li>
            <li> Not Olay quality and packaging doesn&#x27;t measure up to what it should. Appears this is a bootleg version, and works ok but quality isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face moisturized without feeling greasy or causing a breakout. I have combination skin.</li>
            <li> I love it. It feels really silky and the scent is soft and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I get this comment a lot...and just tonight, it happened again.  A 35-year old asked me,  &amp;#34;What&#x27;s your secret?&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m 58, and really don&#x27;t have a secret.  I told her I use Oil of Olay...mail order from Amazon.com.  But I don&#x27;t think she believes me.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> Started out great but developed some kind of rash after 2 weeks. My cheeks started to itch uncontrollably and flake and peel. I lathered on more of the stuff thinking that I needed more moisture, after a few days my temples started to turn bright red and my cheeks burned. Switched to Cerave and my face went back to normal (act even smoother than before) in 5 days. Guess not sensitive enough for me :(</li>
            <li> Olay always good.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is becoming difficult to find without the SPF in it which irritates my skin. So I&#x27;m pleased to be able to find it here. However, the description on this product says \\&quot;pack of 2\\&quot;, but only one bottle is delivered. I hope that they change the description to accurately portray what you will get.</li>
