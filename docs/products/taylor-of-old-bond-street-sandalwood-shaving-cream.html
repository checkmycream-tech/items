            <li>Works up to a really good lather and allows for a great clean shave.</li>
            <li>Smells great, lathers up easily</li>
            <li>This cream smells great and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>One of the best I&#x27;ve tried, and at a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>I have experienced some of the smoothest shaves using this product and my skin is left in great shape with no irritation.</li>
            <li>It also left my face feeling awesome.</li>
            <li>Better than the stuff at that fancy shaving store at a fraction of the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the shaving soaps yet, but most people say the creams are much better.</li>
            <li>It lathers quickly and nicely.  </li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond is a great product.  </li>
            <li>so the price is more than justified.</li>
            <li>, I get a smoother and more comfortable shave with Taylor.</li>
            <li>Lathers very well will a small amount, provides excellent protection against razor burn, and smells great.</li>
            <li>Ok great product handles great, lathers great, burns the crap out of my face.  </li>
            <li>I like the cucumber scent better, but this was an adequate substitute when that wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>He says it lathers great, feels much better than cheaper soaps, smells great, and these last for a very long time.</li>
            <li>and I got it for a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, protects the face very well and leaves</li>
            <li>Make sure you first see if you&#x27;re allergic to this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this (and many of the other)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lathers good but be sure to use hot water on your shaving brush and enough of it.  </li>
            <li>, cool feel on the face.</li>
            <li>Good as a barbershop shave in your own home--very high quality high grade English Shaving cream--doesn&#x27;t give you a mountain of lather</li>
            <li>It is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have a thick and wide-spread beard to shave, but I use sparingly (an amount about the size of my pinky-finger fingernail) and working up a good rich lather with a brush.  </li>
            <li>Try to find a sample or a friend with it first before you pony up 15$</li>
            <li>He was overseas at the time, and bought himself something cheaper when he ran out as I wasn&#x27;t aware he was running low and didn&#x27;t send him more, but I plan to buy him more of this when his current soap is used.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My first time trying the Taylor of Old Bond Street brand, and they did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>Only got better when I moved my regimen of the almost daily shave into my shower.</li>
            <li>Not an overbearing odor just nice subtle pleasant fragrance that lasts a few short hours.</li>
            <li>More expensive than most, I normally don&#x27;t pay so much for a shaving cream, but got an unexpected bonus and went for it.  </li>
            <li>No problem as this works very well with a slightly damp brush touching the soap and a little tiny dab goes a very long way and lathers very nicely.</li>
            <li>That should be all you need enough of an endorsement right there.  </li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m anxious to try more from this historic brand.</li>
            <li>All you need is just a bit to create a thick rich lather for shaving.</li>
            <li>It builds up a thick lather quickly with ease.</li>

            <li> Taylor of Old Bond is a great product.  However, the product I received was not in good condition.  The shaving cream had hardened and was very difficult to apply.  When I purchased the product in the past the cream had the consistancy of dense foam, which I believe to be normal.</li>
            <li> Product arrived and it was not in cream form but hard in the bottom of the jar. No problem as this works very well with a slightly damp brush touching the soap and a little tiny dab goes a very long way and lathers very nicely. I thought it was not going to be what I wanted but I am very happy with the purchase and I got it for a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream. Lathers very well will a small amount, provides excellent protection against razor burn, and smells great. One of the best I&#x27;ve tried, and at a reasonable cost.  One tub of this will last you a long time. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a while and have gone through several tubs of it.  It is now &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers good but be sure to use hot water on your shaving brush and enough of it.  Sooths skin while you shave.&lt;br /&gt;Enough said.</li>
            <li> Good as a barbershop shave in your own home--very high quality high grade English Shaving cream--doesn&#x27;t give you a mountain of lather but it doesn&#x27;t need to</li>
            <li> This is a great product with an awesome scent.  It provided great cushion and protection while I shave.  It also left my face feeling awesome.</li>
            <li> The tubs of shaving cream last me about a year. I have a thick and wide-spread beard to shave, but I use sparingly (an amount about the size of my pinky-finger fingernail) and working up a good rich lather with a brush.  Smells great.  I have been buying this product 5-6 years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend! I have been using this shave cream for three years. A little bit goes a long way; one jar lasts about six months so the price is more than justified. I have experienced some of the smoothest shaves using this product and my skin is left in great shape with no irritation. Get yourself a good quality shave brush and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> I havew been using this product for over 20 years.  That should be all you need enough of an endorsement right there.  All you need is just a bit to create a thick rich lather for shaving.</li>
            <li> Ok great product handles great, lathers great, burns the crap out of my face.  I would recommend this product to other people who know they don&#x27;t have irritation with sandalwood but I need to rate it low so people will read this.  Make sure you first see if you&#x27;re allergic to this stuff.  You might be.  Try to find a sample or a friend with it first before you pony up 15$</li>
            <li> Better than the stuff at that fancy shaving store at a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Use it every day and it provides me with great shave.  I also like the way that it smells after I&#x27;m through</li>
            <li> This is great shaving cream. Works up to a really good lather and allows for a great clean shave. I like the cucumber scent better, but this was an adequate substitute when that wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li> Wonderful rich shaving cream with a great scent. The sandalwood and oils is soothing</li>
            <li> This shaving cream lives up to its name.  More expensive than most, I normally don&#x27;t pay so much for a shaving cream, but got an unexpected bonus and went for it.  It is worth it.  It lathers quickly and nicely.  The lather is slick and protective.  I also like the container.</li>
            <li> This cream smells great and goes on smooth. It builds up a thick lather quickly with ease. My first time trying the Taylor of Old Bond Street brand, and they did not disappoint. I&#x27;m anxious to try more from this historic brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with a few other items to start my husband off when he decided to start shaving old fashioned. He says it lathers great, feels much better than cheaper soaps, smells great, and these last for a very long time. He was overseas at the time, and bought himself something cheaper when he ran out as I wasn&#x27;t aware he was running low and didn&#x27;t send him more, but I plan to buy him more of this when his current soap is used.</li>
            <li> Recommend this items to any man that shaves. It leaves a great, long-lasting scent. I don&#x27;t intend on using any other product again.</li>
            <li> barbasol &amp;#60; shaving soap (glycerine or cream soap) &amp;#60; shave gel out of a can &amp;#60; proraso &amp;#60; Taylor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for a couple months now and I purchased it with a variety of soaps from colonel conk and some proraso shaving creams. I get razor burn when I use the soaps and I don&#x27;t when I use Taylor or proraso. I am not going to bother talking about barbasol or shave gel because I believe everyone can figure that out with a trip to Wal Mart in your 3 wolf moon t-shirt. I have used my double edged razor and the cartridges I have left over from my sensor excel. The change did not prevent the razor burn with the soaps. My conclusion is that soaps don&#x27;t work for me and between proraso and Taylor, I get a smoother and more comfortable shave with Taylor. Too bad it&#x27;s so expensive. It does appear that it will last for months though.</li>
            <li> awesome smell and economical shaving cream</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this (and many of the other) Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream. Only got better when I moved my regimen of the almost daily shave into my shower.</li>
            <li> Smells great, lathers up easily, cool feel on the face. I haven&#x27;t used the shaving soaps yet, but most people say the creams are much better. Give it a try. Not an overbearing odor just nice subtle pleasant fragrance that lasts a few short hours.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells amazing, protects the face very well and leaves you&#x27;re skin feeling good. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
