            <li>I have received so many compliments wearing this scent!</li>
            <li>good product and arrives fast and packaged very good.</li>
            <li>a nice blend I ve never tried before...</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t tell him, because I want it to be my own scent, and have some mystery about me, that he doesn&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>my* kind of green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have always loved it &amp; glad to find it online with amason.com. will reorder.</li>
            <li>I received my product in a very timely manner and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>A favourite of a friend - she was thrilled</li>
            <li>I had to get my own.</li>
            <li>unanimously liked by everyone, this perfume comes handy when you cannot decide on what to buy.</li>
            <li>I love it and very glad Amazon carries it</li>
            <li>I love, love, love, LOVE wearing Alfred Sung because that is truly some good smelling stuff!</li>
            <li>This is a nice floral scent that is suitable for both day and evening wear</li>
            <li>Suitable to wear to work place also.</li>
            <li>A great value, but it did seem that it might not be a fresh bottle....smelled like it might have lost some of its fragance to me.</li>
            <li>It is a good addition to make it a Happy New Year.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery!</li>
            <li>The hole is microscopic or very fine needle size hole to provide misting.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a Xmas gift and was very pleased that it was shipped so quickly!</li>
            <li>, it seems to have been embraced by its user, a very nice and dignified sweet lady, who either way is always gracious enough to make one feel they have bought the best there is.</li>
            <li>Most scents don&#x27;t stay and that&#x27;s what I loved about the original SUNG.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent.  </li>
            <li>i just want to say that this may have been one of the most satisfying consumer experiences that i have ever had.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li>The perfume they sell is made in the USA which I think is better because the fragrance lasts longer, then the one made in Cananda.</li>
            <li>Love the Sung</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and get many compliments about the scent when I wear it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite fragrance for many years.  </li>
            <li>I still love it and get many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>The product was packaged in an appropriate manner to insure safe handling in the transport.</li>
            <li>So I did some research in Internet and found the top 10-15 perfume brands.</li>
            <li>So I decided to have have these in my favorite picks hereafter.</li>
            <li>I love shopping at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and had to buy some for myself.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it here.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love you, Alfred Sung, but not your namesake perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is my most favorite fragrance of all time.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my wife, her favorite.</li>
            <li>Wife reports many compliments when she wears it.</li>
            <li>But Amazons price has made me fall in love with this scent again.</li>
            <li>This is one of my daughter&#x27;s favorite scents.</li>
            <li>Love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I have been asked many many times by men and women</li>

            <li>Love this fragrance...</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the scent of this perfume</li>
            <li>It is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I searched several websites for this product, and found Amazon to have the best pricing.  </li>
            <li>While the website photo showed the authentic bottle, I worried my wife would not be impressed if the bottle looked different to what she was accustomed to.  </li>
            <li>news, the bottle was the authentic design, and the fragrance smells correct, so everything worked out according to plan.  </li>
            <li>The sprayer piece that is visible in the top vertical slot does not have a through hole.  </li>
            <li>and so many retailers have discontinued it.</li>
            <li>and I love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>This one seemed to have more of an alcohol smell to it.  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Sung by Alfred Sung is my favorite fragrance of all times.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.  </li>

            <li>I was glad to find it.</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>and I get more compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sophisticated and sexy.  </li>
            <li>then I use to love the scent of Alfred Sung.</li>

            <li>This is my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>The perfume is just okay in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Should have had a better idea of the scent before purchase.</li>
            <li>I wore this cologne more than 20 years ago</li>
            <li>I love wearing timeless scents and this happened to be one of my favs.  </li>

            <li>I have received many compliments over the years on this scent.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and used to wear it often but the price was much more.</li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my mother-in-law as a gift,she loves it and has been wearing  Sung for many years.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>

            <li>I was also happy that it came in a sealed plastic wrap around the box because some of the sights do not have this type of packaging as they only offer \\&quot;sample\\&quot; type bottles that you see in Department stores as \\&quot;testers\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Great for a romantic scent.</li>
            <li>It is light and lasts.</li>
            <li>Great for a brief hour of scent.</li>
            <li>Fresh, floral, feminine and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>i bought this for my mom for christmas... such a great deal.  </li>
            <li>What a great birthday present</li>
            <li>Light, floral and never over powering so</li>
            <li>I received Sung (by Alfred Sung) as a gift many years ago and was really surprised to see that it is still available (considering that so many of my favorite 80&#x27;s fragrances have been discontinued).</li>
            <li>This fragrance is delightfully light and airy with a hint of scent.  </li>
            <li>continue to make available</li>
            <li>All I can say, is that she has repeatedly thanked me because she not only liked the fragrance, but she has also been asked repeatedly &amp;#34;what&#x27;s this nice perfume</li>
            <li>Have used Sung for 30 years - loved it back then and still love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it, good fluid for work, not too smelly.</li>
            <li>This is one ot the most erotic, heady scents [in my opinion, obviously].  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get my favorite perfume at such a good price.  </li>
            <li>Its light and clean</li>
            <li>I want excited to find this item.</li>
            <li>Original packaging, 1/3 the cost of buying in a majoy department store.  </li>
            <li>the original designed bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I can not find it any where any more Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Sure beats buying it at the department store for twice as much!</li>
            <li>but it is unique</li>
            <li>I love Amazon for making it available at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>Totally my fault not anything to do with the design or quality started using it again and remembered how much I liked it so bought more</li>
            <li>It just smells clean without knocking you over.  </li>
            <li>so it holds a special place in my heart.  </li>
            <li>I remember this fragrance smelling different but this is very good last all day and it is refreshing</li>
            <li>I also liked the smell of these perfumes when I approached near my Girl friend.</li>
            <li>I love Sung, my guy friend always wants to know the name of my perfume.</li>
            <li>bottle has simple lines and is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Long-lasting, light fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>only have  good comments for the product and Amazon&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things to say about this fragrance.</li>
            <li>One of the more reasonable places to buy this  perfume  from</li>
            <li>Just make sure you are getting the real thing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but I just remember it smelling fresher and lighter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend buying this product, because you will get much more than your money is worth!</li>
            <li>I did not like the scent when I first started wearing it as is was quite strong when applied.  </li>
            <li>Its not to floral or sweet, just a fresh clean smell to it.</li>
            <li>Just so fresh and clean...</li>
            <li>So I boldly ordered these perfumes and presented to my Girl Friend.</li>
            <li>It was an awesome deal for such a big bottle.</li>
            <li>I am VERY particular as strong perfumes and after shaves nauseate me.  </li>
            <li>have worn sung since 87 love it and live in fear</li>
            <li>If u don&#x27;t mind the perfume without the box, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>it is fresh and feminine without being to floral or overbearing.</li>
            <li>I receive several nice compliments when I wear this.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the fragrance and have kept coming back to it for many years.</li>
            <li>Hmmm, fresh.</li>
            <li>own personal taste &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I finally bought my own bottle of Alfred Sung some years ago, then a friend bought me some for Xmas</li>
            <li>Soft and memorable.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a present for a sophisticated lady who had not been familiar with it.</li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS RIGHT</li>
            <li>The price was right and it met my needs</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>It is just the right size.</li>
            <li>It was just the right price too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find now, so when I saw it on Amazon for such a great price I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on it and people are usually curious as to where I found it since it really isn&#x27;t in stores anymore:).  </li>
            <li>I have used Sung for many, many years and even though I occasionally try different scents I always come back to my favorite!  </li>
            <li>FAR MORE REASONABLE THAN THE DEPARTMENT STORES.</li>
            <li>Sung is bright, fresh, Spring green.</li>
            <li>As usual, Amazon delivered a great product - exactly what was shown.</li>
            <li>super deal and shipped amazingly fast.  </li>
            <li>She used it and screamed that she likes these perfumes very much.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a beautiful subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>I have used Alfred Sung for many years, but this bottle isn&#x27;t the same.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Many of the compliments she gets come from her male co-workers.  </li>
            <li>If it arrived in a different designed bottle, to me that would not be an authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had many bottles over the years and try many different brands but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>In addition the smell when first sprayed was not the smell after wearing it for a while</li>
            <li>Everywhere that I go, everyone wants to know what perfume I&#x27;m wearing!</li>
            <li>I will certainly be back for more when I need it.</li>
            <li>Dillards was the first department store to sell it</li>
            <li>This is her favorite scent, in fact, the only one she wears.</li>
            <li>I love it and am constantly being asked what I am wearing by women and men alike!!</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite back when it was $50 a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I first bought for her in Mexico over 20 years ago</li>
            <li>Makes life good all the way round.</li>
            <li>Has a very distinct, classy yet sensous scent..</li>
            <li>When you can find a decent price on it, it&#x27;s worth having.</li>
            <li>and then I get that reminiscent feeling of why I loved it so much back then.  </li>
            <li>My go to gift every few years because I enjoy it as much as she does (maybe more).</li>
            <li>This perfume has been a favorite of mine for a long time.</li>
            <li>Not being overpowering, and lasting a decent amount of time, for the time being she remains pleased with Sung by Alfred Sung for Women, Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li>BUT IN THE LARGE SIZE THAT</li>
            <li>FOR ABOUT SIXTY DOLLARS I BOUGHT THREE LARGE SIZE BOTTLES.......AND RECEIVED THEM PROMPTLY IN THE MAIL.</li>
            <li>I was certainly amased when the bottled arrived</li>
            <li>and it is so LARGE...</li>
            <li>I enjoy the long lasting scent and my husband who knows I love perfume always notices when I am wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Original!!!!</li>
            <li>thanks again for delivering the goods</li>
            <li>Amazon sells it for a much lower price compared to department stores or perfume specialty stores.</li>
            <li>smells great...was delivered fast..</li>
            <li>...smell is too synthetic , it  lacks the gentle  fragrance of known competitors.</li>
            <li>THANKS.  </li>
            <li>really like the price</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely devine.</li>
            <li>OMG THIS IS A MUST BYE PERFUME FOR REAL IT</li>
            <li>THE SHIPPING WAS FAST AND BEFOR TIME</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, and item as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely keeping it even if to just lightly spray on bed linen.</li>
            <li>but my Mom really likes it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Not fruity or real flowery.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she loves it but not as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>that way I have always gotten the real thing.  </li>
            <li>my* kind of green.</li>
            <li>THAT kind of green, which immediately disqualifies it as *</li>
            <li>your* kind of green is LOV.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to many white florals.</li>
            <li>I started using it in my early 20s and still love it in my mid 30s.</li>
            <li>I wore this perfume 10 years ago and got more compliments than any other perfume I had worn.  </li>
            <li>Excited to finally find Sung!</li>
            <li>My daughters (now grown) love it and reminds them of me when they encounter it other places.</li>
            <li>I have had more compliments from both men and women when wearing this fragrance than any other.  </li>
            <li>Floral but not sweet, somewhat sophisticated.its my go-too because it  has no unpleasant under notes and is light, but lasts.</li>
            <li>I have been using Sung by Alfred Sung for years, it is a sweet flower scent that does not over power and will last all day</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that most stores don&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
            <li>Have used this perfume for many years and ordered previously from Amazon, but this manufacturing batch was defective.  </li>
            <li>Previous purchase but dropped it the spray broke off and had to pry off the top.</li>
            <li>This lily of the valley based fragrance has been a long-time favorite of mine, although it has gotten more difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>It has decent longevity, and is a bargain at this price.</li>
            <li>This is actually the only one that I wear and will get compliments most every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>I keep a steady supply for my wife at Christmas.  </li>
            <li>My classic favorite...timeless</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the black, plastic integrated spray on top ... not so much ... cheap &amp; tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ended up removing sprayer of old, empty bottle to install on top of new bottle.  </li>
            <li>Light not too sweet or floral, and different from all other perfumes.</li>
            <li>this was the exact product that i wanted, i love this fragrance, a little floral a little woodsy, shipped fast, and a great value for the money, as i have purchased this same fragrance elsewhere, for twice the cost and half the volume.</li>
            <li>but if you live in Alaska they&#x27;ll charge you shipping regardless.</li>
            <li>Smelled just like the new ones I just bought.</li>
            <li>THOUGHT I&#x27;D HAVE TO FIND A NEW COLOGNE.</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon with the problem and they graciously sent me a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>New in box.</li>
            <li>lasting soft fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>very very dissapointed with the cologne and the entire process with Amazon on this order.</li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering perfume from Amazon and it will not be the last.</li>
            <li>I had to change it with an old one!</li>
            <li>THE FRAGRANCE IS LITTLE BIT TOO STRONG</li>
            <li>When I received it, the color was much lighter ---- barely tinged &#x27;yellow&#x27; --- and I find that the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with me for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Since the perfume is not available, this works out just fine.</li>
            <li>Very soft, gentle scent that is definitely feminine and light, never overpowering, heavy, or offensive, even in close quarters like a car.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding this all time favorite of mine - it&#x27;s my signature spirng/summer scent</li>
            <li>Love it, but it is getting really hard to find in the retail stores.</li>
            <li>I even took the bottle to Nordstroms and had the salepeople smell my perfume compared to the sample bottle they had, and everyone clearly smelled the difference.  </li>
            <li>Parcel arrived swiftly despite ordar was placed near Christmas.</li>
            <li>It was classy then - and it&#x27;s classy now - a timeless scent that stands out among the characterless rest.</li>
            <li>Surprised her with it for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li>So, clearly Amazon is selling really old bottles for a discounted price.  </li>
            <li>It kinda drives me a bit wild...</li>
            <li>This is an old fragrance from Alfred Sung, but suits any occasion or outfit...</li>
            <li>This soft flowery fragrance will turn heads everywhere</li>
            <li>This was one of my old favorites.  </li>
            <li>the smell is not too loud.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that they no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li>It is not a heavy scent</li>
            <li>It is not strong -- soft and smells clean.</li>
            <li>A little too sweet and overpowering.</li>
            <li>have opened each bottle, which was too clear to be perfume, and there is not enough fragrance to notice especially&lt;br /&gt;After 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a rustic yet sweet hint to it though not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The scent is ok, but the scent is so weak, that it doesnt even last until I get to work.</li>
            <li>This is watered down and smells nothing remotely like the original.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the fragrance was different than the same eau de toilette spray that I purchased from Nordstroms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for at least 10 years, and being that it&#x27;s not a recent fragrance, it is hard to find at a good price.</li>
            <li>Most perfumes hang on you at least a little through out the day, this one does not.</li>

            <li> Although it is now available in the US, getting Sung through Amazon saves me quite a bit of money and that makes it even more delightful.  </li>

            <li> good product and arrives fast and packaged very good.</li>
            <li> a nice blend I ve never tried before...</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t tell him, because I want it to be my own scent, and have some mystery about me, that he doesn&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> my* kind of green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have always loved it &amp; glad to find it online with amason.com. will reorder.</li>
            <li> I received my product in a very timely manner and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> A favourite of a friend - she was thrilled</li>
            <li> I had to get my own.</li>
            <li> unanimously liked by everyone, this perfume comes handy when you cannot decide on what to buy.</li>
            <li> I love it and very glad Amazon carries it</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, LOVE wearing Alfred Sung because that is truly some good smelling stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a nice floral scent that is suitable for both day and evening wear</li>
            <li> Suitable to wear to work place also.</li>
            <li> A great value, but it did seem that it might not be a fresh bottle....smelled like it might have lost some of its fragance to me.</li>
            <li> It is a good addition to make it a Happy New Year.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery!</li>
            <li> The hole is microscopic or very fine needle size hole to provide misting.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a Xmas gift and was very pleased that it was shipped so quickly!</li>
            <li> , it seems to have been embraced by its user, a very nice and dignified sweet lady, who either way is always gracious enough to make one feel they have bought the best there is.</li>
            <li> Most scents don&#x27;t stay and that&#x27;s what I loved about the original SUNG.</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent.  </li>
            <li> i just want to say that this may have been one of the most satisfying consumer experiences that i have ever had.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li> The perfume they sell is made in the USA which I think is better because the fragrance lasts longer, then the one made in Cananda.</li>
            <li> Love the Sung</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and get many compliments about the scent when I wear it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for many years.  </li>
            <li> I still love it and get many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> The product was packaged in an appropriate manner to insure safe handling in the transport.</li>
            <li> So I did some research in Internet and found the top 10-15 perfume brands.</li>
            <li> So I decided to have have these in my favorite picks hereafter.</li>
            <li> I love shopping at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and had to buy some for myself.</li>
            <li> Glad to find it here.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Love you, Alfred Sung, but not your namesake perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is my most favorite fragrance of all time.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my wife, her favorite.</li>
            <li> Wife reports many compliments when she wears it.</li>
            <li> But Amazons price has made me fall in love with this scent again.</li>
            <li> This is one of my daughter&#x27;s favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  </li>
            <li> I have been asked many many times by men and women</li>
            <li> I love Alfred Sung Eau de Toilette I have used it  for about 15 years</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance...</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the scent of this perfume</li>
            <li> It is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I searched several websites for this product, and found Amazon to have the best pricing.  </li>
            <li> While the website photo showed the authentic bottle, I worried my wife would not be impressed if the bottle looked different to what she was accustomed to.  </li>
            <li> news, the bottle was the authentic design, and the fragrance smells correct, so everything worked out according to plan.  </li>
            <li> The sprayer piece that is visible in the top vertical slot does not have a through hole.  </li>
            <li> and so many retailers have discontinued it.</li>
            <li> and I love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> This one seemed to have more of an alcohol smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Sung by Alfred Sung is my favorite fragrance of all times.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> I love Sung.</li>
            <li> But I love the way she smells.</li>
            <li> good summer &amp; winter and always fresh</li>
            <li> I was glad to find it.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.</li>
            <li> and I get more compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sophisticated and sexy.  </li>
            <li> then I use to love the scent of Alfred Sung.</li>
            <li> Many men and women ask me what I&#x27;m wearing</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Memorable scent.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance.  </li>

            <li> I have used SUNG for years &amp; love it.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that Amazon carries it as Nordstrom &amp; Macy&#x27;s stopped selling it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is much more inexpensive, too.</li>
            <li> TOO AND SAFE PACK</li>
            <li> I AM ORDER MORE FOR SURE PERFUMESWORLD SOON</li>

            <li> My favorite scent of all time</li>
            <li> though I must admit that I detect a bit more gardenia now than I did before.  </li>
            <li> Unlike so many others it has staying power.</li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> The perfume is just okay in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Should have had a better idea of the scent before purchase.</li>
            <li> I wore this cologne more than 20 years ago</li>
            <li> I love wearing timeless scents and this happened to be one of my favs.  </li>

            <li> I will say it wears much better when you layer with it by using the body cream too.</li>
            <li> This is my sister&#x27;s favorite perfume/cologne which I can not find in any of the discount stores in my community.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses Sung and I was able to buy her some for Mother&#x27;s Day in no time at all.  </li>
            <li> and I still LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments over the years on this scent.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and used to wear it often but the price was much more.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t overpower, it draws you in and is appropriate for daytime, or even evening, wear.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother-in-law as a gift,she loves it and has been wearing  Sung for many years.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume and so does my mother so ordering it for both of us was convenient and the price was even better since it&#x27;s more costly in the stores.</li>

            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I would love to know where I can buy this Toilette spray</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, her favorite.</li>
            <li> you are  wearing?&amp;#34; As for me, I just loved its very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This came very fast and the price is good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent and lasts long.  </li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend it...and the price was FANTASTIC!!!  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments how fresh and nice it is.</li>
            <li> I get so many complements,a nice and mature fragrance, very exotic</li>
            <li> Great packaging, original box and lightning fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Nice floral scent, but looses strong scent quickly.</li>
            <li> Great soft scent.  </li>
            <li> light and refreshing scent</li>
            <li> Got here fast smells so good.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper on line and arrived promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Love this clean scent.</li>
            <li> Refreshingly spirited beautiful fragrance which lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> But this was by far, the best price for the size and delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> it is not always easy to find</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find it on Amazon and at a decent price, too.  </li>
            <li> I do not like strong perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I have loved this eau de toilette for a long time and buying it online sure beats going from store to store trying to find it!</li>
            <li> Have received many compliments as to its sweet mellow smell.</li>
            <li> Sweet but elegant, I&#x27;m so in love with the smile of it</li>
            <li> I know it says free shipping</li>
            <li> I was also happy that it came in a sealed plastic wrap around the box because some of the sights do not have this type of packaging as they only offer \\&quot;sample\\&quot; type bottles that you see in Department stores as \\&quot;testers\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Great for a romantic scent.</li>
            <li> It is light and lasts.</li>
            <li> Great for a brief hour of scent.</li>
            <li> Fresh, floral, feminine and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my mom for christmas... such a great deal.  </li>
            <li> What a great birthday present</li>
            <li> Light, floral and never over powering so</li>
            <li> I received Sung (by Alfred Sung) as a gift many years ago and was really surprised to see that it is still available (considering that so many of my favorite 80&#x27;s fragrances have been discontinued).</li>
            <li> This fragrance is delightfully light and airy with a hint of scent.  </li>
            <li> continue to make available</li>
            <li> All I can say, is that she has repeatedly thanked me because she not only liked the fragrance, but she has also been asked repeatedly &amp;#34;what&#x27;s this nice perfume</li>
            <li> Have used Sung for 30 years - loved it back then and still love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it, good fluid for work, not too smelly.</li>
            <li> This is one ot the most erotic, heady scents [in my opinion, obviously].  </li>
            <li> I was excited to get my favorite perfume at such a good price.  </li>
            <li> Its light and clean</li>
            <li> I want excited to find this item.</li>
            <li> Original packaging, 1/3 the cost of buying in a majoy department store.  </li>
            <li> the original designed bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I can not find it any where any more Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Sure beats buying it at the department store for twice as much!</li>
            <li> but it is unique</li>
            <li> I love Amazon for making it available at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> Totally my fault not anything to do with the design or quality started using it again and remembered how much I liked it so bought more</li>
            <li> It just smells clean without knocking you over.  </li>
            <li> so it holds a special place in my heart.  </li>
            <li> I remember this fragrance smelling different but this is very good last all day and it is refreshing</li>
            <li> I also liked the smell of these perfumes when I approached near my Girl friend.</li>
            <li> I love Sung, my guy friend always wants to know the name of my perfume.</li>
            <li> bottle has simple lines and is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Long-lasting, light fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> only have  good comments for the product and Amazon&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things to say about this fragrance.</li>
            <li> One of the more reasonable places to buy this  perfume  from</li>
            <li> Just make sure you are getting the real thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but I just remember it smelling fresher and lighter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend buying this product, because you will get much more than your money is worth!</li>
            <li> I did not like the scent when I first started wearing it as is was quite strong when applied.  </li>
            <li> Its not to floral or sweet, just a fresh clean smell to it.</li>
            <li> Just so fresh and clean...</li>
            <li> So I boldly ordered these perfumes and presented to my Girl Friend.</li>
            <li> It was an awesome deal for such a big bottle.</li>
            <li> I am VERY particular as strong perfumes and after shaves nauseate me.  </li>
            <li> have worn sung since 87 love it and live in fear</li>
            <li> If u don&#x27;t mind the perfume without the box, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> it is fresh and feminine without being to floral or overbearing.</li>
            <li> I receive several nice compliments when I wear this.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fragrance and have kept coming back to it for many years.</li>
            <li> Hmmm, fresh.</li>
            <li> own personal taste &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I finally bought my own bottle of Alfred Sung some years ago, then a friend bought me some for Xmas</li>
            <li> Soft and memorable.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for a sophisticated lady who had not been familiar with it.</li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS RIGHT</li>
            <li> The price was right and it met my needs</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> It is just the right size.</li>
            <li> It was just the right price too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find now, so when I saw it on Amazon for such a great price I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on it and people are usually curious as to where I found it since it really isn&#x27;t in stores anymore:).  </li>
            <li> I have used Sung for many, many years and even though I occasionally try different scents I always come back to my favorite!  </li>
            <li> FAR MORE REASONABLE THAN THE DEPARTMENT STORES.</li>
            <li> Sung is bright, fresh, Spring green.</li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon delivered a great product - exactly what was shown.</li>
            <li> super deal and shipped amazingly fast.  </li>
            <li> She used it and screamed that she likes these perfumes very much.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a beautiful subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> I have used Alfred Sung for many years, but this bottle isn&#x27;t the same.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Many of the compliments she gets come from her male co-workers.  </li>
            <li> If it arrived in a different designed bottle, to me that would not be an authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had many bottles over the years and try many different brands but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> In addition the smell when first sprayed was not the smell after wearing it for a while</li>
            <li> Everywhere that I go, everyone wants to know what perfume I&#x27;m wearing!</li>
            <li> I will certainly be back for more when I need it.</li>
            <li> Dillards was the first department store to sell it</li>
            <li> This is her favorite scent, in fact, the only one she wears.</li>
            <li> I love it and am constantly being asked what I am wearing by women and men alike!!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite back when it was $50 a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I first bought for her in Mexico over 20 years ago</li>
            <li> Makes life good all the way round.</li>
            <li> Has a very distinct, classy yet sensous scent..</li>
            <li> When you can find a decent price on it, it&#x27;s worth having.</li>
            <li> and then I get that reminiscent feeling of why I loved it so much back then.  </li>
            <li> My go to gift every few years because I enjoy it as much as she does (maybe more).</li>
            <li> This perfume has been a favorite of mine for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not being overpowering, and lasting a decent amount of time, for the time being she remains pleased with Sung by Alfred Sung for Women, Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li> BUT IN THE LARGE SIZE THAT</li>
            <li> FOR ABOUT SIXTY DOLLARS I BOUGHT THREE LARGE SIZE BOTTLES.......AND RECEIVED THEM PROMPTLY IN THE MAIL.</li>
            <li> I was certainly amased when the bottled arrived</li>
            <li> and it is so LARGE...</li>
            <li> I enjoy the long lasting scent and my husband who knows I love perfume always notices when I am wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Original!!!!</li>
            <li> thanks again for delivering the goods</li>
            <li> Amazon sells it for a much lower price compared to department stores or perfume specialty stores.</li>
            <li> smells great...was delivered fast..</li>
            <li> ...smell is too synthetic , it  lacks the gentle  fragrance of known competitors.</li>
            <li> THANKS.  </li>
            <li> really like the price</li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely devine.</li>
            <li> OMG THIS IS A MUST BYE PERFUME FOR REAL IT</li>
            <li> THE SHIPPING WAS FAST AND BEFOR TIME</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, and item as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely keeping it even if to just lightly spray on bed linen.</li>
            <li> but my Mom really likes it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Not fruity or real flowery.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it but not as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> that way I have always gotten the real thing.  </li>
            <li> my* kind of green.</li>
            <li> THAT kind of green, which immediately disqualifies it as *</li>
            <li> your* kind of green is LOV.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to many white florals.</li>
            <li> I started using it in my early 20s and still love it in my mid 30s.</li>
            <li> I wore this perfume 10 years ago and got more compliments than any other perfume I had worn.  </li>
            <li> Excited to finally find Sung!</li>
            <li> My daughters (now grown) love it and reminds them of me when they encounter it other places.</li>
            <li> I have had more compliments from both men and women when wearing this fragrance than any other.  </li>
            <li> Floral but not sweet, somewhat sophisticated.its my go-too because it  has no unpleasant under notes and is light, but lasts.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sung by Alfred Sung for years, it is a sweet flower scent that does not over power and will last all day</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that most stores don&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
            <li> Have used this perfume for many years and ordered previously from Amazon, but this manufacturing batch was defective.  </li>
            <li> Previous purchase but dropped it the spray broke off and had to pry off the top.</li>
            <li> This lily of the valley based fragrance has been a long-time favorite of mine, although it has gotten more difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> It has decent longevity, and is a bargain at this price.</li>
            <li> This is actually the only one that I wear and will get compliments most every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> I keep a steady supply for my wife at Christmas.  </li>
            <li> My classic favorite...timeless</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the black, plastic integrated spray on top ... not so much ... cheap &amp; tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ended up removing sprayer of old, empty bottle to install on top of new bottle.  </li>
            <li> Light not too sweet or floral, and different from all other perfumes.</li>
            <li> this was the exact product that i wanted, i love this fragrance, a little floral a little woodsy, shipped fast, and a great value for the money, as i have purchased this same fragrance elsewhere, for twice the cost and half the volume.</li>
            <li> but if you live in Alaska they&#x27;ll charge you shipping regardless.</li>
            <li> Smelled just like the new ones I just bought.</li>
            <li> THOUGHT I&#x27;D HAVE TO FIND A NEW COLOGNE.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon with the problem and they graciously sent me a new bottle.  </li>
            <li> New in box.</li>
            <li> lasting soft fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> very very dissapointed with the cologne and the entire process with Amazon on this order.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering perfume from Amazon and it will not be the last.</li>
            <li> I had to change it with an old one!</li>
            <li> THE FRAGRANCE IS LITTLE BIT TOO STRONG</li>
            <li> When I received it, the color was much lighter ---- barely tinged &#x27;yellow&#x27; --- and I find that the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with me for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Since the perfume is not available, this works out just fine.</li>
            <li> Very soft, gentle scent that is definitely feminine and light, never overpowering, heavy, or offensive, even in close quarters like a car.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this all time favorite of mine - it&#x27;s my signature spirng/summer scent</li>
            <li> Love it, but it is getting really hard to find in the retail stores.</li>
            <li> I even took the bottle to Nordstroms and had the salepeople smell my perfume compared to the sample bottle they had, and everyone clearly smelled the difference.  </li>
            <li> Parcel arrived swiftly despite ordar was placed near Christmas.</li>
            <li> It was classy then - and it&#x27;s classy now - a timeless scent that stands out among the characterless rest.</li>
            <li> Surprised her with it for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> So, clearly Amazon is selling really old bottles for a discounted price.  </li>
            <li> It kinda drives me a bit wild...</li>
            <li> This is an old fragrance from Alfred Sung, but suits any occasion or outfit...</li>
            <li> This soft flowery fragrance will turn heads everywhere</li>
            <li> This was one of my old favorites.  </li>
            <li> the smell is not too loud.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that they no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li> It is not a heavy scent</li>
            <li> It is not strong -- soft and smells clean.</li>
            <li> A little too sweet and overpowering.</li>
            <li> have opened each bottle, which was too clear to be perfume, and there is not enough fragrance to notice especially&lt;br /&gt;After 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a rustic yet sweet hint to it though not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The scent is ok, but the scent is so weak, that it doesnt even last until I get to work.</li>
            <li> This is watered down and smells nothing remotely like the original.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the fragrance was different than the same eau de toilette spray that I purchased from Nordstroms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for at least 10 years, and being that it&#x27;s not a recent fragrance, it is hard to find at a good price.</li>
            <li> Most perfumes hang on you at least a little through out the day, this one does not.</li>
            <li> I have been using Alfred Sung cologne for over 25 years, it is refreshing and delicate not overwhelming .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smell &amp; long lasting</li>
            <li> OK,to my complete delight, I am now paying much less,&amp; smelling  goooood</li>
            <li> Also paid extra for fast delivery but parcel arrived 4 days late.</li>
            <li> This is a bit heavy and border line old ladiesh until I remove my clothing and smell it later</li>
            <li> A lady 5 ft behind me commented about how good I smelled and the scent I was leaving behind.</li>
            <li> Was a little mature for my age and taste</li>
            <li> Use to wear this a long time ago and it is not what I remembered it to be.</li>
            <li> I was out of my usual perfume and wanted something new</li>
            <li> I have been using this single fragrance for years and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t find it in any store, so I went to Amazon, and found the big bottle for less than $30.00.  </li>
            <li> A long time ago Sung was not available in my local department stores, and a friend would pick it up for me in Canada as a birthday or Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> So Be careful if u want this perfume with a sealed box because it would be just the bottle.</li>
            <li> AND IT ARRIVED AS EXPECTED.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, I am having trouble finding it in local stores.  </li>
            <li> It smelled exactly as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> The scent is alluring, yet not overpowering, delicate, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Also,I would recommend to use this spray lightly/sparingly as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> NOT ONLY IN THE SMALL SIZES</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s an extremely diluted product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other Toilette Sprays, but there is none to compare to this one.</li>
            <li> Once I put this on, I can&#x27;t smell it but other people have commented on it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> It simply smells divine, it is a subtle smell yet lasts a long time on the skin and clothing...</li>
            <li> I like a very few fragrances and this is definitely one of them.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find perfume, especially locally.  </li>
            <li> It can get silly really.</li>
            <li> and I have the same complaint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not worth it.</li>
            <li> Decent scent, not too expensive</li>
            <li> Seriously, not for the faint of heart.  </li>
            <li> This must be old stock because I could only use it a couple of months before it went bad.  </li>
            <li> but it dissappears in a few minutes after you put it on.</li>
            <li> Out of those, I sorted few perfumes of around $30-$40 range which I looked for.</li>
            <li> , Sung *is* green, just not *</li>
            <li> Girlie-girl green.</li>
            <li> Wearing a frock made of frugly drapes and singing-Sound-of-Music-in-a-meadow green.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few perfume critics who say &#x27;women should not smell like flowers.&#x27;</li>
            <li> TO MAKE A CHANGE FOR A FEW DAYS.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have worn this, and only this fragrance since it was introduced approximately 22 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I have wasted the dollars and now have three bottles of alcohol or water.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the perfume instead of the toilet water as this one is a bit weak in the odor dept.  </li>
            <li> Have worn it sometimes for past few years.</li>
            <li> This fragrance used to sell for $80.00 for a small bottle in Macys.  </li>
            <li> Never received any compliments like I&#x27;ve expereinced in the past.</li>
            <li> Use this as my everyday scent!</li>
            <li> Not much more to say than that.</li>
            <li> Not sure if something changed in the way it is manufactured, but it is hard to find since Nordstroms does not sell it any longer, so when I found it on Amazon</li>
            <li> This is the preferred parfum of my wife but is hard to find.</li>
            <li> This is one of her favorites and it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> This scent is uplifting, at least to me.</li>
            <li> I get stopped at least twice a week and asked what perfume I am wearing</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was that the lid had become dislodged and some perfume was spilt and lost for consumption.</li>
            <li> However, was disappointed in my recent purchase.</li>
            <li> learned a hard and expensive lesson as I will have to dispose of the product.</li>
            <li> The spray was broken.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product and will try to find the &amp;#34;real stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> One of my friends likes to walk behind me</li>
            <li> * LOV that it&#x27;s scary.</li>
            <li> it had an awful \\&quot;off\\&quot; scent that sort of smelled sour.  </li>
            <li> The perfume had gone bad.  </li>
            <li> Nordstroms said that perfumes definately do have a \\&quot;shelf life\\&quot; and can go bad.  </li>
            <li> They make my stomach sick.  </li>
            <li> I am terribly disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the base flower is -- does anyone??</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> Too bad these were discontinued!!!</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price. Once your wife uses this, she will be buying this all the time. Very quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for a sophisticated lady who had not been familiar with it. All I can say, is that she has repeatedly thanked me because she not only liked the fragrance, but she has also been asked repeatedly &amp;#34;what&#x27;s this nice perfume you are  wearing?&amp;#34; As for me, I just loved its very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> have worn sung since 87 love it and live in fear i wont continue to find it</li>
            <li> I have used Alfred Sung for many years, but this bottle isn&#x27;t the same.  The scent does not last..  Also, the cap broke</li>
            <li> This lily of the valley based fragrance has been a long-time favorite of mine, although it has gotten more difficult to find in stores.  The price and availability on Amazon is very good.</li>
            <li> i just want to say that this may have been one of the most satisfying consumer experiences that i have ever had.  this was the exact product that i wanted, i love this fragrance, a little floral a little woodsy, shipped fast, and a great value for the money, as i have purchased this same fragrance elsewhere, for twice the cost and half the volume. thanks again for delivering the goods</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Only problem I have is it&#x27;s only a tester. It means it&#x27;s not in a box. It&#x27;s open but unused. If u don&#x27;t mind the perfume without the box, it&#x27;s worth it. But it&#x27;s misleading since they never mentioned it&#x27;s a tester. So Be careful if u want this perfume with a sealed box because it would be just the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have loved this eau de toilette for a long time and buying it online sure beats going from store to store trying to find it!</li>
            <li> Decent scent, not too expensive, it seems to have been embraced by its user, a very nice and dignified sweet lady, who either way is always gracious enough to make one feel they have bought the best there is. Not being overpowering, and lasting a decent amount of time, for the time being she remains pleased with Sung by Alfred Sung for Women, Eau De Toilette. 4 Stars.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. It only takes one spray and lasts all day.. I know it says free shipping but if you live in Alaska they&#x27;ll charge you shipping regardless. Just FYI</li>
            <li> Excellent price....smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this clean scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for at least 10 years, and being that it&#x27;s not a recent fragrance, it is hard to find at a good price. Amazon sells it for a much lower price compared to department stores or perfume specialty stores. The perfume they sell is made in the USA which I think is better because the fragrance lasts longer, then the one made in Cananda. The seller did take a week to have the product at my door even though I got the 2 day delivery option from Amazon. Otherwise, the product was just as it was stated and it came in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This fragrance used to sell for $80.00 for a small bottle in Macys.  Now I can&#x27;t find it in any store, so I went to Amazon, and found the big bottle for less than $30.00.  Thanks Amazon!  I&#x27;ll be back when it runs out.  Everyone that&#x27;s smelled this perfume loves it!</li>
            <li> Love the Sung but it dissappears in a few minutes after you put it on.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and get many compliments about the scent when I wear it. Light not too sweet or floral, and different from all other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Did not like at all the scent is not what I thought</li>
            <li> Great winter fragrance!  I get so many compliments on it and people are usually curious as to where I found it since it really isn&#x27;t in stores anymore:).  Love it!</li>
            <li> This has been the cologne I&#x27;ve used for years and always get compliments on it!  I will continue to buy until they quit manufacturing it.</li>
            <li> This is the preferred parfum of my wife but is hard to find. Parcel arrived swiftly despite ordar was placed near Christmas.</li>
            <li> This must be old stock because I could only use it a couple of months before it went bad.  I had to throw it away</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Xmas gift and was very pleased that it was shipped so quickly! I was also happy that it came in a sealed plastic wrap around the box because some of the sights do not have this type of packaging as they only offer \\&quot;sample\\&quot; type bottles that you see in Department stores as \\&quot;testers\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have worn this cologne for years and I love it. The dept stores have stopped carrying it . I ordered it on Amazon and it just is not the same. The scent is ok, but the scent is so weak, that it doesnt even last until I get to work. very very dissapointed with the cologne and the entire process with Amazon on this order.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for many years.  I still love it and get many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Was awesome. Smelled just like the new ones I just bought. Great price and came within a week! Very happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the promtness in receiving my order. The product was packaged in an appropriate manner to insure safe handling in the transport.</li>
            <li> I want excited to find this item. It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My wife was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Initially I don&#x27;t have any idea about ladies&#x27; perfumes. So I did some research in Internet and found the top 10-15 perfume brands. Out of those, I sorted few perfumes of around $30-$40 range which I looked for. Finally I ended up with &#x27;Lolita Lempicka&#x27; and &#x27;Alfred Sung&#x27;. Surprisingly, I also found good reviews in Amazon for these perfumes. So I boldly ordered these perfumes and presented to my Girl Friend. Guess what...?? She used it and screamed that she likes these perfumes very much. So I decided to have have these in my favorite picks hereafter. I also liked the smell of these perfumes when I approached near my Girl friend. Buy it; you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> smells great...was delivered fast..no complaints! :D</li>
            <li> THIS SCENT IS GREAT FOR MEN OR WOMEN.  THE PRICE IS RIGHT AND IT ARRIVED AS EXPECTED.  FAR MORE REASONABLE THAN THE DEPARTMENT STORES.</li>
            <li> i have been wearing alfred  sung for 15 years,I have also been paying double for it until last year,where as at the department store it was almost $40.00 for the 1.whatever oz.OK,to my complete delight, I am now paying much less,&amp; smelling  goooood :)thank you &amp; MERRY HO&#x27;S HO&#x27;S!</li>
            <li> I have been using Sung by Alfred Sung for years, it is a sweet flower scent that does not over power and will last all day</li>
            <li> I bought and gave this as a gift and it was absolutely loved. I love shopping at Amazon. Would definitely return to replenish!</li>
            <li> I met someone at a party and I finally had to ask what fragrance she was wearing. I love this scent and had to buy some for myself.</li>
            <li> Great soft scent.  Glad to find it here.</li>
            <li> I loved this fragrance... a nice blend I ve never tried before... Was a little mature for my age and taste but that doesn&#x27;t keep me from using it... &lt;br /&gt;love it.......and great service from amazon.... received on time....</li>
            <li> Sweet but elegant, I&#x27;m so in love with the smile of it</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent. I was introduced to this perfume back in the 80s and have stuck with it as my fav ever since. Its not to floral or sweet, just a fresh clean smell to it. When you can find a decent price on it, it&#x27;s worth having. Great for a romantic scent.</li>
            <li> I love Sung, my guy friend always wants to know the name of my perfume. i don&#x27;t tell him, because I want it to be my own scent, and have some mystery about me, that he doesn&#x27;t know.  Pat</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent and lasts long.  A favorite for me!</li>
            <li> Love this. Been my favorite for years! Always asked what I&#x27;m  wearing.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering perfume from Amazon and it will not be the last. It was an awesome deal for such a big bottle. I am so happy Amazon carries it because I can&#x27;t find it in any department store within 50 miles from me. This scent is a keeper and so is Amazon!</li>
            <li> Oh, poopers. I was hoping for green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, Sung *is* green, just not *my* kind of green. Sung is bright, fresh, Spring green. Girlie-girl green. Wearing a frock made of frugly drapes and singing-Sound-of-Music-in-a-meadow green. Sung *is* THAT kind of green, which immediately disqualifies it as *my* kind of green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sung opens *so* LOV that it&#x27;s scary. It could be Coty&#x27;s Mugeut de Bois. The LOV is enveloping and lovely, perhaps perfect if *your* kind of green is LOV. Mine isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, the LOV just won&#x27;t go away. I am sensitive to many white florals. Sung was asthma-inducing. Love you, Alfred Sung, but not your namesake perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has simple lines and is gorgeous. On the other hand, the black, plastic integrated spray on top ... not so much ... cheap &amp; tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few perfume critics who say &#x27;women should not smell like flowers.&#x27; Sung is a bed of LOV. &#x27;Nuf said.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it when I buy Sung for her.  Makes life good all the way round.</li>
            <li> It was classy then - and it&#x27;s classy now - a timeless scent that stands out among the characterless rest. It smells the same as it did twenty years ago. I love it and was so happy to find it again.</li>
            <li> ...smell is too synthetic , it  lacks the gentle  fragrance of known competitors.</li>
            <li> Sung by Alfred Sung is my wife&#x27;s &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34;.  She gets a LOT of compliments while wearing this and always has.  Very soft, gentle scent that is definitely feminine and light, never overpowering, heavy, or offensive, even in close quarters like a car.  Many of the compliments she gets come from her male co-workers.  She uses it daily so we buy it once or twice a year.  Amazon is the best source, bar none.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Mom - she loves Alfred Sung.  Could not be happier - great price and it&#x27;s a beautiful subtle scent.  Everyone comments on it - especially the men.</li>
            <li> THOUGHT I&#x27;D HAVE TO FIND A NEW COLOGNE. LOOKED ALL OVER FOR &#x27;SUNG&#x27;...EVEN IN THE CARRIBEAN WHILE ON A CRUISE. NO ONE HAD IT, EXCEPT WALGREEN&#x27;S AND THEN WHEN I WENT BACK TO GET MORE...FOUND THAT THEY WERE NOT CARRYING IT ANYMORE TOO. AS A LAST RESORT...THOUGHT I&#x27;D TRY &#x27;ONLINE&#x27; SHOPPING AND FOUND YOU. NOT ONLY IN THE SMALL SIZES BUT IN THE LARGE SIZE THAT I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD IN YEARS. FOR ABOUT SIXTY DOLLARS I BOUGHT THREE LARGE SIZE BOTTLES.......AND RECEIVED THEM PROMPTLY IN THE MAIL. THREE CHEERS FOR AMAZON!!!!!HEARTFELT THANKS.  ALICE DANIELS....DES MOINES, IOWA</li>
            <li> I wore this perfume 10 years ago and got more compliments than any other perfume I had worn.  So I thought why not try it again!!! Same results, people stopped me in hallways and ask what is your perfume it is awesome!!! 8 compliments in the first 2 days!!!!!!! THE PRICE IS ALSO RIGHT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great price and just as great a fragrance as it&#x27;s ever been!</li>
            <li> It is my most favorite fragrance of all time.  Wonderful buying experience and I saved lots of $$$ by purchasing online.  Will definitely reorder when this bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife, her favorite.</li>
            <li> sung is a great perfume.   ordered this for a friend who was very happy to receive it.  Arrived in greAt time to be given as gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my aunt and she loved it. This is one of her favorites and it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. I have worn this perfume for 20+ years. Have always loved it &amp; glad to find it online with amason.com. will reorder.</li>
            <li> Long-lasting, light fresh scent.  Wife reports many compliments when she wears it. And now (Sept. 2013) I&#x27;m re-ordering more, and delighted the prices is even lower!</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume for years but haven&#x27;t bought alot based on price. But Amazons price has made me fall in love with this scent again. I wear it all the time &amp; get lots of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my daughter&#x27;s favorite scents. We haven&#x27;t seen it in stores for quite sometime. Assumed it was no longer being made. What a happy surprise when I found it on Amazon. Surprised her with it for Mother&#x27;s Day. So glad to know we can still get it!</li>
            <li> The spray was broken. I had to change it with an old one!</li>
            <li> the greatest. can always tell when my wife is wearing it. i think about buying one myself.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  It is light and lasts.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sung for quite some time.  I have been asked many many times by men and women \\&quot;What are you wearing that smells soooo good?\\&quot;  I have heard that fragrances smell different on people.  I am fair complected and have blond hair so maybe this is a good choice for my profile.  Sung sure works for me!</li>
            <li> THE FRAGRANCE IS LITTLE BIT TOO STRONG</li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE OF COLOGNE WAS TOTALLY SHATTERED INSIDE THE BOX.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law was very happy. It was a Christmas gift. The price was right and it met my needs</li>
            <li> I received my product in a very timely manner and in perfect condition.  I am very pleased with your service and would buy from you again.</li>
            <li> I love Alfred Sung Eau de Toilette I have used it  for about 15 years and now that is discontinued in the store it was a relief that I could buy it  through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I only have  good comments for the product and Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Nice floral scent, but looses strong scent quickly. Most perfumes hang on you at least a little through out the day, this one does not. Great for a brief hour of scent.</li>
            <li> Original packaging, 1/3 the cost of buying in a majoy department store.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the price difference for the identical bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance...it is fresh and feminine without being to floral or overbearing. My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the scent of this perfume i had to buy the lotion with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the price and it got here quicker then i had thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value and amount is just perfect good size bottle.</li>
            <li> I USE SUNG IF I HAVE NO RED DOOR ON HAND OR&lt;br /&gt;LIKE TO MAKE A CHANGE FOR A FEW DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVELYN GAUZENS</li>
            <li> Refreshingly spirited beautiful fragrance which lasts all day long. Can be worn for all seasons.  Just a happy fragrance over all.</li>
            <li> Got here fast smells so good.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get my favorite perfume at such a good price.  When it arrived, I discovered why it was discounted.  The perfume had gone bad.  it had an awful \\&quot;off\\&quot; scent that sort of smelled sour.  I contacted Amazon with the problem and they graciously sent me a new bottle.  Well, same problem with the second bottle!!  I even took the bottle to Nordstroms and had the salepeople smell my perfume compared to the sample bottle they had, and everyone clearly smelled the difference.  Nordstroms said that perfumes definately do have a \\&quot;shelf life\\&quot; and can go bad.  So, clearly Amazon is selling really old bottles for a discounted price.  Terrible!</li>
            <li> Buy this for my wife and she loves it. good product and arrives fast and packaged very good.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for years. This bottle didn&#x27;t smell the same and the color was also different. I called to return it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this perfume for probably 20 years. It is my favorite. I get compliments all the time, from men and women.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent. Just like I remembered!  Great packaging, original box and lightning fast shipment. Would order again.</li>
            <li> Always a winner. People ask all the time what is that great smell</li>
            <li> Great price and the perfume arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I searched several websites for this product, and found Amazon to have the best pricing.  My only concern about the purchase was the disclaimer that said the product may come in a different looking bottle.  While the website photo showed the authentic bottle, I worried my wife would not be impressed if the bottle looked different to what she was accustomed to.  If it arrived in a different designed bottle, to me that would not be an authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news, the bottle was the authentic design, and the fragrance smells correct, so everything worked out according to plan.  My only suggestion would be not to wait until the last minute to order this product as a gift, just in case the you need to return it if it doesn&#x27;t come in the original designed bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Amazon Customer</li>
            <li> I have worn Sung for twenty years and have always received compliments.  It&#x27;s hard to find now, so when I saw it on Amazon for such a great price I was thrilled.  When I received it, the color was much lighter ---- barely tinged &#x27;yellow&#x27; --- and I find that the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with me for more than a few minutes.  I feel like it&#x27;s an extremely diluted product.  I also noticed that it had a U.S. address on the label and when I bought Sung in the stores it had a Canadian label.  Not happy with the product and will try to find the &amp;#34;real stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A favourite of a friend - she was thrilled</li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying this product. I have worn it for years and I never get tired of it. People at work always ask &amp;#34;What are you wearing?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> DEFECTIVE SPRAYER.  Have used this perfume for many years and ordered previously from Amazon, but this manufacturing batch was defective.  The sprayer piece that is visible in the top vertical slot does not have a through hole.  The hole is microscopic or very fine needle size hole to provide misting.  Last order was for 2 bottles, and in both cases, neither sprayer worked.  Ended up removing sprayer of old, empty bottle to install on top of new bottle.  Whatever the source of these bottles was, Amazon should find another source.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this all time favorite of mine - it&#x27;s my signature spirng/summer scent and so many retailers have discontinued it. As usual, Amazon delivered a great product - exactly what was shown. New in box.</li>
            <li> My husband got me this perfume and I love, love, love it. Any time I have this perfume on I always get compliments. One of my friends likes to walk behind me so she can catch a whiff of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the fragrance was different than the same eau de toilette spray that I purchased from Nordstroms. This one seemed to have more of an alcohol smell to it.  Not sure if something changed in the way it is manufactured, but it is hard to find since Nordstroms does not sell it any longer, so when I found it on Amazon, I thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> The thing about this fragrance is it always gets me compliments whenever I wear it. I enjoy the long lasting scent and my husband who knows I love perfume always notices when I am wearing this perfume. I have had many bottles over the years and try many different brands but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> This was the 2nd bottle I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon. Sung by Alfred Sung is my favorite fragrance of all times. However, was disappointed in my recent purchase. Never received any compliments like I&#x27;ve expereinced in the past.</li>
            <li> I always receive compliments when I wear my signature perfume, Alfred Sung.  I admired it on one of my teachers twenty years ago, and she gave me a bottle for Christmas that year.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it every since.</li>
            <li> I did not like the scent when I first started wearing it as is was quite strong when applied.  In addition the smell when first sprayed was not the smell after wearing it for a while</li>
            <li> A product I&#x27;ve been using for years and still get wonderful compliments on it.  Not everyone carries this fragrance, so thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Have used Sung for 30 years - loved it back then and still love it.  Very good price.  Never buy this stuff in a Department Store.  You can ALWAYS get it online cheaper.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and quality was as promised</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  I have been using this product for ten years and always complimented on scent.</li>
            <li> I love Sung. It is my wife&#x27;s preference. She gets compliments almost every time she wears Sung. It can get silly really. But I love the way she smells. It kinda drives me a bit wild...</li>
            <li> This is an old fragrance from Alfred Sung, but suits any occasion or outfit...good summer &amp; winter and always fresh</li>
            <li> Another item that is no longer carried locally.  I was glad to find it.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. It&#x27;s been my signature for years. Fresh, floral, feminine and sophisticated. I started using it in my early 20s and still love it in my mid 30s.</li>
            <li> products that I still use today.</li>
            <li> Love it, good fluid for work, not too smelly.</li>
            <li> Use this as my everyday scent! Its light and clean and I get more compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for the price</li>
            <li> This has been my signature fragrance for 25 years...It is lovely!  I always receive compliments!</li>
            <li> gift for daughter for Christmas  she loves Sung</li>
            <li> I have been using Alfred Sung cologne for over 25 years, it is refreshing and delicate not overwhelming . I get so many complements,a nice and mature fragrance, very exotic I love it and very glad Amazon carries it, I can not find it any where any more Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have worn this, and only this fragrance since it was introduced approximately 22 years ago.  I LOVE IT!  I get compliments on it all the time!  It&#x27;s great for all times of the day.  It&#x27;s sophisticated and sexy.  It stays with me too so I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying it.  I wouldn&#x27;t consider another perfume!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was walking in the super market and noticed this delightful fragrance.  When I realized where it was coming from, I asked, a very nice women what she was wearing.  She told me it was Sung.  So, I decided to purchase it. I can&#x27;t wear a lot of products, this is wonderful, very light, not overpowering. Yesterday I was shopping, and someone asked me what I was  wearing, saying you smell so good.  I told her what it was and where I got it!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my mom for christmas... such a great deal.  the same size at the mall retailed for almost $60!!!  super deal and shipped amazingly fast.  got here two days before christmas!!!!</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this perfume outside of the house like when going to work, in the stores, or just around people I know there has been a lot of people who come up to me and ask me what are you wearing because that smells so good? I tell you this when I was a child I remember one of my relatives used to wear this when she went on a date and I remember back then I use to love the scent of Alfred Sung. I love, love, love, LOVE wearing Alfred Sung because that is truly some good smelling stuff!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this fragrance!! Everywhere that I go, everyone wants to know what perfume I&#x27;m wearing! I&#x27;d highly recommend buying this product, because you will get much more than your money is worth! The price, the size, the packaging....everything was just perfect!!</li>
            <li> You can smell this as your spraying it on, by the time you walk 10 feet you will have to reapply, although it would do no good-it doesnt last but 5 seconds, will stick to regular price and go the the store. Paid 26 bucks for a bottle of colored water</li>
            <li> I have been buying this fragrance for over thirty years and it is the ONLY fragrance that pleases me.  Many men and women ask me what I&#x27;m wearing and I let them know, Sung is the only one for me.  The scent is alluring, yet not overpowering, delicate, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> My mom used to wear Sung by Alfred Sung so it holds a special place in my heart.  I was out of my usual perfume and wanted something new so I ordered SUNG.  I love it.  I&#x27;ve received several compliments and every time I spray it I am reminded of her.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for 25 years.  Love it, but it is getting really hard to find in the retail stores.</li>
            <li> Use to wear this a long time ago and it is not what I remembered it to be. I actually like a different fragrance the Alfred Sung has called Jewel.</li>
            <li> This scent is uplifting, at least to me. It has decent longevity, and is a bargain at this price. Wish they had the EDP.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine was wearing this and I was intriqued. I had to get my own. This is absolutely devine. Has a very distinct, classy yet sensous scent.. Mmmmmm!</li>
            <li> Been wearing Alfred Sung for 30 years. That has to say something.</li>
            <li> My wife adores this stuff.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance. Memorable scent. My husband likes it. Have worn it sometimes for past few years. I like a very few fragrances and this is definitely one of them.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance.  For some reason, I am having trouble finding it in local stores.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon and at a decent price, too.  I will certainly be back for more when I need it.</li>
            <li> unanimously liked by everyone, this perfume comes handy when you cannot decide on what to buy. Best item for gifting and buying for yourself. I receive several nice compliments when I wear this. Suitable to wear to work place also.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas based solely on user ratings. Every time I smell it I LOVE it! It&#x27;s got a rustic yet sweet hint to it though not overwhelming. I&#x27;ve told her I have to buy one for myself!</li>
            <li> love it smells great will purchase again. love it smells great will purchase again. love it smells great will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I get complements every time I wear this scent.  I love it- - my favorite!  Excited to finally find Sung!</li>
            <li> I have used SUNG for years &amp; love it.  I always get compliments about how good I smell, from men &amp; women.  I am so glad that Amazon carries it as Nordstrom &amp; Macy&#x27;s stopped selling it.  Amazon is much more inexpensive, too.</li>
            <li> OMG THIS IS A MUST BYE PERFUME FOR REAL IT LAST FOR HOURS SO DONT GUESS ON THIS GO A HEAD AND GET IT THE SHIPPING WAS FAST AND BEFOR TIME TOO AND SAFE PACK THANK YOU PERFUMESWORLD&amp;AMAZON I AM ORDER MORE FOR SURE PERFUMESWORLD SOON</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite perfume!  My husband loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Picked this up for the wife as it is one of her favorites (mine too!).  No problems with the Eau De Toilette Spray that we received.  Arrived quickly and smells great!  Sure beats buying it at the department store for twice as much!</li>
            <li> Alfred Sung is always a head-turner. People ask me regularly what it is I am wearing. I enjoy the fragrance and have kept coming back to it for many years.</li>
            <li> I have used this signature scent for years. I smell too good. What a great birthday present~thank you my daughter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for many years. Most scents don&#x27;t stay and that&#x27;s what I loved about the original SUNG. This is watered down and smells nothing remotely like the original. I was very disappointed. The scent isn&#x27;t the same and what scent it does have leaves immediately. I also bought SHI (my go-to summer scent) by Alfred Sung and I have the same complaint. I won&#x27;t order again. It&#x27;s really not worth it. Too bad these were discontinued!!!</li>
            <li> I love it great product A + + + + +  + + + + + + + ++ +</li>
            <li> My favorite scent of all time and I have worn them all (all the way back to Chanel #5, etc.).  Light, floral and never over powering so I could wear it to work before I retired.  My daughters (now grown) love it and reminds them of me when they encounter it other places.</li>
            <li> After 16 years this is still the best perfume my wife has ever had. No comparison. My go to gift every few years because I enjoy it as much as she does (maybe more).</li>
            <li> I received Sung (by Alfred Sung) as a gift many years ago and was really surprised to see that it is still available (considering that so many of my favorite 80&#x27;s fragrances have been discontinued). This is a nice floral scent that is suitable for both day and evening wear though I must admit that I detect a bit more gardenia now than I did before.  Also,I would recommend to use this spray lightly/sparingly as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; perfume. This is actually the only one that I wear and will get compliments most every time I wear it. Unlike so many others it has staying power.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is delightfully light and airy with a hint of scent.  I have had more compliments from both men and women when wearing this fragrance than any other.  It is perfect to use in drawers and closets.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things to say about this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This soft flowery fragrance will turn heads everywhere you go. Whenever I&#x27;m wearing it, ppl always inquire abt what I&#x27;m wearing! I love it....</li>
            <li> As your price was excellent I decided to order another Sung by Alfred Sung to keep as back-up when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for years and TOTALLY LOVE IT!!!  It is not strong -- soft and smells clean.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I have used it for years and EVERY time I wear it I get compliments...BIG compliments from men and women.  It simply smells divine, it is a subtle smell yet lasts a long time on the skin and clothing...it is delicious.  I would HIGHLY recommend it...and the price was FANTASTIC!!!  I love it...I love Amazon for making it available at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> This was one of my old favorites.  It was a great move to buy  Sung again. It is everything that it was described to be.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since the 1980&#x27;s.  Dillards was the first department store to sell it and I paid $80.00 for this same size as listed&lt;br /&gt;above.  I have tried other Toilette Sprays, but there is none to compare to this one. I can put it on in the am and others can smell it on me later in the day &amp; I cannot!!  This product is absolutely wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I get stopped at least twice a week and asked what perfume I am wearing and it is always Sung</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, and item as described.</li>
            <li> I buy this every year for my mom &amp; she loves it! Is a great price! Will be saving this seller for future purchases.</li>
            <li> This perfume has been a favorite of mine for a long time. I was certainly amased when the bottled arrived and it is so LARGE... Really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> A great value, but it did seem that it might not be a fresh bottle....smelled like it might have lost some of its fragance to me.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Came when they said it would. Great job</li>
            <li> Like the Sung story. The perfume is just okay in my opinion. A little too sweet and overpowering. Should have had a better idea of the scent before purchase.</li>
            <li> I would have rathered given this perfume 3.5 stars but I didn&#x27;t want to go as low as a 3 so I gave it a 4.  I wore this cologne more than 20 years ago and i can&#x27;t remember it smelling like this.  Maybe it&#x27;s because i purchased the Eau De Toilette.  It&#x27;s not bad, but I just remember it smelling fresher and lighter.  This is a bit heavy and border line old ladiesh until I remove my clothing and smell it later and then I get that reminiscent feeling of why I loved it so much back then.  I love wearing timeless scents and this happened to be one of my favs.  I&#x27;m definitely keeping it even if to just lightly spray on bed linen.</li>
            <li> Seriously, not for the faint of heart.  This is one ot the most erotic, heady scents [in my opinion, obviously].  Alluring and discriminating, but not stuffy or overdone. I don&#x27;t know what the base flower is -- does anyone?? -- I love the way it lingers on my clothes even after they&#x27;re washed. Hmmm, fresh.</li>
            <li> I love this sensuous scent!</li>
            <li> Everyone loves this scent!!!!</li>
            <li> Once I put this on, I can&#x27;t smell it but other people have commented on it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;pleasant fragrance. Acquaintances have even asked me to tell them what I&#x27;m &amp;#34;wearing&amp;#34;. Always surprises me because&lt;br /&gt;I forget I have it on.  I have been using this single fragrance for years and&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t plan to change.</li>
            <li> This is a great product by Alfread Sung. Just so fresh and clean...the smell is not too loud.  I love it</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find perfume, especially locally.  But this was by far, the best price for the size and delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> Great perfume at an awesome price. The only bad thing was that the lid had become dislodged and some perfume was spilt and lost for consumption. Also paid extra for fast delivery but parcel arrived 4 days late. There was a big snow storm so I am not complaining about that part.</li>
            <li> I prefer the perfume instead of the toilet water as this one is a bit weak in the odor dept.  Since the perfume is not available, this works out just fine.</li>
            <li> I have used men&#x27;s perfume before so bought for gift.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting soft fresh fragrance. Hope the women&#x27;s one is the same.</li>
            <li> They use to sell this fragrance at nordstrom.  I was surprised that they no longer carry it.  I get many compliments when I wear this fragrance</li>
            <li> I love Alfred Sung!  When I wear it, I always get compliments. My only complaint is that most stores don&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
            <li> Received on time and as described.  Love this fragrance and it is the only one I wear.</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; excellent service!</li>
            <li> Lovely floral scent which I get compliments on all the time. Floral but not sweet, somewhat sophisticated.its my go-too because it  has no unpleasant under notes and is light, but lasts.</li>
            <li> Lovely perfume...light and refreshing scent</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. I have allergies and can only tolerate a drop of this scent. But when I wear a scent it&#x27;s always this.</li>
            <li> This is my daughters favorite fragrance.  She will be thrilled for her birthday!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with ease of ordering and timely receipt of product.</li>
            <li> My all-time-favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> LOVE this scent&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE continue to make available</li>
            <li> I have used Sung for many years from time to time.  Its still as pleasant as it ever was.  I will say it wears much better when you layer with it by using the body cream too.</li>
            <li> It smelled exactly as I expected it to.  Infact, I got a compliment as I was walking into my office.  A lady 5 ft behind me commented about how good I smelled and the scent I was leaving behind.</li>
            <li> Can.t comment on the scent but my Mom really likes it.One of the more reasonable places to buy this  perfume  from</li>
            <li> This is my sister&#x27;s favorite perfume/cologne which I can not find in any of the discount stores in my community.  I found it at a discount on Amazon.  I now have a happier sister.</li>
            <li> My wife uses Sung and I was able to buy her some for Mother&#x27;s Day in no time at all.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Sung since the 80&#x27;s and I still LOVE it. Not too spicy, not too floral....just right. I only use a couple of squirts and it lasts all day. I have received many compliments over the years on this scent. My friends call it my signature perfume.</li>
            <li> Previous purchase but dropped it the spray broke off and had to pry off the top. Totally my fault not anything to do with the design or quality started using it again and remembered how much I liked it so bought more</li>
            <li> I received it and was delighted. I only paid about $ 20.00. I love this scent and used to wear it often but the price was much more. When I happened to see it on Amazon at this price I knew I had to grab it. Plus it was a gift for myself.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my wife and was well received.  Good value for the price. Not much more to say than that.</li>
            <li> I have used Sung for many, many years and even though I occasionally try different scents I always come back to my favorite!  A long time ago Sung was not available in my local department stores, and a friend would pick it up for me in Canada as a birthday or Christmas gift.  Although it is now available in the US, getting Sung through Amazon saves me quite a bit of money and that makes it even more delightful.  It won&#x27;t overpower, it draws you in and is appropriate for daytime, or even evening, wear.  It is not a heavy scent but it is unique and I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother-in-law as a gift,she loves it and has been wearing  Sung for many years.&lt;br /&gt;When Momma is happy ,everyone is happy ...</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume and so does my mother so ordering it for both of us was convenient and the price was even better since it&#x27;s more costly in the stores.</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite perfume and the cost was great and it was delivered on time...thank you!</li>
            <li> My husband gave it to me as a gift and from then it is the only cologne spray that I wear. Have received many compliments as to its sweet mellow smell. It gets a 5 star from me!</li>
            <li> I love, love this fragrance!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance.  Frangrance is very specific for each person, but both Sung and Shi by Alfred Sung work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume since 1988.  Got a sample sprayed on me at a department store and by the time I walked four blocks back to work, I had several strangers compliment me on the perfume.  So I went back and bought a bottle and have been wearing it ever since and still get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> wonderful fragrance..glad I found it again</li>
            <li> I remember this fragrance smelling different but this is very good last all day and it is refreshing I would buy it again</li>
            <li> I am terribly disappointed with this product.  I have worn this fragrance for years so I increased the order for a gift.&lt;br /&gt;I have opened each bottle, which was too clear to be perfume, and there is not enough fragrance to notice especially&lt;br /&gt;After 30 minutes.  I have wasted the dollars and now have three bottles of alcohol or water.  A bargain it is not!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I learned a hard and expensive lesson as I will have to dispose of the product.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances.  And this was the best price ever!!!</li>
            <li> This is a grea value for this size bottle!  Used to wear this perfume years ago and now am so glad I have it again.  :)</li>
            <li> I do not like strong perfumes.  They make my stomach sick.  This has been my favorite perfume for years.  It has a very light scent.  Not fruity or real flowery.  It just smells clean without knocking you over.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Alfred Sung , Sung for years . I love it</li>
            <li> This is a great buy! It smells absolutely wonderful. It is just the right size. It was just the right price too.</li>
            <li> I keep a steady supply for my wife at Christmas.  This is her favorite scent, in fact, the only one she wears. I like it too.</li>
            <li> I  love this perfume- it is not always easy to find but when I do it feels like I have struck gold!</li>
            <li> Once again I have purchase a bottle of my favortite perfume and got a great price and great delivery. Happy as always witht the product and the outstanding service I get with the Perfume Shop</li>
            <li> My order came shattered in a million pieces! Could not return! Very, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume...love it!</li>
            <li> Love the compliments i get when i wear it.</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s favorite fragrance</li>
            <li> This has been The only perfume I have worn for years!! I love it and am constantly being asked what I am wearing by women and men alike!! I can&#x27;t ever find it in stores but thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it but not as much as I do.  Depends on the individuals own personal taste &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; preference though.  Good shipping.</li>
            <li> A friend often wore this to holiday events and I always loved the fragrance.  I am VERY particular as strong perfumes and after shaves nauseate me.  I finally bought my own bottle of Alfred Sung some years ago, then a friend bought me some for Xmas and I recently ran out and bought this bottle through Amazon.  Still love it.  It&#x27;s my identifying fragrance.</li>
            <li> My wife has been looking for this for a while.  It was also only a fraction of the cost in stores.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It is much cheaper on line and arrived promptly and in good condition. It is a good addition to make it a Happy New Year.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE SISTER USED THIS FRAGRENCE AND BECAUSE I LOVED HER I TOOK IT FOR MY OWN...I WEAR IT EVERY DAY</li>
            <li> Perfect gift just what my friend had asked for.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Original!!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite perfumes. I&#x27;m so happy that it was available at a great price!!</li>
            <li> My classic favorite...timeless</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. My husband buys it for me so I can wear it even weeding the garden. I get so many compliments how fresh and nice it is. This came very fast and the price is good.</li>
            <li> When I wear the perfume, I always get compliments!</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume! I have received so many compliments wearing this scent!</li>
            <li> Everything was find. The Eau De Toilette arrived on time.</li>
            <li> wonderful for over 35 years</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite back when it was $50 a bottle.  I just love it.  Just make sure you are getting the real thing.  I order from Amazon and not through Amazon...that way I have always gotten the real thing.  Thank you Amazon.....</li>
            <li> Another of my favorites!  Soft and memorable.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  I have been buying it for years and only buy it here.  Best prices.  My mom always wore it and always got the nicest compliments...mostly from men...so I thought I would give it a try.  I was sold.  Love this.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  Stays all day.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Wish it lasted longer</li>
            <li> This Toilette did not smell like when I paid $60.00 dollars for it. I would love to know where I can buy this Toilette spray and it smells&lt;br /&gt;like it used too. I will pay the extra money.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, her favorite. I gave it to her for Christmas. I first bought for her in Mexico over 20 years ago and I remember how she loved it and had said she liked it&#x27;s smell &amp; long lasting affects.&lt;br /&gt;Thx.</li>
            <li> Great product Great price</li>
