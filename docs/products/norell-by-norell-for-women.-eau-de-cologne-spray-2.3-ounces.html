            <li> It has a longer lasting original essence of Norell. I have ordered from other sellers and they were either old and lost the essence or is a copy. No one asks about it when I am out. This tell me it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li> I had been using Norell for several years until I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores.&lt;br /&gt;Went to Amazon and found it again.&lt;br /&gt;Truly like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Robin Iveson</li>
            <li> this perfume may have been around a long time, but it is classic and the only one i ever wear.</li>
            <li> I have used Norell for years.  It is the best fragrance for me.  No matter where I go people always ask what perfume I am wearing.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this perfume back in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s and that is what it smells like now - OLD perfume.  I was very disappointed.  A friend had purchased a bottle for my birthday remembering how much I loved the scent. Decided to purchase and got the \\&quot;Old\\&quot; smelling perfume instead.  Wear my Donna Karen now.</li>
            <li> Some things never go out of style.  I used Norell all the years that I worked and had so many compliments.  I stopped wearing any cologne after I retired.  A few weeks ago I decided I wanted one more bottle of Norell and ordered one.  The romance with this cologne is back!!!  Every woman needs to feel a little better when she applies her cologne, working or not!</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED NORELL FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND I CAN STLL SAY I GET COMPLIMENTS EVERY DAY.  THE ONLY THING THAT I REGRET IS THAT NORELL NATURAL SPRAY COLOGNE CAN NO LONGER BE FOUND.</li>
            <li> Been using Noell for at least 40 yrs and don&#x27;t know what other colognes would match up to it...</li>
            <li> Norell Cologne has been my favorite for 25 years. I get compliments every time I wear it, even from passersby walking down the street.  I am delighted that I am now able to buy it on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Have worn this scent for years and never fail to get great compliments on it - more&lt;br /&gt;than I ever got with incredibly expensive perfumes. Will not change.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my Mom. She had requested it for Christmas . She loves it and the mere fact that she still enjoys a nice perfume is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> always had something wrong with it after using it about 5 or 6 times.,  Still it is very expensive now.  I&#x27;ll have to make this one last.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for almost 40 years and like it just as much now as I did when it first came out. (I&#x27;m dating myself as I write this, unfortunately). It is classy and classic. Good clean scent with no musky undertones which make it ideal for daytime/business. Scents are highly personal and this one suits me well.</li>
            <li> August 2014 price &#x3D; $121.79.  In July 27, 2013 the purchase price on Amazon WAS  $69.62.  I know there is inflation but THAT MUCH!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I WAS SHOCKED BY THIS NEW PRICE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS SENT OF THE PRODUCT DOES NOT LAST.  IT IS A KNOCK OFF*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COPY AND PASTE INTO YOUR WEB BROSER TO SEE FOR YOURSELF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.bbb.org/central-florida/news-events/news-releases/2014/07/buyers-beware-as-shoddy-internet-knock-offs-infiltrate-the-internet/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 22, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The market for counterfeit luxury items is wide and deep, selling everything from jewelry and perfume to handbags and sunglasses. For bargain-hunters looking for name-brand items at discount prices online, Better Business Bureau offers advice on avoiding web-based rip-off schemes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always deal with reputable businesses. The number one way to avoid getting ripped off when buying luxury goods is to deal with reputable businesses. When in doubt, shoppers can contact the manufacturer and verify which venders are authorized sellers. Consumers should also check out the business with BBB before making a purchasing decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. One of the biggest red flags for knock-off merchandise is an unrealistic price. Extremely low prices are tempting but not to be believed. Paying $100 for a $1000 purse could result in the consumer receiving a poorly constructed - and worthless - fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read between the lines. Some websites or online classified ads will go overboard in their description of the item in order to coax the buyer&#x27;s trust.  Overuse of \\&quot;genuine,\\&quot; \\&quot;real\\&quot; or \\&quot;authentic\\&quot; is a bad sign. Buyers also need to keep an eye out for sneaky phrases like \\&quot;inspired by.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check the merchandise. Considering that the name is a large part of the motivation for buying a luxury brand, many manufacturers spend considerable time and energy on crafting the physical label. Counterfeiters aren&#x27;t usually as meticulous.  Shoppers should look for misspelled words and brand names, poorly sewn logos and labels, etc. Some luxury goods carry an \\&quot;authenticity label\\&quot; with a hologram or other security measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know the brand. Different luxury brands, such as purses, have specific hardware consumers can rely on to identify a genuine piece. Zippers, screws, clasps and stitching are usually very specific for the brand and the manufacturer often has details on their website explaining what to look for and how to spot a knock-off. Craftsmanship is king for most luxury brands. If the sunglasses snap in two in the first week, or if the stitching and seams are ragged and don&#x27;t match up on a purse, the items are probably counterfeit.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have worn Norrell since my early twenties and love it!!!! It is my signature fragrance!!! I am unable to find it in retail stores so went online to purchase!</li>
            <li> Norell is an old, but great product.  I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my cologne.  Always!!  The price through Amazon was good.  Even if I could find the cologne in a store, which I cannot at this time, I&#x27;m paying much less than I ever did.  The seller was timely, and the cologne arrived in fine shape.</li>
            <li> The scent was not the same as I have been using for many, many years.  The top did not fit well so I had leakage problems when packing the bottle for a trip.  Definitely will not be ordering from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes the fragrance and a great price; too.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance for years.  I don&#x27;t use alot but someone always seems to comment on how wonderful I smell.  It is really had to find in a store anymore, so I am greatful I can find it online.</li>
            <li> My very favorite perfume.  I would love more of the original.  Let me know.My very favorite perfume.  I would love more of the original.  Let me know.</li>
            <li> I spent considerable time searching the web for &amp;#34;Norell By Norrell&amp;#34; and all of my efforts were wasted.  After the order arrived (and had been used) I lifted the bottle and noted that it said &amp;#34;Norrell by Five Star&amp;#34;.  Norrell by Five Star is nothing but a liscensed knockoff and it does not have the lasting aroma of Norrell by Norrell.  Had I wanted Norrell by Five Star, I could have bought it from any of the twenty, or so, web sites that advertised it as such.  I expect to be delivered exactly what I order and nothing less.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like it should, it smelled like it was REALLY old and was starting to go bad!  I used to wear it all the time but I don&#x27;t use this because it is old.</li>
            <li> I have loved this fragrance for many years...It is still my favorite, and I am happy to have found it through you!!</li>
            <li> This is NOT Norell by Norell, it&#x27;s Norell by Five Star Fragrances, says so on the box, so the seller has misrepresented the product. I know I don&#x27;t want the Five Star Fragrances product--at its best a pallid shadow of the original glorious Norell--but hoped there might be a warehouse somewhere of the good old stuff. This product is basically a bottle of water and alcohol with amber coloring. The bottle I received has no trace of the original Norell scent--just strong alcohol smell. Finally had to just throw it away.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my 94 year old mother.  She had asked for another bottle that she figured would last until she dies.  $100 for a fragrance that disappointed her expectations.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this cologne.  I used the cologne for years and loved it until I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.  Was told it had been discontinued.  This must be a knockoff as the scent is not like I remember it</li>
            <li> This was a give for my mother, a perfume that she used years ago.  No longer available in stores so resorted to checking the internet out to find it.  After purchasing this from Amazon I found it in a Perfume shop in a mall for a lot more than I got it here, so made my purchase even more rewarding.</li>
