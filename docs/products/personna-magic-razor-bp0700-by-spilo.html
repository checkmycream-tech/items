            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>The retailer is GREAT, perfect, their were no problems.</li>
            <li>this is it, beautiful design and handling go with Pro Glide, unless you have mine, which I customized for myself because the handle was too flimsy.</li>
            <li>Good luck to all and best wishes!</li>
            <li>This is a great product to start off with shaving just be carefull with it</li>
            <li>Great purchase.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great for the price, probably keep it in a tavle bag</li>
            <li>This product works great with the 1/2 razor.</li>
            <li>I am happy that I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>But its a really great razor.</li>
            <li>I received the razor in great condition.  </li>
            <li>Great for doing lineups and cleaning up around the edges of haircuts.</li>
            <li>This is an attractive well made slide in razor, but it doesn&#x27;t support the blade well.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product.</li>
            <li>For the price paid, it is a great way to get a great shave.</li>
            <li>The quality is good and this price was great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, this seems to be a good razor to practice straight-razor techniques.  </li>
            <li>good razor holder i suppose for $3</li>
            <li>With one perfect flick of my wrist I can get a smooth and close shave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good razor, it&#x27;s just it dosent come with any razors, and it&#x27;s kinda in even in the razor slot</li>
            <li>That is how good I consider it.</li>
            <li>Was here real quick looks great just would of like it to come with blads.</li>
            <li>You might be better advised to buy a safety razor or another brand!</li>
            <li>This is just amazing, still using it and razor blades</li>
            <li>I really liked that.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t bringing my own razors in.</li>
            <li>I am sure there are better models out there, but for the price, it is a great deal.</li>
            <li>i really liked this.</li>
            <li>I also own a Dovo shavette and prefer this model hands</li>
            <li>After a little practice I was getting some of the best shaves I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>The Magic razor works great and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I feel like it would have been worthwhile to be informed of this</li>
            <li>PERSONNA Magic Razor BP0700</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>maybe one more day of close shaving, but</li>
            <li>buying something better soon</li>
            <li>It was OK</li>
            <li>I think that I might have to give it more time it scratch my face</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>perfect for my western shaving cup displayed in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>and SRW perform much better than these Personna Magics.</li>
            <li>I were a barber and used one all day, I would find a better make.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The material is mostly plastic in the handle with metal at the top where the blade is held.</li>
            <li>Cheap and don&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li>This results in a very smooth nick free shave.  </li>
            <li>then baby-bottom smooth the sides by going up, against the grain, with the Magic Razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, even with the cheap blades I still leave a blade-half in the Magic BP0700 for a week or two for trimming / close shaving work before I change it.  </li>
            <li>That is a pretty amazing razor itself, but it has too many bladesfor me</li>
            <li>this straight razor works great for its cost make sure to have the right razors to go with it</li>
            <li>it is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>A great set if you are learning how to shave with a bare blade.</li>
            <li>this is fine.</li>
            <li>Granted, there is a technique to using one of these and if performed exact any straight razor should suffice, but this one in particular is excellent.</li>
            <li>r cheap to replace and buy</li>
            <li>you can tell it&#x27;s cheep by picking it up but blade is secure and that&#x27;s all that matters</li>
            <li>You also cant beat the price and the replacement razors are cheap as well.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday to shave along with Derby razors and both products together are a perfect combination.</li>
            <li>and I love the extra time that it takes to have a really good clean shave.</li>
            <li>I was missing out on a great product and most of all, an important manly tradition.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, this razor is beyond amazing; it is perfect.</li>
            <li>great single blade razor, i use it just to line up my hairline and sideburns.</li>
            <li>The razor is not bad</li>
            <li>Other then that its great tool for beginners.</li>
            <li>My step father taught me how to use one of these when I was a kid, but I quickly went to Gilette.</li>
            <li>You can just quick shave and go.</li>
            <li>Great product holds blade firmly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, If you&#x27;re interested in experimenting with a straight razor just for the experience, this works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to reduce my garbage and figured a lifetime of plastic razors would be a good thing to not toss in the trash, but like I say the pain of healing taught me to try other ways to lesson my footprint.</li>
            <li>Very user friendly.</li>
            <li>This is Italian made and is very easy to place a blade in.</li>
            <li>ones I bought from my barber when I bought a new Magic from him always worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I use an Edwin Jagger safety razor too and my Magic Razor sits right next to it.</li>
            <li>I use the white version of the Magic Shavette after allowing my barber to use it on me over the years.  </li>
            <li>The better ones I used to use came in individual paper wrappers, and my barber gave me advice in that I was to split the blade in the wrapper, but if a blade edge cut through the paper that blade-side was ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first of these razors I have owned</li>
            <li>The local beauty supply company was selling for $2 more.  </li>
            <li>just becareful if its your first time using one.</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy double edge blades to go with it.</li>
            <li>Its actually higher quality than what it looks like in the pictures.</li>
            <li>Just be prepared to go slowly at first because you will probably still cut yourself even if you take the utmost of care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I shaved with it</li>
            <li>, I would recommend this if you like nice sharp replaceable blades, time consuming</li>
            <li>you are looking for something easy and comfortable to use regularly, I would recommend spending a little bit more money and getting a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>So, other than the handle this razor is more than worth the price, it is a steal that I should be in prison for.</li>
            <li>This is the first straight razor for me</li>
            <li>Love getting the closest shave ever and despite being flimsy it has lasted this long almost 2 years.</li>
            <li>I have read other reviews saying that this razor is mostly used to shape up or edge up sideburns and not for a full shave, but I shave my entire face with it and have experienced no irritation or trouble.</li>
            <li>(I had to carve each side of the handle and shape them to a pretty precise size of the actual handle).</li>
            <li>Its great if you&#x27;re just getting started with straight razors and the like, but its made pretty poorly.</li>
            <li>Pros: Closeness, Quality, Design, Length (holding it is easy when shaving), and Blades (Personna Double Edged Blades, was all they had for this type of straight razor),</li>
            <li>The quality is good as far as weight, balance, and appearance, etc, but the blade does sometimes slip slightly in the holder during use.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use this Shavette to shave my whole face - instead</li>
            <li>Too much blood loss.</li>
            <li>I bought a straight razor cause</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare to others.</li>
            <li>This is a straight razor with replacement blades.</li>
            <li>Also does shaves very well,</li>
            <li>The safety razor is also so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>you know how to shave with a straight razor, this will do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor is very practical.</li>
            <li>I am a straight razor shaver.</li>
            <li>This razor holder, while inexpensive, works very well.</li>
            <li>Two shaves at the very maximum.</li>
            <li>It gets rusty and gunky if you don&#x27;t clean it regularly after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li>I would be greatly upset if that happened in a more expensive straight razor, but with a budget brand like this, the user just has to expect it, and be careful.</li>
            <li>I bought this from a beauty salon store because I wanted to try one before I went and purchased a more expensive and better made razor.</li>
            <li>Decent razor holder.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor to every man out there, this is less costly and a better shave than ANY razor</li>
            <li>I see many brands of razors out there, and with the low price category, this one seemed OK before ordering, but when it arrived, I immediately know this one was not a good quality at all.</li>
            <li>I thought my son in the military might enjoy this.  </li>
            <li>As any real shaver will tell you, it is difficult to find a good razor, and it really is.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a extremely economical way to shave not to mention traditional</li>
            <li>the plastic handle broke off from just normal wear and tear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just really cheap and plastic looking, not a pretty product at all.</li>
            <li>- it arrived, packaging was just a little plastic slip thing (which is fine, i didn&#x27;t expect much but just an FYI), but i wasn&#x27;t really so pleasantly surprised with the product itself...</li>
            <li>but the funny thing is that I use double ege  razors all the time</li>
            <li>I gave this razor a 5 star rating and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a great shave and does not want to spend the big bucks on useless cartriges.</li>
            <li>, personally I find that this straight razor is beyond comparison.</li>
            <li>Handle, it needs cleaned frequently (just remove the slide and take a tissue and remove the built up hair), and Replaceable Blades instead of a blade incorporated into the design.</li>
            <li>then I ever did with my old Mach3</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36yrs young</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to get an actual straight razor this time, not one that holds replaceable blades.</li>
            <li>I would have rather just bought a nice looking wood razor for near the same price and then bought the razors separately again, instead of just having this poor looking razor.</li>
            <li>can make the skin a little raw the next day (good for a lighter Mach 3 shave, and</li>
            <li>The razor was clean and well made, but after a few tries I gave up using a straight razor.</li>
            <li>(I would not go back to only using a cartridge razor alone), though I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>The outside beveled body around the blade is just about the exact angle you&#x27;re going to use to shave with - so they&#x27;ve made it easier to not cut yourself as long as the body of the housing (the chromed silver piece around the blade) is against your skin.r skin.</li>
            <li>it didnt last very long, and if you open it with any force at all, you run the risk of flipping the blade cartridge straight out of its housing.</li>
            <li>Being a knife owner I know to dry this completely after each use but still rust.</li>
            <li>at least the quick, low-prep-time way I do it)</li>

            <li> I bought this from a beauty salon store because I wanted to try one before I went and purchased a more expensive and better made razor.</li>
            <li> Decent razor holder.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor to every man out there, this is less costly and a better shave than ANY razor</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was here real quick looks great just would of like it to come with blads.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold the blade correctly. Difficult to hold and the plastic cracks easily. You might be better advised to buy a safety razor or another brand!</li>
            <li> I thought my son in the military might enjoy this.  The description doesn&#x27;t seem to mention that the razors are not even included with this razor.  I understand it does state which razors it uses, but I expected at least one or two to be included with it. This was therefore not usable without a trip to go buy razors.  I feel like it would have been worthwhile to be informed of this so I could have ordered a few razors for him.</li>
            <li> PERSONNA Magic Razor BP0700 its okay but i&#x27;m going to up grade.This is a great product to start off with shaving just be carefull with it kuz you can  cut your self.Other then that its great tool for beginners.</li>
            <li> I like it at a five-star level (I would not go back to only using a cartridge razor alone), though I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  I use the white version of the Magic Shavette after allowing my barber to use it on me over the years.  When I grew a goatee he not only got my neck, but trimmed my goatee with it, so I had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]The ones I bought from my barber when I bought a new Magic from him always worked very well.  Yeah, I have no clue what brand they are.  But I went out and bought \\&quot;Platinum Chrome Blades\\&quot; - I don&#x27;t even see a name on the plastic blade holder now - and they work, but not as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this Shavette to shave my whole face - instead, I shave the bulk off with a Mach 3, then baby-bottom smooth the sides by going up, against the grain, with the Magic Razor.  I don&#x27;t have a goatee anymore, but I do close-trim areas under the nose and at the corners of the jaw with it still, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, like all Shavettes I guess, requires the user to snap in half a dual-edged safety razor to put into it.  The better ones I used to use came in individual paper wrappers, and my barber gave me advice in that I was to split the blade in the wrapper, but if a blade edge cut through the paper that blade-side was ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, even with the cheap blades I still leave a blade-half in the Magic BP0700 for a week or two for trimming / close shaving work before I change it.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, as close-shaving (at least the quick, low-prep-time way I do it) can make the skin a little raw the next day (good for a lighter Mach 3 shave, and maybe one more day of close shaving, but then I give my face a rest).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this seems to be a good razor to practice straight-razor techniques.  The outside beveled body around the blade is just about the exact angle you&#x27;re going to use to shave with - so they&#x27;ve made it easier to not cut yourself as long as the body of the housing (the chromed silver piece around the blade) is against your skin.r skin.</li>
            <li> great single blade razor, i use it just to line up my hairline and sideburns.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Christmas present for my father, but aside from that, it arrived in only a few days and their was no problem in tracking the package the entire time. I really liked that. The retailer is GREAT, perfect, their were no problems.</li>
            <li> The half blades sits a bit slanted, you have to keep adjusting it, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This is just amazing, still using it and razor blades r cheap to replace and buy, I would recommend this if you like nice sharp replaceable blades, time consuming but yeah thats how they are used.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor about a year or two ago. I used it every other day. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Works perfect you can tell it&#x27;s cheep by picking it up but blade is secure and that&#x27;s all that matters&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buying something better soon but it&#x27;s great for the price, probably keep it in a tavle bag</li>
            <li> Not great but not bad. Does what it says it does although it does seem a little flimsy around the hinges.</li>
            <li> The product came nicely wrapped  in the mail, but once i open the package the the silver part of the blade was all dirty and it looked like it had been used. I was also disappointed that it didn&#x27;t bring blades.</li>
            <li> The Magic razor works great and is well worth the money. It does not come with any blades. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This product works great with the 1/2 razor. This razor works just as it&#x27;s designed. I am happy that I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> The razor was clean and well made, but after a few tries I gave up using a straight razor. Too much blood loss. I guess men were tough back then. I bought a straight razor cause I wanted to reduce my garbage and figured a lifetime of plastic razors would be a good thing to not toss in the trash, but like I say the pain of healing taught me to try other ways to lesson my footprint.</li>
            <li> It was OK I think that I might have to give it more time it scratch my face but the funny thing is that I use double ege  razors all the time</li>
            <li> good razor holder i suppose for $3 but I was under the impression it would have a blade with it</li>
            <li> this straight razor works great for its cost make sure to have the right razors to go with it</li>
            <li> Love this razor. Better than any of this other crap that has like 9 blades(i&#x27;m exagerrating) but you know what I mean. This is the first of these razors I have owned so I can&#x27;t really compare to others. But its a really great razor. Their was cheaper ones on here but like the saying goes \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is a straight razor with replacement blades. The blades you buy for this must be broken in half before being put into the slide of the razor. I bought this from a beauty salon store because I wanted to try one before I went and purchased a more expensive and better made razor. Needless to say, this razor is beyond amazing; it is perfect. It is relatively well made, except for the flimsy plastic handle I am impressed. I took the liberty of removing the handle and using a piece of birch tree (I had to carve each side of the handle and shape them to a pretty precise size of the actual handle). So, other than the handle this razor is more than worth the price, it is a steal that I should be in prison for. Granted, there is a technique to using one of these and if performed exact any straight razor should suffice, but this one in particular is excellent. With one perfect flick of my wrist I can get a smooth and close shave and I can move on. This razor cut (pun intended) my shaving time in less than half, literally. Shaving has now become effortless. Once you improve your technique with this you will not suffer from the rawness another reviewer spoke of, it&#x27;s all about the angle. Anyways, I wish I would have converted to this type of razor years ago, I used to go to the barber to get my shaves done, but they stopped doing them because of the transfer of aids and I wasn&#x27;t bringing my own razors in. My step father taught me how to use one of these when I was a kid, but I quickly went to Gilette. I highly recommend this razor to every man out there, this is less costly and a better shave than ANY razor I have EVER used and I have spent quite a lot of money on razors in my lifetime. As any real shaver will tell you, it is difficult to find a good razor, and it really is. I&#x27;ve almost given up on razors, the only razor I would recommend if you want a traditional razor would be the Gillete Fusion Pro Glide. That is a pretty amazing razor itself, but it has too many bladesfor me, personally I find that this straight razor is beyond comparison. For speed and versatility this is it, quality and comfort this is it, beautiful design and handling go with Pro Glide, unless you have mine, which I customized for myself because the handle was too flimsy. Buy this and give it a try or two.    Pros: Closeness, Quality, Design, Length (holding it is easy when shaving), and Blades (Personna Double Edged Blades, was all they had for this type of straight razor), Price (I only paid $10).    Cons: Handle, it needs cleaned frequently (just remove the slide and take a tissue and remove the built up hair), and Replaceable Blades instead of a blade incorporated into the design.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor, it&#x27;s just it dosent come with any razors, and it&#x27;s kinda in even in the razor slot</li>
            <li> The razor I received was useless the quality is shameful the buttons that supposed to hold the razor exsist on side and not on the other so there is no way the razor would be held in it&#x27;s place what I&#x27;ve received was a junk.</li>
            <li> Such a simple product, I&#x27;m still not great at shaving, but straight dry shaving gets me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten, which helps with my dysphoria.</li>
            <li> perfect for my western shaving cup displayed in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I received the razor in great condition.  This is the first straight razor for me and I did not know what to expect.  The quality is good and this price was great.  The local beauty supply company was selling for $2 more.  My intentions were for face and back of neck shaving.  With this razor and the derby blades I bought for it, I can get a close shave.  But, I am still learning the technique.  These razors are sharp and will nick and cut in an instant.  I am sure there are better models out there, but for the price, it is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great for doing lineups and cleaning up around the edges of haircuts. Also does shaves very well, just becareful if its your first time using one. You also cant beat the price and the replacement razors are cheap as well.</li>
            <li> This is an attractive well made slide in razor, but it doesn&#x27;t support the blade well.  This razor leaves about 2mm - 3mm of unsupported blade sticking out which means the blade has too much flex and chatter when shaving which results in unnecessary nicks and cuts.  I would recommend the Parker razors instead.  They support the blade very firmly up to about 1mm from the blade edge.  This results in a very smooth nick free shave.  The Parker SR! and SRW perform much better than these Personna Magics.</li>
            <li> The blade didn&#x27;t even sit well on the straight edge razor due to uneven proportions.  I was actually scared to use it on myself.</li>
            <li> I see many brands of razors out there, and with the low price category, this one seemed OK before ordering, but when it arrived, I immediately know this one was not a good quality at all. I just couldn&#x27;t have it hold the blade correctly at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go with a 20-30 dolar razor. This just does not work.</li>
            <li> Its great if you&#x27;re just getting started with straight razors and the like, but its made pretty poorly. it didnt last very long, and if you open it with any force at all, you run the risk of flipping the blade cartridge straight out of its housing.</li>
            <li> i really liked this. it is lightweight and easy to use. dont bother cleaning it with a q-tip or it will warp the metal and it will no longer hold the blades</li>
            <li> Not great not bad just ehhh!  The razor is not bad but if you want something to last a long time look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Well it is a shavette.. So understand what you are getting into before you buy one. This is Italian made and is very easy to place a blade in. I also own a Dovo shavette and prefer this model hands down.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a extremely economical way to shave not to mention traditional this is a great product. Close shave and will cost pennies in comparison to shick or Gillette products. Make sure you buy double edge blades to go with it.</li>
            <li> Works like a champ! Its actually higher quality than what it looks like in the pictures. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> After a couple years of using this razor, I&#x27;ve moved on to using a safety razor.  I found that maintenance became sort of a hassle.  There is a sliding mechanism you use to put the blade in.  It gets rusty and gunky if you don&#x27;t clean it regularly after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, loading the blade in evenly can sometimes be difficult.  I found that I would often have one side of the razor sticking out further than on another side.  This would force me to be extra careful while shaving, especially around sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, If you&#x27;re interested in experimenting with a straight razor just for the experience, this works just fine.  Just be prepared to go slowly at first because you will probably still cut yourself even if you take the utmost of care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something easy and comfortable to use regularly, I would recommend spending a little bit more money and getting a safety razor.  You will save the same amount of money in the long run, buying the same blades.  The safety razor is also so much easier to use.  You can just quick shave and go.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is great.&lt;br /&gt;If you know how to shave with a straight razor, this will do.&lt;br /&gt;If I were a barber and used one all day, I would find a better make.&lt;br /&gt;But this is fine. You have to adjust the razor, so it is not crooked, but once you slide it in, it holds firm and straight.&lt;br /&gt;And you can find them in beauty supply shops.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I use it everyday to shave along with Derby razors and both products together are a perfect combination. No more safety disposable razors for me. I get a closer shave now then I ever did with my old Mach3 with way less irritation. I recommend this razor combination to everyone! Also try some Clubman aftershave to go along with it and you&#x27;ll be in Manly Heaven! I&#x27;m 36yrs young and I love the extra time that it takes to have a really good clean shave. Good luck to all and best wishes!</li>
            <li> I bought this little razor a few months ago and this is why I am barely reviewing it. The first time I shaved with it I had a some difficulties and this is only because I had never used a razor like this before. After a little practice I was getting some of the best shaves I have ever experienced. I have used all kinds of razors from Gillette, Schick, Bic, etc. I was missing out on a great product and most of all, an important manly tradition. The razor is very practical. You just take a half double edge razor blade and place it in the holder and close it up. That is it! Very user friendly. The material is mostly plastic in the handle with metal at the top where the blade is held. It is not elegant but it serves its purpose. I have read other reviews saying that this razor is mostly used to shape up or edge up sideburns and not for a full shave, but I shave my entire face with it and have experienced no irritation or trouble. I gave this razor a 5 star rating and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a great shave and does not want to spend the big bucks on useless cartriges. I use an Edwin Jagger safety razor too and my Magic Razor sits right next to it. That is how good I consider it.</li>
            <li> I am a straight razor shaver. This razor holder, while inexpensive, works very well. This works well in my travel o-night kit.</li>
            <li> Great product holds blade firmly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor at a store locally. For the price paid, it is a great way to get a great shave. The quality is good as far as weight, balance, and appearance, etc, but the blade does sometimes slip slightly in the holder during use. I would be greatly upset if that happened in a more expensive straight razor, but with a budget brand like this, the user just has to expect it, and be careful. I would recommend a blade change after each shave (it&#x27;s not like the blades are all that expensive). Two shaves at the very maximum.</li>
            <li> Love getting the closest shave ever and despite being flimsy it has lasted this long almost 2 years. My only real complaint is the fact that it started rusting a week after I bought it. Being a knife owner I know to dry this completely after each use but still rust. I might have gotten a bad one but it still works and only rusts around the blade clasp. A great set if you are learning how to shave with a bare blade.</li>
            <li> Junk razor made in India and NOT made in Italy. Cheap and don&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> Decent razor holder. I bought it in 2012 and it lasted until 2015. the plastic handle broke off from just normal wear and tear. The steel part that holds the razor is still intact and I&#x27;m using it until I get a replacement. I&#x27;m going to get an actual straight razor this time, not one that holds replaceable blades. Figured I&#x27;m gonna be shaving the rest of my life (probably) and I might as well spend the extra money to get one that&#x27;s gonna last a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor thinking it came with the blades to actually shave - it arrived, packaging was just a little plastic slip thing (which is fine, i didn&#x27;t expect much but just an FYI), but i wasn&#x27;t really so pleasantly surprised with the product itself... It&#x27;s just really cheap and plastic looking, not a pretty product at all. I do understand that it might look like this because it IS cheap, but i bought this because other razors had complaints about being dull; seeing how this razor didn&#x27;t even come with any blades and i had to purchase them separately, this turned out to be completely irrelevant... I would have rather just bought a nice looking wood razor for near the same price and then bought the razors separately again, instead of just having this poor looking razor. It is functional though, so i&#x27;ll give it that.</li>
            <li> Awful...awful. do not buy this. I am sticking with my de razor.</li>
