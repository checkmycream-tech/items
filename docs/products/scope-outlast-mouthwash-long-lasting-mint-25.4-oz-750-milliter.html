            <li>The best thing about this bottle is the shape.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scope Outlast is a great option if you don&#x27;t want flouride or hydrogen peroxide.  </li>
            <li>But when used with a Waterpik, great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mouthwash leaves a pleasant minty flavor after rinsing, and a \\&quot;just-brushed\\&quot; feeling rather than a \\&quot;just-burned\\</li>
            <li>There is a pleasant mint taste.</li>
            <li>Scope Outlast Mouthwash in Long-Lasting Mint has a very pleasant minty flavor, very fresh and well, mouthwashy!  </li>
            <li>Not in a minty way - just in a tingly, my arm went to sleep and is now pins and pricks kind of way.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Scope for years and have always liked.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended that as a way to boost the effectiveness of using a Waterpik alone, plus it adds a nice freshness to my mouth when done.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Plus, I will do whatever easy steps I can to try to get fresher breath - and this is an easy one.</li>
            <li>I like the shape of the bottle because it&#x27;s easy to hold</li>
            <li>This Scope mouthwash is strong, so it does work.</li>
            <li>It is not as strong tongue numbing like Listerine, but of course, it is not sold as an antiseptic.</li>
            <li>All my friends tell me that I have beautiful white teeth.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice minty taste that makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scope Outlast is a unique, pleasurably tasting, gracefully lasting, flat-out delicious, minty fresh flavor.</li>
            <li>Feels clean, doesn&#x27;t linger too long after you finish brushing right before bed, Gives that perfect tingling feeling.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Scope Outlast mouthwash is not just a great tasting minty mouthwash, but it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>Scope Original Mint Mouthwash 50.7 Fl Oz]]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so familiar</li>
            <li>And while some tasted great and others had that burning alcohol taste, none of them lasted very long.</li>
            <li>Still, it is a great mouthwash, with alcohol to kill bacteria and a longer lasting formula for fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a clean, minty taste that lingers for some time.</li>
            <li>However, this Scope is more gentle and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>To get strong long-lasting fresh breath, you do have to swish the mouthwash for a while and hold-off that urge to spit it out too soon.</li>
            <li>I prefer the good old fashion Scope for its&#x27; taste and the impression that it keeps my breath fresh (although my wife says that it doesn&#x27;t do the job after a good Italian meal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, this is how mouthwash should be; straight forward, with its outstanding signature Scope flavor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more concentrated - rather than having to use 2 or 3 capfuls of the store brand, I&#x27;m getting good results with only about 1/3 as much of the Scope.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scope Outlast Mouthwash-Long Lasting Mint seemed a good place to start.</li>
            <li>In fact, I love this mint taste so much that I think twice before drinking coffee or eating a snack that will diminish it.  </li>
            <li>Original Scope users will like the Scope Outlast, it&#x27;s a fresh, minty tasting mouthwash.</li>
            <li>A regular or more streamlined bottle shape would be better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was ready to try the \\&quot;new\\&quot;, longer-lasting Scope and it tastes as good as the old relable.  </li>
            <li>but with newer options available, I thought I&#x27;d give them a try to see if they work any better than the trusty old Scope</li>
            <li>I tend to use mouthwash in between brushings, so I&#x27;ll never be able to test the validity of that claim, but I do like this mouthwash and would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Great tasting, Not to powerful like that other well known name brand.</li>
            <li>I love the taste of this new Scope mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>While many products currently on the market claim various benefits, some claiming up to &#x27;six benefits&#x27;, Scope&#x27;s Outlast is manly about maintaining your fresh breath and it&#x27;s quite successful at that.</li>
            <li>Scope is the perfect finishing touch to getting ready for the day, and the fresh breath will usually last until lunch time, or you start drinking several cups of coffee.</li>
            <li>Not the case, if you read the claim it says that your breath feels fresh up to 5X longer (vs. brushing alone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does taste minty and fresh.</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;m pleased with the Scope Outlast Mouthwash.</li>
            <li>claim for Scope Outlast is that it keeps your breath fresh up to 5 times longer versus brushing alone.</li>
            <li>It would be well worth it to try this product.</li>
            <li>So, I was excited to try the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Outlast better than Scope because it will keep my breath fresher longer and is more minty and less alcohol</li>
            <li>Outlast better than Scope because it will keep my breath fresher longer and is more minty and less alcohol</li>
            <li>Fresh breath is a priority for most people, but in my job I often find myself sitting closely beside a customer at their desk either troubleshooting a technical issue or training them on how to use our systems, so fresh breath is a must for my job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A dental hygienist once told me that you really should do it for a full minute, so that&#x27;s what I do.</li>
            <li>but Listerine burns right from the first second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste much different than the old Scope Mint Mouthwash, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Scope has always been one of the best mouthwashes, and their new long lasting formular does its job very well.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This product is for those seeking consistent quality from a brand you can trust.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine that an arthritic hand would not be able to open this cap.  </li>
            <li>Thant&#x27;s not a negative thing since the old stuff is still at the top of the mouthwash</li>
            <li>I plan to switch to this mouthwash the next time I need to purchase more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t worry so much about my breath when I use it right after I&#x27;ve eaten.</li>
            <li>Whereas Scope, specifically this formula, made my mouth feel very fresh and clean for a long time.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the mouthwash works in conjunction with brushing ones teeth, so it works great for a mouthwash - it just doesn&#x27;t last longer for me.</li>
            <li>It does last longer, as it claims because it is so strong</li>
            <li>It is not an alcohol free mouthwash, so there is a little \\&quot;burn\\&quot; to it, but it is very mild.</li>
            <li>With Listerine, I feel like it &#x27;must&#x27; be working, since it burns so much.</li>
            <li>I also tried using it straight as mouthwash and it was a bit too intense for me.</li>
            <li>and I really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>The taste of this mouthwash is ok for me, it&#x27;s not as bitter as some mouthwashes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy this regularly, but it might be a good switch between something minty like Scope, and then using Listerine every other day.</li>
            <li>Scope Outlast has a strong mint taste that lingers a long time after I&#x27;ve rinsed my mouth.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll give this four stars and prefer to most other mouthwash products.  </li>
            <li>flavor of Scope Outlast is very similar to the Scope Original Mint version.</li>
            <li>There are more hardcore, mouth-blistering mouthwashes on the market if desired, but this one is pretty good and fairly strong without the nasty taste that a lot of alcohol-free mouthwashes seem to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It reminds me of pretty bottles you see in old movies on the vanity of the leading lady.</li>
            <li>I know they claim that alcohol dries out your mouth while the non-alcoholic rinses keep your mouth moist, but to me, it feels like to opposite is true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Scope Mouthwash, and the new \\&quot;Scope Outlast Mouthwash Long Lasting Mint\\</li>
            <li>Then, I tried a dose of Scope Outlast for comparison and tasted a much more concentrated mint/mouthwashy flavor and less alcohol.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an odd size (flared at the bottom) and takes up more room than it should on the counter.</li>
            <li>The container has been redesigned and provides a contemporary look.  </li>
            <li>both have water listed as the main ingredient, not a surprise&lt;</li>
            <li>The main issue I have with it is that it leaves my lips feeling tingly for hours afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The main thing for me about mouthwash is the aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>My main use for mouthwash is to add some to the water when I use my Waterpik.</li>
            <li>The minty flavor dissipates quickly and I&#x27;m left with that unpleasantness in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a new formula of Scope, but it still has that classic 1960&#x27;s teardrop bottle.</li>
            <li>normally use either Listerine, or a child&#x27;s flouride rinse.</li>
            <li>What did seem different was that the Outlast was a bit stronger and that hours after using it, I still had a fresh feeling in my mouth, even after eating something for breakfast at work, and drinking a soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glamorous White - Fresh Mint 473 Ml (Pack of 12)]]].  </li>
            <li>It gave me a tingly feeling shortly afterward, and then a fresh feeling through out the morning and afternoon.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:moFKC3S7BNQ854]]Having been a daily user of Scope I was interested to try Scope Outlast when I saw it on the product shelves.  </li>
            <li>Scope Outlast smells mint first, alcohol second.  </li>
            <li>Scope also makes no claims as to how long your breath will feel fresh vs. brushing alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does keep your mouth fresh for a long time too, but it&#x27;s \\&quot;5x</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like the taste of alcohol in it, although it works in killing bacteria and keeps my mouth fresh for long time.</li>
            <li>Made by a brand I already trust, its very title seems to promise that it will last longer than the older</li>
            <li>When you spit it out the aftertaste is the same as the initial taste and quickly fades away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So while this product is an effective long lasting mouthwash, I would prefer to avoid the possible yellowing and the cost and inconvenience of the subsequent visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li>My introduction to Scope Outlast was in the Crest Complete toothpaste containing it.  </li>
            <li>While deemed safe by the FDA and common in dental problems, there are alternatives.</li>
            <li>negative for me is the goofy, inefficient bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have used Scope Outlast Mouthwash for nearly two weeks and it has not stained my teeth or my tongue.  </li>
            <li>(Remember, one doesn&#x27;t have to be old to have arthritis.)  </li>
            <li>I know most mouthwashes that contain alcohol have a safety cap that require you to squeeze the sides to open, but for some reason this one gives me trouble.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about five times longer, but I do know that my breath felt cleaner and fresher a lot longer than when I use my Crest 3D White Multi-Care Whitening Rinse Glamorous White - Fresh Mint</li>
            <li>Despite the fancy name, this is same classic Scope mouthwash that I have always known, as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>regular Scope definitely smells alcohol first, then mint.  </li>
            <li>I normally avoid alcohol-based mouthwashes due to their harshness, and this was even more harsh than the store brands.</li>
            <li>One nice thing about the cap is that it has a child lock, but you simply squeeze and it opens, unlike some other&#x27;s that are more difficult to open.</li>
            <li>The only new thing about Outlast Scope seems to be the bottle design.</li>
            <li>If you look close, there are no active ingredients listed.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I have two major dislikes about this product:  </li>
            <li>Mouthwash is one of those things that&#x27;s difficult to review truly accurately - until you&#x27;ve used it for months, gone to the dentist, and actually figured out if there were lasting results, it&#x27;s hard to fairly judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No big deal except it takes up too much space when packing for a long trip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not certain how much longer the \\&quot;Outlast\\&quot; version lasts, but it&#x27;s been a go-to mouthwash for us for a while.</li>
            <li>The discoloration supposedly can be removed by additional brushing or a dental visit, it is, in my opinion, to avoid it altogether....or at least discolor your teeth by bingeing on expresso or fine red wine.</li>
            <li>Compared to other toothpaste, it was much stronger and the longer lasting.  </li>
            <li>Mouthwash was exaggerating when it claimed that using it would make one&#x27;s breath feel fresh five times longer than ordinary mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t as burning in the mouth as Listerine, but this particular Scope product leaves me with a bitter taste on the front end of my tongue which lasts for several minutes.  </li>
            <li>The peppermint flavor might even be too much for someone to hold in their mouth much less gargle for the 30 seconds that is recommended in the directions.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> To get strong long-lasting fresh breath, you do have to swish the mouthwash for a while and hold-off that urge to spit it out too soon.</li>
            <li> I prefer the good old fashion Scope for its&#x27; taste and the impression that it keeps my breath fresh (although my wife says that it doesn&#x27;t do the job after a good Italian meal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, this is how mouthwash should be; straight forward, with its outstanding signature Scope flavor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more concentrated - rather than having to use 2 or 3 capfuls of the store brand, I&#x27;m getting good results with only about 1/3 as much of the Scope.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scope Outlast Mouthwash-Long Lasting Mint seemed a good place to start.</li>
            <li> In fact, I love this mint taste so much that I think twice before drinking coffee or eating a snack that will diminish it.  </li>
            <li> Original Scope users will like the Scope Outlast, it&#x27;s a fresh, minty tasting mouthwash.</li>
            <li> A regular or more streamlined bottle shape would be better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was ready to try the \\&quot;new\\&quot;, longer-lasting Scope and it tastes as good as the old relable.  </li>
            <li> but with newer options available, I thought I&#x27;d give them a try to see if they work any better than the trusty old Scope</li>
            <li> I tend to use mouthwash in between brushings, so I&#x27;ll never be able to test the validity of that claim, but I do like this mouthwash and would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Great tasting, Not to powerful like that other well known name brand.</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this new Scope mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> While many products currently on the market claim various benefits, some claiming up to &#x27;six benefits&#x27;, Scope&#x27;s Outlast is manly about maintaining your fresh breath and it&#x27;s quite successful at that.</li>
            <li> Scope is the perfect finishing touch to getting ready for the day, and the fresh breath will usually last until lunch time, or you start drinking several cups of coffee.</li>
            <li> Not the case, if you read the claim it says that your breath feels fresh up to 5X longer (vs. brushing alone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does taste minty and fresh.</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;m pleased with the Scope Outlast Mouthwash.</li>
            <li> claim for Scope Outlast is that it keeps your breath fresh up to 5 times longer versus brushing alone.</li>
            <li> It would be well worth it to try this product.</li>
            <li> So, I was excited to try the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Outlast better than Scope because it will keep my breath fresher longer and is more minty and less alcohol</li>
            <li> Outlast better than Scope because it will keep my breath fresher longer and is more minty and less alcohol</li>
            <li> Fresh breath is a priority for most people, but in my job I often find myself sitting closely beside a customer at their desk either troubleshooting a technical issue or training them on how to use our systems, so fresh breath is a must for my job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A dental hygienist once told me that you really should do it for a full minute, so that&#x27;s what I do.</li>
            <li> but Listerine burns right from the first second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste much different than the old Scope Mint Mouthwash, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Scope has always been one of the best mouthwashes, and their new long lasting formular does its job very well.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This product is for those seeking consistent quality from a brand you can trust.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine that an arthritic hand would not be able to open this cap.  </li>
            <li> Thant&#x27;s not a negative thing since the old stuff is still at the top of the mouthwash</li>
            <li> I plan to switch to this mouthwash the next time I need to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry so much about my breath when I use it right after I&#x27;ve eaten.</li>
            <li> Whereas Scope, specifically this formula, made my mouth feel very fresh and clean for a long time.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the mouthwash works in conjunction with brushing ones teeth, so it works great for a mouthwash - it just doesn&#x27;t last longer for me.</li>
            <li> It does last longer, as it claims because it is so strong</li>
            <li> It is not an alcohol free mouthwash, so there is a little \\&quot;burn\\&quot; to it, but it is very mild.</li>
            <li> With Listerine, I feel like it &#x27;must&#x27; be working, since it burns so much.</li>
            <li> I also tried using it straight as mouthwash and it was a bit too intense for me.</li>
            <li> and I really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> The taste of this mouthwash is ok for me, it&#x27;s not as bitter as some mouthwashes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy this regularly, but it might be a good switch between something minty like Scope, and then using Listerine every other day.</li>
            <li> Scope Outlast has a strong mint taste that lingers a long time after I&#x27;ve rinsed my mouth.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll give this four stars and prefer to most other mouthwash products.  </li>
            <li> flavor of Scope Outlast is very similar to the Scope Original Mint version.</li>
            <li> There are more hardcore, mouth-blistering mouthwashes on the market if desired, but this one is pretty good and fairly strong without the nasty taste that a lot of alcohol-free mouthwashes seem to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It reminds me of pretty bottles you see in old movies on the vanity of the leading lady.</li>
            <li> I know they claim that alcohol dries out your mouth while the non-alcoholic rinses keep your mouth moist, but to me, it feels like to opposite is true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Scope Mouthwash, and the new \\&quot;Scope Outlast Mouthwash Long Lasting Mint\\</li>
            <li> Then, I tried a dose of Scope Outlast for comparison and tasted a much more concentrated mint/mouthwashy flavor and less alcohol.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an odd size (flared at the bottom) and takes up more room than it should on the counter.</li>
            <li> The container has been redesigned and provides a contemporary look.  </li>
            <li> both have water listed as the main ingredient, not a surprise&lt;</li>
            <li> The main issue I have with it is that it leaves my lips feeling tingly for hours afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The main thing for me about mouthwash is the aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> My main use for mouthwash is to add some to the water when I use my Waterpik.</li>
            <li> The minty flavor dissipates quickly and I&#x27;m left with that unpleasantness in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a new formula of Scope, but it still has that classic 1960&#x27;s teardrop bottle.</li>
            <li> normally use either Listerine, or a child&#x27;s flouride rinse.</li>
            <li> What did seem different was that the Outlast was a bit stronger and that hours after using it, I still had a fresh feeling in my mouth, even after eating something for breakfast at work, and drinking a soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glamorous White - Fresh Mint 473 Ml (Pack of 12)]]].  </li>
            <li> It gave me a tingly feeling shortly afterward, and then a fresh feeling through out the morning and afternoon.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moFKC3S7BNQ854]]Having been a daily user of Scope I was interested to try Scope Outlast when I saw it on the product shelves.  </li>
            <li> Scope Outlast smells mint first, alcohol second.  </li>
            <li> Scope also makes no claims as to how long your breath will feel fresh vs. brushing alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does keep your mouth fresh for a long time too, but it&#x27;s \\&quot;5x</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like the taste of alcohol in it, although it works in killing bacteria and keeps my mouth fresh for long time.</li>
            <li> Made by a brand I already trust, its very title seems to promise that it will last longer than the older</li>
            <li> When you spit it out the aftertaste is the same as the initial taste and quickly fades away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So while this product is an effective long lasting mouthwash, I would prefer to avoid the possible yellowing and the cost and inconvenience of the subsequent visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> My introduction to Scope Outlast was in the Crest Complete toothpaste containing it.  </li>
            <li> While deemed safe by the FDA and common in dental problems, there are alternatives.</li>
            <li> negative for me is the goofy, inefficient bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have used Scope Outlast Mouthwash for nearly two weeks and it has not stained my teeth or my tongue.  </li>
            <li> (Remember, one doesn&#x27;t have to be old to have arthritis.)  </li>
            <li> I know most mouthwashes that contain alcohol have a safety cap that require you to squeeze the sides to open, but for some reason this one gives me trouble.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about five times longer, but I do know that my breath felt cleaner and fresher a lot longer than when I use my Crest 3D White Multi-Care Whitening Rinse Glamorous White - Fresh Mint</li>
            <li> Despite the fancy name, this is same classic Scope mouthwash that I have always known, as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> regular Scope definitely smells alcohol first, then mint.  </li>
            <li> I normally avoid alcohol-based mouthwashes due to their harshness, and this was even more harsh than the store brands.</li>
            <li> One nice thing about the cap is that it has a child lock, but you simply squeeze and it opens, unlike some other&#x27;s that are more difficult to open.</li>
            <li> The only new thing about Outlast Scope seems to be the bottle design.</li>
            <li> If you look close, there are no active ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I have two major dislikes about this product:  </li>
            <li> Mouthwash is one of those things that&#x27;s difficult to review truly accurately - until you&#x27;ve used it for months, gone to the dentist, and actually figured out if there were lasting results, it&#x27;s hard to fairly judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No big deal except it takes up too much space when packing for a long trip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain how much longer the \\&quot;Outlast\\&quot; version lasts, but it&#x27;s been a go-to mouthwash for us for a while.</li>
            <li> The discoloration supposedly can be removed by additional brushing or a dental visit, it is, in my opinion, to avoid it altogether....or at least discolor your teeth by bingeing on expresso or fine red wine.</li>
            <li> Compared to other toothpaste, it was much stronger and the longer lasting.  </li>
            <li> Mouthwash was exaggerating when it claimed that using it would make one&#x27;s breath feel fresh five times longer than ordinary mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t as burning in the mouth as Listerine, but this particular Scope product leaves me with a bitter taste on the front end of my tongue which lasts for several minutes.  </li>
            <li> The peppermint flavor might even be too much for someone to hold in their mouth much less gargle for the 30 seconds that is recommended in the directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but then a minute or so later you get this strange after taste.  </li>
            <li> final take is that if you are curious, give it a try, especially if you are a Scope user.  </li>
            <li> final take is that if you are curious, give it a try, especially if you are a Scope user.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was fearful that Scope Outlast Mouthwash, with its bright green color, would stain my teeth</li>
            <li> I have been using Scope as a mouthwash since I was a teenager (and I don&#x27;t want to say how long ago THAT was).  </li>
            <li> I will be using this mouthwash for a long time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give you the dry burning feel others have and the scent of freshness lasts.</li>
            <li> My mouth didn&#x27;t feel dry at all.</li>
            <li> , however the cap isn&#x27;t easy to remove as one needs to push in on two particular spots at the base while turning.  </li>
            <li> I pour it directly into a small bathroom cup which I then fill with water and use for rinsing the mouth.  </li>
            <li> careful though</li>
            <li> , when you look at the back of the package you see the \\&quot;5X longer\\&quot; highlighted in green</li>
            <li> Not surprising, since they are the same brand and similar flavor.</li>
            <li> My breath feels like it will stay fresher, longer primarily due to the difference in concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is primarily due to the ingredient shift.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve preferred Scope to other mouthwashes for years.</li>
            <li> In other words, it serves as a deterrent for consuming snacks that might cause cavities.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other brands other than Scope</li>
            <li> The mouthwash does not taste antispetic like some other do.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the bottle.</li>
            <li> Because the bitter taste hasn&#x27;t lasted for longer than a few minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought that Listerine was too painful (even the less intense kind) and the non-alcohol mouthwashes leave a really bad aftertaste.</li>
            <li> This Scope has a slight mint taste with no burn.</li>
            <li> That puts the price per use less than the store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The green is identifiable with Scope, but I&#x27;m not in favor of unnecessary added colorings.</li>
            <li> There is a slight burn, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt like the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would prefer it if they punched it up a little and increased the alcohol content a bit, but that is nitpicking.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I don&#x27;t usually have problems at the dentist, so I think it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> rinse for about a minute, and it gets a little spicy at the end -</li>
            <li> After a few seconds of rinsing though this taste goes away and it is just like swishing water in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I wish Scope wasn&#x27;t green, but that&#x27;s just me.  </li>
            <li> I would not use it if I was planning on eating a meal or having a drink in the next hour - my tastes buds are numb for about that long.</li>
            <li> Scope Outlast encompasses the good, the bad and the ugly.</li>
            <li> No one likes bad breath and when you wash your mouth out in the morning you have the whole day to go.  </li>
            <li> It is a shame that it is not safe to drink, it is that yummy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure...</li>
            <li> I assume the high alcohol content (1/7 of the bottle) is to kill germs and the accompanying bad breath.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t misunderstand; what&#x27;s inside the bottle isn&#x27;t bad, there just isn&#x27;t anything new about it.</li>
            <li> I owe this to brushing, flossing and rinsing at least three times a day.  </li>
            <li> With my hopes so high, I was a bit disappointed to find a subtle Scope flavor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, I can conclude the taste differences are due to the difference in alcohol percentage and the infamous \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; labeling.  </li>
            <li> This one does have alcohol in addition to other difficult to pronounce chemicals and a secret ingredient referred to as &#x27;flavor&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Finally, yellow teeth are ugly.</li>
            <li> The only real negative about this bottle is the annoying squeeze cap.</li>
            <li> Both of these brands burn my tongue so badly that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to rinse for the required time period.</li>
            <li> If I use this or the toothpaste with it, food tastes nasty for a long time, but I consider that a benefit for my diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does stays longer in your mouth like a mint candy, and not like an unpleasant metallic lingering aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> The child-proof cap is very difficult to remove for those of us who have arthritic hands.  </li>
            <li> The bad is that it contains Cetylpyridnium Chloride which can discolor teeth, cause oral numbness and allergies and is toxic if ingested or inhaled.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Scope has upgraded their traditional mouthwash with the Outlast brand.  It doesn&#x27;t have that antiseptic after-taste and is actually more refreshing.  The container has been redesigned and provides a contemporary look.  This product is for those seeking consistent quality from a brand you can trust.</li>
            <li> This version of scope has been a favorite of ours for a while. I&#x27;m not certain how much longer the \\&quot;Outlast\\&quot; version lasts, but it&#x27;s been a go-to mouthwash for us for a while. It&#x27;s not the mildest version out there. To get strong long-lasting fresh breath, you do have to swish the mouthwash for a while and hold-off that urge to spit it out too soon. It does have a little sing to it, but most of the best mouthwashes do. Scope is the perfect finishing touch to getting ready for the day, and the fresh breath will usually last until lunch time, or you start drinking several cups of coffee. Basically, it will last until you eat or drink something to overpower it or wash it away.</li>
            <li> This Scope mouthwash is strong, so it does work. The peppermint flavor might even be too much for someone to hold in their mouth much less gargle for the 30 seconds that is recommended in the directions.&lt;br /&gt;It will definitely leave your mouth tingling. I would not use it if I was planning on eating a meal or having a drink in the next hour - my tastes buds are numb for about that long. It does last longer, as it claims because it is so strong</li>
            <li> Great tasting, Not to powerful like that other well known name brand. Feels clean, doesn&#x27;t linger too long after you finish brushing right before bed, Gives that perfect tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this mouthwash. It has a nice minty taste that makes my mouth feel clean and fresh. I don&#x27;t worry so much about my breath when I use it right after I&#x27;ve eaten.</li>
            <li> My introduction to Scope Outlast was in the Crest Complete toothpaste containing it.  Wow!  Compared to other toothpaste, it was much stronger and the longer lasting.  So, I was excited to try the real thing.  With my hopes so high, I was a bit disappointed to find a subtle Scope flavor.  Still, it is a great mouthwash, with alcohol to kill bacteria and a longer lasting formula for fresh breath.  If I use this or the toothpaste with it, food tastes nasty for a long time, but I consider that a benefit for my diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scope Outlast is a great option if you don&#x27;t want flouride or hydrogen peroxide.  I would prefer it if they punched it up a little and increased the alcohol content a bit, but that is nitpicking.</li>
            <li> Scope Outlast encompasses the good, the bad and the ugly. The good includes a pleasant minty flavor and lasting freshness.  The bad is that it contains Cetylpyridnium Chloride which can discolor teeth, cause oral numbness and allergies and is toxic if ingested or inhaled. While deemed safe by the FDA and common in dental problems, there are alternatives. Finally, yellow teeth are ugly. The discoloration supposedly can be removed by additional brushing or a dental visit, it is, in my opinion, to avoid it altogether....or at least discolor your teeth by bingeing on expresso or fine red wine.

            <li> The best thing about this bottle is the shape. It reminds me of pretty bottles you see in old movies on the vanity of the leading lady. Don&#x27;t misunderstand; what&#x27;s inside the bottle isn&#x27;t bad, there just isn&#x27;t anything new about it. It has a similar taste and feel to all of the similar mint flavored mouthwashes on the market. The only real negative about this bottle is the annoying squeeze cap. I know most mouthwashes that contain alcohol have a safety cap that require you to squeeze the sides to open, but for some reason this one gives me trouble.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moFKC3S7BNQ854]]Having been a daily user of Scope I was interested to try Scope Outlast when I saw it on the product shelves.  No one likes bad breath and when you wash your mouth out in the morning you have the whole day to go.  I tried a dose of Scope and could taste mint and alcohol.  Then, I tried a dose of Scope Outlast for comparison and tasted a much more concentrated mint/mouthwashy flavor and less alcohol.  After a few seconds of rinsing though this taste goes away and it is just like swishing water in your mouth.  When you spit it out the aftertaste is the same as the initial taste and quickly fades away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the two bottles and did a side by side comparison of ingredients and here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;*They both have water listed as the main ingredient, not a surprise&lt;br /&gt;*Scope has 15% alcohol and Scope Outlast has 13%&lt;br /&gt;*The rest of the ingredients were the same and also in the same order&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I can conclude the taste differences are due to the difference in alcohol percentage and the infamous \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; labeling.  I think they took the minty flavor and increased it by 2% to make up for the loss of alcohol.  I will say that when swishing the mouthwash it was tingly and refreshing.  My breath feels like it will stay fresher, longer primarily due to the difference in concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful though, when you look at the back of the package you see the \\&quot;5X longer\\&quot; highlighted in green and I immediately thought that this meant that Scope Outlast was 5X stronger than regular Scope.  Not the case, if you read the claim it says that your breath feels fresh up to 5X longer (vs. brushing alone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just unscrewed the caps to take one more whiff and regular Scope definitely smells alcohol first, then mint.  Scope Outlast smells mint first, alcohol second.  This is primarily due to the ingredient shift.  Scope also makes no claims as to how long your breath will feel fresh vs. brushing alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final take is that if you are curious, give it a try, especially if you are a Scope user.  I like Scope Outlast better than Scope because it will keep my breath fresher longer and is more minty and less alcohol tasting (which makes it taste better).  Plus, I will do whatever easy steps I can to try to get fresher breath - and this is an easy one.r /&gt;My final take is that if you are curious, give it a try, especially if you are a Scope user.

            <li> Scope Outlast mouthwash has a really pleasant minty flavor and doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth too much.  The main issue I have with it is that it leaves my lips feeling tingly for hours afterwards.  Not in a minty way - just in a tingly, my arm went to sleep and is now pins and pricks kind of way.  That doesn&#x27;t keep my breath fresher, it just annoys me.  On the other hand, the mouthwash works in conjunction with brushing ones teeth, so it works great for a mouthwash - it just doesn&#x27;t last longer for me.</li>
            <li> Now, this is how mouthwash should be; straight forward, with its outstanding signature Scope flavor. I had been using what I have always considered Scope&#x27;s competitor, which I consider on the same plateau of effectiveness, pending the whim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scope Outlast is a unique, pleasurably tasting, gracefully lasting, flat-out delicious, minty fresh flavor. It is a shame that it is not safe to drink, it is that yummy - all while providing bacteria-fighting effectiveness at a premier level.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve preferred Scope to other mouthwashes for years. This one is slightly different tasting but I like it. What is improved is that it seems to last longer. I assume the high alcohol content (1/7 of the bottle) is to kill germs and the accompanying bad breath.</li>
            <li> The only new thing about Outlast Scope seems to be the bottle design. If you look close, there are no active ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> Scope Outlast Mouthwash in Long-Lasting Mint has a very pleasant minty flavor, very fresh and well, mouthwashy!  It does freshen the breath and it tastes good and is astringent so it makes the mouth feel tingly and clean.  I like the genie bottle package with the scalloped cap as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Scope for years and have always liked.  The main thing for me about mouthwash is the aftertaste.  Sometimes you gargle and it tastes pretty good but then a minute or so later you get this strange after taste.  But this is not one of those products. Love the design of the bottle too-it distinguishes itself when looking on the grocery shelve for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Better then any others. Doesn&#x27;t give you the dry burning feel others have and the scent of freshness lasts.</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this new Scope mouthwash.  It does stays longer in your mouth like a mint candy, and not like an unpleasant metallic lingering aftertaste.  It is not as strong tongue numbing like Listerine, but of course, it is not sold as an antiseptic. This is more to freshen your breath and be confident.  Just not a fan of the Genie bottle.</li>
            <li> I like traditional mouthwashes like the mint Listerine and Scope. I think this is a new formula of Scope, but it still has that classic 1960&#x27;s teardrop bottle. One nice thing about the cap is that it has a child lock, but you simply squeeze and it opens, unlike some other&#x27;s that are more difficult to open. This Scope has a slight mint taste with no burn. It seems to have made my mouth feel cleaner and my breath fresher. Original Scope users will like the Scope Outlast, it&#x27;s a fresh, minty tasting mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Mouthwash is one of those things that&#x27;s difficult to review truly accurately - until you&#x27;ve used it for months, gone to the dentist, and actually figured out if there were lasting results, it&#x27;s hard to fairly judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the shortterm, the focus can be taste and end-of-day refreshment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use either Listerine, or a child&#x27;s flouride rinse. With Listerine, I feel like it &#x27;must&#x27; be working, since it burns so much. On the other hand, I don&#x27;t usually have problems at the dentist, so I think it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Scope delivers as advertised. It does not burn like Listerine. It does taste minty and fresh. It provides overnight relief (but it&#x27;s gone by the next morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinse for about a minute, and it gets a little spicy at the end - but Listerine burns right from the first second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the taste though. But if it&#x27;s not burning, is it actually working? I&#x27;m not sure...I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy this regularly, but it might be a good switch between something minty like Scope, and then using Listerine every other day.</li>
            <li> Sometimes mouthwash is just that. While many products currently on the market claim various benefits, some claiming up to &#x27;six benefits&#x27;, Scope&#x27;s Outlast is manly about maintaining your fresh breath and it&#x27;s quite successful at that. When compared to competing products that are more focused on oral hygiene, my mouth felt minty-fresh longer with Scope&#x27;s and I couldn&#x27;t detect an aftertaste and that&#x27;s what Scope is mostly about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... if your problem is gingivitis, look elsewhere. But if you&#x27;re about to go out on a date, rinsing with Scope&#x27;s mouthwash may turn out to be a contributing factor to your date success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, ingredients. This one does have alcohol in addition to other difficult to pronounce chemicals and a secret ingredient referred to as &#x27;flavor&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My main use for mouthwash is to add some to the water when I use my Waterpik. My dentist recommended that as a way to boost the effectiveness of using a Waterpik alone, plus it adds a nice freshness to my mouth when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the store brand mouthwashes for that, but I may switch to this version of Scope. It&#x27;s much more concentrated - rather than having to use 2 or 3 capfuls of the store brand, I&#x27;m getting good results with only about 1/3 as much of the Scope. That puts the price per use less than the store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a clean, minty taste that lingers for some time. I also tried using it straight as mouthwash and it was a bit too intense for me. I normally avoid alcohol-based mouthwashes due to their harshness, and this was even more harsh than the store brands. But when used with a Waterpik, great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the bottle. It&#x27;s an odd size (flared at the bottom) and takes up more room than it should on the counter. A regular or more streamlined bottle shape would be better.</li>
            <li> I wish Scope wasn&#x27;t green, but that&#x27;s just me.  [[ASIN:B002P8F4ZG Scope Outlast Mouthwash-Long Lasting Mint-25 oz, 750 milliter]] isn&#x27;t as burning in the mouth as Listerine, but this particular Scope product leaves me with a bitter taste on the front end of my tongue which lasts for several minutes.  The minty flavor dissipates quickly and I&#x27;m left with that unpleasantness in my mouth.  I like the shape of the bottle because it&#x27;s easy to hold, however the cap isn&#x27;t easy to remove as one needs to push in on two particular spots at the base while turning.  I&#x27;d imagine that an arthritic hand would not be able to open this cap.  I don&#x27;t use the cap for measuring because I don&#x27;t want to have dripping Scope on the countertop or sides of the bottle.  I pour it directly into a small bathroom cup which I then fill with water and use for rinsing the mouth.  Because the bitter taste hasn&#x27;t lasted for longer than a few minutes and I&#x27;ve become accustomed to expecting this reaction, I&#x27;ll give this four stars and prefer to most other mouthwash products.  The green is identifiable with Scope, but I&#x27;m not in favor of unnecessary added colorings.</li>
            <li> I have been using Scope as a mouthwash since I was a teenager (and I don&#x27;t want to say how long ago THAT was).  I have seen Scope in different bottles, different colors, and different flavors.  I prefer the good old fashion Scope for its&#x27; taste and the impression that it keeps my breath fresh (although my wife says that it doesn&#x27;t do the job after a good Italian meal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to try the \\&quot;new\\&quot;, longer-lasting Scope and it tastes as good as the old relable.  I alternated the regular Scope with the \\&quot;new\\&quot; Scope and I really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.  Thant&#x27;s not a negative thing since the old stuff is still at the top of the mouthwash products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;Genie in the Bottle\\&quot; container.  No big deal except it takes up too much space when packing for a long trip.</li>
            <li> Scope Outlast mouthwash is not just a great tasting minty mouthwash, but it lasts a really long time. It truly does what it says. I have used many brands of mouthwash over the years. And while some tasted great and others had that burning alcohol taste, none of them lasted very long. Maybe an hour or two at the most. But with Scope Outlast the minty freshness lasts anywhere from 4 to 5 hours (without eating anything). I will be using this mouthwash for a long time.</li>
            <li> Despite the fancy name, this is same classic Scope mouthwash that I have always known, as far as I can tell.  There are more hardcore, mouth-blistering mouthwashes on the market if desired, but this one is pretty good and fairly strong without the nasty taste that a lot of alcohol-free mouthwashes seem to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A negative for me is the goofy, inefficient bottle.  If you don&#x27;t have a lot of shelf space, you&#x27;re wasting what you do have for only 75cl.</li>
            <li> Fresh breath is a priority for most people, but in my job I often find myself sitting closely beside a customer at their desk either troubleshooting a technical issue or training them on how to use our systems, so fresh breath is a must for my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I&#x27;ve used the [[ASIN:B000052YD8 Scope Original Mint Mouthwash 50.7 Fl Oz]] and it has worked well, but with newer options available, I thought I&#x27;d give them a try to see if they work any better than the trusty old Scope I&#x27;m so familiar with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scope Outlast Mouthwash-Long Lasting Mint seemed a good place to start. Made by a brand I already trust, its very title seems to promise that it will last longer than the older formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor of Scope Outlast is very similar to the Scope Original Mint version. Not surprising, since they are the same brand and similar flavor. What did seem different was that the Outlast was a bit stronger and that hours after using it, I still had a fresh feeling in my mouth, even after eating something for breakfast at work, and drinking a soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m pleased with the Scope Outlast Mouthwash. I plan to switch to this mouthwash the next time I need to purchase more.</li>
            <li> For mouthwash I&#x27;ve always used either Listerine or Equate, which is the Wal-mart equivalent of Listerine. Both of these brands burn my tongue so badly that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to rinse for the required time period. I thought that was just the way mouthwashes had to be unless you bought the alcohol-free ones. However, this Scope is more gentle and comfortable to use. There is a slight burn, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt like the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mouthwash instructions always say to rinse for 30 seconds. A dental hygienist once told me that you really should do it for a full minute, so that&#x27;s what I do. This mouthwash leaves a pleasant minty flavor after rinsing, and a \\&quot;just-brushed\\&quot; feeling rather than a \\&quot;just-burned\\&quot; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim for Scope Outlast is that it keeps your breath fresh up to 5 times longer versus brushing alone. I tend to use mouthwash in between brushings, so I&#x27;ll never be able to test the validity of that claim, but I do like this mouthwash and would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Scope Mouthwash, and the new \\&quot;Scope Outlast Mouthwash Long Lasting Mint\\&quot; is no different. It doesn&#x27;t taste much different than the old Scope Mint Mouthwash, which is a good thing. It is not an alcohol free mouthwash, so there is a little \\&quot;burn\\&quot; to it, but it is very mild. It does keep your mouth fresh for a long time too, but it&#x27;s \\&quot;5x longer\\&quot; claim might be a stretch. Scope has always been one of the best mouthwashes, and their new long lasting formular does its job very well.</li>
            <li> The taste of this mouthwash is ok for me, it&#x27;s not as bitter as some mouthwashes I&#x27;ve tried. I just don&#x27;t like the taste of alcohol in it, although it works in killing bacteria and keeps my mouth fresh for long time.</li>
            <li> I thought Scope Outlast Mouthwash was exaggerating when it claimed that using it would make one&#x27;s breath feel fresh five times longer than ordinary mouthwash.  I don&#x27;t know about five times longer, but I do know that my breath felt cleaner and fresher a lot longer than when I use my Crest 3D White Multi-Care Whitening Rinse Glamorous White - Fresh Mint [[[ASIN:B001FWXS2O Crest 3d White Multi-Care Whitening Rinse Glamorous White - Fresh Mint 473 Ml (Pack of 12)]]].  Scope Outlast has a strong mint taste that lingers a long time after I&#x27;ve rinsed my mouth.  In fact, I love this mint taste so much that I think twice before drinking coffee or eating a snack that will diminish it.  In other words, it serves as a deterrent for consuming snacks that might cause cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have used Scope Outlast Mouthwash for nearly two weeks and it has not stained my teeth or my tongue.  All my friends tell me that I have beautiful white teeth.  I owe this to brushing, flossing and rinsing at least three times a day.  At first, I was fearful that Scope Outlast Mouthwash, with its bright green color, would stain my teeth but it never did.  Nevertheless, I have two major dislikes about this product:  It contains alcohol that burns my mouth when I begin rinsing.  (I never hold the mouthwash for more than thirty seconds.)  The child-proof cap is very difficult to remove for those of us who have arthritic hands.  (Remember, one doesn&#x27;t have to be old to have arthritis.)  Overall, I would recommend this mouthwash to anyone who is trying to decrease cavities.  Using it gives me confidence that I am doing everything I can to prevent cavities while making myself more presentable to those around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyos</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought that Listerine was too painful (even the less intense kind) and the non-alcohol mouthwashes leave a really bad aftertaste. I know they claim that alcohol dries out your mouth while the non-alcoholic rinses keep your mouth moist, but to me, it feels like to opposite is true. The non-alcoholic mouthwashes give me cotton mouth for hours and hours afterward. Whereas Scope, specifically this formula, made my mouth feel very fresh and clean for a long time. My mouth didn&#x27;t feel dry at all. It gave me a tingly feeling shortly afterward, and then a fresh feeling through out the morning and afternoon. I would periodically check with my husband and he said my breath was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Scope is definitely my favorite mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I like the Scope Outlast Mouthwash-Long Lasting Mint. I have used Scope for years in the many variations that have come out. I have used other brands other than Scope and I have always come back to Scope. There is a pleasant mint taste. The mouthwash does not taste antispetic like some other do. This mouthwash seems to leave a nice clean minty tast longer than most. It would be well worth it to try this product.</li>
