    <ol>
            <li>It works wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>This oil is odorless, colorless, and downright awesome!</li>
            <li>and I made a flea killer for my dog that worked great!</li>
            <li>I used it as a make up remover and also worked great!</li>
            <li>But I gotta say this stuff is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Beside that I would say this is a very good product</li>
            <li>This FCO has been ideal for blending EO roller bottles, except for the cap.</li>
            <li>excellent product and great price</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>The oil itself has been great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it alone (2 drops) for fly aways in my hair.</li>
            <li>The oil is great but there is no scent.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil is great, the &amp;#34;free pump&amp;#34; is garbage.</li>
            <li>A great product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for skin, face, and hair.</li>
            <li>Great for massages.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li>The oil is great but the packaging is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anything coconut is great-</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>The oil is good.</li>
            <li>The packaging was good.</li>
            <li>Luckily I got a refund via Amazon&#x27;s excellent customer service, however now I must find another bottle or way to dispense the oil vs pouring it out onto my hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got the opportunity to try it and review it!</li>
            <li>There are so many things you can do with coconut oil!</li>
            <li>was very smooth which was good for massage.</li>
            <li>My hair feels absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>I buy rollerballs off amazon to make my own rollerballs.</li>
            <li>this oil to make your own vicks chest rub.</li>
            <li>and then when you decide you are ready get the best brand in the market....</li>
            <li>This is my honest and unbiased opinion,</li>
            <li>The oil looked nice and had no smell in the bottle.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves it and honestly I like it too.</li>
            <li>This oil is fantastic, it&#x27;s super hydrating and smells awesome!</li>
            <li>I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>One of the best products I&#x27;ve reviewed thus far!</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend that the seal on top of the oil opening be made of a stronger material.  </li>
            <li>Interestingly, the &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; sign is erased from the bottle image on the Amazon website.</li>
            <li>which makes it much more easier to use.</li>
            <li>If you use essential oils and need an awesome carrier oil, this is it....</li>
            <li>You can add your favorite EO and make s blend that works for you... Or use it for its many stand alone benefits...</li>
            <li>Awesome and love using it for my essential oil blends!</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I, personally, love the creaminess of non fractionated coconut oil and find that it absorbs much better into my face without feeling greasy than the fractionated oil.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>What more can I say..</li>
            <li>This oil does not have any smell which is what I like the most</li>
            <li>I am in love with this coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a top like a ketchup bottle, for inverting then squirting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it is a fractionated version, this coconut oil should be more stable.</li>
            <li>A tradeoff is that this oil is more lightweight which some may not like.</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t anything over the top tho.</li>
            <li>I have never tried coconut oil before, so I was very excited when given this opportunity to review it.</li>
            <li>When I got a chance to review this item for a lowered price I was excited!</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my hair and scalp and now use it on my face arms and legs as it is a perfect for moisturizing the dry skin.</li>
            <li>The oil is great so far, but the pump will continue to leak oil through the top even when not in use.</li>
            <li>I love fractionated coconut oil, and this seems to be just fine.</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle and I love that because I use a lot of fractionated coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came witha  free pump and applicator top.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a strong coconut scent.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and ships quickly!</li>
            <li>In exchange for my unbiased honest opinion I received a promotional price for this 16oz bottle of Majestic Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is scent free and stays liquid, which is why it is such a great carrier oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did not come with the free pump like stated.</li>
            <li>I like the product, but I didnt&#x27; get my free pump.</li>
            <li>Light and without a scent.</li>
            <li>Fortunately nothing else in the shipment was damaged by the runaway oil.</li>
            <li>My skin feels silky and smooth now.</li>
            <li>This is excellent quality and I&#x27;m going to use it as my main carrier oil for my essential</li>
            <li>It only came with the squeeze top, which didn&#x27;t look like the one pictured, but more like something that looks like it belongs on the top of a condiment bottle.</li>
            <li>Better advertising, such as an accurate picture, would be nice.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a massage therapist and generally familiar with the smell of rancid oils</li>
            <li>It absorbed very quickly by your skin and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>Love this pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I like the product and really like the pump and squirt top.</li>
            <li>I was super bummed when this Fractionated Coconut Oil arrived.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super versatile.</li>
            <li>This was important to me, and it was why I chose Majestic over the others (plus all the positive reviews).  </li>
            <li>The oil inside the bottle is good, you loose a bunch if it&#x27;s just sitting on the shelf.</li>
            <li>My skin drinks this stuff in and it would make a great hair treatment for medium to thick hair - mine is fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great as a massage oil as well, and you can use whatever essential oil you want to make yourself massage oils, just make sure you store any essential oil mixes in either glass or PET plastic, that is safe for essential oils</li>
            <li>and it gets absorbed well into your skin.</li>
            <li>review will be rather short as it&#x27;s a good quality oil that works in most places where you would use traditional coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I use the coconut oil to untangle my hair right before I am about to shower.</li>
            <li>Thank you Majestic Pure!</li>
            <li>I would not normally be the kind of guy that writes a coconut oil review.  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying using it with my DoTerra Essential oils.  </li>
            <li>am providing a chart to show dilution rates if you are using this as a carrier oil, it will show you how many drops of essential oil to use in a carrier oil.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that they were willing to do this, and look forward to using their product.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it (and every time I&#x27;ve used it since)</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin and this product leaves my skin feeling smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>( There is even a date on the product saying that it is good for 5 years and was just packaged, so if that is true then there is a serious contamination issue.</li>
            <li>The product description refers generally ti coconut oil, but suggests their oil is partucularly gives good quality for value and price, with the distinct impression that their item offers 48 ounces of their oil rather than what the item actually contains.</li>
            <li>It was pretty flimsy feeling and easily split open while being shipped.  </li>
            <li>But the company went the extra mild to make it right, and I really think that speaks volumes!</li>
            <li>However, I was contacted by Majestic Pure and they sent me another bottle, security seal in place.  </li>
            <li>I live in one of the most arid parts of the country, so moisturizing is essential.</li>
            <li>My mother, who has dry hair, now has very silky smooth hair!</li>
            <li>so it was a little heavy, but it did add awesome shine!</li>
            <li>and this has helped so much.</li>
            <li>Really, feels just like baby oil to me, whatever that&#x27;s made of.</li>
            <li>I really want to try it as a deodorant and toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I am very please with this product and with the seller.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s kind of messy!</li>
            <li>Their product description text reads, &amp;#34;oils&amp;#34; and pictures 3 bottles on the main picture.</li>
            <li>I like having a pump because it helps with the mess of touching the cap and getting the bottle oily</li>
            <li>It is a very thin consistency and goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>I put a little in my hair to make it shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>Mine didn&#x27;t come with the little droplet top, just the normal cap and the pump.</li>
            <li>The top tends to leak a little bit (I use the squirt top) which can be a bit of a messy annoyance, but that&#x27;s probably my fault for spilling it.</li>
            <li>The 16oz bottle will probably last quite a while since I only needed a single pump per arm and it spread nicely.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s $10 for a small rollerball of it, so much better to make your own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first bottle of Majestic coconut oil I received had the seal torn open.  </li>
            <li>I have had it 2 days and its nearly gone!</li>
            <li>The oil leaked in the box creating a large stain on the outside and puddle on the inside of the box.  </li>
            <li>I tried out Majestic Pure&#x27;s fractionated coconut oil and have mixed feelings about it.</li>
            <li>After gently rubbing in my arms did not feel greasy but definitely felt moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use it for nearly everything.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was temperature abused or is old.</li>
            <li>This does the trick with no odors (unless you put some essential oil in), and more importantly, no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased how my soft my hair and skin has turned out since I started using the coconut oil a little less than a month ago.</li>
            <li>the pump leaks everywhere and leaves an oily mess to clean.</li>
            <li>In the past I used the coconut oil for my hair but the problem was that it had strong smell and used to leave oil stains on everything it touched like pillows and couches.</li>
            <li>like to use lavender mixed with this on healing cuts and burns, once it&#x27;s not longer an open wound they heal so much faster, try it and you will be amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Such a reasonable price, will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li>I find this very peculiar,  and actually makes me question the validity of the purity of the product, and the actual date of Mfg.</li>
            <li>A little peppermint oil and this rubbed into feet is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> ( There is even a date on the product saying that it is good for 5 years and was just packaged, so if that is true then there is a serious contamination issue.</li>
            <li> The product description refers generally ti coconut oil, but suggests their oil is partucularly gives good quality for value and price, with the distinct impression that their item offers 48 ounces of their oil rather than what the item actually contains.</li>
            <li> It was pretty flimsy feeling and easily split open while being shipped.  </li>
            <li> But the company went the extra mild to make it right, and I really think that speaks volumes!</li>
            <li> However, I was contacted by Majestic Pure and they sent me another bottle, security seal in place.  </li>
            <li> I live in one of the most arid parts of the country, so moisturizing is essential.</li>
            <li> My mother, who has dry hair, now has very silky smooth hair!</li>
            <li> so it was a little heavy, but it did add awesome shine!</li>
            <li> and this has helped so much.</li>
            <li> Really, feels just like baby oil to me, whatever that&#x27;s made of.</li>
            <li> I really want to try it as a deodorant and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this product and with the seller.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s kind of messy!</li>
            <li> Their product description text reads, &amp;#34;oils&amp;#34; and pictures 3 bottles on the main picture.</li>
            <li> I like having a pump because it helps with the mess of touching the cap and getting the bottle oily</li>
            <li> It is a very thin consistency and goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> I put a little in my hair to make it shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t come with the little droplet top, just the normal cap and the pump.</li>
            <li> The top tends to leak a little bit (I use the squirt top) which can be a bit of a messy annoyance, but that&#x27;s probably my fault for spilling it.</li>
            <li> The 16oz bottle will probably last quite a while since I only needed a single pump per arm and it spread nicely.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s $10 for a small rollerball of it, so much better to make your own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first bottle of Majestic coconut oil I received had the seal torn open.  </li>
            <li> I have had it 2 days and its nearly gone!</li>
            <li> The oil leaked in the box creating a large stain on the outside and puddle on the inside of the box.  </li>
            <li> I tried out Majestic Pure&#x27;s fractionated coconut oil and have mixed feelings about it.</li>
            <li> After gently rubbing in my arms did not feel greasy but definitely felt moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use it for nearly everything.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was temperature abused or is old.</li>
            <li> This does the trick with no odors (unless you put some essential oil in), and more importantly, no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased how my soft my hair and skin has turned out since I started using the coconut oil a little less than a month ago.</li>
            <li> the pump leaks everywhere and leaves an oily mess to clean.</li>
            <li> In the past I used the coconut oil for my hair but the problem was that it had strong smell and used to leave oil stains on everything it touched like pillows and couches.</li>
            <li> like to use lavender mixed with this on healing cuts and burns, once it&#x27;s not longer an open wound they heal so much faster, try it and you will be amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Such a reasonable price, will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I find this very peculiar,  and actually makes me question the validity of the purity of the product, and the actual date of Mfg.</li>
            <li> A little peppermint oil and this rubbed into feet is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excite to try Majestic Pure Coconut Oil because its not in solid which what I usually use.</li>
            <li> At least it was in a Ziploc, which was full of oil, so the other items in my box were not damaged.</li>
            <li> Again though, this oil is good as a base when mixing essential</li>
            <li> Unlike baby oil it just sat on my skin and didn&#x27;t absorb in or dry up, which sort of left it wet and oily.  </li>
            <li> I even put it in my hair the other night and washed my hair the next morning.</li>
            <li> (other plastics will deteriorate with essential</li>
            <li> Using this on my skin to help with itching and being dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for massages and to help dry skin areas.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of use on my dry skinned arms I can say that this has left them moisturized all day long after rubbing in the night before.</li>
            <li> It comes in a big bottle and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It was left to roll around in a larger box with one small piece of shipping material.</li>
            <li> If you cluck through, the less obvious of their product description photos show one bottle..</li>
            <li> The color is yellow and not clean.</li>
            <li> Add a few drops of essential oils to give your body treatments an aromatherapy boost.</li>
            <li> but my hair seems less dry and looks healthier to me.</li>
            <li> The oil seems thinner than others I&#x27;ve purchased and my skin does not stay hydrated like other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Bottle leaked and damaged the package with other items in it.</li>
            <li> ; I don&#x27;t think any other brands have these.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work out very well.</li>
            <li> I also put the oil on my skin after my showers when my skin is still slightly damp.</li>
            <li> There is also an issue with the pump leaking all over my counter and making a mess.  </li>
            <li> I am always finding a ring of coconut oil on my counter no matter how tight I screw the cap on.</li>
            <li> That way you can get away from petroleum which is no good for your skin, and keep the harsh ingredients out and just use essential</li>
            <li> Was a little dissappoined.</li>
            <li> oils!&lt;br /&gt;I added a little vitamin c and lemon to make a lotion/bug repellant..</li>
            <li> I get my hair a little damp, part my hair in four sections, put about 2 quarter size amount in each section, and use my fingers to untangle my hair.</li>
            <li> Its thin compared to coconut oil and liquid instead of a solid</li>
            <li> messy.</li>
            <li> Seal missing off bottle.</li>
            <li> So, this item is at least 2/3 less value than an unwitting or mistaken buyer may assume about the quality and value of the product described and pictured.</li>
            <li> I was looking for organic, this cannot be ingested, therefore, not safe for use in body lotions</li>
            <li> The lid was not able to contain the oil that had spilled out.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the ridges don&#x27;t line up, the pump itself is faulty</li>
            <li> When I use it after a while it smells icky.</li>
            <li> or I just got a wonky one but</li>
            <li> However, once it was on the skin for a short while it started to have a noticeably unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I also put a very small amount in my hair after my shower.</li>
            <li> Not impressed to receive a bottle with less product than what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Not a good lubricating oil.</li>
            <li> This was frustrating for me.  </li>
            <li> China has poor manufacturing standards</li>
            <li> I use this as the base to mix with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it until I used it on a client.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is also not great.</li>
            <li> Works well as base for applying essential oils, but unfortunately it does tend to make me break out just a bit.  </li>
            <li> just not a good start!  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Totally useless.</li>
            <li> In addition, there is a smell to this product which I found difficult to tolerate for any length of time.</li>
            <li> I would find it difficult to recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> My oil smells weird.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Tried using this as a moisturizer and it just has this funky, unpleasant smell on the skin.</li>
            <li> When I lived there for 6 years in china and I had a lot of bad experience/ quality.</li>
            <li> Sort of like oil that has gone bad or rancid.</li>
            <li> but this coconut oil had a really bad odor.</li>
            <li> It was bad.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to receive an unsealed bottle -</li>
            <li> My bathroom counter is covered with oil that leaked from the base of the pump.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> leaks TERRIBLY.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a replacement and this pump also is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was looking for organic, this cannot be ingested, therefore, not safe for use in body lotions</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Only problem is that the pump/bottle constantly leaks.  I am always finding a ring of coconut oil on my counter no matter how tight I screw the cap on.</li>
            <li> The pump leaks when not in use. The oil inside the bottle is good, you loose a bunch if it&#x27;s just sitting on the shelf. I will not order again!!</li>
            <li> The oil itself has been great.  I am enjoying using it with my DoTerra Essential oils.  I have one recommendation though.  When I received the oil in my amazon shipment, it had opened in route and leaked all over everything else.  This was frustrating for me.  I would recommend that the seal on top of the oil opening be made of a stronger material.  It was pretty flimsy feeling and easily split open while being shipped.  The lid was not able to contain the oil that had spilled out.  Beside that I would say this is a very good product and I would buy it again, but only in a store.  It does not ship well.</li>
            <li> I never used this once Coconut Oil for my face..It&#x60;s made in china.When I lived there for 6 years in china and I had a lot of bad experience/ quality. But now I used this Coconut Oil for my bamboo furniture from the Philippines. It is not longer possible to order our products and services...No, products from china. Sorry</li>
            <li> FYI, this product is made in China. It may not bother some people but it caught me off guard. I never thought about coconut oil being made in China. Interestingly, the &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; sign is erased from the bottle image on the Amazon website. I cannot comment on the quality because I am returning mine before opening it.</li>
            <li> In exchange for my unbiased honest opinion I received a promotional price for this 16oz bottle of Majestic Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil. After a few days of use on my dry skinned arms I can say that this has left them moisturized all day long after rubbing in the night before. Its thin compared to coconut oil and liquid instead of a solid which makes it much more easier to use. This came with a bonus pump that fits the oil bottle. The 16oz bottle will probably last quite a while since I only needed a single pump per arm and it spread nicely. After gently rubbing in my arms did not feel greasy but definitely felt moisturized. It does not seem to have a scent that  I can smell and there are lots of uses for it. I even put it in my hair the other night and washed my hair the next morning. no greasy residue but my hair seems less dry and looks healthier to me.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle and I love that because I use a lot of fractionated coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a carrier oil for my essential oils. I buy rollerballs off amazon to make my own rollerballs. You can add 2 drops peppermint 2 drops lavender to 10ml of this carrier oil in a rollerball and apply it to your temples and back of your neck for headaches and migraines. It works just like mygrastick, which you can find on amazon as well but it&#x27;s $10 for a small rollerball of it, so much better to make your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use lavender mixed with this on healing cuts and burns, once it&#x27;s not longer an open wound they heal so much faster, try it and you will be amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great as a massage oil as well, and you can use whatever essential oil you want to make yourself massage oils, just make sure you store any essential oil mixes in either glass or PET plastic, that is safe for essential oils (other plastics will deteriorate with essential oils)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is scent free and stays liquid, which is why it is such a great carrier oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it alone (2 drops) for fly aways in my hair. I&#x27;ve used it alone for vaginal dryness. Rubbed into my feet to moisturize. A little peppermint oil and this rubbed into feet is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this oil to make your own vicks chest rub. That way you can get away from petroleum which is no good for your skin, and keep the harsh ingredients out and just use essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find all sorts of recipes online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am providing a chart to show dilution rates if you are using this as a carrier oil, it will show you how many drops of essential oil to use in a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> If you use essential oils and need an awesome carrier oil, this is it.... You can add your favorite EO and make s blend that works for you... Or use it for its many stand alone benefits... Do your research on what FCO can do and then when you decide you are ready get the best brand in the market.... This is my honest and unbiased opinion,</li>
            <li> I like the product and really like the pump and squirt top. However, after I received the product I noticed it was manufactured in China. China has poor manufacturing standards and I do not trust products manufactured there, for that reason I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Awesome and love using it for my essential oil blends! The top tends to leak a little bit (I use the squirt top) which can be a bit of a messy annoyance, but that&#x27;s probably my fault for spilling it. Mine didn&#x27;t come with the little droplet top, just the normal cap and the pump.</li>
            <li> Packaged well.  Came witha  free pump and applicator top.  I love it.  I mixed with my castor oil, and now I&#x27;m adding this to my scalp.  This works well with castor oil for people needing to regrow hair!!!</li>
            <li> I like the oil, it&#x27;s not sticky, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work as well. It spills all around the bottle everytime I use it.  So it&#x27;s kind of messy!</li>
            <li> Works well as base for applying essential oils, but unfortunately it does tend to make me break out just a bit.  Not sure why.  I switched back to using organic non fractionated coconut oil (from my farmers market) and my face is back to not breaking out.  I, personally, love the creaminess of non fractionated coconut oil and find that it absorbs much better into my face without feeling greasy than the fractionated oil.  Again though, this oil is good as a base when mixing essential oils.&lt;br /&gt; I might still re-purchase this, but I may also try out another brand.&lt;br /&gt;Pump leaks TERRIBLY.  My bathroom counter is covered with oil that leaked from the base of the pump. messy.</li>
            <li> The oil is great but there is no scent. I was expecting a strong coconut scent.</li>
            <li> I actually thought  was getting three bottles. Was a little dissappoined.</li>
            <li> The oil seems thinner than others I&#x27;ve purchased and my skin does not stay hydrated like other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Only wish it had the smell of coconut! Using this on my skin to help with itching and being dry.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is great, the &amp;#34;free pump&amp;#34; is garbage. It leaks. Totally useless. I had to transfer it all into another bottle to avoid loosing all the oil.</li>
            <li> A great product.  I use this as the base to mix with essential oils.</li>
            <li> This oil is fantastic, it&#x27;s super hydrating and smells awesome! Such a reasonable price, will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Did not come with the free pump like stated. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Bottle was open. And leaked all over package.  Seal missing off bottle. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Had to return.  The foil seal was loosened and it had leaked out.  At least it was in a Ziploc, which was full of oil, so the other items in my box were not damaged.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but I didnt&#x27; get my free pump.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for skin, face, and hair. I have extremely sensitive skin and this has helped so much.</li>
            <li> Bottle leaked and damaged the package with other items in it. Not impressed to receive a bottle with less product than what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Great for massages. Light and without a scent.</li>
            <li> Tried using this as a moisturizer and it just has this funky, unpleasant smell on the skin. Sort of like oil that has gone bad or rancid. Not even hint of coconut smell to this oil. Really, feels just like baby oil to me, whatever that&#x27;s made of. Shirt even smells rancid after applying it. Gross. Will be returning it. 2 stars are for nifty pump attachment!</li>
            <li> This is an update to a recent review that was unfavorable.  The first bottle of Majestic coconut oil I received had the seal torn open.  Because I didn&#x27;t know if it had been tampered with, I returned it to Amazon.  Rather than try reordering another bottle of this same brand, I went with another brand.  However, I was contacted by Majestic Pure and they sent me another bottle, security seal in place.  I appreciate that they were willing to do this, and look forward to using their product.  I do like that it has both a pump and nozzle dispenser; I don&#x27;t think any other brands have these.  This was important to me, and it was why I chose Majestic over the others (plus all the positive reviews).  I was disappointed to receive an unsealed bottle - just not a good start!  But the company went the extra mild to make it right, and I really think that speaks volumes!</li>
            <li> I was excite to try Majestic Pure Coconut Oil because its not in solid which what I usually use. It is a very thin consistency and goes on nice and smooth. I use it on my hair and skin. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for massages and to help dry skin areas.  It works wonderfully!  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Made in China. Do NOT BUY. The color is yellow and not clean. YUCK</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like rating products as 1 but this coconut oil had a really bad odor. I used it on my hair and scalp and I had to wash my hair to get the smell out....and wash my pillow cases and hair ties and scarves. It was bad.</li>
            <li> I was super bummed when this Fractionated Coconut Oil arrived. Based on the image, I was under the impression that it would come with a pump, which is why I chose this specific brand. It only came with the squeeze top, which didn&#x27;t look like the one pictured, but more like something that looks like it belongs on the top of a condiment bottle. Better advertising, such as an accurate picture, would be nice.</li>
            <li> This oil is odorless, colorless, and downright awesome! It&#x27;s super versatile. My skin drinks this stuff in and it would make a great hair treatment for medium to thick hair - mine is fine so it was a little heavy, but it did add awesome shine! Add a few drops of essential oils to give your body treatments an aromatherapy boost. You can do anything with this terrific oil! I&#x27;m so glad I got the opportunity to try it and review it!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and I had hoped it would work well as a skin moisturizer.  Unfortunately, this did not work out very well. Unlike baby oil it just sat on my skin and didn&#x27;t absorb in or dry up, which sort of left it wet and oily.  In addition, there is a smell to this product which I found difficult to tolerate for any length of time. There is also an issue with the pump leaking all over my counter and making a mess.  I would find it difficult to recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this. When I got a chance to review this item for a lowered price I was excited! I use coconut oil on a daily basis! I use it for nearly everything. I did not have it but 5 minutes and I made a flea killer for my dog that worked great! I used it as a make up remover and also worked great! I put a little in my hair to make it shiny and smooth! There are so many things you can do with coconut oil! I can&#x27;t wait til my next order get a here. This is excellent quality and I&#x27;m going to use it as my main carrier oil for my essential oils!&lt;br /&gt;I added a little vitamin c and lemon to make a lotion/bug repellant.. What more can I say.. it&#x27;s really great. I have had it 2 days and its nearly gone! I have been using  it for EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> I live in one of the most arid parts of the country, so moisturizing is essential. This does the trick with no odors (unless you put some essential oil in), and more importantly, no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and easy to use.  High quality.</li>
            <li> The coconut oil seems to be as advertised but there was a problem in the shipping.  The oil leaked in the box creating a large stain on the outside and puddle on the inside of the box.  The bottle was not sealed; an inch of oil leaked from the bottle.  Fortunately nothing else in the shipment was damaged by the runaway oil.</li>
            <li> When the item arrived the oil leaked and soaked the box that it was in. It was left to roll around in a larger box with one small piece of shipping material. The oil looked nice and had no smell in the bottle. However, once it was on the skin for a short while it started to have a noticeably unpleasant odor. I don&#x27;t know if that means it was rancid. I got my money back. Maybe it was my chemistry but I doubt it.</li>
            <li> Love this pure coconut oil. My skin feels silky and smooth now.</li>
            <li> I would not normally be the kind of guy that writes a coconut oil review.  But I gotta say this stuff is excellent.  If for whatever reason you are thinking of buying it, whether for massage or skin care or whatever, trust me it&#x27;s good stuff. My girlfriend loves it and honestly I like it too.</li>
            <li> The oil is great so far, but the pump will continue to leak oil through the top even when not in use. Bummer! Luckily I got a refund via Amazon&#x27;s excellent customer service, however now I must find another bottle or way to dispense the oil vs pouring it out onto my hands. Otherwise d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Not a good lubricating oil. I will not buy again</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my hair and scalp and now use it on my face arms and legs as it is a perfect for moisturizing the dry skin. In the past I used the coconut oil for my hair but the problem was that it had strong smell and used to leave oil stains on everything it touched like pillows and couches. This oil does not have any smell which is what I like the most and it gets absorbed well into your skin. I have normal to dry skin and this product leaves my skin feeling smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> The oil is good. The packaging was good. The first time I used it (and every time I&#x27;ve used it since) the pump leaks everywhere and leaves an oily mess to clean.</li>
            <li> Did not come with pump or cap as advertised</li>
            <li> YUCK! This oil arrived to my house yellow:( There is even a date on the product saying that it is good for 5 years and was just packaged, so if that is true then there is a serious contamination issue.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this coconut oil. I use it for my hair and my skin. I only wash my hair 2 or 3 times a week. On Sunday is my big wash. I use the coconut oil to untangle my hair right before I am about to shower. I get my hair a little damp, part my hair in four sections, put about 2 quarter size amount in each section, and use my fingers to untangle my hair. And then leave it in my hair for about 10 minutes before I take a shower. I also put a very small amount in my hair after my shower. I also put the oil on my skin after my showers when my skin is still slightly damp. I am very pleased how my soft my hair and skin has turned out since I started using the coconut oil a little less than a month ago. It comes in a big bottle and a little goes a long way. I am very pleased with this product! One of the best products I&#x27;ve reviewed thus far!</li>
            <li> This FCO has been ideal for blending EO roller bottles, except for the cap. I wish it had a top like a ketchup bottle, for inverting then squirting. I have to use a dropper instead.</li>
            <li> When I use it after a while it smells icky.</li>
            <li> I love fractionated coconut oil, and this seems to be just fine. One thing however I notice an attached lable indicating the Mfg. Date as: June 17, 2015. The Exp. Date shows: June 16, 2015. I find this very peculiar,  and actually makes me question the validity of the purity of the product, and the actual date of Mfg. Lot # is: 0617MP-FCO. TY I am not disatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> My oil smells weird. I&#x27;ve never used this product before but I&#x27;m a massage therapist and generally familiar with the smell of rancid oils and that&#x27;s what mine smells like. Maybe it was temperature abused or is old. I didn&#x27;t notice it until I used it on a client.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is also not great. There was oil spilled all over the bag.&lt;br /&gt;oil was very smooth which was good for massage.</li>
            <li> excellent product and great price</li>
            <li> I tried out Majestic Pure&#x27;s fractionated coconut oil and have mixed feelings about it. The oil is great but the packaging is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE 04/19/2015* I ordered a replacement and this pump also is horrible. I am taking a star off because it isn&#x27;t a one-off and for the hassle of oil leaking, I could get another comparable product/bottle with a pump that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review will be rather short as it&#x27;s a good quality oil that works in most places where you would use traditional coconut oil. The ONLY PROBLEM I have is the pump. I&#x27;m not sure if the ridges don&#x27;t line up, the pump itself is faulty or I just got a wonky one but oil leaks out of the spout and the ring every time I pump it out. I like having a pump because it helps with the mess of touching the cap and getting the bottle oily but this one does not work for me. Hopefully this is a one-off and no one else has this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is a fractionated version, this coconut oil should be more stable. A tradeoff is that this oil is more lightweight which some may not like.</li>
            <li> Works well but smells like baby vomit.</li>
            <li> Anything coconut is great- this isn&#x27;t anything over the top tho.</li>
            <li> I have never tried coconut oil before, so I was very excited when given this opportunity to review it. I have started using it on my hair and face. My hair feels absolutely amazing. My mother, who has dry hair, now has very silky smooth hair! I have also been applying it to my face as a face wash. I really want to try it as a deodorant and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The product appears acceptable in quality unless you compare the quality to the price. The product description refers generally ti coconut oil, but suggests their oil is partucularly gives good quality for value and price, with the distinct impression that their item offers 48 ounces of their oil rather than what the item actually contains. Their product description text reads, &amp;#34;oils&amp;#34; and pictures 3 bottles on the main picture. If you cluck through, the less obvious of their product description photos show one bottle.. So, this item is at least 2/3 less value than an unwitting or mistaken buyer may assume about the quality and value of the product described and pictured. The item described as &amp;#34;oils&amp;#34; and picturing three bottles is actually ONE bottle of OIL.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and ships quickly! Thank you Majestic Pure!</li>
            <li> My skin loves this oil. It absorbed very quickly by your skin and leaves no residue. I am very please with this product and with the seller. I will continue to buy it.</li>
