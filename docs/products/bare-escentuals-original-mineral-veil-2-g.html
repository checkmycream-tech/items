            <li>Really good and original product.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it makes my skin look young and flawless.</li>
            <li>VEil is a must with bare minerals, it finishes the makeup and makes it stay in place for a flawless finish</li>
            <li>best results way is to start with the bare escentuals and finish with bare&lt;br /&gt;escentuals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very light</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really impressed, brand name Bare Minerals is much better.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I feel confident again.  </li>
            <li>I love mineral Veil.</li>
            <li>I love this line.</li>
            <li>always looks better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This goes on top of the foundation (powder) as a finishing veil.</li>
            <li>Why do I have to add 19 more words if I already raved about the product?</li>
            <li>And now you want 3 more words??</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>If you have clear skin, like me though, it is perfect for a light cover to ad a matte finish.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love that the minerals are so lightweight that you forget you are wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products when it comes to cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Love the Veil.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite BE products, so I ordered three.  </li>
            <li>Oh well though, that was probably my fault. :)</li>
            <li>I love how it soften the look.</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite make up product out there.</li>
            <li>love all their products</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I love this my friend told me about it</li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t ask for much better.</li>
            <li>Perfect to cover up red spots or even out brown spots.  </li>
            <li>The Bare Escentuals Original Mineral Veil is one of the best finishing products for your skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more finely milled and doesn&#x27;t contain talc, which I am allergic to.  </li>
            <li>The mineral veil gives my makeup a beautiful, silky smooth finish that&#x27;s soft to touch, and my face never gets shiny anymore since using it.</li>
            <li>Probably best of all, Bare Escentuals stays on and fresh for hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found cheaper knock-offs, but the real BE product really is superior.</li>
            <li>I love how fresh this makes me feel!</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t read the fine print and didn&#x27;t realize that I was not buying the full-sized item.  </li>
            <li>Nice addition to my original order, thanks!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so light and does not sit in your fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals is an amazing line of products!</li>
            <li>My item arrived fast, was packaged nicely, and saved me a ton of money.</li>
            <li>the company which I bought the product from was absolutely amazing and shipped my product in a very timely manner</li>
            <li>The color is too light.</li>
            <li>so if I use this I like a really light liquid foundation underneath</li>
            <li>It sounded like something important.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky smooth</li>
            <li>crease free.</li>
            <li>Mineral Veil adds a light &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; to my make up and helps to keep it on all day.</li>
            <li>I would say that it is light and covers</li>
            <li>This product is solid, follow the instructions - it always does a great job.</li>
            <li>It is light like your not wearing anything.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it honestly didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
            <li>It covered up the look of pores and gives a smooth all over feeling</li>
            <li>Great last minute add-to for adding a glow to your face.  </li>
            <li>, Overall, I di not spend a fortune so for the price I will be happy.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love the Bare Minerals products...</li>
            <li>old woman.......figured powder would collect in creases &amp; just make me look older, but surprisingly, this has not been the case!</li>
            <li>Have used their essentials in the past, very happy with the price will purchase here again.</li>
            <li>wonderful product for all you bare essential wearers.</li>
            <li>I like it because it kind of evens my skin color out, but if my face is clear</li>
            <li>but this mineral veil gives a nice, natural finishing touch to my skin.</li>
            <li>I rarely need to touch up my foundation when I add this light layer at the end.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this again but not because the product isn&#x27;t good only because it didn&#x27;t help with the shine.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>The inert ingredients are naturally good for the human face.</li>
            <li>Mineral Veil is the finishing product and leaves everything soft &amp;amp; brings all together nicely.</li>
            <li>I am actually not even sure the product I got was mineral veil because when I tried out my friend&#x27;s I remembered liking it more.  </li>
            <li>this particular product &amp;#34;veil&amp;#34; is the one I like and use the most.</li>
            <li>However, I must wear a powder sunblock over it for adequate protection.</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil is amazing.</li>
            <li>Mineral Veil is so light that in hot weather you don&#x27;t feel it or sweat.</li>
            <li>It looks good all day long</li>
            <li>It cuts down on the shine I get and also acts great as a finishing powder.</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals has never caused me to break out and is great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Mineral makeup and no one does it better than Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing this mineral veil because it hides large pores and blends well over the mineral powder.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing how you can see the transformation instantly.  </li>
            <li>I will still continue to use the blush, because it&#x27;s the most natural flush out there.  </li>
            <li>It sets makeup so well that I rarely have to reapply.</li>
            <li>It keeps my makeup looking fresh all day</li>
            <li>It was just as describe and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>You can see them all on Amazon and take your time choosing just the right color combinations etc  without a salesperson standing in front of  you.</li>
            <li>Same great bare escentuals</li>
            <li>I may be old and fat but my skin looks marvelous thanks to Bare Escentuals Bare Minerals products.  </li>
            <li>Everything thing they claim is absolute true.  </li>
            <li>I love this Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil.  </li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals is not the answer to better makeup or skincare.  </li>
            <li>Although I am greatly satisfied with the product, I wish I would have seen more clearly that it is only 2g!</li>
            <li>I love Bare Escentuals</li>
            <li>I wear and have been wearing most Bare Escentuals products for years.</li>
            <li>It appears to me that it was taken from one of the sampler packages of bare minerals, and if that is the case then I might have been getting more for my money</li>
            <li>Lol no really paint on an old barn</li>
            <li>It not only &#x27;sets&#x27; your makeup but gives you an oil free smooth look...</li>
            <li>It is not the full-size that I thought it was, but for $10.00 (half the amount of a full-size jar) it is a good buy.  </li>
            <li>Very much the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced and arrived timely.  </li>
            <li>I think the price was still very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Good product a little bit lighter than I had hoped for&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I&#x27;m looking for shopping on Amazon</li>
            <li>came in really fast!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use this product at first, but when I decided to add it to my morning make up routine, I noticed an immediate difference.</li>
            <li>Please be more specific with your listings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pride better than in the local store carrying these products.</li>
            <li>and I most likely got it on time</li>
            <li>I really hope they keep making it years from now!</li>
            <li>should have used this product when it first came out</li>
            <li>It is really small container to keep the powder in , but I love the size any way because I just need to try it , love how it feels on the skin after the primer its enlighten the make up</li>
            <li>I cant say enough good things about bare escentuals mineral veil.</li>
            <li>The big deal is it&#x27;s safe for your skin, but it also delivers.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clog pores, but the matte version is not as natural looking as the original version .</li>
            <li>I use this with the bare minerals foundation brush and it goes on so smooth and effortlessly.</li>
            <li>This is the higher price minerals at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>A must for the Bare Mineral user -- it smooth out the foundation and blush.  </li>
            <li>I love the coverage and it stays put all day long.</li>
            <li>That said, I found it effective as a colored finishing powder in ONE area of my face - I have a dark spot on my cheek</li>
            <li>Good as usual.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect finishing tough to bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>shiny6 shimmery effect, just a smooth finish to create the final look that is ready for a picture or portrait.</li>
            <li>I have most all the Bare Escentuals and Bare Minerals products.</li>
            <li>so it works really well for oily skin and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause break outs.</li>
            <li>covers beautifully, is very lightweight and would recommend to anyone who want a finishing touch to their makeup.</li>
            <li>really shows where you place it, unless you follow it with a blush, as I do.</li>
            <li>I dont notice much of glow from it</li>
            <li>I really like this powder.  </li>
            <li>The trick to applying powder foundations is to move the brush is a circular motion and really rub it in.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This product was so much cheaper than in stores or on the company website.</li>
            <li>Cheap price because tiny amount</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>had I purchased the whole package</li>
            <li>It kind of felt like cornstarch on my skin and got cakey after a few hours.</li>
            <li>The seller should make the smaller size more clear to the consumer.</li>
            <li>The price was good, but you barely get anything, and it will only last you MAYBE a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>just seals in a nice glow....and even&#x27;s out a few dark spots I have from my love for sunshine</li>
            <li>I love bare minerals,  just the right enough and light enough to just even out your skin tone to look days younger.</li>
            <li>It keeps the shine down for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Remember less is more with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I believe the main ingredient is corn starch</li>
            <li>Have used this for years but have paid at least 3 times this price great product especially the price</li>
            <li>Although this comes in the older style container.</li>
            <li>I bought the same kind that I bought in a department store and the colors didnt match..be careful...</li>
            <li>Now that they&#x27;ve changed the formula, however, I&#x27;ve discovered a much better powder, Urban Decay Naked.  </li>
            <li>&amp; in the winter when I am more pale.</li>
            <li>The product came as described and was brand new and never opened.</li>
            <li>it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I cheated and went to their counter, found my correct colors and then was able to get this thru Amazon and saved a few $$!</li>
            <li>and this is the FIRST product in my 30+ years of wearing makeup that actually truly irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>these are the smaller travel size - which I was aware of when I ordered...</li>
            <li>and then use the small concealer brush to tap this gently over it and it works fine for that .</li>
            <li>Bare Mineral&#x27;s!!!!  </li>
            <li>You can make your own bare minerals products with common powders from your health food store, like cocoa powder, arrowroot powder, and ginger.</li>
            <li>Product shipped quickly and does everything I expected it to.</li>
            <li>It feels natural but covers and looks so natural!  </li>
            <li>although I wasn&#x27;t clear on the size of the product.</li>
            <li>All of their products look so natural</li>
            <li>and I received it two days early.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t clog pores and looks natural if you don&#x27;t place it on directly after you have moisturized your face.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have a heavy hand in brushing this on....just lightly.  </li>
            <li>As the old saying goes, &amp;#34;Try</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and can also finish a foundation.</li>
            <li>People who do not use Mineral Veil, should really try in ---it gives your skin an air brushed effect (that&#x27;s what my friends tell me anyway)</li>
            <li>Its not heavy like some makeup.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really want bare minerals in warmth color for blush, Is it still possible to get it and where.</li>
            <li>It doesnt take much of this makeup to cover so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>a gain Bare Escentuals!  </li>
            <li>In the past I tried some &amp;#34;wannabees&amp;#34; but there is nothing that can compare with the original.  </li>
            <li>Bare escentuals origninal mineral Veil two gram product was as advertised!  </li>
            <li>Have used Bare Escentuals for years.</li>
            <li>Thought I was buying Bare Minerals....can&#x27;t close it under the co ER so lose tons of it</li>
            <li>I had been hearing about bare minerals for years, and I figured I might as well try it.</li>
            <li>A Must-Have item if you use Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>People say that Bare Mineral&#x27;s is for kids--pooy--</li>
            <li>I chose to review the Bare Escentual&#x27;s \\&quot;Mineral</li>
            <li>so Bare Escentuals is a bargain.</li>
            <li>What I wasn&#x27;t aware if was this product was half the size  </li>
            <li>Although you have to be careful and not be heavy handed or put too much product or it can be very yellowish!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back as long as the shipping isnt as high as it</li>
            <li>Exactly the same thing that you would purchase from Sephora but half the price.</li>
            <li>After reading about the Bare Escentuals line, I finally gave in.</li>
            <li>Product was brand new, in the box and even arrived earlier than expected!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of makeup before and this is by far the best one!!</li>
            <li> This is so far the best thing in make-up that happened to me.  </li>
            <li> Really good and original product.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it makes my skin look young and flawless.</li>
            <li> VEil is a must with bare minerals, it finishes the makeup and makes it stay in place for a flawless finish</li>
            <li> best results way is to start with the bare escentuals and finish with bare&lt;br /&gt;escentuals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very light</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really impressed, brand name Bare Minerals is much better.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I feel confident again.  </li>
            <li> I love mineral Veil.</li>
            <li> I love this line.</li>
            <li> always looks better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This goes on top of the foundation (powder) as a finishing veil.</li>
            <li> Why do I have to add 19 more words if I already raved about the product?</li>
            <li> And now you want 3 more words??</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> If you have clear skin, like me though, it is perfect for a light cover to ad a matte finish.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love that the minerals are so lightweight that you forget you are wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products when it comes to cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Love the Veil.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite BE products, so I ordered three.  </li>
            <li> Oh well though, that was probably my fault. :)</li>
            <li> I love how it soften the look.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite make up product out there.</li>
            <li> love all their products</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> I love this my friend told me about it</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t ask for much better.</li>
            <li> Perfect to cover up red spots or even out brown spots.  </li>
            <li> The Bare Escentuals Original Mineral Veil is one of the best finishing products for your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more finely milled and doesn&#x27;t contain talc, which I am allergic to.  </li>
            <li> The mineral veil gives my makeup a beautiful, silky smooth finish that&#x27;s soft to touch, and my face never gets shiny anymore since using it.</li>
            <li> Probably best of all, Bare Escentuals stays on and fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found cheaper knock-offs, but the real BE product really is superior.</li>
            <li> I love how fresh this makes me feel!</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t read the fine print and didn&#x27;t realize that I was not buying the full-sized item.  </li>
            <li> Nice addition to my original order, thanks!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so light and does not sit in your fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Bare Minerals is an amazing line of products!</li>
            <li> My item arrived fast, was packaged nicely, and saved me a ton of money.</li>
            <li> the company which I bought the product from was absolutely amazing and shipped my product in a very timely manner</li>
            <li> The color is too light.</li>
            <li> so if I use this I like a really light liquid foundation underneath</li>
            <li> It sounded like something important.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky smooth</li>
            <li> crease free.</li>
            <li> Mineral Veil adds a light &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; to my make up and helps to keep it on all day.</li>
            <li> I would say that it is light and covers</li>
            <li> This product is solid, follow the instructions - it always does a great job.</li>
            <li> It is light like your not wearing anything.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it honestly didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
            <li> It covered up the look of pores and gives a smooth all over feeling</li>
            <li> Great last minute add-to for adding a glow to your face.  </li>
            <li> , Overall, I di not spend a fortune so for the price I will be happy.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the Bare Minerals products...</li>
            <li> old woman.......figured powder would collect in creases &amp; just make me look older, but surprisingly, this has not been the case!</li>
            <li> Have used their essentials in the past, very happy with the price will purchase here again.</li>
            <li> wonderful product for all you bare essential wearers.</li>
            <li> I like it because it kind of evens my skin color out, but if my face is clear</li>
            <li> but this mineral veil gives a nice, natural finishing touch to my skin.</li>
            <li> I rarely need to touch up my foundation when I add this light layer at the end.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this again but not because the product isn&#x27;t good only because it didn&#x27;t help with the shine.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> The inert ingredients are naturally good for the human face.</li>
            <li> Mineral Veil is the finishing product and leaves everything soft &amp;amp; brings all together nicely.</li>
            <li> I am actually not even sure the product I got was mineral veil because when I tried out my friend&#x27;s I remembered liking it more.  </li>
            <li> this particular product &amp;#34;veil&amp;#34; is the one I like and use the most.</li>
            <li> However, I must wear a powder sunblock over it for adequate protection.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil is amazing.</li>
            <li> Mineral Veil is so light that in hot weather you don&#x27;t feel it or sweat.</li>
            <li> It looks good all day long</li>
            <li> It cuts down on the shine I get and also acts great as a finishing powder.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals has never caused me to break out and is great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Mineral makeup and no one does it better than Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing this mineral veil because it hides large pores and blends well over the mineral powder.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing how you can see the transformation instantly.  </li>
            <li> I will still continue to use the blush, because it&#x27;s the most natural flush out there.  </li>
            <li> It sets makeup so well that I rarely have to reapply.</li>
            <li> It keeps my makeup looking fresh all day</li>
            <li> It was just as describe and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> You can see them all on Amazon and take your time choosing just the right color combinations etc  without a salesperson standing in front of  you.</li>
            <li> Same great bare escentuals</li>
            <li> I may be old and fat but my skin looks marvelous thanks to Bare Escentuals Bare Minerals products.  </li>
            <li> Everything thing they claim is absolute true.  </li>
            <li> I love this Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil.  </li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals is not the answer to better makeup or skincare.  </li>
            <li> Although I am greatly satisfied with the product, I wish I would have seen more clearly that it is only 2g!</li>
            <li> I love Bare Escentuals</li>
            <li> I wear and have been wearing most Bare Escentuals products for years.</li>
            <li> It appears to me that it was taken from one of the sampler packages of bare minerals, and if that is the case then I might have been getting more for my money</li>
            <li> Lol no really paint on an old barn</li>
            <li> It not only &#x27;sets&#x27; your makeup but gives you an oil free smooth look...</li>
            <li> It is not the full-size that I thought it was, but for $10.00 (half the amount of a full-size jar) it is a good buy.  </li>
            <li> Very much the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced and arrived timely.  </li>
            <li> I think the price was still very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Good product a little bit lighter than I had hoped for&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x27;m looking for shopping on Amazon</li>
            <li> came in really fast!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product at first, but when I decided to add it to my morning make up routine, I noticed an immediate difference.</li>
            <li> Please be more specific with your listings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pride better than in the local store carrying these products.</li>
            <li> and I most likely got it on time</li>
            <li> I really hope they keep making it years from now!</li>
            <li> should have used this product when it first came out</li>
            <li> It is really small container to keep the powder in , but I love the size any way because I just need to try it , love how it feels on the skin after the primer its enlighten the make up</li>
            <li> I cant say enough good things about bare escentuals mineral veil.</li>
            <li> The big deal is it&#x27;s safe for your skin, but it also delivers.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog pores, but the matte version is not as natural looking as the original version .</li>
            <li> I use this with the bare minerals foundation brush and it goes on so smooth and effortlessly.</li>
            <li> This is the higher price minerals at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> A must for the Bare Mineral user -- it smooth out the foundation and blush.  </li>
            <li> I love the coverage and it stays put all day long.</li>
            <li> That said, I found it effective as a colored finishing powder in ONE area of my face - I have a dark spot on my cheek</li>
            <li> Good as usual.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect finishing tough to bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> shiny6 shimmery effect, just a smooth finish to create the final look that is ready for a picture or portrait.</li>
            <li> I have most all the Bare Escentuals and Bare Minerals products.</li>
            <li> so it works really well for oily skin and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause break outs.</li>
            <li> covers beautifully, is very lightweight and would recommend to anyone who want a finishing touch to their makeup.</li>
            <li> really shows where you place it, unless you follow it with a blush, as I do.</li>
            <li> I dont notice much of glow from it</li>
            <li> I really like this powder.  </li>
            <li> The trick to applying powder foundations is to move the brush is a circular motion and really rub it in.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This product was so much cheaper than in stores or on the company website.</li>
            <li> Cheap price because tiny amount</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> had I purchased the whole package</li>
            <li> It kind of felt like cornstarch on my skin and got cakey after a few hours.</li>
            <li> The seller should make the smaller size more clear to the consumer.</li>
            <li> The price was good, but you barely get anything, and it will only last you MAYBE a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> just seals in a nice glow....and even&#x27;s out a few dark spots I have from my love for sunshine</li>
            <li> I love bare minerals,  just the right enough and light enough to just even out your skin tone to look days younger.</li>
            <li> It keeps the shine down for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Remember less is more with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I believe the main ingredient is corn starch</li>
            <li> Have used this for years but have paid at least 3 times this price great product especially the price</li>
            <li> Although this comes in the older style container.</li>
            <li> I bought the same kind that I bought in a department store and the colors didnt match..be careful...</li>
            <li> Now that they&#x27;ve changed the formula, however, I&#x27;ve discovered a much better powder, Urban Decay Naked.  </li>
            <li> &amp; in the winter when I am more pale.</li>
            <li> The product came as described and was brand new and never opened.</li>
            <li> it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I cheated and went to their counter, found my correct colors and then was able to get this thru Amazon and saved a few $$!</li>
            <li> and this is the FIRST product in my 30+ years of wearing makeup that actually truly irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> these are the smaller travel size - which I was aware of when I ordered...</li>
            <li> and then use the small concealer brush to tap this gently over it and it works fine for that .</li>
            <li> Bare Mineral&#x27;s!!!!  </li>
            <li> You can make your own bare minerals products with common powders from your health food store, like cocoa powder, arrowroot powder, and ginger.</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly and does everything I expected it to.</li>
            <li> It feels natural but covers and looks so natural!  </li>
            <li> although I wasn&#x27;t clear on the size of the product.</li>
            <li> All of their products look so natural</li>
            <li> and I received it two days early.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t clog pores and looks natural if you don&#x27;t place it on directly after you have moisturized your face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have a heavy hand in brushing this on....just lightly.  </li>
            <li> As the old saying goes, &amp;#34;Try</li>
            <li> It is not heavy and can also finish a foundation.</li>
            <li> People who do not use Mineral Veil, should really try in ---it gives your skin an air brushed effect (that&#x27;s what my friends tell me anyway)</li>
            <li> Its not heavy like some makeup.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really want bare minerals in warmth color for blush, Is it still possible to get it and where.</li>
            <li> It doesnt take much of this makeup to cover so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> a gain Bare Escentuals!  </li>
            <li> In the past I tried some &amp;#34;wannabees&amp;#34; but there is nothing that can compare with the original.  </li>
            <li> Bare escentuals origninal mineral Veil two gram product was as advertised!  </li>
            <li> Have used Bare Escentuals for years.</li>
            <li> Thought I was buying Bare Minerals....can&#x27;t close it under the co ER so lose tons of it</li>
            <li> I had been hearing about bare minerals for years, and I figured I might as well try it.</li>
            <li> A Must-Have item if you use Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li> People say that Bare Mineral&#x27;s is for kids--pooy--</li>
            <li> I chose to review the Bare Escentual&#x27;s \\&quot;Mineral</li>
            <li> so Bare Escentuals is a bargain.</li>
            <li> What I wasn&#x27;t aware if was this product was half the size  </li>
            <li> Although you have to be careful and not be heavy handed or put too much product or it can be very yellowish!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back as long as the shipping isnt as high as it</li>
            <li> Exactly the same thing that you would purchase from Sephora but half the price.</li>
            <li> After reading about the Bare Escentuals line, I finally gave in.</li>
            <li> Product was brand new, in the box and even arrived earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I would not have paid this much for only the small size of mineral veil.</li>
            <li> the product itself can make face look a little dry if dry already so if your face has winter dry skin,  i wouldn&#x27;t recommend, but if not it does put a finishing tough on that I love!</li>
            <li> They do make a compact with solid veil powder, but I prefer the loose powder.</li>
            <li> guess I didn&#x27;t read careful enough.</li>
            <li> Ive tried other makeup that made me look yellow.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to be a red head, or pale blonde to pull it off!</li>
            <li> However I was surprised just how small the product was.</li>
            <li> As a rule, I use their other facial products as well; a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re short on time, just put on a little &#x27;Mineral</li>
            <li> The shipping was a lot quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> Careful not to get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I cannot belive I paid the amount I did for 2g when I get 8g for the same price or less!</li>
            <li> When I went to purchase this again, I saw that it is now very pink, too pink for my skin.  </li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the rage, but also did some research about the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Note that this is a small container and not the standard size.</li>
            <li> Ive tried other mineral makeups but this matches my skin color</li>
            <li> Other makeups have made my face feel greasy and this does not do that either.</li>
            <li> I have even used this with other products..</li>
            <li> Veil\\&quot; because it is a product you can apply without any other makeup and feel like you are presentable.</li>
            <li> The two active ingredients are known to be carcinogens which cause skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> loose minerals tend to be a bit messy</li>
            <li> During the summer months, I tend to incorporate this product less into my routine.</li>
            <li> I just put a little primer on my face then put the powder on</li>
            <li> (and sometimes a little concealer-in the winter)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like heavy makeup</li>
            <li> Not cakey or heavy on your face.</li>
            <li> Received within just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I order from bare minerals before and they are too expensive</li>
            <li> My skin loses a tired look, the pores do disappear and that makes me look younger.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if that was my error in not realizing it before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Small but lasted me a while as i dont wear alot makeup anymore</li>
            <li> SMALL USE -</li>
            <li> Like I order things from the past</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to use it</li>
            <li> Not sure it was a savings though.</li>
            <li> It was small than I thought...</li>
            <li> this did not compare to the mineral veil I had purchased in the past</li>
            <li> but the container is very small which makes it somewhat difficult to use with the larger brush.</li>
            <li> At least I can use it up now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe a day or two late</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small this was going to be!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, I was a convert to at least Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil and blush.  </li>
            <li> However, I only give 4 stars because of the size confusion :(</li>
            <li> but this shipment was like a week late!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very difficult to cover, due to its difference in texture.  </li>
            <li> I apply just a thin coat on my face before I leave for work</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description carefully before I purchased and I was sad :(</li>
            <li> I feel so dumb because it was my fault and was so mad when I saw how little it was! :-(</li>
            <li> got the wrong product</li>
            <li> Was initially skeptical about a powder type product for a 52yr.</li>
            <li> OVER moisturizer, and before I get out of the driveway my face is itching like mad.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I received this product.</li>
            <li> and they immediately wanted to sell me ANOTHER product to wear as a &#x27;base&#x27; or something. . .</li>
            <li> It was annoying to me..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>

            <li> Great coverage, easy to apply, love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> Thought I was buying Bare Minerals....can&#x27;t close it under the co ER so lose tons of it</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I have rosacea and sometimes the redness shows through my foundation.  When I apply this over my foundation...Awesome.  I feel confident again.  Thank once a gain Bare Escentuals!  You Rock.</li>
            <li> I just put a little primer on my face then put the powder on and it gives me a flawless look and natural not cakey, I have Rosacea, so I can&#x27;t put a lot of stuff on my face, this works just Fine !!</li>
            <li> I received this item in a timely fashion and it is the same product I have bought at Sephora. What I wasn&#x27;t aware if was this product was half the size  and I&#x27;m not sure if that was my error in not realizing it before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I believe the main ingredient is corn starch so it works really well for oily skin and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause break outs.</li>
            <li> My item arrived fast, was packaged nicely, and saved me a ton of money. Exactly what I&#x27;m looking for shopping on Amazon</li>
            <li> I use this product as the final step of my routine.It gives my skin a flawless airbrushed appearance.During the summer months, I tend to incorporate this product less into my routine.It makes my face look to shiny!</li>
            <li> Small but lasted me a while as i dont wear alot makeup anymore</li>
            <li> The Bare Escentuals Original Mineral Veil is one of the best finishing products for your skin.  I haven&#x27;t found anything else else that works quite like it.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same thing that you would purchase from Sephora but half the price. I love mineral Veil. Even if I&#x27;m not wearing makeup, it&#x27;s great to just toss on before heading out.</li>
            <li> My skin looks like it glows! After reading about the Bare Escentuals line, I finally gave in. I love this line. All of their products look so natural so I don&#x27;t feel like I am coating my face with makeup. I love how fresh this makes me feel! And a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I like it because it kind of evens my skin color out, but if my face is clear you can&#x27;t even tell I put it on...</li>
            <li> Have used this for years but have paid at least 3 times this price great product especially the price</li>
            <li> Great condition and quality.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it all the time</li>
            <li> the company which I bought the product from was absolutely amazing and shipped my product in a very timely manner and I received it two days early. now on to the product! the mineral veil gives my skin a finishing look that takes care of any of my oily spots. it doesn&#x27;t give your face that cheep glittery effect either. I will be adding this product to my daily makeup with out any doubts</li>
            <li> loved it! came in really fast! no complaints! works great! goes on light ! not cakey looking ! great makeup and service!</li>
            <li> I love bare minerals,  just the right enough and light enough to just even out your skin tone to look days younger. Lol no really paint on an old barn always looks better. Love it.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best. doesn&#x27;t clog pores and looks natural if you don&#x27;t place it on directly after you have moisturized your face.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals is an amazing line of products! Good for your skin too but iit can be pricey! I cheated and went to their counter, found my correct colors and then was able to get this thru Amazon and saved a few $$! Product was brand new, in the box and even arrived earlier than expected! Bonus all the way around!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really impressed, brand name Bare Minerals is much better.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve used it for over 10vyears.</li>
            <li> i use this daily. covers beautifully, is very lightweight and would recommend to anyone who want a finishing touch to their makeup.</li>
            <li> I like this but the container is very small which makes it somewhat difficult to use with the larger brush.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the Bare Minerals products...couldn&#x27;t be easier to use and flawless beauty!  Wouldn&#x27;t change my makeup routine for the world!</li>
            <li> The color is too light.</li>
            <li> still playing with it with different foundations. I don&#x27;t like heavy makeup so if I use this I like a really light liquid foundation underneath and it works well. Leaves a nice dewey finish.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I use it before and after I apply a powder foundation. It helps the foundation stay on longer and also helps to minimalize my pores. It cuts down on the shine I get and also acts great as a finishing powder.</li>
            <li> This goes on top of the foundation (powder) as a finishing veil. Works great and you can re-apply throughout day if desired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I don&#x27;t like foundation makeup but this mineral veil gives a nice, natural finishing touch to my skin. I use it every day and it stays on until I take it off. It also stays on when I&#x27;m at the gym sweating or going into steam rooms.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff because it provides that evening effect without having to worry about color matching. She is very happy with the results, and I like that it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try mineral veil for a while because I have friends who rave about it.  I will not be one of those people.  I ordered the product for a great price so I am not too disapointed that it did not work out for me.  I am actually not even sure the product I got was mineral veil because when I tried out my friend&#x27;s I remembered liking it more.  The product I got was in mineral veil packaging but it did not even out or \\&quot;veil\\&quot; anything, absorb oil, or any of the othe claims of this product.  It kind of felt like cornstarch on my skin and got cakey after a few hours.</li>
            <li> ITCHY! - They claim all this purity stuff. and this is the FIRST product in my 30+ years of wearing makeup that actually truly irritated my skin.  I can put it on. OVER moisturizer, and before I get out of the driveway my face is itching like mad.  What gives??&lt;br /&gt;MULTIPLE? - I mentioned the itch at the store where I bought it and they immediately wanted to sell me ANOTHER product to wear as a &#x27;base&#x27; or something. . . I don&#x27;t need to get into buying multiple products where one should be sufficient!&lt;br /&gt;ONE SMALL USE - That said, I found it effective as a colored finishing powder in ONE area of my face - I have a dark spot on my cheek that&#x27;s very difficult to cover, due to its difference in texture.  I forget what it&#x27;s called. . .anyhow . I can use a creamy concealer on it. and then use the small concealer brush to tap this gently over it and it works fine for that . without itch.  At least I can use it up now.&lt;br /&gt;SHINE - I dislike the pearly gleam in it. .it really shows where you place it, unless you follow it with a blush, as I do.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it makes my skin look young and flawless. Mineral veil is especially good at setting my makeup for the whole day. Their new pressed foundation is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Although this comes in the older style container. (no way to close the holes) it is still very good makeup and I am very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> I bought the same kind that I bought in a department store and the colors didnt match..be careful...wont buy this stuff over the internet</li>
            <li> Awesome. Why do I have to add 19 more words if I already raved about the product? And now you want 3 more words??</li>
            <li> I bought his product because I liked the advertising on the page. It sounded like something important. But you don&#x27;t need this! You can make your own bare minerals products with common powders from your health food store, like cocoa powder, arrowroot powder, and ginger. Adding Mica will get that shimmer. You&#x27;ll save a lot.</li>
            <li> I only use it to seal liquid make up. I dont notice much of glow from it but i guess thats a good thing.very light and breathes well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found cheaper knock-offs, but the real BE product really is superior. It&#x27;s silky smooth and I have acne-prone skin and it doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Leaves your skin looking velvety without looking like pancake makeup. Very nice stuff! They do make a compact with solid veil powder, but I prefer the loose powder.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to powder! It not only &#x27;sets&#x27; your makeup but gives you an oil free smooth look...crease free.</li>
            <li> I really like this powder.  Don&#x27;t have a heavy hand in brushing this on....just lightly.  It gives me a great matte look.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since their debut and I wouldn&#x27;t consider using anything else.  In the past I tried some &amp;#34;wannabees&amp;#34; but there is nothing that can compare with the original.  Everything thing they claim is absolute true.  I may be old and fat but my skin looks marvelous thanks to Bare Escentuals Bare Minerals products.  As the old saying goes, &amp;#34;Try it...You&#x27;ll like it&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin than this is for you. It keeps the shine down for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product at first, but when I decided to add it to my morning make up routine, I noticed an immediate difference. Mineral Veil adds a light &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; to my make up and helps to keep it on all day. I rarely need to touch up my foundation when I add this light layer at the end.</li>
            <li> I would not have paid this much for only the small size of mineral veil. I was under the impression that it was the larger container. Please be more specific with your listings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product and works well. However, I only give 4 stars because of the size confusion :(</li>
            <li> Very lightly colored! You&#x27;d have to be a red head, or pale blonde to pull it off!</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil is amazing. It is the perfect finishing tough to bare minerals foundation. I use this with the bare minerals foundation brush and it goes on so smooth and effortlessly. The trick to applying powder foundations is to move the brush is a circular motion and really rub it in. Bare Escentuals has never caused me to break out and is great on my sensitive skin. I will use a liquid foundation on any spots and then apply the powder foundation then mineral veil. It feels light and makes my face look flawless.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Good product a little bit lighter than I had hoped for&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again in a bit darker color.</li>
            <li> I used this for years and I have some left in a travel size.  When I went to purchase this again, I saw that it is now very pink, too pink for my skin.  I guess they&#x27;ve changed the formula.  It&#x27;s too bad, I was a convert to at least Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil and blush.  The foundation doesn&#x27;t come in a tone suited to my skin.  Now that they&#x27;ve changed the formula, however, I&#x27;ve discovered a much better powder, Urban Decay Naked.  It&#x27;s more finely milled and doesn&#x27;t contain talc, which I am allergic to.  I will still continue to use the blush, because it&#x27;s the most natural flush out there.  The colors are superb.  Naked also comes in a much larger container but is about the same price ounce for ounce.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to reduce shine and to use as a foundation base. This stuff is the best, I&#x27;ve used it for many years and will continue.</li>
            <li> I got this to help reduce the shine on my face however it didn&#x27;t work, but it could be hormonal.  I would not buy this again but not because the product isn&#x27;t good only because it didn&#x27;t help with the shine.  I would say that it is light and covers well you can&#x27;t tell that you have it on.</li>
            <li> Always like this product.  It always works well over foundation. I&#x27;ve also put it over the warmth color and blush.</li>
            <li> I love this Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil.  I would recommend this to anyone applying make up....this particular product &amp;#34;veil&amp;#34; is the one I like and use the most.</li>
            <li> This product should be removed from Amazon or repriced.  2 grams is like a sample size...yes, I realize I should know this but I didn&#x27;t read the fine print and didn&#x27;t realize that I was not buying the full-sized item.  I think this seller is scamming buyers.</li>
            <li> I love this. I had been hearing about bare minerals for years, and I figured I might as well try it. The mineral veil gives my makeup a beautiful, silky smooth finish that&#x27;s soft to touch, and my face never gets shiny anymore since using it. Great product!!</li>
            <li> This product is solid, follow the instructions - it always does a great job. And yes, it has good coverage!</li>
            <li> I only gave this one three stars as the use is for some skin types. If you have clear skin, like me though, it is perfect for a light cover to ad a matte finish.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I received this product. I was under the impression this container was much larger than it was. The seller should make the smaller size more clear to the consumer.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very much the icing on the cake. Remember less is more with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Nice addition to my original order, thanks!</li>
            <li> I will be a life long customer of Bare Escentuals products. My skin loves me for it, I haven&#x27;t found a product I don&#x27;t like yet.</li>
            <li> Mineral Veil is the best finishing powder... I&#x27;ve used it for years and LOVE it!  It sets makeup so well that I rarely have to reapply.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Not cakey or heavy on your face.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Mineral makeup and no one does it better than Bare Escentuals. It is easy to apply and looks great on! I love that the minerals are so lightweight that you forget you are wearing makeup. It looks good all day long and I never have to reapply.</li>
            <li> A Must-Have item if you use Bare Escentuals. It evens your complexion and feels like silk!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have incredibly oily skin and this works all day to help keep the shine away.</li>
            <li> It works just as it says. I use BE all the time, I just needed to restock, but this is a must if you arent using it! It smells great.</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing this mineral veil because it hides large pores and blends well over the mineral powder. It&#x27;s also very light and you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing anything extra. However, I must wear a powder sunblock over it for adequate protection.</li>
            <li> I really want bare minerals in warmth color for blush, Is it still possible to get it and where. thank you betty</li>
            <li> Bare escentuals origninal mineral Veil two gram product was as advertised!  pride better than in the local store carrying these products.</li>
            <li> Very good price, and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products when it comes to cosmetics. The veil smooths the skin creating a luminous glow. It is not heavy and can also finish a foundation. Love the Veil.</li>
            <li> I love the veil mineral! I order from bare minerals before and they are too expensive but when I saw this on amazon, I had to get it. Plus I was running out of this product anyways. I use this to set my cc cream and it makes my face feels like I&#x27;m not wearing make up! but the thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the shipment didn&#x27;t arrive on time like it said it would. Like I order things from the past and I most likely got it on time maybe a day or two late but this shipment was like a week late! I wasn&#x27;t happy that I had to contact the seller because ups didn&#x27;t send me my order. It was annoying to me.. But over all, this is a good product</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the rage, but also did some research about the ingredients.  The two active ingredients are known to be carcinogens which cause skin cancer.  In addition, the inactive ingredients cause folks to break out in an itchy rash.  Going back!  Bare Escentuals is not the answer to better makeup or skincare.  Spoiler alert!</li>
            <li> what can I say....love, love the mineral veil!  I really hope they keep making it years from now!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the higher price minerals at a reasonable price. Good size for travel. I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> A must for the Bare Mineral user -- it smooth out the foundation and blush.  Good product.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product (foundation, eye shadows etc. etc.) for almost 16 years and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I love the coverage and it stays put all day long.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price was great.  Received within just a few days.  Great product. . .great service.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of makeup before and this is by far the best one!! What a great find at a great price. Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> VEil is a must with bare minerals, it finishes the makeup and makes it stay in place for a flawless finish</li>
            <li> excellent product line get compliments all the time and I am 62 should have used this product when it first came out</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. Great product.</li>
            <li> It is really small container to keep the powder in , but I love the size any way because I just need to try it , love how it feels on the skin after the primer its enlighten the make up</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite BE products, so I ordered three.  Very reasonably priced and arrived timely.  Keep in mind these are the smaller travel size - which I was aware of when I ordered... I think the price was still very reasonable.</li>
            <li> it gives my skin a muddy tone</li>
            <li> People who do not use Mineral Veil, should really try in ---it gives your skin an air brushed effect (that&#x27;s what my friends tell me anyway)</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to use it I think it was a waist I thought it would be bigger that is about all I have to say.</li>
            <li> This product was so much cheaper than in stores or on the company website. Same great bare escentuals but with a lower price. I was able to afford to buy it and still save money!</li>
            <li> The shipping was a lot quicker than expected. The product came as described and was brand new and never opened. Although I am greatly satisfied with the product, I wish I would have seen more clearly that it is only 2g! Oh well though, that was probably my fault. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back as long as the shipping isnt as high as it was.great product though,I love it! thank you</li>
            <li> Note that this is a small container and not the standard size. I didn&#x27;t read the description carefully before I purchased and I was sad :(</li>
            <li> I use it over my makeup. I love how it soften the look.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup!  It is light like your not wearing anything.  Its not heavy like some makeup.  It feels natural but covers and looks so natural!  I swear by it!!  Ive tried other mineral makeups but this matches my skin color well.  Ive tried other makeup that made me look yellow.  This does not do that.  Other makeups have made my face feel greasy and this does not do that either. It doesnt take much of this makeup to cover so it lasts a long time. I cant say enough good things about bare escentuals mineral veil.</li>
            <li> It was just as describe and super fast shipping! the product itself can make face look a little dry if dry already so if your face has winter dry skin,  i wouldn&#x27;t recommend, but if not it does put a finishing tough on that I love!</li>
            <li> Cheap price because tiny amount</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog pores, but the matte version is not as natural looking as the original version .</li>
            <li> Was a gift. Not sure it was a savings though. Will consider again later.  She likes the product. Nothing else</li>
            <li> Personally, I can&#x27;t stand putting sunscreen on my face.  Everything about it grosses me out - the goopy texture, the smell, etc.  So I use mineral veil instead.  I dust some on my face and chest every day and get the SPF 25 protection.  It&#x27;s invisible so I can even use it on my husband and it works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It keeps my makeup looking fresh all day long.&lt;br /&gt;I pair it with the Bareskin foundation.</li>
            <li> Good as usual. I have been using this for almost a year!</li>
            <li> I love Bare Escentuals so it was a &amp;#34;no-brainer&amp;#34; purchase...although I wasn&#x27;t clear on the size of the product. It was small than I thought...guess I didn&#x27;t read careful enough.</li>
            <li> got the wrong product</li>
            <li> This is a no brainer gift to my wife.  She loves this brand and says it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s used. The inert ingredients are naturally good for the human face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small this was going to be! The price was good, but you barely get anything, and it will only last you MAYBE a couple weeks. Plus, it honestly didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this is the only brand I can use without breaking out in hives!  I would recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite make up product out there. It acts as the perfect finisher to all my foundation and blush. It covered up the look of pores and gives a smooth all over feeling</li>
            <li> I cannot belive I paid the amount I did for 2g when I get 8g for the same price or less! I feel so dumb because it was my fault and was so mad when I saw how little it was! :-(</li>
            <li> love all their products</li>
            <li> the best mineral veil..not the one with that shiny6 shimmery effect, just a smooth finish to create the final look that is ready for a picture or portrait. seller excellent review by me delivered as said</li>
            <li> Love this it was cheap and works great. Would recommended this site and this product to any one that uses make up...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Stays on,feels great! Great product! Recommend for flawless finish! A+++++++. Been using this four 7 years!  Tell your friends</li>
            <li> great product have ordered more than once.</li>
            <li> Great last minute add-to for adding a glow to your face.  People say that Bare Mineral&#x27;s is for kids--pooy--I say----I am 55 and that is all that I use over tons of moisturizer! (and sometimes a little concealer-in the winter)  This is not sparkly---thank goodness---just seals in a nice glow....and even&#x27;s out a few dark spots I have from my love for sunshine :-0  Thanks Bare Mineral&#x27;s!!!!  I can wear this when I have a bit of sun-&amp; in the winter when I am more pale. Great Deal.  Thank you once again Amazon--You guys rock:-0</li>
            <li> The best finishing product...I have even used this with other products..&lt;br /&gt;the best results way is to start with the bare escentuals and finish with bare&lt;br /&gt;escentuals.</li>
            <li> Really good and original product.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and happy with purchase</li>
            <li> wonderful product for all you bare essential wearers. it&#x27;s a must and especially great for photography.</li>
            <li> I love this product...it&#x27;s so light and does not sit in your fine lines.  I use it with my airbrush makeup and it&#x27;s the perfect compliment to it.</li>
            <li> I wear and have been wearing most Bare Escentuals products for years. Mineral Veil is the finishing product and leaves everything soft &amp;amp; brings all together nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this my friend told me about it and I don&#x27;t leave the house with out it on my face! My makeup looks so much better!</li>
            <li> I have most all the Bare Escentuals and Bare Minerals products. You can see them all on Amazon and take your time choosing just the right color combinations etc  without a salesperson standing in front of  you. I don&#x27;t need  that pressure. I chose to review the Bare Escentual&#x27;s \\&quot;Mineral Veil\\&quot; because it is a product you can apply without any other makeup and feel like you are presentable. I have friends who have said the same thing. And if you&#x27;re short on time, just put on a little &#x27;Mineral Veil\\&quot; and it will make you feel good. As a rule, I use their other facial products as well; a little goes a long way so Bare Escentuals is a bargain. Mineral Veil is so light that in hot weather you don&#x27;t feel it or sweat. Probably best of all, Bare Escentuals stays on and fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t ask for much better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what came in the container but it&#x27;s not a B.E. product. It&#x27;s grittier than the knockoffs. It&#x27;s gross. Something is off.</li>
            <li> this did not compare to the mineral veil I had purchased in the past</li>
            <li> Good price, great product.</li>
            <li> loose minerals tend to be a bit messy but i like this product to battle shine and set foundation.</li>
            <li> Perfect finish to my foundation</li>
            <li> However I was surprised just how small the product was. It appears to me that it was taken from one of the sampler packages of bare minerals, and if that is the case then I might have been getting more for my money had I purchased the whole package , Overall, I di not spend a fortune so for the price I will be happy.</li>
            <li> I use this product on a daily basis.  It is not the full-size that I thought it was, but for $10.00 (half the amount of a full-size jar) it is a good buy.  It will last several months.</li>
            <li> Perfect to cover up red spots or even out brown spots.  Careful not to get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> This is so far the best thing in make-up that happened to me.  The big deal is it&#x27;s safe for your skin, but it also delivers. I apply just a thin coat on my face before I leave for work and it&#x27;s amazing how you can see the transformation instantly.  My skin loses a tired look, the pores do disappear and that makes me look younger.  I&#x27;ve just re-ordered in bigger size.</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly and does everything I expected it to. I&#x27;d run out of mineral veil and I feel like my makeup just doesn&#x27;t look as finished without it!</li>
            <li> Was initially skeptical about a powder type product for a 52yr. old woman.......figured powder would collect in creases &amp; just make me look older, but surprisingly, this has not been the case!</li>
            <li> Great undereye setting powder! Although you have to be careful and not be heavy handed or put too much product or it can be very yellowish! I would suggest a light sweeping and you&#x27;ll be good! I would repurchase I just think it&#x27;s an excellent product to have lying around!</li>
            <li> Love it! Great price and great product!</li>
            <li> Have used their essentials in the past, very happy with the price will purchase here again.</li>
