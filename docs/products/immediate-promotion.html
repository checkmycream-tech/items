            <li>The paint job on mine wasn&#x27;t perfect a bit sloppy, but it is small.</li>
            <li>I love this little statue of Monkey Riding Horse.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Anyone expecting anything else probably has their sights too high and should look for something that is actually expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> About three inches high by two wide.</li>
            <li> My sign is the monkey</li>
            <li> The Horse has a shiny gold finish and the monkey has a matte gold finish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Consequently, we do not get upset at minor flaws.  </li>
            <li> Thought it was going to be a little bigger, but its not.</li>
            <li> The monkey is not golden.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s rather small, smaller than I expected, but I prefer it this way.</li>
            <li> But this is not a fine piece of sculpture, its a little plastic figurine glued to a black wooden plate.</li>
            <li> It is less than 3 inches tall.</li>
            <li> it is not particularly accurate or neat, but also not so sloppy than you can tell from far away.</li>
            <li> I mean come on, a monkey riding a horse, who wouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> These symbols have never let me down!</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago, and I have not received a promotion yet.</li>
            <li> Its small can be kept on the study/work desk.</li>
            <li> Very small.</li>
            <li> It is gold and shiny, the monkey is painted, the base is wood and the detail is well done.  </li>
            <li> Not a wood base like another review stated, it is resin.</li>

            <li> It is a plastic resin toy,3&amp;#34; tall,  weighs 2 oz. The monkey is not golden. However, faith is more important than the object.  I&#x27;ll enjoy it on my mantle facing the front door and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it and keeps it mounted on her desk</li>
            <li> I hope it works it is very nice item and a welcome addition to my collection.</li>
            <li> Thought it was going to be a little bigger, but its not. Very small.</li>
            <li> I love this little statue of Monkey Riding Horse.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it brings me a better job which I need.</li>
            <li> My sign is the monkey and this is the year of the horse , it looks good on my mantel.&lt;br /&gt; people see it and  ask about  it all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for Feng Shui. And I thought it looks cool. I mean come on, a monkey riding a horse, who wouldn&#x27;t buy it. But I gotta say, it really impressed me how great it looks on my study table. I hope this item really work though, if not, it&#x27;s still a great piece to display. Delivered very fast too, within 3 days. Great service.</li>
            <li> Many opportunities arose after buying this. Coincidence? I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for!!!&lt;br /&gt;Ok it&#x27;s not metal, but the contrast between horse &amp; monkey (satin &amp; shiny) are good, nice detail!</li>
            <li> It does what it says. It works</li>
            <li> not work the money, looks like a tody</li>
            <li> Oh my this is such a lovely item. I wish they made one larger.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago, and I have not received a promotion yet. But then again, I am not in a position where a promotion is an option at the moment. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rather small, smaller than I expected, but I prefer it this way. It&#x27;s probably about two inches high. It is very cheap and the gold is kind of gaudy. The Horse has a shiny gold finish and the monkey has a matte gold finish. The horse has red stripes painted on the belts as you can see in the picture. you can tell someone just did a quick swipe with a paint brush. it is not particularly accurate or neat, but also not so sloppy than you can tell from far away. I can tell that over time the red paint will rub off. But this is not a fine piece of sculpture, its a little plastic figurine glued to a black wooden plate. Anyone expecting anything else probably has their sights too high and should look for something that is actually expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This figurine is a great addition to the back of a shelf in an office of a person secretly pining away for a raise or promotion trying to gain the nerve to ask for it. lol</li>
            <li> great product and quick delivery</li>
            <li> The paint job on mine wasn&#x27;t perfect a bit sloppy, but it is small. I really hope it will work though</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son so I didn&#x27;t see it in person but he said he was happy to have it on his desk.</li>
            <li> This item is rather light weight and shines for about 3 hours before the shine dulled.  Our family believes in the sentiment of this object.&lt;br /&gt;Consequently, we do not get upset at minor flaws.  The Promotion statue is definitely working.  I vacillate between the actual power of the object and wishing.  We have had this Immediate Promotion for a while.  Two days ago, a career was launched.  Now, it will sit in my daughters room before she takes her LSAT!&lt;br /&gt;Having lived in China, Thailand and the entire Pacific Rim, I watched indigenous people use these objects, I am a convert!  These symbols have never let me down!</li>
            <li> It is a great item to have. I like it.</li>
            <li> It is less than 3 inches tall. They did not give a measurement, just a weight (says 9 oz)--its actual weight is 2 oz. Not a wood base like another review stated, it is resin. The horse and monkey are cheap plastic. Not cost effective to return.</li>
            <li> Its small can be kept on the study/work desk.</li>
            <li> It is gold and shiny, the monkey is painted, the base is wood and the detail is well done.  Its a very nice looking piece.</li>
            <li> About three inches high by two wide. Very cute and interesting. I don&#x27;t know anyone who has this. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use it in a window it works !Great Feng Shui tool,every one should have them ,they are beautiful!A must !</li>
