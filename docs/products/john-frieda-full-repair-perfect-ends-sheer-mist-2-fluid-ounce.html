            <li> I have fine, silky soft hair and this is the only product that detangles my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair less dry and frizzy and makes it shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to use it when the hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I comb it from the middle of my hair down to the ends.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it repairs my hair, but it definitely makes the damage less noticeable.  </li>

            <li> After drying my hair it looked just as damaged and dry as it did previously.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin color treated hair that has gotten damaged from using a straight iron.  </li>
            <li> I like this because it is weight less.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the deep conditioner product.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and dried my hair as usual.  </li>

            <li> I use this product on my daughters hair. She has medium, very wavy hair. The trick is to use it when the hair is dry. In the morning, her hair is difficult to comb. I spray this stuff on and comb it through. Her hair is smooth with a nice wave. When it dries, it isn&#x27;t frizzy. I do recommend this product.</li>

It has not only helped the split ends but my overall hair health...&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002PBCABY L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStrong Sulfate-Free Fortify System Overnight Hair Repair Treatment, 3.4 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
