            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Found out about product in an over priced kiosk in the mall but looked it up on Amazon and love the cream and also the face peel.</li>
            <li>I love the cream itself.  </li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>I like this product better than many night creams I have used.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>The day cream is paraben free, and is amazing under makeup.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an excellent night cream (and since the day cream I bought &amp;#60;not a vivo product&amp;#62; hurt my skin, I used this during the day as well for the last 30 days...)</li>
            <li>Okay, product.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>The day cream, night cream and facial peel are great!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This has got to be one of the best facial lotions i have ever used.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better in the morning.</li>
            <li>I love that it is not a heavy,greasy cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I use most of the Vivo products.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizing night cream.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>it moisturizes well, but I don&#x27;t like the fragrance, and I feel like I&#x27;m slightly more prone to breakouts</li>
            <li>I love this night cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I can get this when I need it.</li>
            <li>I bought my original at kiosk in Las Vegas at their fabulous mall and loved it ever since.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and has a great light, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful if you have dry skin and want a non greasy cream.</li>
            <li>Super nice and east to use.  </li>
            <li>Love all the Vivo products, simple ingredients, work beautifully.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and vivo per lei products work great.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive &amp; it works great.</li>
            <li>and my face feels so soft and a great smell.</li>
            <li>yes, I am susceptible to things like that - I like to feel I am using something special on my face!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly without feeling greasy, leaving my skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>The Vivo Per Lei creams have been very effective for me and it&#x27;s amazing how long a jar lasts.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I keep trying other products AVON has been the best.</li>
            <li>When I opened the jar it had a strong smell, but what the heck lets give it a try.</li>
            <li>My skin is nice and soft from using this, and the fragrance is nice as well.  </li>
            <li>Amazing thank you very helpful!</li>
            <li>love this stuff and great for my really dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has made a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels hydrated, moisturized, and smooth.</li>
            <li>This feels fantastic on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I would purchase this again if I could get it fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It does not leave any grease and your skin feels so smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this night cream.  </li>
            <li>The night cream, applied just before bedtime, soaks in, and in the morning my skin is plump, wrinkles faded/diminished and skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Enjoy,</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth the price ,My skin is nice and soft from using this, and the fragrance is nice as well.</li>
            <li>not only for the sale price was this cheaper than Aveeno, compare $17 to $10.48 plus free two day shipping, I find it much MUCH better!!</li>
            <li>This product seems to moisturize very well, but the scent is very strong.  </li>
            <li>this is our first time using this type of cream and we love it.</li>
            <li>Makes your face smile!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is worth the price, ...just not at the mall!</li>
            <li>bought this as a gift for friends, it is a quality brand with significant results&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they are interesting and can be quite fun if you really know how to take better care of them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27; s just a cream, nothing special about it</li>
            <li>This cream goes right into your skin!</li>
            <li>Such a good line of products that my girlfriend tried &amp; recommended to me.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>It feels good going on but does not last.</li>
            <li>sweet and feminine</li>
            <li>This product is hard to find really pleased to have found it here ...and for a great price.</li>
            <li>Absolutely convinced of the unique &amp;#34;cell renewal&amp;#34; properties!  </li>
            <li>Vivo Per Lei cell Renewal Night Cream is great and worth the money that I spent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve used, especially for the money.  </li>
            <li>Love that I got it at $13 and not the $40 that they offered me in the mall (with employee discount, ;), ;))</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced and so smooth to use.  </li>
            <li>My skin has more elasticity, is more firm, and appears much more radiant than before use.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much - it keeps my face soft &amp; smooth - and helps to smooth fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>That being said, this cream leaves my skin very soft and smooth, and for the Amazon price it is a bargain!</li>
            <li>I live in a desert and need the extra moisture, this gives me this and smells nice too, very light.</li>
            <li>Having only used this for a few days, I can&#x27;t say there is any real &amp;#34;change&amp;#34; in my appearance, but my skin feels great, the product smells good and is richly moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li>It is not too heavy, smells great, evens out the tone quite a bit</li>
            <li>When I wake up, my face feels fresh.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It has been so exciting to find your website to order it.</li>
            <li>I love this night cream...not sticky and leaves my skin so soft by morning.</li>
            <li>I was scammed into this at the mall several years ago,but liked the product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is suttle and fresh.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this stuff and use many other Vivo Per Lei products.</li>
            <li>I have used other Vivo products and loved them..</li>
            <li>A little greasy, but has a nice fragrance and leaves my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>and very fast shipping</li>
            <li>She has been using this&lt;br /&gt;product and seems to like it very much along with the\&lt;br /&gt;Day Cream.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend introduced me to this product and likes it very much.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t is very nice perfume either, its very fakey and heavy.</li>
            <li>3rd time refill purchased, like the smell, keep your skin soft not oilly at all -- Love it &amp; enjoy very much</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Between the two may face actually does feel better.  </li>
            <li>First time I tried this cream was in Hawaii at the mall in Honolulu.</li>
            <li>I normally do not wear cream at night due to clogging of my pores; however, this product went on light and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love these products enough that I would spend the money</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it promises to do.</li>
            <li>I use the Vivo Per Lei Vitamin cream first and follow with this night cream.</li>
            <li>It gives me an overall more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the sun too much in my younger years.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to other lotions, as I break out right away with greasy ones, but so far so good, no breakouts with this one!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have your hair back until it absorbs, it can make your hair look oily if it gets on it before absorbing.</li>
            <li>My wife said that I needed to start taking care of my face, so I bought this for night and Aveeno positively radiant for the day.  </li>
            <li>Her first jar came from a very over priced vendor at a women&#x27;s show.</li>
            <li>I discoverd the first night, this has WAY too much perfume in it, and that tells me either they are either trying to hide something or its just glorified perfumed cream.</li>
            <li>This is the first night cream I really like.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is just as good, if not better</li>
            <li>I Love cell renewal night cream for its rich creamy texture, how it really helps my face feel moisturized, and the daily results of younger feeling &amp; looking skin.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that this night lotion is purely divine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite facial cream.</li>
            <li>I believe it helps with the fine lines, especially around  the eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li>It may work better for very dry skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very greasy and does not seem like it works very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day and don&#x27;t really see a long-term change in my skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes the skin smooth and supple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Found it online, very affordable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This night cream works very well.</li>
            <li>We found it here for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This product has really helped soften up my skin.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really care for the product.  </li>
            <li>it cost 3 times as much.</li>
            <li>I really recommend them and I have tried alot in my 60 years.</li>
            <li>I really like how it works, it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I like how it works, but the smell is too much</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like it and can see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>so it really nourishes the skin and moisturizes throughout the night</li>
            <li>: Buy it here on Amazon, it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than buying it from the mall kiosks or from vivopl.com.</li>
            <li>I absorbs into the skin very well.</li>
            <li>I am very unpleased with the cream.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t do much of anything else.</li>
            <li>The products works very well</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin too.</li>
            <li>This was for my daughter and she really loves it.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was reasonable for the quality of cream.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s nor real.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is packaged well even without gift options and serves as a very economically efficient present</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed other products in this line and they all seem to do what their advertised to do</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve played with many facial care products and never really liked them or enjoyed them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it&#x27;s definitely not subtle.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, but don&#x27;t let those people at the mall pressure you to purchase...</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly greasier than the day cream, but it is absorbed quite quickly.</li>
            <li>Left my face so soft and clean...</li>
            <li>The problem is that it has an overwhelming perfumy smell, like your grandmothers heavily scented perfume.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice and thick</li>
            <li>I live in the dessert and needed the moisture</li>
            <li>I tried the more expensive version of this - Oro Gold, which I bought in Vegas for a huge amount of money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 64 years old and have always had a ruddy complexion which has gotten redder as I have gotten older.  </li>
            <li>I have used a night cream for many years, but have never liked one as much as I do this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to young and older women.</li>
            <li>I  Love the day cream , but  the night cream is far to greasy and heavy for my skin .</li>
            <li>, if that&#x27;s the case I&#x27;d suggest you stick to the light Day Cream, but if you&#x27;ve got combination or dry skin, or if you&#x27;re like me and have hard water in the area and have to put on two or three coats of lotion before bed to keep from having that really dry and tight feeling on your face this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive skin), and makes it feel silky and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m will never ever,ever use anything other than my tried and true.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much - it&#x27;s thick, so it&#x27;s easy to accidentally take too much when removing from the bottle.</li>
            <li>It is thick and my face feels very soft and it looks healthy in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I like using different kinds of beauty products but i will try to use this one a little more to see if i notice a change</li>
            <li>I am very fragrance sensitive so this is a big plus.</li>
            <li>I am so pleasantly surprised by that brand.</li>
            <li>Since you don&#x27;t use much, it&#x27;s not too overpowering, but you definitely smell it.</li>
            <li>She uses them because she has sensitive skin and has never had any problems.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive Skin and can&#x27;t use every Product .</li>
            <li>This product is helpful in moisturizing the face and keeping the young look.  </li>
            <li>make your skin soft and glowing..</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and not grease.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>Do not use if you have sensitive skin or are opposed to fragrances in face cream.</li>
            <li>I like this moisturizer to use during the winter months, kept my skin very moisturized and glowing, it seems a bit greasy, but during winter I don&#x27;t mind because my skin get so irritated because of the cold, and this cream kept it well behave during those winter months, will not be using it in the summer, because I&#x27;M PRONE TO BREAKOUTS, and I feel this will cause them if I used it during the summer.so far a good product and well priced.</li>
            <li>With my sensitive skin, I am always looking for quality products.</li>
            <li>This night cream is not heavy.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling soft even into the morning.</li>
            <li>It leaves my aging skin soft and smooth and feeling firm.</li>
            <li>Already after only two weeks worth of use my skin is looking younger and firmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very nice thick moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;Recently had an acid treatment so skin was 2 weeks post and a little</li>
            <li>I bought some other products that were more expensive and this works so much better.  </li>
            <li>It is very rich and thick.  </li>
            <li>Birds are strange creatures and it is not easy to care for them in a way that will help them to live longer and have a better life.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy, goes on smooth, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I used the products until the containers were almost empty and found them very gentle.</li>
            <li>I have a real problem with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My chin seems to be reacting to it (reddened skin and blind blemishes developing) but the rest of my face is doing very well and appears softer and more &#x27;dewy.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy at all, leaves skin soft, and your skin instantly looks healthier when you put it on.</li>
            <li>I tested it out several times too before using because I can have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Make my skin look younger and soft.</li>
            <li>I really like Vivo products - price is less than at counters or home party groups.  </li>

            <li> Amazing thank you very helpful!</li>

            <li> This lotion has made a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels hydrated, moisturized, and smooth.</li>

            <li> Enjoy,</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth the price ,My skin is nice and soft from using this, and the fragrance is nice as well.</li>
            <li> not only for the sale price was this cheaper than Aveeno, compare $17 to $10.48 plus free two day shipping, I find it much MUCH better!!</li>
            <li> This product seems to moisturize very well, but the scent is very strong.  </li>
            <li> this is our first time using this type of cream and we love it.</li>
            <li> Makes your face smile!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is worth the price, ...just not at the mall!</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift for friends, it is a quality brand with significant results&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they are interesting and can be quite fun if you really know how to take better care of them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27; s just a cream, nothing special about it</li>
            <li> This cream goes right into your skin!</li>
            <li> Such a good line of products that my girlfriend tried &amp; recommended to me.  </li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> It feels good going on but does not last.</li>
            <li> sweet and feminine</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find really pleased to have found it here ...and for a great price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely convinced of the unique &amp;#34;cell renewal&amp;#34; properties!  </li>
            <li> Vivo Per Lei cell Renewal Night Cream is great and worth the money that I spent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve used, especially for the money.  </li>
            <li> Love that I got it at $13 and not the $40 that they offered me in the mall (with employee discount, ;), ;))</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced and so smooth to use.  </li>
            <li> My skin has more elasticity, is more firm, and appears much more radiant than before use.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much - it keeps my face soft &amp; smooth - and helps to smooth fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> That being said, this cream leaves my skin very soft and smooth, and for the Amazon price it is a bargain!</li>
            <li> I live in a desert and need the extra moisture, this gives me this and smells nice too, very light.</li>
            <li> Having only used this for a few days, I can&#x27;t say there is any real &amp;#34;change&amp;#34; in my appearance, but my skin feels great, the product smells good and is richly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy, smells great, evens out the tone quite a bit</li>
            <li> When I wake up, my face feels fresh.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It has been so exciting to find your website to order it.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream...not sticky and leaves my skin so soft by morning.</li>
            <li> I was scammed into this at the mall several years ago,but liked the product.  </li>
            <li> The smell is suttle and fresh.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this stuff and use many other Vivo Per Lei products.</li>
            <li> I have used other Vivo products and loved them..</li>
            <li> A little greasy, but has a nice fragrance and leaves my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> and very fast shipping</li>
            <li> She has been using this&lt;br /&gt;product and seems to like it very much along with the\&lt;br /&gt;Day Cream.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend introduced me to this product and likes it very much.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t is very nice perfume either, its very fakey and heavy.</li>
            <li> 3rd time refill purchased, like the smell, keep your skin soft not oilly at all -- Love it &amp; enjoy very much</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft, smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Between the two may face actually does feel better.  </li>
            <li> First time I tried this cream was in Hawaii at the mall in Honolulu.</li>
            <li> I normally do not wear cream at night due to clogging of my pores; however, this product went on light and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love these products enough that I would spend the money</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it promises to do.</li>
            <li> I use the Vivo Per Lei Vitamin cream first and follow with this night cream.</li>
            <li> It gives me an overall more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the sun too much in my younger years.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to other lotions, as I break out right away with greasy ones, but so far so good, no breakouts with this one!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have your hair back until it absorbs, it can make your hair look oily if it gets on it before absorbing.</li>
            <li> My wife said that I needed to start taking care of my face, so I bought this for night and Aveeno positively radiant for the day.  </li>
            <li> Her first jar came from a very over priced vendor at a women&#x27;s show.</li>
            <li> I discoverd the first night, this has WAY too much perfume in it, and that tells me either they are either trying to hide something or its just glorified perfumed cream.</li>
            <li> This is the first night cream I really like.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is just as good, if not better</li>
            <li> I Love cell renewal night cream for its rich creamy texture, how it really helps my face feel moisturized, and the daily results of younger feeling &amp; looking skin.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this night lotion is purely divine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite facial cream.</li>
            <li> I believe it helps with the fine lines, especially around  the eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li> It may work better for very dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy and does not seem like it works very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day and don&#x27;t really see a long-term change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes the skin smooth and supple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Found it online, very affordable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This night cream works very well.</li>
            <li> We found it here for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped soften up my skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the product.  </li>
            <li> it cost 3 times as much.</li>
            <li> I really recommend them and I have tried alot in my 60 years.</li>
            <li> I really like how it works, it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I like how it works, but the smell is too much</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like it and can see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> so it really nourishes the skin and moisturizes throughout the night</li>
            <li> : Buy it here on Amazon, it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than buying it from the mall kiosks or from vivopl.com.</li>
            <li> I absorbs into the skin very well.</li>
            <li> I am very unpleased with the cream.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t do much of anything else.</li>
            <li> The products works very well</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin too.</li>
            <li> This was for my daughter and she really loves it.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was reasonable for the quality of cream.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s nor real.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is packaged well even without gift options and serves as a very economically efficient present</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed other products in this line and they all seem to do what their advertised to do</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve played with many facial care products and never really liked them or enjoyed them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it&#x27;s definitely not subtle.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, but don&#x27;t let those people at the mall pressure you to purchase...</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly greasier than the day cream, but it is absorbed quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Left my face so soft and clean...</li>
            <li> The problem is that it has an overwhelming perfumy smell, like your grandmothers heavily scented perfume.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice and thick</li>
            <li> I live in the dessert and needed the moisture</li>
            <li> I tried the more expensive version of this - Oro Gold, which I bought in Vegas for a huge amount of money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 years old and have always had a ruddy complexion which has gotten redder as I have gotten older.  </li>
            <li> I have used a night cream for many years, but have never liked one as much as I do this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to young and older women.</li>
            <li> I  Love the day cream , but  the night cream is far to greasy and heavy for my skin .</li>
            <li> , if that&#x27;s the case I&#x27;d suggest you stick to the light Day Cream, but if you&#x27;ve got combination or dry skin, or if you&#x27;re like me and have hard water in the area and have to put on two or three coats of lotion before bed to keep from having that really dry and tight feeling on your face this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive skin), and makes it feel silky and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m will never ever,ever use anything other than my tried and true.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much - it&#x27;s thick, so it&#x27;s easy to accidentally take too much when removing from the bottle.</li>
            <li> It is thick and my face feels very soft and it looks healthy in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I like using different kinds of beauty products but i will try to use this one a little more to see if i notice a change</li>
            <li> I am very fragrance sensitive so this is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I am so pleasantly surprised by that brand.</li>
            <li> Since you don&#x27;t use much, it&#x27;s not too overpowering, but you definitely smell it.</li>
            <li> She uses them because she has sensitive skin and has never had any problems.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive Skin and can&#x27;t use every Product .</li>
            <li> This product is helpful in moisturizing the face and keeping the young look.  </li>
            <li> make your skin soft and glowing..</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and not grease.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> Do not use if you have sensitive skin or are opposed to fragrances in face cream.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer to use during the winter months, kept my skin very moisturized and glowing, it seems a bit greasy, but during winter I don&#x27;t mind because my skin get so irritated because of the cold, and this cream kept it well behave during those winter months, will not be using it in the summer, because I&#x27;M PRONE TO BREAKOUTS, and I feel this will cause them if I used it during the summer.so far a good product and well priced.</li>
            <li> With my sensitive skin, I am always looking for quality products.</li>
            <li> This night cream is not heavy.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft even into the morning.</li>
            <li> It leaves my aging skin soft and smooth and feeling firm.</li>
            <li> Already after only two weeks worth of use my skin is looking younger and firmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very nice thick moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;Recently had an acid treatment so skin was 2 weeks post and a little</li>
            <li> I bought some other products that were more expensive and this works so much better.  </li>
            <li> It is very rich and thick.  </li>
            <li> Birds are strange creatures and it is not easy to care for them in a way that will help them to live longer and have a better life.  </li>
            <li> Very creamy, goes on smooth, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used the products until the containers were almost empty and found them very gentle.</li>
            <li> I have a real problem with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My chin seems to be reacting to it (reddened skin and blind blemishes developing) but the rest of my face is doing very well and appears softer and more &#x27;dewy.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy at all, leaves skin soft, and your skin instantly looks healthier when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I tested it out several times too before using because I can have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Make my skin look younger and soft.</li>
            <li> I really like Vivo products - price is less than at counters or home party groups.  </li>
            <li> Also a few of the other reviews said that they find the scent a little to strong, but this was not the case for me at all.</li>
            <li> Probably not very good if you have really oily skin</li>
            <li> This does give my skin a firm, soft feeling the morning after using it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance stays a long time and made my eyes water.</li>
            <li> As I have aged, my regular skin care moisturizer just didn&#x27;t do it for me anymore.  </li>
            <li> I could use it sparingly and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> It smells like my great-grandmother and is just a thick cream that didn&#x27;t really do a thing for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used others that worked better that were less expensive.</li>
            <li> also contains alcohol and mineral oil which dry the skin.</li>
            <li> but my skin feels dry in the morning</li>
            <li> I bought this after noticing my face was really dry this winter.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or make me break out.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face from getting too dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and I usually use products without perfumes if I can help it.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t want up with dry or tight skin the next morning.  </li>
            <li> so if you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> this one however was very thick and felt very greasy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely too heavy to use all day.</li>
            <li> I actually mix it with water because it is so heavy.  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way and it balances out the dry spots on your face.</li>
            <li> My face has felt much less dry since I&#x27;ve started using it.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will probably try to avoid my chin area from now on and continue using...unless other parts of my face start having problems as well.</li>
            <li> and I like to feel softer as I have with other products.  </li>
            <li> I have switched almost all my skin care products due to my experience with this product.  </li>
            <li> Note: a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I bought this to go along with the other two products I had purchased.</li>
            <li> I like this brand and have used other products in this brand.  </li>
            <li> I use less then a dime size on my face and neck and chest at night.</li>
            <li> and my face felt slick in the AM  , kinda icky actually .  </li>
            <li> night cream is a little richer than the day cream</li>
            <li> heavy and greasy..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Dead Sea products for years.  </li>
            <li> so buy something less expensive and get the same results.  </li>
            <li> i am not sure if this worked for me or not.  </li>
            <li> the texture is different but in a hurry I always grab the wrong one.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of waking up again with a face feeling like a oil slick .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the creams.</li>
            <li> It is a smoother not too thick cream.  </li>
            <li> I accidentally used this during the day once, and since it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> This one is fake.</li>
            <li> Feeling bad by giving one star.</li>
            <li> She was very annoying and the product was very expensive.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Vivo Per Lei cell Renewal Night Cream is great and worth the money that I spent.</li>
            <li> I am so pleasantly surprised by that brand. I had never heard of it and just received 5 of their products. It leaves my skin soft, smooth and refreshed. I don&#x27;t break out a day or two after application (therefore not too oily).&lt;br /&gt;A definite &amp;#34;will buy again&amp;#34; item!</li>
            <li> Love all the Vivo products, simple ingredients, work beautifully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy and does not seem like it works very well. The greasy feeling does not go away and it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> When I wake up, my face feels fresh. It&#x27;s not sticky, and my face and neck feel hydrated .&lt;br /&gt;Excellent price too. I used it before and I bought it from someone else, paying a lot more.</li>
            <li> Hours after applying this product my face still feels greasy. also contains alcohol and mineral oil which dry the skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the quality of this product.This stuff is worth the price ,My skin is nice and soft from using this, and the fragrance is nice as well. and very fast shipping</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product.  Very reasonably priced and so smooth to use.  It has been great for my face.</li>
            <li> excellent very good product this is our first time using this type of cream and we love it.Very good price.</li>
            <li> Amazing thank you very helpful! Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee (Rivki) Silverberg&lt;br /&gt;Author of Understanding Children and Families with Autism Spectrum Disorders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Children-Families-Spectrum-Disorders/dp/1622127269/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;books&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1418769206&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;understanding+children+and+families+with+autism+spectrum+disorders</li>
            <li> This cream is thicker than the day cream, and has a scent to it. Since you don&#x27;t use much, it&#x27;s not too overpowering, but you definitely smell it. Kind of fruity almost. I accidentally used this during the day once, and since it&#x27;s so expensive I didn&#x27;t want to take it off and replace with the day cream - but it&#x27;s definitely too heavy to use all day. Won&#x27;t be doing that again!  This does give my skin a firm, soft feeling the morning after using it. Don&#x27;t use too much - it&#x27;s thick, so it&#x27;s easy to accidentally take too much when removing from the bottle. I don&#x27;t use it every day and don&#x27;t really see a long-term change in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product seems to moisturize very well, but the scent is very strong.  My skin is extremely sensitive and I usually use products without perfumes if I can help it. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it&#x27;s definitely not subtle.  My chin seems to be reacting to it (reddened skin and blind blemishes developing) but the rest of my face is doing very well and appears softer and more &#x27;dewy.&#x27;  I will probably try to avoid my chin area from now on and continue using...unless other parts of my face start having problems as well.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years. Vivo is one ofo my favorite brands.  It is well worth the money.  I can&#x27;t imagine not using it.</li>
            <li> Such a good line of products that my girlfriend tried &amp; recommended to me.  I bought it for myself &amp; as a gift to another friend.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy.</li>
            <li> Nice and creamy and smells so good.  Definitely makes the skin smooth and supple.&lt;br /&gt;The night cream is a little richer than the day cream so if you have very dry skin I would&lt;br /&gt;recommend using this one day and night.</li>
            <li> Vivo Per Lei product is excellent for all.  I Love this mark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; s just a cream, nothing special about it so buy something less expensive and get the same results.  It does smell nice though!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite night cream...I live in a desert and need the extra moisture, this gives me this and smells nice too, very light.</li>
            <li> It works okay but my skin feels dry in the morning and I like to feel softer as I have with other products.  I think that the day is better than the night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I keep trying other products AVON has been the best. I&#x27;m will never ever,ever use anything other than my tried and true. No I&#x27;m not an AVON sell representative. Just a nut who is finally sane.</li>
            <li> heavy and greasy..i dont like it!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the way this cream feels when I put it on. Skin feels hydrated, moisturized, and smooth. My mom tried some of mine and after one use she ordered some for herself!</li>
            <li> Makes your face smile!  Lovely consistency, didn&#x27;t make my face break out, and the aroma is incredibly delightful!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. My wife said that I needed to start taking care of my face, so I bought this for night and Aveeno positively radiant for the day.  Between the two may face actually does feel better.  It may be in my brain, but so be it.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Skin feels rejuvenated</li>
            <li> good product.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered fast&lt;br /&gt;Little too oily</li>
            <li> 3rd time refill purchased, like the smell, keep your skin soft not oilly at all -- Love it &amp; enjoy very much</li>
            <li> I have the day cream and I decided I needed the night cream too! This stuff works great but OMG it is SO strong smelling!!!</li>
            <li> Great cream! Amazing value for cost and smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 years old and have always had a ruddy complexion which has gotten redder as I have gotten older.  About 3 months ago, I was approached by a salesperson from a Vivo Per Lei kiosk at the mall.  She was very annoying and the product was very expensive.  When I got home, I went to Amazon and read the reviews, saw the great prices and purchased both the day cream and night cream.  Within a week or two, my skin had a better feel and appearance - the redness was greatly reduced.  I no longer use a tinted moisturizer to cover up the redness.  The Vivo Per Lei creams have been very effective for me and it&#x27;s amazing how long a jar lasts.  You need just a couple of dots to cover your face and neck.</li>
            <li> I found this to be an excellent product, absorbed quickly without a greasy feeling.  Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought my original at kiosk in Las Vegas at their fabulous mall and loved it ever since.  I have switched almost all my skin care products due to my experience with this product.  Way cheaper thru Amazon than the kiosk I might add - way cheaper.</li>
            <li> First time I tried this cream was in Hawaii at the mall in Honolulu. I couldn&#x27;t afford it. Found it online, very affordable. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend the day time cream.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed other products in this line and they all seem to do what their advertised to do i&#x27;m happy with the reduced price.</li>
            <li> This works very well, absorbs beautifully, and is a light consistency so it goes on easily and is great under makeup.  Feels nice on my skin. Will order it again and a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to my friends.  It&#x27;s an excellent product.  My daughter said it broke her out, so I guess it&#x27;s not for everyone,&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve used, especially for the money.  I also love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> When I ran out of my Aveeno night cream, I searched for another one I could try. not only for the sale price was this cheaper than Aveeno, compare $17 to $10.48 plus free two day shipping, I find it much MUCH better!! It is not greasy at all, leaves skin soft, and your skin instantly looks healthier when you put it on. Note: a little goes a long way! use sparingly!  Also a few of the other reviews said that they find the scent a little to strong, but this was not the case for me at all. I find it rather pleasant. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Amazing product with great service. Very good smell and amazingâ€‹ packing</li>
            <li> I bought this after noticing my face was really dry this winter.  The night cream comes beautifully packaged.  My face has felt much less dry since I&#x27;ve started using it.  The cream feels nice and light going on.  Great, inexpensive night cream option.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Having only used this for a few days, I can&#x27;t say there is any real &amp;#34;change&amp;#34; in my appearance, but my skin feels great, the product smells good and is richly moisturizing. I am very impressed with the appearance of the packaging...yes, I am susceptible to things like that - I like to feel I am using something special on my face! That being said, this cream leaves my skin very soft and smooth, and for the Amazon price it is a bargain!</li>
            <li> My wife has used these products for a year now and she has no complaints.  She uses them because she has sensitive skin and has never had any problems.</li>
            <li> Every night for two years,very pleased!</li>
            <li> This night cream works very well. It&#x27;s light and has a great light, clean fragrance. I have used this product for quite a while now, and I will continue to use it as it works so well.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the product line. There is a fragrance but I find it pleasing. I am very fragrance sensitive so this is a big plus. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best cream ever. It is the same as sold in the malls, with people stopping you as you walk, where you will pay triple!</li>
            <li> Is there ever a product that does what it says it will do? It feels good going on but does not last.</li>
            <li> This creme is great! Just a little bit goes a long way and it balances out the dry spots on your face. Makes your face evenly moisturized. Love it!</li>
            <li> i am not sure if this worked for me or not.  i do not think i feel the difference between with this and with out this..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Dead Sea products for years.  It&#x27;s hard to find the creams. This is wonderful if you have dry skin and want a non greasy cream.</li>
            <li> Very effective . Does surpass my wife&#x27;s expectations and will want to order again when needed. this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item after my wife had recieved a couple&lt;br /&gt;packets of the Day Cream.  She has been using this&lt;br /&gt;product and seems to like it very much along with the\&lt;br /&gt;Day Cream.</li>
            <li> This feels fantastic on my skin.  I will place another order as soon as I can. Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li> Very creamy, goes on smooth, a little goes a long way. Fast shipping, great price, will use seller again</li>
            <li> My mom loves this cream. Her first jar came from a very over priced vendor at a women&#x27;s show. We found it here for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention. I thought I was ordering the the Vivo Per Lei facial peel...oops!!!! The night cream feels nice on my face, my skin seems brighter and smoother since I started using it. One thing I don&#x27;t like is the fragrance. The fragrance is to flowery for my taste. I would purchase this again if I could get it fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I use all the Vivo per lei products and have been very pleased. I am 53 YO and was in the sun alot. This product has really helped soften up my skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the product.  I&#x27;ve used others that worked better that were less expensive.</li>
            <li> This is excellent night cream. It leaves my aging skin soft and smooth and feeling firm. It&#x27;s slightly greasier than the day cream, but it is absorbed quite quickly.</li>
            <li> The Vivo products are terrific. It has been so exciting to find your website to order it. My skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> This night cream is as moist in the morning as when you apply it at night.  Great for the price. Don&#x27;t buy from shopping mall it cost 3 times as much.</li>
            <li> This product feels great on and it smells devine!  Even the packaging is beautiful. I will definitely purchase this again and again!  What a great deal compared to the stores.</li>
            <li> Absolutely convinced of the unique &amp;#34;cell renewal&amp;#34; properties!  Apply this product before betime with the assurance that it&#x27;s providing the necessary nutrients my skin needs while I sleep.  When I wake in the morning, my skin appears refreshed and rested without any baggyness or sag.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love all their products. I have sensitive skin and vivo per lei products work great. I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive Skin and can&#x27;t use every Product . This Cream is wonderful and my Skin is smoothie and soft!</li>
            <li> This cream goes right into your skin! My skin is sensitive to other lotions, as I break out right away with greasy ones, but so far so good, no breakouts with this one! Love that I got it at $13 and not the $40 that they offered me in the mall (with employee discount, ;), ;))</li>
            <li> Love this product! This product is hard to find really pleased to have found it here ...and for a great price.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much - it keeps my face soft &amp; smooth - and helps to smooth fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> Keep out of the sun, drink plenty of water, wear sunscreen daily and use this product line religiously and your skin will look AH-MAZING!</li>
            <li> This product is helpful in moisturizing the face and keeping the young look.  My girlfriend introduced me to this product and likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Was unsure as to how this product would be.  I normally do not wear cream at night due to clogging of my pores; however, this product went on light and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this as a sample and was so happy that I found it on line with the right price</li>
            <li> Keep your money in your pocket.  This product was shipped from somewhere in Turkey.  You will find better products here in the U.S., over the counter in a drug store.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results of the night cream and the whole line of Vivo products . The product and the price is a very good buy .</li>
            <li> I really like Vivo products - price is less than at counters or home party groups.  I really recommend them and I have tried alot in my 60 years.</li>
            <li> This lotion has made a huge difference in my skin.  It is not too heavy, smells great, evens out the tone quite a bit (I have very sensitive skin), and makes it feel silky and hydrated.  I love the night cream, too.</li>
            <li> I tried the more expensive version of this - Oro Gold, which I bought in Vegas for a huge amount of money.  This stuff is just as good, if not better</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  You can feel the difference immediately.  I bought some other products that were more expensive and this works so much better.  love this stuff and great for my really dry skin.  wake up refreshed feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream as a gift and she is very happy with it&lt;br /&gt;She said is working. She would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I thought it would be. It is wonderful and well worth the money. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I really like how it works, it is very moisturizing. I actually mix it with water because it is so heavy.  The problem is that it has an overwhelming perfumy smell, like your grandmothers heavily scented perfume.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell natural.  I like how it works, but the smell is too much and I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice thick moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;Recently had an acid treatment so skin was 2 weeks post and a little dry.&lt;br /&gt;This cream was able to alleviate the dryness.</li>
            <li> very nice and night cream..make your skin soft and glowing..it has a fragrance that I love not overpowering just .soft sweet and feminine</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite facial cream. It smells wonderful. Its super-silky without being greasy. And my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> I can feel the pruduct working as soon as i apply it.  my eyes are not puffy in the morning.</li>
            <li> After cleaning off all makeup with the cleanser, and using the toner, apply the night cream on your skin.  It does not leave any grease and your skin feels so smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the good reviews on this web site. I&#x27;m glad I did. My skin feels soft and not grease. I use it every night. I&#x27;m very happy I found a nice product for a very good price. Will recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go along with the other two products I had purchased. I really like it and can see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve played with many facial care products and never really liked them or enjoyed them. That is, until I found Vivo Per Lei! It is very rich and thick.  Probably not very good if you have really oily skin, if that&#x27;s the case I&#x27;d suggest you stick to the light Day Cream, but if you&#x27;ve got combination or dry skin, or if you&#x27;re like me and have hard water in the area and have to put on two or three coats of lotion before bed to keep from having that really dry and tight feeling on your face this is perfect.  A little bit goes a long way and it&#x27;s nice and thick so it really nourishes the skin and moisturizes throughout the night so you don&#x27;t want up with dry or tight skin the next morning.  All I can say is that this night lotion is purely divine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this stuff and use many other Vivo Per Lei products. Already after only two weeks worth of use my skin is looking younger and firmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Buy it here on Amazon, it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than buying it from the mall kiosks or from vivopl.com. I love these products enough that I would spend the money but it&#x27;s always nice to save a bundle!</li>
            <li> Found out about product in an over priced kiosk in the mall but looked it up on Amazon and love the cream and also the face peel.</li>
            <li> Super nice and east to use.  I use this in conjunction with the Vivo Per Lei Day cream and they are a great pair.</li>
            <li> The night cream and day cream are both good, in my opinion, I have them both. But one suggestion:  label the night cream and the day cream. the texture is different but in a hurry I always grab the wrong one.  Day for nigt and night for day.</li>
            <li> I love the cream itself.  It works wonderful and my skin looks and feels fantastic.  I just think it is way over scented.  For the price and the results I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Time will tell whether or not it produces the results I am looking for. I absorbs into the skin very well.</li>
            <li> I am very unpleased with the cream. The smell is very strong and very cheap and like for a man. I dont want even to use it for hands or feet.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a good night cream. Skin feels soft in the morning. Just make sure you have your hair back until it absorbs, it can make your hair look oily if it gets on it before absorbing.</li>
            <li> I received a sample from a vendor and loved the way it made my skin feel. So I did a search and found online so decided to give a try. My skin&#x27;s appearance has changed drastically. Love this cream.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who raves about this, but I just don&#x27;t get it. It smells like my great-grandmother and is just a thick cream that didn&#x27;t really do a thing for me. I tested it out several times too before using because I can have sensitive skin and it is SO perfumed. It never irritated me or rashed me out. It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or make me break out. It also didn&#x27;t do much of anything else.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than many night creams I have used.  It is a smoother not too thick cream.  One thing I especially like is the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love this night face cream! It smells absolutely amazing and is a great way to slip into a wonderful night sleep! So glad to have found it on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and well packaged. I love this night cream...not sticky and leaves my skin so soft by morning.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this night cream.  It is thick and my face feels very soft and it looks healthy in the morning.  If you use the day moisturizer you can compare them and see that this is thicker and the aroma is stronger but it works as well as the day cream.  The products works very well and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar it had a strong smell, but what the heck lets give it a try. What a big mistake that was. The fragrance stays a long time and made my eyes water. My forehead broke out and along the sides of my face did too. Do not use if you have sensitive skin or are opposed to fragrances in face cream. This cream is also oily feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer to use during the winter months, kept my skin very moisturized and glowing, it seems a bit greasy, but during winter I don&#x27;t mind because my skin get so irritated because of the cold, and this cream kept it well behave during those winter months, will not be using it in the summer, because I&#x27;M PRONE TO BREAKOUTS, and I feel this will cause them if I used it during the summer.so far a good product and well priced.</li>
            <li> I purchased both day and night cream. I cannot believe the quality of this product. The night cream, applied just before bedtime, soaks in, and in the morning my skin is plump, wrinkles faded/diminished and skin smooth. The day cream is paraben free, and is amazing under makeup. I am very, very pleased, and will buy many more for myself and gifts for others. Enjoy,</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth the price, ...just not at the mall! My skin is nice and soft from using this, and the fragrance is nice as well.  As I have aged, my regular skin care moisturizer just didn&#x27;t do it for me anymore.  I was scammed into this at the mall several years ago,but liked the product.  I got it from Amazon, and don&#x27;t regret it either! It feels like silk as  I spread it on my face at night.  It absorbs quickly without feeling greasy, leaving my skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used a night cream for many years, but have never liked one as much as I do this product. My skin is sensitive &amp; it works great.</li>
            <li> I discoverd the first night, this has WAY too much perfume in it, and that tells me either they are either trying to hide something or its just glorified perfumed cream. This isn&#x27;t is very nice perfume either, its very fakey and heavy. I use it on my elbows and hands now.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Make my skin look younger and soft. I recommend this product to young and older women.</li>
            <li> I Love cell renewal night cream for its rich creamy texture, how it really helps my face feel moisturized, and the daily results of younger feeling &amp; looking skin. My skin has more elasticity, is more firm, and appears much more radiant than before use. If you&#x27;re looking for an excellent night cream (and since the day cream I bought &amp;#60;not a vivo product&amp;#62; hurt my skin, I used this during the day as well for the last 30 days...) try this one!! I will be trying the Vivo day cream this month to see if it&#x27;s as lovely!</li>
            <li> A little greasy, but has a nice fragrance and leaves my face feeling smooth. Good product for the money.</li>
            <li> Okay, product. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and non-greasy. I could use it sparingly and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It does exactly what it promises to do. It is gentle on the skin too.</li>
            <li> I  Love the day cream , but  the night cream is far to greasy and heavy for my skin . Caused break outs  and my face felt slick in the AM  , kinda icky actually .  I tried it three nights in a row . Couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of waking up again with a face feeling like a oil slick . But ...... the day cream is heaven .</li>
            <li> My concern is that the product I received was \\&quot;Made in Japan\\&quot; and the acutal product is supposed to be \\&quot;Made in Israel.\\&quot; I guess that explans the price...</li>
            <li> I love this it is not greasy like I thought it would be.  I live in the dessert and needed the moisture and my face feels so soft and a great smell.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at a kiosk in a mall. With my sensitive skin, I am always looking for quality products. I used the products until the containers were almost empty and found them very gentle. They didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. The day cream, night cream and facial peel are great! Thank you.</li>
            <li> The cream has real strong smell to it could not use it Had to wash it off my face as soon as I put it on</li>
            <li> It keeps my face from getting too dry.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery...very happy!!!</li>
            <li> Too sticky. This product is too sticky. It may work better for very dry skin</li>
            <li> I love it. Left my face so soft and clean...</li>
            <li> This has got to be one of the best facial lotions i have ever used. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This night cream is not heavy. Leaves your skin feeling soft even into the morning. I use the Vivo Per Lei Vitamin cream first and follow with this night cream.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift for friends, it is a quality brand with significant results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is packaged well even without gift options and serves as a very economically efficient present</li>
            <li> This publication answers the questions that everyone asks but no one gets an answer.  Birds are strange creatures and it is not easy to care for them in a way that will help them to live longer and have a better life.  Birds are not an ideal pet but they are interesting and can be quite fun if you really know how to take better care of them.  A great book for a first time birder and one that is informative for everyone.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better in the morning. I love that it is not a heavy,greasy cream.  The only drawback to me is the fragrance.  I prefer fragrance-free products. While it is not the worst or heaviest fragrance, it would be perfect if it weren&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> This was for my daughter and she really loves it. I thought the price was reasonable for the quality of cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have a real problem with dry skin.  This moisturizer keeps my face moist and has an awesome smell.</li>
            <li> I use most of the Vivo products. They have improved the look and feel of my skin. Love them!</li>
            <li> I like using different kinds of beauty products but i will try to use this one a little more to see if i notice a change</li>
            <li> Feeling bad by giving one star.But it&#x27;s nor real. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years.This one is fake.It&#x27;s smells different.And it was not made in Israel.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizing night cream.  So far it is the best I have found.  It gives me an overall more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Love it...fill so good in the skin</li>
            <li> Skin feels great, holds moisture all through the night, reasonalbly priced. The smell is suttle and fresh. I highly recommend this, but don&#x27;t let those people at the mall pressure you to purchase...it&#x27;s way overpriced. Buy online.</li>
            <li> I believe it helps with the fine lines, especially around  the eyes and mouth.  I would recommend this over the Oil of Olay I was using</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to go with a day cream I was talked into. it moisturizes well, but I don&#x27;t like the fragrance, and I feel like I&#x27;m slightly more prone to breakouts</li>
            <li> I use it each night and in the morning my face and neck feels really good. Don&#x27;t know if any creams will get make my wrinkles go away...I enjoyed the sun too much in my younger years.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream. My face is oily but, this does not make my face oily. It feels so good on my face and I like the scent it has. If you use a lot of it I can see where the scent would be overpowering. I use less then a dime size on my face and neck and chest at night. I use it along with the Vitamin C serum from Vivo Per Lei.  The cream is heavier then the day cream. This is the first night cream I really like.  My face looks so good when I wake up and feels smooth. I do not have to wear a lot of make up anymore since using Vivo Per Lei and Gratiae products. I love them!</li>
            <li> I like this brand and have used other products in this brand.  I&#x27;m glad that I can get this when I need it.</li>
            <li> I have used other Vivo products and loved them..this one however was very thick and felt very greasy. Will still continue to use Vivo products...just not this one.</li>
