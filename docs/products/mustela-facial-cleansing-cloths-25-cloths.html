            <li>but everything was fine.</li>

            <li>They are also the perfect level of damp - wet enough without being too wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Mustela!</li>
            <li>These cleaning cloths have a nice smell that isn&#x27;t too overpowering (unlike the Johnson and Johnson hand and face wipes I tried) and are gentle on sensitive baby skin.</li>
            <li>These wipes are completely and absolutely safe for babies and people of all ages.</li>
            <li>it smells fresh.</li>
            <li>Great for those first few weeks when the cord stub is still attached and cant submerge baby.  </li>
            <li>Many regular cleansers are just too harsh for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin, however, these are perfect.</li>
            <li>They do a really good job and leave my little one smelling fresh.</li>

            <li>I have been using these cloths for more than 5 years with two kids, I cannot recommend them enough!</li>
            <li>We were worried about using them at first because the baby might get an allergy to it</li>
            <li>We tried regular wet wipes, but they don&#x27;t seem to clean as well or smell as good.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use any other kind of wipe.</li>
            <li>I love these wipes for a quick wipe down in between my sons baths.</li>
            <li>These wipes smell absolutely great, I use them to clean my baby&#x27;s face during bath time and to get areas that are difficult to catch in a bath, the folds in his neck, his ears etc.</li>
            <li>I do like how it doesn&#x27;t dry out my baby&#x27;s skin, but I find the product&#x27;s scent to be overwhelming.</li>
            <li>They are very handy to have in the diaper bag for times when you need a wipe down (especially around the eyes).  </li>
            <li>They are gentle on his skin and are convenient to carry in the diaper bag when we travel.</li>
            <li>Someone wrote that they used these gentle wipes to take makeup off their face.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my newborn&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s not fair to give this 3 stars, since I&#x27;m sure it works great for babies, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell when I used it to take makeup off.</li>
            <li>Love the facial cleansing cloths and entire mustela line....</li>
            <li>They clean up dirty faces easily, I even use them on myself sometimes, but what is most important is that my children don&#x27;t recoil from them the way they do other wipes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I really like all the Mustela products I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Has a nice and delicate scent.</li>
            <li>He loves the smell and it is very soft for his skin.</li>
            <li>- they leave my little one smelling so baby-like - sweet and edible!</li>
            <li>They smell great and are great for cleaning hte neck and behind the ears too, places hard to reach in the bathtub, especially when baby is little.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product, expensive though.</li>
            <li>And they seem to agree with her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and we use these wipes to clean her up when she gets messy after a feeding.</li>
            <li>These are so gentle and have helped tremendously to clear up my baby&#x27;s winter dry skin/exzema.  </li>
            <li>Your better off spending a few extra dollars rather then having issues later with a cheaper product, not saying that all cheap products are bad, but most are.</li>
            <li>Plus, it leaves their skin soft and not dry or chapped at all.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these to any parent who has a child with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The wipes are soft and not overly wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only draw back it</li>
            <li>They also do not dry out the babies skin, they instead refresh the skin.</li>
            <li>After wiping down her skin twice a day with these wipes for four days her acne is almost completely gone!!!  </li>
            <li>All the Mustela products are a little on the pricey side, but almost $9 for a pack of 25 wipes is a bit much.</li>

            <li> there are not as useful if they are a little dried out.</li>
            <li> I tried washing her skin twice a day with a wet cloth like the doctor had suggested but it seemed to make her face red</li>
            <li> My husband and I work long hours, and when we pick up our kids from daycare, we sometimes struggle to get them fed, bathed, and to bed on time.  </li>
            <li> Seems expensive but worth the price!  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use for a long time!</li>
            <li> Soft, gentle, and don&#x27;t leave residue or smell behind!</li>
            <li> These wipes did what I expected them to.</li>
            <li> After a long nights sleep, my baby&#x27;s eyes tend to be a little crusty in the morning</li>
            <li> I would recommend this and any other Mustela product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use them to wipe my baby down on days that he doesn&#x27;t get a bath.</li>
            <li> My 6-week old daughter has extremely sensitive skin and developed horrible case of baby acne.  </li>
            <li> clean my baby&#x27;s face &amp; moisturize at the same time though he still hated getting his face wiped</li>
            <li> My little guy has eczema prone skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these a few times.</li>
            <li> Some wipes are either too harsh or smell offensive</li>
            <li> I love mustela products,  but these made my newborn&#x27;s baby acne one million times worse.  :(</li>
            <li> I usually avoid baby products with any scent, but the scent of these is just so divine</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars is because they are expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using these wipes for a few years now, but not for babies!</li>
            <li> give this product 4 stars just due to price - they are rather expensive</li>
            <li> We use the mustela cold cream after this before bed and it usually resolves his chapped bumpy cheeks almost overnight.  </li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong with these wipes - even using it for hands/neck/chest.</li>
            <li> I always have a pack of these in my purse for all those unfortunately timed spit-ups.</li>

            <li> Love the facial cleansing cloths and entire mustela line....good for quick clean of spit up or a freshen up throughout the day for the baby.  Worth the price...have some at home and in diaper bag.</li>
            <li> Love these. Seems expensive but worth the price!  They smell great and are great for cleaning hte neck and behind the ears too, places hard to reach in the bathtub, especially when baby is little.  Great for those first few weeks when the cord stub is still attached and cant submerge baby.  Great for mama too when you need to wipe your face or arms because you cant squeeze in a shower for the day!</li>
            <li> I bought these cloths based on the reviews here on amazon.  I do like how it doesn&#x27;t dry out my baby&#x27;s skin, but I find the product&#x27;s scent to be overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I bought these for cleansing faces before makeup applications, also to remove makeup with. It works great! Smells nice and fresh! Skin looks and feels amazing after using. You can also use these for an all over clean, if you are on the road/ camping to stay fresh and keep skin feeling great! I would Def recommend and buy again!</li>
            <li> These wipes did what I expected them to. clean my baby&#x27;s face &amp; moisturize at the same time though he still hated getting his face wiped it did feel nice afterward.</li>
            <li> My baby only allows me to wipe his face with these wipes! He loves the smell and it is very soft for his skin. We love all the Mustela products!</li>
            <li> convenient for travel and outings. it smells very good.</li>
            <li> These are great to have and to keep in a diaper bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has issues with one of her tear ducts and tends to get some crustiness around one of her eyes.  These clothes are safe and gentle and I can comfortably use them around and even on her eyelid so she is more comfortable.  She doesn&#x27;t fuss at all.  They are also the perfect level of damp - wet enough without being too wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Mustela!</li>
            <li> I love all the Mustela products, but this one I don&#x27;t find effective or a good value for the price.  I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> A baby must-have! Cannot go wrong with these wipes - even using it for hands/neck/chest. Amazing smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these a few times. The smell is light and pleasant. However, last time i got them they weren&#x27;t as moist as i thought they would be.  there are not as useful if they are a little dried out.</li>
            <li> I simply love the smell and texture of this facial cleansing cloth. Mustela is very gentle for my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes!!  I use them all the time.  In fact, they are the only facial wipes I will use on my baby.  They do a really good job and leave my little one smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> Cleans up even the messiest baby faces leaving them moisturized and kissable :)</li>
            <li> These wipes smell absolutely great, I use them to clean my baby&#x27;s face during bath time and to get areas that are difficult to catch in a bath, the folds in his neck, his ears etc. Overall great product, expensive though.</li>
            <li> Totally love these. I usually avoid baby products with any scent, but the scent of these is just so divine - they leave my little one smelling so baby-like - sweet and edible! And they seem to agree with her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes for a quick clean while we&#x27;re on the go or even at home in a pinch.  The best part is they are not too drying.  Many regular cleansers are just too harsh for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin, however, these are perfect.</li>
            <li> I never write product reviews but had to for this product.  These wipes are amazing.  My 6-week old daughter has extremely sensitive skin and developed horrible case of baby acne.  It was all over her cheeks, chest, and back.  I tried washing her skin twice a day with a wet cloth like the doctor had suggested but it seemed to make her face red and she would break out even more.  I started reading reviews about these wipes online and decided to buy them.  After wiping down her skin twice a day with these wipes for four days her acne is almost completely gone!!!  The scent is strong but I think it smells good and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her at all.  I would definitely recommend these to any parent who has a child with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> very good product. I have been using this product since 2008 on my son. I am having it again for my coming baby. The product was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I really like all the Mustela products I&#x27;ve used so far. These cleaning cloths have a nice smell that isn&#x27;t too overpowering (unlike the Johnson and Johnson hand and face wipes I tried) and are gentle on sensitive baby skin. They are very handy to have in the diaper bag for times when you need a wipe down (especially around the eyes).  My biggest problem with these is the price. All the Mustela products are a little on the pricey side, but almost $9 for a pack of 25 wipes is a bit much.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of these facial wipes.  I use them to wipe my baby down on days that he doesn&#x27;t get a bath.</li>
            <li> These are so gentle and have helped tremendously to clear up my baby&#x27;s winter dry skin/exzema.  We use the mustela cold cream after this before bed and it usually resolves his chapped bumpy cheeks almost overnight.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes for my baby&#x27;s face.  After a long nights sleep, my baby&#x27;s eyes tend to be a little crusty in the morning and she drools constantly throughout the day, so these wipes are a great to have.  They don&#x27;t dry out the skin and smell great.  Thus far, I prefer them than any other wipes since I use them specifically for baby girl\\&quot;s face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 4 stars just due to price - they are rather expensive given there are only 25 clothes per pack.  However, they are specific for the face and not multipurpose like the others.  If 50 clothes came in a pack, I would give it 5 stars.  So, I just wait until there is a buy one and get 50% off the next purchase sale at Babies R Us.</li>
            <li> My little guy has eczema prone skin so we use the entire Mustela product line including these face wipes. They are gentle on his skin and are convenient to carry in the diaper bag when we travel. The wipes are soft and not overly wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only draw back it they do not come out very easily. But otherwise, the product is great.</li>
            <li> I have been using these cloths for more than 5 years with two kids, I cannot recommend them enough! If only they were cheaper!!</li>
            <li> Great but how many wipes can one carry around we just use the regular wipes from mustela on his face.</li>
            <li> These are great to wipe my daughter&#x27;s face when it gets messy.  They smell nice too.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because they are expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this product, soft, smells so good, my baby loved it</li>
            <li> I got these wipes in a sample kit for babies from Mustela. These wipes are great and safe. We just had a newborn and we use these wipes to clean her up when she gets messy after a feeding. These wipes are completely and absolutely safe for babies and people of all ages. They have a nice scent to them and they don&#x27;t bother the baby. We were worried about using them at first because the baby might get an allergy to it but everything was fine. They also do not dry out the babies skin, they instead refresh the skin. This is another quality product made by Mustela. We keep them in the diaper bag just in case we want to freshen the baby up. I would recommend this and any other Mustela product to anyone. Your better off spending a few extra dollars rather then having issues later with a cheaper product, not saying that all cheap products are bad, but most are.</li>
            <li> refreshing for baby&#x27;s face...Especially when you don&#x27;t have a bath time twice a day! It works great on mornings for baby.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these wipes. They clean up dirty faces easily, I even use them on myself sometimes, but what is most important is that my children don&#x27;t recoil from them the way they do other wipes. Some wipes are either too harsh or smell offensive so kids become upset when they are wiped with them -- especially on their faces. But, these wipes and gentle yet effective, and they smell DIVINE. I know scents are personal, but these really smell great. I won&#x27;t use any other kind of wipe.</li>
            <li> Those are great to have in the diaper bag or near your change pad. Has a nice and delicate scent.</li>
            <li> My husband and I work long hours, and when we pick up our kids from daycare, we sometimes struggle to get them fed, bathed, and to bed on time.  For those super hectic nights, we grab these and wipe our kids off.  It&#x27;s not as great as a bath, but they do end up clean and nice smelling.  Plus, it leaves their skin soft and not dry or chapped at all.  We tried regular wet wipes, but they don&#x27;t seem to clean as well or smell as good.</li>
            <li> I have been using these wipes for a few years now, but not for babies! They are the greatest at removing makeup at the end of the day! Soft, gentle, and don&#x27;t leave residue or smell behind! Will continue to use for a long time!</li>
            <li> Someone wrote that they used these gentle wipes to take makeup off their face. Maybe it&#x27;s not fair to give this 3 stars, since I&#x27;m sure it works great for babies, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell when I used it to take makeup off.</li>
            <li> Wipes are great but have strange after smell. I like Mustela body wash - it smells fresh. However facial cleansing cloths are not the same.</li>
            <li> These are great for milk-face and milk-neck! Gentle on my newborn&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I love mustela products,  but these made my newborn&#x27;s baby acne one million times worse.  :(</li>
            <li> Great experience and fast shipping international!!! Thanks</li>
            <li> I always have a pack of these in my purse for all those unfortunately timed spit-ups. The cloths are gentle on my daughter&#x27;s skin and smell great!</li>
            <li> I love these wipes for a quick wipe down in between my sons baths. They don&#x27;t leave his skin oily.</li>
