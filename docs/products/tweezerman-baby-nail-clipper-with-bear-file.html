            <li>This is perfect!  </li>
            <li>This nail cutter is the best one that I bought.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy though!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>These baby nail clippers are great.  </li>
            <li>and I still haven&#x27;t used the scissors so we opted for this set and it works great.</li>
            <li>The nail file works great and rounds out nicely.</li>
            <li>Still looking for a good pair of baby clippers to deal with her claws.</li>
            <li>I believe these are the best clippers available.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing price for them, even with the shipping.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s kind of pricey comparing the job done.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re cute and easy to use, and Tweezerman is a great brand... except for the big glaring problem that they simply don&#x27;t do a good job!  </li>
            <li>I ended up paid more and get the one by Piegon, that one works so much better.</li>
            <li>I tried the Safety 1st nail clippers and wasn&#x27;t pleased.</li>
            <li>This nail clipper is very cute, easy to hold, and the included nail filer is very useful, too.  </li>
            <li>Using these has been much easier than scissors would have been, so it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m pretty sure I have tried them all!)  </li>
            <li>these nail trimmers are so easy to use</li>
            <li>My son has strong, fast-growing nails and we have to use this all the time.</li>
            <li>This Tweezerman Baby Nail Clipper and Bear File is a perfect set for my little one.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for little fingers from infant to my 8 year olds who uses them herself.</li>
            <li>That one has a large, easy-to grip loop handle and nice rubber accents that allow for a reassuringly stable grip, and it clips the nails cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li>They fit so comfortably in the palm and don&#x27;t slip so you can put all your efforts toward holding baby&#x27;s hand still.</li>
            <li>It would make a sweet gift too.</li>
            <li>I returned it &amp; got full refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love these so much that I just purchased another set to give as a baby shower gift.</li>
            <li>We bought this item hoping it would be a great product like all the other Tweezerman products I have.</li>
            <li>I have a number of other Tweezerman products and have always been happy with this brand.  </li>
            <li>And, the cute teddybear design has made it clear that this is the baby&#x27;s file, so that Nana and Grandmommie don&#x27;t accidentally take it.</li>
            <li>We got the full set with our first</li>
            <li>It sits right at my nightstand</li>
            <li>Not only have they remained as sharp as when I first received them but the best thing I like about them is that when you clip a nail, the nail clipping remains (somehow) between the blades so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about the nail clippings shooting out onto baby or onto the floor or whatever.  </li>
            <li>My 5 month old now wants to \\&quot;help\\&quot; when I clip his nails because the nail clipper is bright yellow and fun to look at.</li>
            <li>even the nail file is small enough to use perfect for baby!</li>
            <li>Works well and the nail file is particularly handy to remove the sharp corners after clipping.  </li>
            <li>I was using nail scissors before and this clipper is much easier to use, although because it&#x27;s so cute looking, it was initially a distraction to my baby.</li>
            <li>I own the adult version of Tweezerman&#x27;s nail clippers and toe nail clippers, so I was expecting the baby nail clipper to be of similar quality.  </li>
            <li>The nail clipper has a comfortable grip, the clippers are sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>Also, the metal clipper part came out of the plastic casing on one of them, but it was easy to put back in and didn&#x27;t affect the performance.</li>
            <li>For those who care, there is a large label on the bottom that reads \\&quot;CHINA.\\</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the file too much but the little nail clipper is perfect for my little one.</li>
            <li>Costs a little bit more but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It actually cuts the nails instead of just lightly scoring it.  </li>
            <li>But, i expected a lot more from Tweezerman products.    </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these clippers...</li>
            <li>I really like these nail clippers.</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 of these, and one of them cut better than the other.</li>
            <li>They have worked better than any other pair I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>However, these clippers do not seem to be any better made than the $3 Red Cross brand baby clippers that I also own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other issue is the clippers slide out of the holder so easily.</li>
            <li>and I like that the file has a rough and smooth side.  </li>
            <li>However it does not do a good job to cut my newborn&#x27;s thin finger nails.  </li>
            <li>i have several nail trimmers for my son and these have a big handle and are easy to grib</li>
            <li>This is a cute nail clipper, but it&#x27;s flimsy--not up to Tweezerman&#x27;s usual high quality.</li>
            <li>Many times I have to pull a little get the unfinished part off after making one cut!</li>
            <li>However, the Tweezerman clippers seem to be just as sharp as they originally were.</li>
            <li>After using this on my newborn for no more than 3 times (no joke), the metal pin popped out and the top part flew off.  </li>
            <li>The first set lasted about a year till the plastic broke, leaving these tiny clippers.</li>
            <li>Too bad it doesn&#x27;t come in a little case like the full set but still a great deal!</li>
            <li>The clippers came out of the large yellow piece</li>
            <li>but now that he&#x27;s 6 months old they still don&#x27;t cut through the nail.  </li>
            <li>Normally I think those 1 star review people are too critical</li>
            <li>The smooth plastic handles that have been added are more difficult to grip than other baby nail clippers I&#x27;ve tried, and the metal clipper often slides out as I&#x27;m trying to maneuver them.  </li>
            <li>&quot; (I can&#x27;t find it on Amazon, but one of the major big-box baby stores carries it).  </li>
            <li>Nice small size for little fingers</li>
            <li>They were not sharp enough to cut my baby&#x27;s nails.  </li>
            <li>However, I might be unlucky as right on the first use, the cutter was broken!</li>
            <li>I needed a gentle file for my newborn&#x27;s nails because she&#x27;s too little to clip them.  </li>
            <li>It got bent after a few weeks worth of use and it constantly wormed its way loose too.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> So tiny I couldn&#x27;t use them, and I&#x27;ve got small hands!</li>
            <li> do work quite well, but no better than the other pair that were 1/3 of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has been a few months, and I am changing my rating of these clippers from 4 stars to 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> This product was sooo frustrating, especially since I had a squirming baby to deal with.  </li>
            <li> My pair cuts poorly -- leaving a sharp, somewhat crushed nail edge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of other Tweezerman products, but these clippers left me disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I recommend waiting til your little one is asleep!</li>
            <li> The handle wad too small and it would clip my baby skin as i was clipping his nails.</li>
            <li> and those ACTUALLY cut... too bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather tough to keep them in there.</li>
            <li> I found the clippers hard to grasp and didn&#x27;t make cutting my baby&#x27;s nails any easier.</li>
            <li> , this was one of those \\&quot;wasted money\\&quot; baby items :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they broke after just two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Stupid word minimum.</li>
            <li> but this nail clipper is awful.  </li>

            <li> We bought this item hoping it would be a great product like all the other Tweezerman products I have. It&#x27;s great. My son has strong, fast-growing nails and we have to use this all the time. I haven&#x27;t used the file too much but the little nail clipper is perfect for my little one.</li>
            <li> I bought these to help trim my newborn&#x27;s nails.  I found the clippers hard to grasp and didn&#x27;t make cutting my baby&#x27;s nails any easier.</li>

It actually cuts the nails instead of just lightly scoring it.  Please note that I think that it should only be used on infants 2 month and up.</li>
            <li> This is a cute nail clipper, but it&#x27;s flimsy--not up to Tweezerman&#x27;s usual high quality. The hinge that holds the clipper in place fell out during the second time I used the clipper. I recommend Tweezerman&#x27;s manicure scissors instead.</li>

The smooth plastic handles that have been added are more difficult to grip than other baby nail clippers I&#x27;ve tried, and the metal clipper often slides out as I&#x27;m trying to maneuver them.  For those who care, there is a large label on the bottom that reads \\&quot;CHINA.\\&quot;  I thought perhaps that all baby nail clippers were the same, until I tried the Summer Infant \\&quot;Dr Mom Nail Clipper Set\\&quot; (I can&#x27;t find it on Amazon, but one of the major big-box baby stores carries it).  That one has a large, easy-to grip loop handle and nice rubber accents that allow for a reassuringly stable grip, and it clips the nails cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li> Normally I think those 1 star review people are too critical but this nail clipper is awful.  The pin that holds the handle must be made of a softer metal than the clipper itself.  It got bent after a few weeks worth of use and it constantly wormed its way loose too.  Then only one side of the clipper was actually sharp enough to clip my baby&#x27;s nails... the other side would just mash it, leaving a jagged edge at times.

            <li> The nail cutter is sharper than other kinds I bought before &amp; it&#x27;s cuter too. However, I might be unlucky as right on the first use, the cutter was broken! I returned it &amp; got full refund from Amazon. I&#x27;m happy though!</li>
            <li> The nail clipper has a comfortable grip, the clippers are sharp and precise. The nail file works great and rounds out nicely.</li>
            <li> i purchased these nail clippers about 1 year ago.  Not only have they remained as sharp as when I first received them but the best thing I like about them is that when you clip a nail, the nail clipping remains (somehow) between the blades so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about the nail clippings shooting out onto baby or onto the floor or whatever.  I just clip and then shake out the nail clipping whereever I would like to place it.  I take them everywhere with me and I only use my other brand clippers as a backup.  Last week I lost these clippers so I am purchasing another one today.</li>
            <li> After using this on my newborn for no more than 3 times (no joke), the metal pin popped out and the top part flew off.  The metal pin is somewhere buried in my couch and i&#x27;m left with a non-functioning nail clipper.   Maybe it was meant to be....my baby hates getting her nails cut!  But, i expected a lot more from Tweezerman products.    Still looking for a good pair of baby clippers to deal with her claws.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is very cute, easy to hold, and the included nail filer is very useful, too.  However it does not do a good job to cut my newborn&#x27;s thin finger nails.  Many times I have to pull a little get the unfinished part off after making one cut! Plus it&#x27;s kind of pricey comparing the job done.  Not worth the money. I ended up paid more and get the one by Piegon, that one works so much better.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these, and one of them cut better than the other. One had a part of the blades that didn&#x27;t cut too well. Also, the metal clipper part came out of the plastic casing on one of them, but it was easy to put back in and didn&#x27;t affect the performance. Using these has been much easier than scissors would have been, so it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> these nail trimmers are so easy to use i have several nail trimmers for my son and these have a big handle and are easy to grib even the nail file is small enough to use perfect for baby!</li>
            <li> We bought this to use on a newborn baby girl and it does the trick!  Works well and the nail file is particularly handy to remove the sharp corners after clipping.  I have a number of other Tweezerman products and have always been happy with this brand.  Costs a little bit more but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I believe these are the best clippers available. (I&#x27;m pretty sure I have tried them all!)  They fit so comfortably in the palm and don&#x27;t slip so you can put all your efforts toward holding baby&#x27;s hand still. This is an amazing price for them, even with the shipping.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to use anything else to trim baby&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for little fingers from infant to my 8 year olds who uses them herself.</li>
            <li> Crappy plastic, but it does the job well.  I recommend waiting til your little one is asleep! Stupid word minimum.</li>
            <li> These baby nail clippers are great.  Nice small size for little fingers and I like that the file has a rough and smooth side.  My 5 month old now wants to \\&quot;help\\&quot; when I clip his nails because the nail clipper is bright yellow and fun to look at.</li>
            <li> I bought these earlier in the year to cut my daughter&#x27;s nails.  They have worked better than any other pair I&#x27;ve tried.  I love these so much that I just purchased another set to give as a baby shower gift.</li>
            <li> The baby nail clippers wasn&#x27;t what i expected to be. The handle wad too small and it would clip my baby skin as i was clipping his nails. don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> This is my second set of these. The first set lasted about a year till the plastic broke, leaving these tiny clippers. So tiny I couldn&#x27;t use them, and I&#x27;ve got small hands! Hopefully the second set lasts longer. The other issue is the clippers slide out of the holder so easily. It&#x27;s rather tough to keep them in there.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for our second child. We got the full set with our first and I still haven&#x27;t used the scissors so we opted for this set and it works great. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t come in a little case like the full set but still a great deal!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these clippers... they&#x27;re cute and easy to use, and Tweezerman is a great brand... except for the big glaring problem that they simply don&#x27;t do a good job!  They just tear my son&#x27;s nails... of course when he was a newborn I sort of expected that (soft nails) but now that he&#x27;s 6 months old they still don&#x27;t cut through the nail.  So what did I spend a bunch of money on?  A silly (but cute) nail file that I could have purchased at my local drug store for under a dollar.  A friend has the Summer Infant clippers (I don&#x27;t know why Amazon doesn&#x27;t sell them - I just picked them up at Babies R Us for under $5 - and it was a 2-pack) and those ACTUALLY cut... too bad, this was one of those \\&quot;wasted money\\&quot; baby items :(</li>
            <li> I really like these nail clippers. I tried the Safety 1st nail clippers and wasn&#x27;t pleased. The clippers came out of the large yellow piece but I still use them anyway.</li>
