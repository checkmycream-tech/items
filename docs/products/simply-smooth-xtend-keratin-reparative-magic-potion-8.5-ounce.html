            <li>It has a nice nutty smell to it.  </li>
            <li>I loved it and bought it a couple more times.</li>
            <li>This leave-in after shampoo spray is absolutely the best!!</li>
            <li>the way, THANKS FOR THE GREAT PRICE, PLEASE KEEP IT GOING!</li>
            <li>but I would caution agains overusing it for your hairs health and your own health.</li>
            <li>Bought it because a girl liked it at work.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many hair products, and this magic potion makes my hair so smooth and it smells awesome.  </li>
            <li>Its does work nicely.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery and very good price.</li>
            <li>love this stuff -- it works great to keep hair smooth and sleek</li>
            <li>It works so good that I can actually use just this in my hair without mousse and still have awesome curls with no frizz!  </li>
            <li>Very easy transaction.</li>
            <li>I love the magic potion!</li>
            <li>Over all I would say that this is a good OVERNIGHT leave in conditioner,  or good to use daytime hours, IF your going to wear your hair up :) Not a bad product by anymeans, but would not purchase again ...</li>
            <li>This is the best product.leaves your hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really smooth and smells good too.</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>Nice light coconut smell too!</li>
            <li>I think that keratin is wonderful, but if you use this product too much it can make your hair too strong</li>
            <li>I looked around for a good hair care line with parabeen and sulfate free and like what this line had top offer.  </li>
            <li>This helps make her hair very smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Great product, I used it on very long unruly hair, it worked great.</li>
            <li>One of the great things about it is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky at all like so many other anti-frizz serums but just gives it a beautiful sheen.</li>
            <li>We dont even have to use detangler when we get out of the shower, which is a huge deal!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>use on my hair and love it.</li>
            <li>Your hair will thank you :)</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>

            <li>I wish I&#x27;d purchased more to save shipping b/c</li>

            <li>I really love this product.</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>Great product, and fast shipping</li>
            <li>It is simply magic.  </li>
            <li>I do love this spray in blowdry product.</li>
            <li>I like it but don&#x27;t love it .  </li>
            <li>It IS magic.</li>
            <li>Love what this does for my hair</li>
            <li>I went to purchase more and the price had gone up</li>
            <li>It is magical.</li>
            <li>I get so many complements on how shinny my hair is..</li>
            <li>This stuff is better than magic, it&#x27;s like a miracle.  </li>
            <li>no matter how many products (or what)</li>
            <li>Helps calm my frizz and smells good too.</li>
            <li>love love love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 3 more of these because I never want to run out.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>In between shampoos, your hair look so smooth !</li>
            <li>I love this makes my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I spray about 8 pumps into the palm of my hand and spread it through, but mostly on the ends.</li>
            <li>The cost wasn&#x27;t to shabby either. :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Also recommend ordering from Amazon as the salons sell it for much more.</li>
            <li>Mostly it is unsafe for hairdressers who breath in the product all day.</li>
            <li>My hair has been more manageable and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Except that it makes my hair look healthy and behave better</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I get more complements than ever.</li>
            <li>I doubt it would be a miracle product for ALL hair types, but it sure is for mine.</li>
            <li>I have Keritin treated hair and needed a product that would be safe to use.  </li>
            <li>Also purchased the shampoo and was pleased with that as well.</li>
            <li>I have been using for 4 months thought it was awesome until my hair starting breaking off.</li>
            <li>I just love the way it makes my curls turn out.  </li>
            <li>This product was ok.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product...great for shaping the style you may want....</li>
            <li>It has to have some magic in it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this when I run out of it.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to grow there hair longer while keeping it healthy and in great condition.</li>
            <li>I absolutely fell in love with this product, works amazing!</li>

            <li>Order arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>and it works great, no other product needed.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of this from my distributor (I&#x27;m a stylist of 22 years) and I am one of those stylists that prefers clean, product free, healthy hair</li>

            <li>Huge thumbs up</li>
            <li>Control and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle for myself to take home, and when I use it, it is just as silky and smooth and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and definitely smooths my wavy stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>It is also light</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because you put it on AFTER your shower, and not only does it take out the Tangles; but it makes your hair so SHINY!  </li>
            <li>Simply smooth does make your hair feel satiny smooth.</li>
            <li>This product does help smooth and protect your hair...</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair follicles feel elastic and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My hair now feels closer to how smooth it was before my Brazilian blowout wore off.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, and it smooths out the frizzy and gives me nice defined curls.</li>
            <li>Simply Smooth doesn&#x27;t test on animals.  </li>
            <li>It locks in smooth moisture for hair that is overprocessed and frizzy in humid weather.</li>
            <li>I used this spray on my hair after washing and conditioning it with the Simply Smooth line.</li>
            <li>This product has a huge amount of keratin and too much protien can break your hair!!!</li>
            <li>This product is so good it takes the knots right out of your hair so fast</li>
            <li>still searching for the right one :)</li>
            <li>Great product - leaves my hair smooth and shiny without buildup and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>One of my new favorite products!</li>
            <li>It keeps my locks full of moisture in the arid climate in Denver and frizz free during the humid summers in Kansas City.</li>
            <li>I have to say this has truly been the difference in letting me grow my hair long and in great condition.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Originally bought at Beauty shop....</li>
            <li>This is great for people with dry, chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>Magic Potion will leave your hair soft with a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Simply Smooth Xtend Keratin Reparative Magic Potion Sodium Chloride Free, 8.5 Ounce</li>
            <li>and so far my hair is back to looking healthy and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>My Hair is very smooth and shiny and straight after blow drying.</li>
            <li>I spray 6 pumps into my hands and work it through my hair paying special attention to the ends</li>
            <li>Comb goes right through!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff... Makes my hair much smoother</li>
            <li>This product really does work magic with your hair.</li>
            <li>much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>If they ever stop making this, I want fair warning so I can buy cases of it for the future.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s good to use it only once in a while</li>
            <li>The consistency might be too thick for people with thinner hair, but it&#x27;s perfect for mine.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The sides and lower layers can dry naturally and look great, but I had to use  many products to try and get the top layers to look as soft and healthy as those, and that area has always been a problem area</li>
            <li>The results are incredible even in dry crappy New England weather!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant, but subtle and even when my hair is dry, I get compliments on how wonderful it smells.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this before in a smaller version and glad I now have more to use.  </li>
            <li>I die, bleach, hot-iron and blow-dry my hair on a regular basis and the Magic Potion spray helps keep it looking healthy.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a huge difference in my hair after the first use.  </li>
            <li>it will, i&#x27;m very satisfied and will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;silk&amp;#34; product... more of a normal hair feel.</li>
            <li>it really keeps my relaxed hair moisturized and strong.</li>
            <li>Makes blowdrying easy and fast.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair very soft &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hot iron junky, trust me, with this simply smooth and the foaming pomade, I literally go from wet to out the door.. And look damn good doing it..</li>
            <li>does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>my hair has way less knots, feels so smooth, and it also smells so good,,</li>
            <li>She says this is the only product that keeps her hair manageable - makes it easy to brush and style, helps hold style, reduces frizz, makes hair look healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, I am a hair product junkie and seem to buy new stuff before I ever finish the old stuff, always in search of the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>Smooth straight hair</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much, and it makes your hair smooth and silky with a &#x27;spring&#x27; to it.  </li>
            <li>It was so soft and shiny and smooth!  </li>
            <li>LOVE that Amazon sells this item for nearly 50% cheaper than the salons in this area.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s SO WORTH</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair incredibly soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>it did feel soft but it works better if you blow dray your hair often</li>
            <li>Makes my brittle, frizzy hair go from impossible-to-handle to soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>but this is totally worth the result.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>Worth the price too.</li>
            <li>so I tend to go through it pretty quickly, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it not to have to fight with my hair every morning.</li>
            <li>Weightless, not an overpowering smell, but works better than most other things I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>it seems like it is disappearing pretty quickly</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have long fine color treated hair</li>
            <li>this gives me the right amount of shine and volume without the frizz.</li>
            <li>I received the shipment very fast and started using it right away</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING for coarser, dry, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>It should also be mentioned that he dyed my hair too, with very intense concentrated dye</li>
            <li>I have fine naturally wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li>The salon usually charges me for a \\&quot;keratin blow dry upgrade\\&quot; that only lasts 2 days at best, so it is nice to be able to do it myself on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser turned me on to this stuff and it really does do something for my hair that no other product does- if your hair is processed it will give it a healthier, more managable feel without any sign that you have anything in your hair after stying.  </li>
            <li>First time i ever tried this i got a sample bottle from a wedding expo...</li>
            <li>Exactly what described</li>
            <li>The first time I heard about it was at my hair salon, my hair dresser used it on my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is so smooth and soft with use of this product.  </li>
            <li>My white-girl-fro was straight for 3 days!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims it</li>
            <li>It will smooth and detangle, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>It really is a &amp;#34;magic potion&amp;#34; as the label says!</li>
            <li>and I have already thanked her several times !!! -:))</li>
            <li>I fill it up with water, which help it spray better and last longer.</li>
            <li>Purchased this product for the first time.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and smooth, but not to the point that I can&#x27;t do anything with it.  </li>
            <li>I did not see much change in my hair!</li>
            <li>This product was first suggested to me in lieu of doing a Keratin Express process.  </li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t blow out your hair, it will be smooth and soft</li>
            <li>This really makes your hair smooth and easy to blow dry.  </li>
            <li>But, more than that, it holds my style for twice as long as anything I&#x27;ve used in the past (which has been many, many products, as I&#x27;m an admitted hair product junkie- just trying to find THE ONE).  </li>
            <li>He said it would make it really silky and smooth and soft</li>
            <li>This product really helps to straighten and smooth out the hair shaft, leaving your hair soft, silky and shiny - like you just had a salon blowout.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting some gray which is a whole different (and sometimes challenging)</li>
            <li>My hair, especially in the hot and humid Florida climate goes to frizz so easily.  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s offered at a pretty reasonable price point, I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>Heard about this from a friend and bought it right away because she spoke so highly of it.</li>
            <li>Transforms dry, damaged &amp; lifeless hair to smooth, shiny and bouncy hair!  </li>
            <li>and I like how this product makes it super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Do not need to use that much product to get positive results.  </li>
            <li>In the end, if you have nice hair already don&#x27;t mess it up, like I almost did.  </li>
            <li>The price on the company was very high</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;A very minimal body wave in my haur, but mostly my hair until I curl it is straight as an arrow!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different detangler products but this one really is like magic!</li>
            <li>My hair is also pretty fine, but still textured and frizzy (wavy, not curly), and this helps calm all that down.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine but usually grows very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Silky, smooth, and stronger instantly..</li>
            <li>I end the style with Simply Smooth gloss spray to get that extra shine.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use that much per time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it even though I have not done the whole treatment.</li>
            <li>LOVE Amazon and was really surprised by this info and really wish I could get my money back</li>
            <li>Does what it says, detangles in NO TIME and is gentle on children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>and my hair got so much nicer.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to have helped the damage a whole lot.</li>
            <li>Great for thin hair - bought some for me and my sister.</li>
            <li>She raved about it soo much that I had to try it as well.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does deserve to have \\&quot;magic\\&quot; in its name.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work very well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>really like this product</li>
            <li>because I went through hundreds of hair car products before I found Simply Smooth, and no going back now.</li>
            <li>This is the real product which was cheaper and arrived in three days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far and its fantastic!</li>
            <li>The magic potion leaves my long broken hair very smooth, soft, touchable, and frizz free!</li>
            <li>This product has worked well on my GF&#x27;s very full and somewhat dry hair.</li>
            <li>I use it before any other styling product more as a treatment.  </li>
            <li>The price at the beauty salons was over the top for me, so I started searching for other sources for this product.</li>
            <li>and I have to flat iron or curl my hair to make it smooth looking.</li>
            <li>the cost - our bathroom houses bottles of many other products that didn&#x27;t work as well, and it would have been easier just to buy this from the start.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and smooth, very touchable, and looks MUCH healthier than it actually is.  </li>
            <li>I only use it about once a week, but it makes my hair soft and strong.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, wavy, highly frizz prone, regularly highlighted blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless hair products and have a graveyard cupboard full of bottles.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve received many recent questions about what I&#x27;m doing differently with my hair</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly/frizzy hair that is very dry and colored.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Will now go back to my more natural, organic products and quit with the wasteful trial-and-error from buying outside of salons.</li>
            <li>I Normally purchase at Hair Salon @ $25 or So?</li>
            <li>With this I have been able to blowdry with a round brush and go.</li>
            <li>and this is light enough to use daily and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and leaves it soft and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>I only gave 4 stars simply because I have extremely fine hair</li>
            <li>I have very long fine hair and only wash every 3 days with liquid castille soap which is very clarifying.</li>
            <li>AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a new salon for my mother&#x27;s wedding, the guy did my hair there, and he used this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair super soft and shiny...barely need a flat iron at all after using.</li>
            <li>Simply Smooth company only to find out that they only sell to hair salons and online through them.</li>
            <li>I have super dry hair that is highlighted, as well, so I pour on conditioner.  </li>
            <li>left my hair smooth for several days</li>
            <li>Very concentrated so you do not need much will last for awhile.</li>
            <li>It held despite rainy weather, and humidity, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down either.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair, so I need to water it down before I spray it on my hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t willing to part with all that hair even though it was constantly knotting up and breaking off.  </li>
            <li>I have used this in the Caribbean and the hot Mid West summers.</li>
            <li>Even though this product is most likely no going to harm you, I would rather be safe than sorry.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>My hair stays clean feeling and you would never know there was anything in it other than bounce, shine and softness.</li>
            <li>it was to blow dry my curly frizzy hair that laid down smooth and straight , but what you really you can&#x27;t imagine, is the softness and shine this stuff delivers.</li>
            <li>This product is hard to find and costs more at the salon!&lt;br /&gt;Makes your hair come out sleek without feeling gummy.</li>
            <li>I found that it really only works with heat (hair dryer and/or straitening iron) - I spray just a dime size in my palm then smooth on wet hair.</li>
            <li>With just a few sprays, made my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the last person to ever buy $20 hair care products really...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I went from bleach blond for 15 yrs, to growing out my natural color from all the damage of being blond...</li>
            <li>It makes your hair incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>i am a professional with thirty years of experience...</li>
            <li>I have very curly mixed hair that some like to call kinky curly.</li>
            <li>Soft and manageable results.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural (no chemicals).</li>
            <li>If you are natural and sometimes want to straighten hair,  I recommend this product</li>
            <li>( left it feeling very straw</li>
            <li>( I have naturally wavy hair)  </li>
            <li>I bought this because my hairdresser uses it to detangle my natural hair while in transition form processed hair.</li>
            <li>Because of these two reasons I have switched to an all natural leave in conditioner that does no contain a protein.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, gives body and lift and no greasy look of feel.</li>
            <li>I have no idea what is different about this product over the hundreds I&#x27;ve tried over the years, but I don&#x27;t do reviews unless something really strikes a cord with me.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair bouncy and soft.  </li>
            <li>Frizz is controlled, and my hair feels soft and looks shinier.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy, curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and silky and helps with almost any hair problem.</li>
            <li>The product itself is OK, but not amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was suffering from MAJOR hair breakage, so she told me to give this line a try!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very expensive, especially since this bottle lasts so LONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a professional keratin treatment done a few months ago, and wanted to prolong the &#x27;investment&#x27; so did much searching, read a lot of reviews, as I wanted to purchase a product that was going to benefit my hair, and not sit in a basket with all the other misfit hair products I have purchased along the way :)  </li>
            <li>Other hair types might find it too thick or too heavy, but it&#x27;s perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>I have tried different products leaving most of them half full due to my constant search.</li>
            <li>I have found I can get the same silky smooth effect with other products that I know are safer.</li>
            <li>Using a flat iron afterwards will definately help keep your hair straight.</li>
            <li>I have super fine, thin, frizzy hair that tends to be dry (I live in the desert).</li>
            <li>My sister moved to an area where the climate is hot and dry and wanted to try something to give her hair a boost!</li>
            <li>First few times I tried it, it did make my hair very shiny and so bouncy...</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by a friend who is a professional hair stylist because I have had some major breakage.</li>
            <li>Years of trying to get the top front of my hair to lay down and \\&quot;behave\\&quot; has resulted in lots of damage, not only from coloring, but from routine flat ironing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found very few products that truly help my frizz, and very few leave-in conditioners that are hydrating enough, but Magic Potion makes a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t use as much as you might think, so I think it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>My hair was in pretty rough shape.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s NEVER made my hair feel heavy or greasy like so many other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really protects your hair from the heat of flat irons!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Such a small amount makes a HUGE difference in your hair.</li>
            <li>When my hair was completely dried it felt course, not soft or smooth,  so I ended up wearing my hair up .  </li>
            <li>Not what I expected for how much my friend raved on about.</li>
            <li>Apparently the keratin is can be unsafe to breathe in when you are blow drying with the product in your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and actually has shine too.</li>
            <li>Only need several sprays (perhaps more for thick hair).</li>
            <li>i use it every single day, reduces breakage, frizz, and split ends, makes your hair easy to manage and comb thru wet, and dry .</li>
            <li>When I want to blow dry my hair straight, I have to use this product, otherwise my hair soaks up humidity from the air and curls back up.</li>
            <li>Hard to find but ABSOLUTELY worth the effort!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now ready to try other products in their line up....</li>
            <li>and it does keep it straight without the oily feeling of some other products.</li>
            <li>Having natural curly hair, only God knows I have battled my entire life with it.  </li>
            <li>I use this product faithfully, as it helps to soften my coarse, naturally curly hair &amp; makes flat ironing my hair a smoother &amp; quicker process.</li>
            <li>i took the class and was certified to do this process and when i did it the first few times it worked well.i</li>
            <li>Based on the glowing reviews I thought this would be worth trying; I usually use cheaper products.  </li>
            <li>and if I squirt too much it can weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>I can use it when my hair is straight or curly and it never weighs it down and helps with knots and kinks.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, curly and coarse hair and have used many products that just left my hair weirdly flat and plastered to my head but</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, even for those with super long hair like me.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and do not use a lot of protein products.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It smells nice too !.</li>
            <li> Not an overbearing odor, instead quite pleasant for a hair product.</li>

            <li> It is just amazing and this is coming from someone who just wasn&#x27;t blessed with great hair.</li>

            <li> It smells good too.</li>

            <li> shipped fast and came in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> It has a nice nutty smell to it.  </li>
            <li> I loved it and bought it a couple more times.</li>
            <li> This leave-in after shampoo spray is absolutely the best!!</li>
            <li> the way, THANKS FOR THE GREAT PRICE, PLEASE KEEP IT GOING!</li>
            <li> but I would caution agains overusing it for your hairs health and your own health.</li>
            <li> Bought it because a girl liked it at work.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many hair products, and this magic potion makes my hair so smooth and it smells awesome.  </li>
            <li> Its does work nicely.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and very good price.</li>
            <li> love this stuff -- it works great to keep hair smooth and sleek</li>
            <li> It works so good that I can actually use just this in my hair without mousse and still have awesome curls with no frizz!  </li>
            <li> Very easy transaction.</li>
            <li> I love the magic potion!</li>
            <li> Over all I would say that this is a good OVERNIGHT leave in conditioner,  or good to use daytime hours, IF your going to wear your hair up :) Not a bad product by anymeans, but would not purchase again ...</li>
            <li> This is the best product.leaves your hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really smooth and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> Nice light coconut smell too!</li>
            <li> I think that keratin is wonderful, but if you use this product too much it can make your hair too strong</li>
            <li> I looked around for a good hair care line with parabeen and sulfate free and like what this line had top offer.  </li>
            <li> This helps make her hair very smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Great product, I used it on very long unruly hair, it worked great.</li>
            <li> One of the great things about it is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky at all like so many other anti-frizz serums but just gives it a beautiful sheen.</li>
            <li> We dont even have to use detangler when we get out of the shower, which is a huge deal!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> use on my hair and love it.</li>
            <li> Your hair will thank you :)</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>

            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d purchased more to save shipping b/c</li>

            <li> I really love this product.</li>

            <li> I do love this spray in blowdry product.</li>
            <li> I like it but don&#x27;t love it .  </li>
            <li> It IS magic.</li>
            <li> Love what this does for my hair</li>
            <li> I went to purchase more and the price had gone up</li>
            <li> It is magical.</li>
            <li> I get so many complements on how shinny my hair is..</li>
            <li> This stuff is better than magic, it&#x27;s like a miracle.  </li>
            <li> no matter how many products (or what)</li>
            <li> Helps calm my frizz and smells good too.</li>
            <li> love love love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 more of these because I never want to run out.</li>
            <li> This is actually magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> In between shampoos, your hair look so smooth !</li>
            <li> I love this makes my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I spray about 8 pumps into the palm of my hand and spread it through, but mostly on the ends.</li>
            <li> The cost wasn&#x27;t to shabby either. :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> Also recommend ordering from Amazon as the salons sell it for much more.</li>
            <li> Mostly it is unsafe for hairdressers who breath in the product all day.</li>
            <li> My hair has been more manageable and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Except that it makes my hair look healthy and behave better</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I get more complements than ever.</li>
            <li> I doubt it would be a miracle product for ALL hair types, but it sure is for mine.</li>
            <li> I have Keritin treated hair and needed a product that would be safe to use.  </li>
            <li> Also purchased the shampoo and was pleased with that as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 4 months thought it was awesome until my hair starting breaking off.</li>
            <li> I just love the way it makes my curls turn out.  </li>
            <li> This product was ok.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product...great for shaping the style you may want....</li>
            <li> It has to have some magic in it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this when I run out of it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to grow there hair longer while keeping it healthy and in great condition.</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this product, works amazing!</li>

            <li> I bought a bottle for myself to take home, and when I use it, it is just as silky and smooth and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and definitely smooths my wavy stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> It is also light</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great because you put it on AFTER your shower, and not only does it take out the Tangles; but it makes your hair so SHINY!  </li>
            <li> Simply smooth does make your hair feel satiny smooth.</li>
            <li> This product does help smooth and protect your hair...</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair follicles feel elastic and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My hair now feels closer to how smooth it was before my Brazilian blowout wore off.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, and it smooths out the frizzy and gives me nice defined curls.</li>
            <li> Simply Smooth doesn&#x27;t test on animals.  </li>
            <li> It locks in smooth moisture for hair that is overprocessed and frizzy in humid weather.</li>
            <li> I used this spray on my hair after washing and conditioning it with the Simply Smooth line.</li>
            <li> This product has a huge amount of keratin and too much protien can break your hair!!!</li>
            <li> This product is so good it takes the knots right out of your hair so fast</li>
            <li> still searching for the right one :)</li>
            <li> Great product - leaves my hair smooth and shiny without buildup and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> One of my new favorite products!</li>
            <li> It keeps my locks full of moisture in the arid climate in Denver and frizz free during the humid summers in Kansas City.</li>
            <li> I have to say this has truly been the difference in letting me grow my hair long and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Originally bought at Beauty shop....</li>
            <li> This is great for people with dry, chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> Magic Potion will leave your hair soft with a healthy shine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Simply Smooth Xtend Keratin Reparative Magic Potion Sodium Chloride Free, 8.5 Ounce</li>
            <li> and so far my hair is back to looking healthy and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> My Hair is very smooth and shiny and straight after blow drying.</li>
            <li> I spray 6 pumps into my hands and work it through my hair paying special attention to the ends</li>
            <li> Comb goes right through!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... Makes my hair much smoother</li>
            <li> This product really does work magic with your hair.</li>
            <li> much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> If they ever stop making this, I want fair warning so I can buy cases of it for the future.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s good to use it only once in a while</li>
            <li> The consistency might be too thick for people with thinner hair, but it&#x27;s perfect for mine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The sides and lower layers can dry naturally and look great, but I had to use  many products to try and get the top layers to look as soft and healthy as those, and that area has always been a problem area</li>
            <li> The results are incredible even in dry crappy New England weather!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pleasant, but subtle and even when my hair is dry, I get compliments on how wonderful it smells.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this before in a smaller version and glad I now have more to use.  </li>
            <li> I die, bleach, hot-iron and blow-dry my hair on a regular basis and the Magic Potion spray helps keep it looking healthy.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a huge difference in my hair after the first use.  </li>
            <li> it will, i&#x27;m very satisfied and will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;silk&amp;#34; product... more of a normal hair feel.</li>
            <li> it really keeps my relaxed hair moisturized and strong.</li>
            <li> Makes blowdrying easy and fast.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair very soft &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hot iron junky, trust me, with this simply smooth and the foaming pomade, I literally go from wet to out the door.. And look damn good doing it..</li>
            <li> does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> my hair has way less knots, feels so smooth, and it also smells so good,,</li>
            <li> She says this is the only product that keeps her hair manageable - makes it easy to brush and style, helps hold style, reduces frizz, makes hair look healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, I am a hair product junkie and seem to buy new stuff before I ever finish the old stuff, always in search of the next best thing.  </li>
            <li> Smooth straight hair</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much, and it makes your hair smooth and silky with a &#x27;spring&#x27; to it.  </li>
            <li> It was so soft and shiny and smooth!  </li>
            <li> LOVE that Amazon sells this item for nearly 50% cheaper than the salons in this area.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s SO WORTH</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is by far my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair incredibly soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> it did feel soft but it works better if you blow dray your hair often</li>
            <li> Makes my brittle, frizzy hair go from impossible-to-handle to soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> but this is totally worth the result.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> Worth the price too.</li>
            <li> so I tend to go through it pretty quickly, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it not to have to fight with my hair every morning.</li>
            <li> Weightless, not an overpowering smell, but works better than most other things I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> it seems like it is disappearing pretty quickly</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have long fine color treated hair</li>
            <li> this gives me the right amount of shine and volume without the frizz.</li>
            <li> I received the shipment very fast and started using it right away</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING for coarser, dry, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> It should also be mentioned that he dyed my hair too, with very intense concentrated dye</li>
            <li> I have fine naturally wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> The salon usually charges me for a \\&quot;keratin blow dry upgrade\\&quot; that only lasts 2 days at best, so it is nice to be able to do it myself on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this stuff and it really does do something for my hair that no other product does- if your hair is processed it will give it a healthier, more managable feel without any sign that you have anything in your hair after stying.  </li>
            <li> First time i ever tried this i got a sample bottle from a wedding expo...</li>
            <li> Exactly what described</li>
            <li> The first time I heard about it was at my hair salon, my hair dresser used it on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so smooth and soft with use of this product.  </li>
            <li> My white-girl-fro was straight for 3 days!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims it</li>
            <li> It will smooth and detangle, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It really is a &amp;#34;magic potion&amp;#34; as the label says!</li>
            <li> and I have already thanked her several times !!! -:))</li>
            <li> I fill it up with water, which help it spray better and last longer.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for the first time.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and smooth, but not to the point that I can&#x27;t do anything with it.  </li>
            <li> I did not see much change in my hair!</li>
            <li> This product was first suggested to me in lieu of doing a Keratin Express process.  </li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t blow out your hair, it will be smooth and soft</li>
            <li> This really makes your hair smooth and easy to blow dry.  </li>
            <li> But, more than that, it holds my style for twice as long as anything I&#x27;ve used in the past (which has been many, many products, as I&#x27;m an admitted hair product junkie- just trying to find THE ONE).  </li>
            <li> He said it would make it really silky and smooth and soft</li>
            <li> This product really helps to straighten and smooth out the hair shaft, leaving your hair soft, silky and shiny - like you just had a salon blowout.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting some gray which is a whole different (and sometimes challenging)</li>
            <li> My hair, especially in the hot and humid Florida climate goes to frizz so easily.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s offered at a pretty reasonable price point, I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Heard about this from a friend and bought it right away because she spoke so highly of it.</li>
            <li> Transforms dry, damaged &amp; lifeless hair to smooth, shiny and bouncy hair!  </li>
            <li> and I like how this product makes it super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Do not need to use that much product to get positive results.  </li>
            <li> In the end, if you have nice hair already don&#x27;t mess it up, like I almost did.  </li>
            <li> The price on the company was very high</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;A very minimal body wave in my haur, but mostly my hair until I curl it is straight as an arrow!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different detangler products but this one really is like magic!</li>
            <li> My hair is also pretty fine, but still textured and frizzy (wavy, not curly), and this helps calm all that down.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine but usually grows very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Silky, smooth, and stronger instantly..</li>
            <li> I end the style with Simply Smooth gloss spray to get that extra shine.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use that much per time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it even though I have not done the whole treatment.</li>
            <li> LOVE Amazon and was really surprised by this info and really wish I could get my money back</li>
            <li> Does what it says, detangles in NO TIME and is gentle on children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> and my hair got so much nicer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to have helped the damage a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Great for thin hair - bought some for me and my sister.</li>
            <li> She raved about it soo much that I had to try it as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does deserve to have \\&quot;magic\\&quot; in its name.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work very well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> really like this product</li>
            <li> because I went through hundreds of hair car products before I found Simply Smooth, and no going back now.</li>
            <li> This is the real product which was cheaper and arrived in three days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far and its fantastic!</li>
            <li> The magic potion leaves my long broken hair very smooth, soft, touchable, and frizz free!</li>
            <li> This product has worked well on my GF&#x27;s very full and somewhat dry hair.</li>
            <li> I use it before any other styling product more as a treatment.  </li>
            <li> The price at the beauty salons was over the top for me, so I started searching for other sources for this product.</li>
            <li> and I have to flat iron or curl my hair to make it smooth looking.</li>
            <li> the cost - our bathroom houses bottles of many other products that didn&#x27;t work as well, and it would have been easier just to buy this from the start.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and smooth, very touchable, and looks MUCH healthier than it actually is.  </li>
            <li> I only use it about once a week, but it makes my hair soft and strong.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, wavy, highly frizz prone, regularly highlighted blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless hair products and have a graveyard cupboard full of bottles.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve received many recent questions about what I&#x27;m doing differently with my hair</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly/frizzy hair that is very dry and colored.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Will now go back to my more natural, organic products and quit with the wasteful trial-and-error from buying outside of salons.</li>
            <li> I Normally purchase at Hair Salon @ $25 or So?</li>
            <li> With this I have been able to blowdry with a round brush and go.</li>
            <li> and this is light enough to use daily and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and leaves it soft and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars simply because I have extremely fine hair</li>
            <li> I have very long fine hair and only wash every 3 days with liquid castille soap which is very clarifying.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a new salon for my mother&#x27;s wedding, the guy did my hair there, and he used this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair super soft and shiny...barely need a flat iron at all after using.</li>
            <li> Simply Smooth company only to find out that they only sell to hair salons and online through them.</li>
            <li> I have super dry hair that is highlighted, as well, so I pour on conditioner.  </li>
            <li> left my hair smooth for several days</li>
            <li> Very concentrated so you do not need much will last for awhile.</li>
            <li> It held despite rainy weather, and humidity, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down either.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair, so I need to water it down before I spray it on my hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t willing to part with all that hair even though it was constantly knotting up and breaking off.  </li>
            <li> I have used this in the Caribbean and the hot Mid West summers.</li>
            <li> Even though this product is most likely no going to harm you, I would rather be safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> My hair stays clean feeling and you would never know there was anything in it other than bounce, shine and softness.</li>
            <li> it was to blow dry my curly frizzy hair that laid down smooth and straight , but what you really you can&#x27;t imagine, is the softness and shine this stuff delivers.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find and costs more at the salon!&lt;br /&gt;Makes your hair come out sleek without feeling gummy.</li>
            <li> I found that it really only works with heat (hair dryer and/or straitening iron) - I spray just a dime size in my palm then smooth on wet hair.</li>
            <li> With just a few sprays, made my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the last person to ever buy $20 hair care products really...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I went from bleach blond for 15 yrs, to growing out my natural color from all the damage of being blond...</li>
            <li> It makes your hair incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> i am a professional with thirty years of experience...</li>
            <li> I have very curly mixed hair that some like to call kinky curly.</li>
            <li> Soft and manageable results.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural (no chemicals).</li>
            <li> If you are natural and sometimes want to straighten hair,  I recommend this product</li>
            <li> ( left it feeling very straw</li>
            <li> ( I have naturally wavy hair)  </li>
            <li> I bought this because my hairdresser uses it to detangle my natural hair while in transition form processed hair.</li>
            <li> Because of these two reasons I have switched to an all natural leave in conditioner that does no contain a protein.</li>
            <li> Not heavy, gives body and lift and no greasy look of feel.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what is different about this product over the hundreds I&#x27;ve tried over the years, but I don&#x27;t do reviews unless something really strikes a cord with me.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair bouncy and soft.  </li>
            <li> Frizz is controlled, and my hair feels soft and looks shinier.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and silky and helps with almost any hair problem.</li>
            <li> The product itself is OK, but not amazing.  </li>
            <li> I was suffering from MAJOR hair breakage, so she told me to give this line a try!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very expensive, especially since this bottle lasts so LONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a professional keratin treatment done a few months ago, and wanted to prolong the &#x27;investment&#x27; so did much searching, read a lot of reviews, as I wanted to purchase a product that was going to benefit my hair, and not sit in a basket with all the other misfit hair products I have purchased along the way :)  </li>
            <li> Other hair types might find it too thick or too heavy, but it&#x27;s perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried different products leaving most of them half full due to my constant search.</li>
            <li> I have found I can get the same silky smooth effect with other products that I know are safer.</li>
            <li> Using a flat iron afterwards will definately help keep your hair straight.</li>
            <li> I have super fine, thin, frizzy hair that tends to be dry (I live in the desert).</li>
            <li> My sister moved to an area where the climate is hot and dry and wanted to try something to give her hair a boost!</li>
            <li> First few times I tried it, it did make my hair very shiny and so bouncy...</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who is a professional hair stylist because I have had some major breakage.</li>
            <li> Years of trying to get the top front of my hair to lay down and \\&quot;behave\\&quot; has resulted in lots of damage, not only from coloring, but from routine flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found very few products that truly help my frizz, and very few leave-in conditioners that are hydrating enough, but Magic Potion makes a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t use as much as you might think, so I think it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> My hair was in pretty rough shape.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NEVER made my hair feel heavy or greasy like so many other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really protects your hair from the heat of flat irons!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Such a small amount makes a HUGE difference in your hair.</li>
            <li> When my hair was completely dried it felt course, not soft or smooth,  so I ended up wearing my hair up .  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected for how much my friend raved on about.</li>
            <li> Apparently the keratin is can be unsafe to breathe in when you are blow drying with the product in your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and actually has shine too.</li>
            <li> Only need several sprays (perhaps more for thick hair).</li>
            <li> i use it every single day, reduces breakage, frizz, and split ends, makes your hair easy to manage and comb thru wet, and dry .</li>
            <li> When I want to blow dry my hair straight, I have to use this product, otherwise my hair soaks up humidity from the air and curls back up.</li>
            <li> Hard to find but ABSOLUTELY worth the effort!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now ready to try other products in their line up....</li>
            <li> and it does keep it straight without the oily feeling of some other products.</li>
            <li> Having natural curly hair, only God knows I have battled my entire life with it.  </li>
            <li> I use this product faithfully, as it helps to soften my coarse, naturally curly hair &amp; makes flat ironing my hair a smoother &amp; quicker process.</li>
            <li> i took the class and was certified to do this process and when i did it the first few times it worked well.i</li>
            <li> Based on the glowing reviews I thought this would be worth trying; I usually use cheaper products.  </li>
            <li> and if I squirt too much it can weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I can use it when my hair is straight or curly and it never weighs it down and helps with knots and kinks.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly and coarse hair and have used many products that just left my hair weirdly flat and plastered to my head but</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, even for those with super long hair like me.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and do not use a lot of protein products.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely long (down to my butt) and very curly.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and use this product directly after towel drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only product that smooths and straightens my hair when used with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Price is a little high though I thought.</li>
            <li> like / not smooth and soft ) and then letting my hair dry naturally</li>
            <li> I did question using Keratin on natural hair- good or a bad thing!</li>
            <li> It stays straight for days with just a small touch up after sleeping.  </li>
            <li> Following her shampoo, and condition; I simply spray a bit of this into her hair, get the wide tooth comb, and within a couple of minutes her entire head is combed from root to end.</li>
            <li> Her hair is fried from flat iron use...</li>
            <li> It held my style for 4-5 days, instead of having to flat iron it</li>
            <li> It DOES LAST A LONG TIME (U do not use a lot).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it also when I was putting dry hair up, and it never leaves it greasy or gross looking.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse, dry, and frizzy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a wide spray, but just a sharp stream.  </li>
            <li> The products are more expensive than other shampoos</li>
            <li> I tried blow-drying, flat ironing and just letting it air dry.</li>
            <li> You can hardly use too much.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and this does not weigh it down or make it appear greasy.</li>
            <li> Alittle bit goes long way</li>
            <li> used it for years but ran out of it and couldn&#x27;t find it locally but kept the empty bottle.</li>
            <li> Made my hair sticky, not soft</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it, so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length and with this product it is a breeze to comb through my wet hair, tangles simply disappear.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> You spray it on wet hair and while it says only 4-5 sprays I use about 10 -15</li>
            <li> I blow dry my long hair, and feel this product makes the task easier.</li>
            <li> I used to be addicted to this product, it made my thick course hair very smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> I checked around town and found other prices are just about the same!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a leave-in conditioner or other smoothing-type product, you should definitely try this.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use anything with alcohol in my hair because it&#x27;s too dry</li>
            <li> and it always feels brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> i now can not live without this product.</li>
            <li> Like this a lot for after shampooing  and conditioning I like to use this on my wet  hair to wrap or flat iron, I only used it for two and a half weeks too.</li>
            <li> I have even turned the bottle upside down trying to drain it to the last drop.</li>
            <li> This can be used on your hair just wet from the shower, or when it&#x27;s mostly dry.</li>
            <li> Apply to wet hair before blow dry.</li>
            <li> My hair feels, looks, and stays much less frizzy for several days.</li>
            <li> Have tried it both on wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Her hair has always been very dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> So, often times I&#x27;ll just pour a little into my hands and work it through that way, but it works the same regardless.  </li>
            <li> You only need very little to go a long way.</li>
            <li> recently did two clients and they later complained that it didnt work well....</li>
            <li> No real shine, just makes it wavy, with no body.  </li>
            <li> absolutely no breakage.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday, but several times a weeks seems to help.</li>
            <li> Can be used daily with just a few sprays.</li>
            <li> Use in wet hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li> just blow drying it with a round brush or using the flat iron too.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> mother in law actually recommended this product to me, as I have always had a hard time brushing my hair after washing and keeping my curls neat when I dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it with alot of other stuff.</li>
            <li> Now I use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> every other.....</li>
            <li> and I have never found any other leave-in conditioner that has helped at all.  </li>
            <li> I use four sprays in the palm of my hands and work it through one side of my hair, and then four sprays for the other side.</li>
            <li> I am going to invest in other products in this line as I run out of what I am using.</li>
            <li> I towel dry my hair, spray it with a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using 5-6 pumps after each wash on towel dried hair now that hair is a little longer, mid length.</li>
            <li> and i urge all of you to be very careful with this product.</li>
            <li> I use a few spritzes in my hands and rub in like a cream and comb in with a wide-toothed comb, let it air dry</li>
            <li> I use it after showering and just apply a few sprays, and I just let it air dry.</li>
            <li> My hair (thick and slightly coarse) felt no different than usual after using this.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick product, so I would suggest spritzing it into your hand and then applying it to your hair instead of spraying it directly to the head.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Simply Smooth,\\&quot; comb it through and style and there are no more little frizzy ends standing up anywhere.</li>
            <li> However, if you lighten your hair...it will affect the color and make blonde hair look brassy and dull.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been addicted ever since,  My hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> After I have shampooed and conditioned and  combed my hair out, I flip my head down and work it into my roots to the ends.</li>
            <li> This product does not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> This does not weigh the hair down but makes it feel smoother and healthier.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and works whether I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Not too greasy and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel coated or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use any other product again!</li>
            <li> My hair is still damaged but this product is definitely helping do some serious damage control.  </li>
            <li> then i coat my ends and hairline with jamaican black castor oil.</li>
            <li> but I noticed that I shampoo less now (twice a week).</li>
            <li> Product will cut drying time in half.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t put too much on, a little dab will do ya with this product, and results are immediate..</li>
            <li> just a little and smooths your hair</li>
            <li> I can pick my little afro out without pain now for this products softens it and detangles.</li>
            <li> smell of this product is a little beachy, as it smells like coconut but not too harsh or off-putting.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to someone with hair like mine, as it is not too heavy for someone with very thick hair.</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago I over-processed my hair and essentially killed all but maybe 3 inches of it.  </li>
            <li> I have thick and rough textured hair.</li>
            <li> I used it on towel dried hair and distribute it using my fingers.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist introduced me to this product, after using the product just a few times I can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> product doesnt work, could possibly make things worse.</li>
            <li> As my hair &#x27;air dried&#x27; the ends still became frizzy/fly away.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair feel heavy ...</li>
            <li> so harsh and so dead feeling..  </li>
            <li> I put it in my towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a few years now.</li>
            <li> It never leaves my hair sticky, stiff or greasy looking.</li>
            <li> (and I have very very thick, long hair)</li>
            <li> Hard to find a &amp;#34;LEAVE IN&amp;#34; that does not weigh your hair down...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little thick for styling.  </li>
            <li> I spray 3 sprays into the palm of my hand and then apply to my hair (approx 4 inches past shoulders)</li>
            <li> I hope I am wrong or was given the incorrect information but according to them their items are ONLY sold online through them.&lt;br /&gt;call</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair past my shoulders and I use three pump sprays into the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> Then  you comb it through and style as usual .</li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> and I stopped, started putting heavy moisturizing balms and oils to liven it up!  </li>
            <li> and I went to theme part this past weekend</li>
            <li> My hair would never grow past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s VERY heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and slightly wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Although its a spray bottle, I find the potion a little too thick to spray on, so I just spray into my hands &amp; then run it through my hair!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s hard to get all over your hair.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find elsewhere, this is just what my wife wanted</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair dull or greasy either.</li>
            <li> Now it has grown at least 1/2 inch since I began using it.  </li>
            <li> but I am too late and it was my mistake</li>
            <li> It basically takes care of any &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; hair issues, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I prefer thinner oils for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> now it is about 6 inches past!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical until he was done, and my hair felt like down feathers.  </li>
            <li> , I was a bit worried that it would dry out and become unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> smell is overpowering and not entirely pleasant.</li>
            <li> Have order this at least three times!</li>
            <li> She has very thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> because I have very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for approximately two years.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted to this product.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> This helps with frizz like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tired.  </li>
            <li> you DEFINITELY WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> A little disappointed with the sprayer gets all over the place.</li>
            <li> The weird thing is my hair stays in place but feels like there is nothing holding it.</li>
            <li> Leaves a weird feeling in my hair.</li>
            <li> ,i was treated very poorly by customer service and they basically told me i was out of luck</li>
            <li> Has helped me change my hairstyle, which I thought was impossible.</li>
            <li> i called the distributor and found out i got a bad batch of the product</li>
            <li> This has to have been a bad knock-off.  </li>
            <li> and I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate using chemicals</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I use it with alot of other stuff.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Have order this at least three times! Works great! Would recommend for all! Alittle bit goes long way</li>
            <li> Great product, I used it on very long unruly hair, it worked great. Control and tangle free. It smells great too.</li>
            <li> My Hair is very smooth and shiny and straight after blow drying. Using a flat iron afterwards will definately help keep your hair straight. I did go out into the humidity and my hair got frizzy, so quite honesly I don&#x27;t think anything will work in the humid air.</li>
            <li> First time i ever tried this i got a sample bottle from a wedding expo... this product is AMAZING! it does everything... my hair has way less knots, feels so smooth, and it also smells so good,,, i use it all the time!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product.leaves your hair soft and shiny&lt;br /&gt;I used it for years but ran out of it and couldn&#x27;t find it locally but kept the empty bottle. Just recently I found it and ordered it on line.&lt;br /&gt;Great price !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the last person to ever buy $20 hair care products really... but this stuff is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a new salon for my mother&#x27;s wedding, the guy did my hair there, and he used this stuff.  It should also be mentioned that he dyed my hair too, with very intense concentrated dye, I was a bit worried that it would dry out and become unpleasant.  He said it would make it really silky and smooth and soft and I didn&#x27;t even have to use it every day, I could use it once or twice a week and it would keep it that way.  I was skeptical until he was done, and my hair felt like down feathers.  It was so soft and shiny and smooth!  I bought a bottle for myself to take home, and when I use it, it is just as silky and smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t use as much as you might think, so I think it lasts a long time.  I love it its a GREAT product, a must have for people with dry, frizzy, dyed hair.</li>
            <li> use on my hair and love it. I found it when my hairdresser used it on my hair and loved the product.</li>
            <li> Great value. Exactly what described</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what anyone sees in this overpriced junk!  It made my already wavy hair look like I just came in from the rain--honestly!  No real shine, just makes it wavy, with no body.  Nightmare--don&#x27;t bother ordering.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Protects hair well!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered in a timely manner.  I use this product faithfully, as it helps to soften my coarse, naturally curly hair &amp; makes flat ironing my hair a smoother &amp; quicker process.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  My hair is fine but usually grows very quickly.  About 2 years ago I over-processed my hair and essentially killed all but maybe 3 inches of it.  I wasn&#x27;t willing to part with all that hair even though it was constantly knotting up and breaking off.  After some research and reading countless reviews, I took a chance on this product.  Within a couple weeks there was a noticeable difference in my hair.  Now it has grown at least 1/2 inch since I began using it.  I wash my hair every other day and use this product directly after towel drying my hair.  I also use a deep moisturizing conditioner and leave it on for a couple minutes before rinsing.  My hair is still damaged but this product is definitely helping do some serious damage control.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> LOVE that Amazon sells this item for nearly 50% cheaper than the salons in this area. My daughter has a very full head of hair with curls that are out of this world. Following her shampoo, and condition; I simply spray a bit of this into her hair, get the wide tooth comb, and within a couple of minutes her entire head is combed from root to end. Love.this.stuff!!</li>
            <li> Made my hair sticky, not soft</li>
            <li> Bought it at my wife&#x27;s request for her.  She swears by it.</li>
            <li> This product is so good it takes the knots right out of your hair so fast</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t boasting without reason when they call it &amp;#34;magic potion&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t put too much on, a little dab will do ya with this product, and results are immediate.. Silky, smooth, and stronger instantly..&lt;br /&gt;I went from bleach blond for 15 yrs, to growing out my natural color from all the damage of being blond... This is a miracle product!!! Also try paul Mitchell foaming pomade to help ease frizz.. I&#x27;m a hot iron junky, trust me, with this simply smooth and the foaming pomade, I literally go from wet to out the door.. And look damn good doing it.. Finally!!!&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, it&#x27;s SO WORTH IT!!! Your hair will thank you :)</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that gets tangled easily. I&#x27;ve tried several different detangler products but this one really is like magic! I use it every day so I tend to go through it pretty quickly, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it not to have to fight with my hair every morning. It smells great and will leave your hair silky smooth as well. LOVE.</li>
            <li> I love this product - it is truly a magic potion.  It makes your hair incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> i have purchased my second bottle of this. it really keeps my relaxed hair moisturized and strong. absolutely no breakage. i use about 10 pumps into my palm and spread it throughout my hair. then i coat my ends and hairline with jamaican black castor oil. it&#x27;s so worth the price.</li>
            <li> i am a professional with thirty years of experience...i took the class and was certified to do this process and when i did it the first few times it worked well.i recently did two clients and they later complained that it didnt work well....i called the distributor and found out i got a bad batch of the product and i immediately contacted the manufacturer,i was treated very poorly by customer service and they basically told me i was out of luck and they would do nothing for me....i will NEVER buy any products from this company again and i urge all of you to be very careful with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and definitely smooths my wavy stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly mixed hair that some like to call kinky curly. When I want to blow dry my hair straight, I have to use this product, otherwise my hair soaks up humidity from the air and curls back up. I have used this in the Caribbean and the hot Mid West summers. The results always please me. I do have to use a lot of product, but even so the bottle lasts me several months. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product. It is by far my favorite hair product. The first time I heard about it was at my hair salon, my hair dresser used it on my hair. The smell is amazing &amp; it works perfect for curly/wavy frizzy hair! It prevented humidity from doing anything to my hair when drug store brands just make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I have thick and rough textured hair. This magic potion works like magic on my hair. I used it on towel dried hair and distribute it using my fingers. A little bit goes a long way. The hair feels softer for days until the next wash. I wash using Simply Smooth Replenishing Shampoo and Conditioner, which are great too. The products are more expensive than other shampoos but I noticed that I shampoo less now (twice a week). I dont get the \\&quot;oil-dirty\\&quot; feeling for days. I end the style with Simply Smooth gloss spray to get that extra shine.</li>
            <li> One of the greatest products ever &amp; easy to use. Don&#x27;t have to spend hundreds of dollars on Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist introduced me to this product, after using the product just a few times I can tell the difference. If your hair is chemically treated and you also use heat on your hair, if definatley works. Best investment in hair product.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who is a professional hair stylist because I have had some major breakage. This product is definitely helping to restore the luster in my hair. It is a very thick product, so I would suggest spritzing it into your hand and then applying it to your hair instead of spraying it directly to the head.</li>
            <li> I used this product when I went to my niece&#x27;s wedding and was complaining about my hair being unmanageable.  My sister in law handed me this product, I liked the scent and the name b/c it addressed my recent frustrations with my hair, and I gave it a try.  I&#x27;m getting some gray which is a whole different (and sometimes challenging) texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. I towel dry my hair, spray it with a little \\&quot;Simply Smooth,\\&quot; comb it through and style and there are no more little frizzy ends standing up anywhere. It is also light so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I wish I&#x27;d purchased more to save shipping b/c it seems like it is disappearing pretty quickly and I don&#x27;t use that much per time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend giving it a try if you are looking for a smoother finish - I&#x27;ve received many recent questions about what I&#x27;m doing differently with my hair and this is the ONLY change.</li>
            <li> Used it for a while didn&#x27;t see any result.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so nice! 2nd time buying it! Saves it from the heat of the blow dryer and frizz :)</li>
            <li> This is an a mazing product. I use it even though I have not done the whole treatment. It eaves my hair sof, hydrated, shiny and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing and detangling. I really love this product. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it, so the bottle lasts a long time. Great price also.</li>
            <li> This product definitely lives up to its name! I&#x27;ve never had a product make me actually WANT to do my hair! I even use it on my 5 yr olds hair, with ease (she has my hair to the T)! We dont even have to use detangler when we get out of the shower, which is a huge deal! I&#x27;ll never use any other product again!</li>
            <li> Based on the glowing reviews I thought this would be worth trying; I usually use cheaper products.  What a waste of money. My hair (thick and slightly coarse) felt no different than usual after using this. I tried blow-drying, flat ironing and just letting it air dry.</li>
            <li> I was just introduced to this product last week when having my haircut.  I spray 3 sprays into the palm of my hand and then apply to my hair (approx 4 inches past shoulders)..and it works great, no other product needed.  I also have my daughter using it.  Her hair is fried from flat iron use...this product def makes a difference, adding shine and smoothing frizzy ends...It is cheaper on this site by $9 compared to what i paid in the shop.</li>
            <li> This product is a part of my regular rotation of hair care.  It keeps my hair shiny and smooth.  It extends the keratin treatment smells like a tropical vacation.</li>
            <li> I have super fine, thin, frizzy hair that tends to be dry (I live in the desert). This stuff makes my hair soft, smooth, shiny, and awesome. A little bit goes a long way, even for those with super long hair like me. This can be used on your hair just wet from the shower, or when it&#x27;s mostly dry. I&#x27;ve used it also when I was putting dry hair up, and it never leaves it greasy or gross looking. Huge thumbs up, I&#x27;m a big fan and will DEFINITELY buy this again when I use up this bottle I have now!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Repeat purchase. Soft and manageable results. Not an overbearing odor, instead quite pleasant for a hair product. Very good value. I use on my beard. Does a great job.</li>
            <li> This product is WONDERFUL for your hair!  I was introduced to it by my Hair Stylist.  It&#x27;s great because you put it on AFTER your shower, and not only does it take out the Tangles; but it makes your hair so SHINY!  You&#x27;ll absolutely LOVE IT!  It&#x27;s not very expensive, especially since this bottle lasts so LONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for approximately two years.  It&#x27;s NEVER made my hair feel heavy or greasy like so many other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, I&#x27;ve always had&lt;br /&gt;A very minimal body wave in my haur, but mostly my hair until I curl it is straight as an arrow!  Now I have actual curls all over the back and even some on the sides.  I can blow them out with my curling brush or a curling iron, but at 59 I think it&#x27;s GOT to be this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course that&#x27;s my theory, the bottle doesn&#x27;t state that, but I just can&#x27;t think of any thing else!  BUY THIS PRODUCT you DEFINITELY WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I cannot use anything with alcohol in my hair because it&#x27;s too dry this gives me the right amount of shine and volume without the frizz. I&#x27;m probably on my 20th bottle. Love it</li>
            <li> Great smoothing and straightening product</li>
            <li> I looked around for a good hair care line with parabeen and sulfate free and like what this line had top offer.  The price on the company was very high and I ordered it from here which offered a relatively good price. I received the shipment very fast and started using it right away and it did NOTHING like it described. I called American culture/Simply Smooth company only to find out that they only sell to hair salons and online through them. I hope I am wrong or was given the incorrect information but according to them their items are ONLY sold online through them.&lt;br /&gt;call the company that the name is on the bottle and double check before you order from any where else&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE Amazon and was really surprised by this info and really wish I could get my money back but I am too late and it was my mistake</li>
            <li> Does what it says, detangles in NO TIME and is gentle on children&#x27;s hair. Has caused no skin irritations either.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now and I will never use anything else ever again! This stuff is seriously amazing. It has everything you want all in one formula. My hair is extremely long (down to my butt) and very curly. It keeps my locks full of moisture in the arid climate in Denver and frizz free during the humid summers in Kansas City. I always get compliments on how healthy my hair looks and it is because of this product!</li>
            <li> My daughter recommend  this potion so that my hair would smooth out, This stuff leaves my hair smooth and full of body! I love it! I like all of their products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome - great leave in conditioner/heat protector for hair.  Weightless, not an overpowering smell, but works better than most other things I&#x27;ve tried. The spray nozzle tends to get mucked up - I&#x27;ve gone through several bottles.  So, often times I&#x27;ll just pour a little into my hands and work it through that way, but it works the same regardless.  I have super dry hair that is highlighted, as well, so I pour on conditioner.  My hair is also pretty fine, but still textured and frizzy (wavy, not curly), and this helps calm all that down.  It&#x27;s not a frizz killer, but it does help moisturize everything.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend.  Boy am I glad I tried it!!  My hair was in pretty rough shape.  I used it every day for a week and I noticed a huge difference in my hair after the first use.  Now I use it every other day.  I would definitely recommend this product.  It&#x27;s definitely a Magic Potion for my hair and it will be for yours!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this product, works amazing! Apply to wet hair before blow dry. And voila! Smooth straight hair</li>
            <li> My hair is so smooth and soft with use of this product.  The salon usually charges me for a \\&quot;keratin blow dry upgrade\\&quot; that only lasts 2 days at best, so it is nice to be able to do it myself on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Awesome love this product and have purchased multiple times and will order from them again!</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;m using 5-6 pumps after each wash on towel dried hair now that hair is a little longer, mid length. It&#x27;s in such great condition even my hairdresser was delightfully amazed. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it sprays.  It&#x27;s not a wide spray, but just a sharp stream.  That&#x27;s hard to get all over your hair.  The product itself is OK, but not amazing.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> i love this product. delivery was on time</li>
            <li> I love the magic potion! It makes my hair really smooth and smells good too. This is great for people with dry, chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> Simply smooth does make your hair feel satiny smooth. It almost seems to add weight to your hair and makes it much more manageable.  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Simply Smooth Xtend Keratin Reparative Magic Potion Sodium Chloride Free, 8.5 Ounce</li>
            <li> -- My hair stylist introduced me to &amp;#34;Simply Smooth Xtend Keratin Reparative Magic Potion &amp;#34;. I have to say this has truly been the difference in letting me grow my hair long and in great condition. &amp;#34;S.S. Magic Potion&amp;#34; is a leave in conditioner. You do not need to use a lot of this product. I have medium length hair past my shoulders and I use three pump sprays into the palm of my hand. After I have shampooed and conditioned and  combed my hair out, I flip my head down and work it into my roots to the ends. Then  you comb it through and style as usual . Magic Potion will leave your hair soft with a healthy shine. This product does not weigh your hair down. I love it and I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to grow there hair longer while keeping it healthy and in great condition.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Simply Smooth!! My hair feels, looks, and stays much less frizzy for several days. You can hardly use too much. Order arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Good product. Work fine on all hair types. Nice leave in condition. Adds shone and body for bouncy hair. Great.</li>
            <li> This product does help smooth and protect your hair...However, if you lighten your hair...it will affect the color and make blonde hair look brassy and dull.</li>
            <li> shipped fast and came in perfect condition. product doesnt work, could possibly make things worse. smell is overpowering and not entirely pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great product, and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Wow...I absolutely love this stuff!  It is simply magic.  Transforms dry, damaged &amp; lifeless hair to smooth, shiny and bouncy hair!  You only need very little to go a long way.</li>
            <li> My white-girl-fro was straight for 3 days!</li>
            <li> I love it! &amp;#34;Simply Smooth&amp;#34; has outdone themselves with this product. I have very thick, curly and coarse hair and have used many products that just left my hair weirdly flat and plastered to my head but not at all soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother in law actually recommended this product to me, as I have always had a hard time brushing my hair after washing and keeping my curls neat when I dry my hair. I use a few spritzes in my hands and rub in like a cream and comb in with a wide-toothed comb, let it air dry and my hair looks beautiful, soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is a little beachy, as it smells like coconut but not too harsh or off-putting. It&#x27;s pleasant, but subtle and even when my hair is dry, I get compliments on how wonderful it smells.  I would definitely recommend this product to someone with hair like mine, as it is not too heavy for someone with very thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair just feels better each time I use it!!! Best line for smoothness ever!! I love simply smooth products.</li>
            <li> I do love this spray in blowdry product. As a stylist I use it on all hair types and always get a gorgeous result.</li>
            <li> It really works. My hair is natural (no chemicals). If you are natural and sometimes want to straighten hair,  I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I had a professional keratin treatment done a few months ago, and wanted to prolong the &#x27;investment&#x27; so did much searching, read a lot of reviews, as I wanted to purchase a product that was going to benefit my hair, and not sit in a basket with all the other misfit hair products I have purchased along the way :)  My review on this product is this .. I like it but don&#x27;t love it .  It has a nice nutty smell to it.  I spray into my hands, rub my hands together to evenly distribute the oils, then work it into my damp hair . I have used it both ways .. drying/straightening my hair ( left it feeling very straw like / not smooth and soft ) and then letting my hair dry naturally ( I have naturally wavy hair)  As my hair &#x27;air dried&#x27; the ends still became frizzy/fly away.  When my hair was completely dried it felt course, not soft or smooth,  so I ended up wearing my hair up .  Over all I would say that this is a good OVERNIGHT leave in conditioner,  or good to use daytime hours, IF your going to wear your hair up :) Not a bad product by anymeans, but would not purchase again ... still searching for the right one :)</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims it it will, i&#x27;m very satisfied and will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> This product gives definition and moisture to my curls.</li>
            <li> I have coarse wavy hair and I like how this product makes it super soft and manageable. I use it after showering and just apply a few sprays, and I just let it air dry. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for those with hair that is prone to getting snarled after washing. It will smooth and detangle, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This will literally save your hair. It IS magic. My hair was breaking off from bleach damage but I started using this and my hair got so much nicer. Been using it two years since and I won&#x27;t ever use anything else</li>
            <li> Love what this does for my hair</li>
            <li> Makes hair shiny when used before straightening or curling.  Great protection for hair before applying heat.  Hair is soft and smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my hairdresser uses it to detangle my natural hair while in transition form processed hair. Comb goes right through! Don&#x27;t regret this purchase one bit! I did question using Keratin on natural hair- good or a bad thing! Not sure but it works wonders!!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair and I loved it so much I had to order it for myself.  You don&#x27;t have to use much, and it makes your hair smooth and silky with a &#x27;spring&#x27; to it.  I&#x27;m 75 and need all the help I can get .. and get lots of compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product so I purchased it from my salon since it wasn&#x27;t too pricey. I loved it and bought it a couple more times. I went to purchase more and the price had gone up so once again I turned to Amazon. This product DOES what it says. It basically takes care of any &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; hair issues, at least for me. Since it&#x27;s offered at a pretty reasonable price point, I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I use this as directed and it makes my hair feel stronger and healthier. I wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday, but several times a weeks seems to help. Its a product that doesn&#x27;t help unless it is continually used.</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  Makes blowdrying easy and fast.  No residue and no offensive smell.  Only need several sprays (perhaps more for thick hair).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is magical. You have to get it.  Simply Smooth is the filet mignon of all hair products for sure.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff, I have fine hair and don&#x27;t use conditioner.  This does not weigh the hair down but makes it feel smoother and healthier.  I use it before any other styling product more as a treatment.  It is just amazing and this is coming from someone who just wasn&#x27;t blessed with great hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little thick for styling.  I am still playing around with it.  Have tried it both on wet and dry hair.  I prefer thinner oils for my thick hair.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to have helped the damage a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Great product.  This really makes your hair smooth and easy to blow dry.  I am addicted to this product.</li>
            <li> This has to have been a bad knock-off.  The label is not affixed properly and slides off.  The product itself - actually CAUSED frizz and waves.  I have thin, fine hair and do not use a lot of protein products.  Will now go back to my more natural, organic products and quit with the wasteful trial-and-error from buying outside of salons.</li>
            <li> This product ROCKS! I have thin hair. I found that it really only works with heat (hair dryer and/or straitening iron) - I spray just a dime size in my palm then smooth on wet hair. This is the ONLY product i need anymore. I no longer need shine serum or hairspray. I get so many complements on how shinny my hair is.. even on the rainy days! I love it!</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is awesome. Admittedly, I am a hair product junkie and seem to buy new stuff before I ever finish the old stuff, always in search of the next best thing.  This is it!  My hair, especially in the hot and humid Florida climate goes to frizz so easily.  This stuff makes my hair follicles feel elastic and smooth.  My hair now feels closer to how smooth it was before my Brazilian blowout wore off.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... Makes my hair much smoother</li>
            <li> This product really does work magic with your hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works well.  Price is a little high though I thought. I&#x27;ll probably try another leave in conditioner next time though. The Miracle 7 brand is just as good that I got at Sally&#x27;s and it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Similar to &amp;#34;Its a 10&amp;#34; but much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this daily. Her hair has always been very dry and frizzy. This helps make her hair very smooth and shiny. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product has worked well on my GF&#x27;s very full and somewhat dry hair. She says it has improved things and I agree.</li>
            <li> This stuff is better than magic, it&#x27;s like a miracle.  I have very fine, wavy, highly frizz prone, regularly highlighted blonde hair.  Years of trying to get the top front of my hair to lay down and \\&quot;behave\\&quot; has resulted in lots of damage, not only from coloring, but from routine flat ironing.  The sides and lower layers can dry naturally and look great, but I had to use  many products to try and get the top layers to look as soft and healthy as those, and that area has always been a problem area no matter how many products (or what) I put on it. Well, this one product DOES IT all.  My hair feels soft and smooth, very touchable, and looks MUCH healthier than it actually is.  But, more than that, it holds my style for twice as long as anything I&#x27;ve used in the past (which has been many, many products, as I&#x27;m an admitted hair product junkie- just trying to find THE ONE).  It held my style for 4-5 days, instead of having to flat iron it every other.....so my hair gets a break from the abuse and may actually be on the road to health again.  It held despite rainy weather, and humidity, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down either.  I love this stuff, I&#x27;m sold on it, and I don&#x27;t write reviews unless the product EXCEEDS any and all expectations!  I&#x27;m now ready to try other products in their line up....despite the cost!  It&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> Helps calm my frizz and smells good too.</li>
            <li> love love love. It is perfect!</li>
            <li> Really great product to add softness and shine to your hair. Conditions hair, and hair shaft. Can be used daily with just a few sprays. Short hair, 2-3 sprays, longer and thich hair 5-7 sprays. Just spray into hands and rub into damp hair. Comb through and style hair. Product will cut drying time in half. Must try. Recommended to my friends.</li>
            <li> This leave-in after shampoo spray is absolutely the best!! One of the great things about it is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky at all like so many other anti-frizz serums but just gives it a beautiful sheen. My hair is shoulder length and with this product it is a breeze to comb through my wet hair, tangles simply disappear. Best of all, frizzies are gone and my hair is smooth as silk. It really is a &amp;#34;magic potion&amp;#34; as the label says! I&#x27;ve bought 3 more of these because I never want to run out.</li>
            <li> This product is really great!! left my hair smooth for several days does exactly what it says! Very concentrated so you do not need much will last for awhile.</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever! I will always reccomend! And i love it! Nice light coconut smell too!</li>
            <li> Having natural curly hair, only God knows I have battled my entire life with it.  I have tried different products leaving most of them half full due to my constant search. I bought this product and didn&#x27;t realize I used it all. I have even turned the bottle upside down trying to drain it to the last drop. Buying my second bottle today.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue!</li>
            <li> Best hair product for frizzy hair</li>
            <li> If they ever stop making this, I want fair warning so I can buy cases of it for the future. It is fabulous!! It actually works. I have not had a Keratin treatment in ages, and even after ONE use, I feel like I&#x27;ve had one again. Do not hesitate to buy this product if your hair can be frizzy/bulky like mine.</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars simply because I have extremely fine hair and if I squirt too much it can weigh it down.  But overall I like it and use it every day</li>
            <li> Great Stuff! Makes your hair incredibly soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected for how much my friend raved on about. It made my hair feel heavy ...it did feel soft but it works better if you blow dray your hair often and I do not.</li>
            <li> This is actually magic in a bottle. My hairstylist recommended it and this product does wonders. Makes my brittle, frizzy hair go from impossible-to-handle to soft and smooth! It transforms straw to silk. I love it.</li>
            <li> It is honestly the best hair product I have bought. In between shampoos, your hair look so smooth ! People around me thought that I just go a Brazilian blow out !!! I will order it again. My hairdresser had recommended it and I have already thanked her several times !!! -:))</li>
            <li> I love this makes my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li> I love this product !!!!! It really protects your hair from the heat of flat irons!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for thin hair - bought some for me and my sister. Try it you will love it!</li>
            <li> just a little and smooths your hair</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and very good price.</li>
            <li> My sister moved to an area where the climate is hot and dry and wanted to try something to give her hair a boost! I purchased this stuff for her from my hair dresser, after hearing great reviews! My sister just purchased her 2nd bottle! Says, shes received tons of compliments on her hair and its shine! She raved about it soo much that I had to try it as well. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far and its fantastic! Although its a spray bottle, I find the potion a little too thick to spray on, so I just spray into my hands &amp; then run it through my hair! Definitely worth it! Also...FYI; my hairdresser sells this Potion for almost double the price as sold here on Amazon. I checked around town and found other prices are just about the same! So if you want to try it, definitely make your purchase here through Amazon! Good luck!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample. I&#x27;ve been addicted ever since,  My hair feel soft. I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair every day.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well. I only use it about once a week, but it makes my hair soft and strong. It smells good too.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My hair dresser introduced me to it and I absolutely love it. Once I use a 1/4&amp;#34; of it...I fill it up with water, which help it spray better and last longer.</li>
            <li> First few times I tried it, it did make my hair very shiny and so bouncy... but, after putting it on for couple weeks, only twice a week, I noticed that my hair felft like it was bleached, so harsh and so dead feeling..  It scared me and I stopped, started putting heavy moisturizing balms and oils to liven it up!  and so far my hair is back to looking healthy and beautiful.  In the end, if you have nice hair already don&#x27;t mess it up, like I almost did.  Maybe it&#x27;s good to use it only once in a while, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m planning on doing.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this stuff is incredible. I have fine, curly/frizzy hair that is very dry and colored. Basically, it&#x27;s sort of a nightmare and always looks \\&quot;not done.\\&quot; This stuff made my hair behave and look like it did when I was in my 20&#x27;s. (I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s now.) Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this stuff and it really does do something for my hair that no other product does- if your hair is processed it will give it a healthier, more managable feel without any sign that you have anything in your hair after stying.  It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;silk&amp;#34; product... more of a normal hair feel.</li>
            <li> Hard to find elsewhere, this is just what my wife wanted</li>
            <li> I have fine naturally wavy/curly hair and I use this product after every shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and works whether I&#x27;m just blow drying it with a round brush or using the flat iron too. I spray about 8 pumps into the palm of my hand and spread it through, but mostly on the ends. I would buy this again for sure!</li>
            <li> I Normally purchase at Hair Salon @ $25 or So? I remember thinking &amp;#34;better make it last&amp;#34;.  It DOES LAST A LONG TIME (U do not use a lot). This stuff is something I cannot be without. Great for fine longer hair. Hard to find a &amp;#34;LEAVE IN&amp;#34; that does not weigh your hair down... Not EZ to do.  This does it all.&lt;br /&gt; AND,  SMELLS LIKE COOKIE DOUGH.  Must try the Shampoo and Conditioner someday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, THANKS FOR THE GREAT PRICE, PLEASE KEEP IT GOING!</li>
            <li> With just a few sprays, made my hair soft and smooth. (and I have very very thick, long hair) My hairstylist used it and I knew I must find it. The cost wasn&#x27;t to shabby either. :)</li>
            <li> Heard about this from a friend and bought it right away because she spoke so highly of it. I have very long fine hair and only wash every 3 days with liquid castille soap which is very clarifying. The magic potion leaves my long broken hair very smooth, soft, touchable, and frizz free! I hate using chemicals but this is totally worth the result. I spray 6 pumps into my hands and work it through my hair paying special attention to the ends and I reapply one spray into my hand and through the ends each morning. The results are incredible even in dry crappy New England weather!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair super soft and shiny...barely need a flat iron at all after using. Use in wet hair before blow drying. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair dull or greasy either. I absolutely love it. One of my new favorite products! I bought it based on the reviews and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> Great product - leaves my hair smooth and shiny without buildup and goes a long way.  Do not need to use that much product to get positive results.  Love Simply Smooth Xtend Keratin Reparaative Magic Potion.  Also recommend ordering from Amazon as the salons sell it for much more.</li>
            <li> I used to be addicted to this product, it made my thick course hair very smooth and manageable. My salon quit carrying this line and I was really disappointed. Apparently the keratin is can be unsafe to breathe in when you are blow drying with the product in your hair. Mostly it is unsafe for hairdressers who breath in the product all day. That made me question if I should still be using the product. I think that keratin is wonderful, but if you use this product too much it can make your hair too strong and then it becomes brittle. Because of these two reasons I have switched to an all natural leave in conditioner that does no contain a protein. I like the effect this product gives but I would caution agains overusing it for your hairs health and your own health. I have found I can get the same silky smooth effect with other products that I know are safer. Even though this product is most likely no going to harm you, I would rather be safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless hair products and have a graveyard cupboard full of bottles.  This stuff is awesome.  My ends are smooth and it really does a great job of heat protecting. Not too greasy and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel coated or weighed down.</li>
            <li> My hair has been more manageable and healthy.  I can pick my little afro out without pain now for this products softens it and detangles.</li>
            <li> Tames unmanageable hair like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> ive been using this product for a year now and it has transformed my hair. i use it every single day, reduces breakage, frizz, and split ends, makes your hair easy to manage and comb thru wet, and dry . i now can not live without this product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this before in a smaller version and glad I now have more to use.  This makes my hair feel like silk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years now and it has done wonders for my hair. I die, bleach, hot-iron and blow-dry my hair on a regular basis and the Magic Potion spray helps keep it looking healthy. Would recommend to anyone needing some extra protection for their processed hair.</li>
            <li> Works great! Not heavy, gives body and lift and no greasy look of feel. Doesn&#x27;t separate hair like mousse. Except that it makes my hair look healthy and behave better, you&#x27;d never know I used anything on it!</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells so good and leaves hair feeling like silk as a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> This stuff really does deserve to have \\&quot;magic\\&quot; in its name.  My hair is coarse, dry, and frizzy and I have never found any other leave-in conditioner that has helped at all.  This helps with frizz like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tired.  The consistency might be too thick for people with thinner hair, but it&#x27;s perfect for mine.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have very curly hair, and it smooths out the frizzy and gives me nice defined curls. I put it in my towel dried hair. It never leaves my hair sticky, stiff or greasy looking. It does not take a lot of the product to work.  My hair is about six inches below my shoulder. I use four sprays in the palm of my hands and work it through one side of my hair, and then four sprays for the other side. It smells nice too !. The price at the beauty salons was over the top for me, so I started searching for other sources for this product. I found a win win here. Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> love this stuff -- it works great to keep hair smooth and sleek</li>
            <li> Still leaves frizzy hair threw it out</li>
            <li> I am a latina with curly hair i have my hair straightened alot. My hair stylist reffered me to this product and I have been won!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from my distributor (I&#x27;m a stylist of 22 years) and I am one of those stylists that prefers clean, product free, healthy hair but since it was a sample I took it home for myself and gave it a shot. WOW! My hair stays clean feeling and you would never know there was anything in it other than bounce, shine and softness. I have fine, curly hair that tends to be more frizzy than curly and I have to flat iron or curl my hair to make it smooth looking. With this I have been able to blowdry with a round brush and go. I get more complements than ever. The weird thing is my hair stays in place but feels like there is nothing holding it. My co-worker and I went to theme part this past weekend and she made the comment, \\&quot;OMG how is your hair still perfect after that rollercoaster?\\&quot; lol  I have no idea what is different about this product over the hundreds I&#x27;ve tried over the years, but I don&#x27;t do reviews unless something really strikes a cord with me. I doubt it would be a miracle product for ALL hair types, but it sure is for mine.</li>
            <li> This works great! You don&#x27;t need much. I have thin fine hair and this does not weigh it down or make it appear greasy. That is always my biggest problem.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work very well. Don&#x27;t put it in your hair if you&#x27;re not going to be putting heat on it. Great product. Saved my hair</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for the first time. I have Keritin treated hair and needed a product that would be safe to use.  I was very pleased with the results. A small amount goes a long way. It does not feel or leave your hair greasy. I blow dry my long hair, and feel this product makes the task easier. My hair is shiny and soft. Also purchased the shampoo and was pleased with that as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 4 months thought it was awesome until my hair starting breaking off. I am a hair stylist of 15 years and would recomend using sparingly spray into hand then work through. Use a clarifier weekly. This product has a huge amount of keratin and too much protien can break your hair!!!</li>
            <li> My stylist has used this on my hair after a cut and after color/highlights.  It makes my hair so soft and smooth, but not to the point that I can&#x27;t do anything with it.  My salon had a contest on FaceBook and I won my choice of products.  I asked my stylist what the product was that she has used in my hair and she showed me this. It is great.  Even if I hadn&#x27;t won the contest, I would have bought it.  Such a small amount makes a HUGE difference in your hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so awesome! I have highlighted and colored hair and it always feels brittle and dry. But after I shampoo my hair and put this on it....amazing! My hair feels so soft and actually has shine too. Something I&#x27;ve never had with highlighted hair before. I will definitely keep buying this product!</li>
            <li> I think this product works great, it smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It works amazing on my curly hair!  I just love the way it makes my curls turn out.  I have long hair so I use quite a bit at a time.  It leaves my hair bouncy and soft.  It works so good that I can actually use just this in my hair without mousse and still have awesome curls with no frizz!  If you have curly hair you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed with the sprayer gets all over the place. Have to spray it in my hands to put in my hair this should of been in a tube.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find and costs more at the salon!&lt;br /&gt;Makes your hair come out sleek without feeling gummy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING for coarser, dry, frizzy hair.  Other hair types might find it too thick or too heavy, but it&#x27;s perfect for me.  I&#x27;ve found very few products that truly help my frizz, and very few leave-in conditioners that are hydrating enough, but Magic Potion makes a huge difference in my hair.  Frizz is controlled, and my hair feels soft and looks shinier.  Plus, it smells great and Simply Smooth doesn&#x27;t test on animals.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything else.</li>
            <li> I have my hair relaxed with keratin treatments but this product allows me to extend the time between treatments by almost a month and it does keep it straight without the oily feeling of some other products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Makes my hair feel awesome.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a few years now. My hair would never grow past my shoulders. now it is about 6 inches past! A must, for all hair types!</li>
            <li> My wife has tried everything out there.  She has very thick, wavy hair.  She says this is the only product that keeps her hair manageable - makes it easy to brush and style, helps hold style, reduces frizz, makes hair look healthy and shiny.  If you&#x27;re looking for a leave-in conditioner or other smoothing-type product, you should definitely try this.  It&#x27;s well worth the cost - our bathroom houses bottles of many other products that didn&#x27;t work as well, and it would have been easier just to buy this from the start.</li>
            <li> This product was ok. I did not see much change in my hair! Bought it because a girl liked it at work. Leaves a weird feeling in my hair. I would use its a 10 with keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> Hard to find but ABSOLUTELY worth the effort! This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used! Worth the price too.</li>
            <li> It works on my hair.  It smoothes, detangles, and shines.  I can see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Has helped me change my hairstyle, which I thought was impossible.</li>
            <li> Make hair like satin just using it 1 day a week!</li>
            <li> This product was first suggested to me in lieu of doing a Keratin Express process.  I am so glad I tried this!  I have very thick and slightly wavy hair.  This product really helps to straighten and smooth out the hair shaft, leaving your hair soft, silky and shiny - like you just had a salon blowout.  I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have long fine color treated hair and this is light enough to use daily and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and leaves it soft and feeling healthy. Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product...great for shaping the style you may want....great for hair that may need taming and styling..really like this product</li>
            <li> Originally bought at Beauty shop....this is wonderful ...</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I will order again and again. I spray it liberally on my hands and then run it all over my hair after towel drying.  It locks in smooth moisture for hair that is overprocessed and frizzy in humid weather. I love it!</li>
            <li> I use this every time I wash my hair; I mix it with a Argan Oil and rub all through my hair before blow drying....and voila!  beautiful, straight shiny hair, I barely have to use my flat iron with this great combination!  (The trick here is to mix with Argan or Moroccan Oil for an even shinier straighter look.)</li>
            <li> Have only used product once , but did not see any difference in hair when I did. Will keep using it and may be update review</li>
            <li> I used this spray on my hair after washing and conditioning it with the Simply Smooth line. I sprayed the leave in on my hair and ran a blow dryer and brush through it. You can not imagine the ease and quickness it was to blow dry my curly frizzy hair that laid down smooth and straight , but what you really you can&#x27;t imagine, is the softness and shine this stuff delivers. It has to have some magic in it. because I went through hundreds of hair car products before I found Simply Smooth, and no going back now. You will have to pry this spray from my death grip hands...</li>
            <li> Great product! Not sticky or tacky. No buildup! Leaves hair very soft &amp; smooth! Great for color treated or chemically treated hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have naturally wavy, curly, frizzy hair and this is the only product that smooths and straightens my hair when used with a flat iron.  It stays straight for days with just a small touch up after sleeping.  I am going to invest in other products in this line as I run out of what I am using.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smelling, humidity resistant, does what it claims to do. Could not find this product in salons or stores here in the mountains. This is the real product which was cheaper and arrived in three days. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It makes your hair soft and silky and helps with almost any hair problem. I can use it when my hair is straight or curly and it never weighs it down and helps with knots and kinks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing - no joke.  I have tried so many hair products, and this magic potion makes my hair so smooth and it smells awesome.  You spray it on wet hair and while it says only 4-5 sprays I use about 10 -15 because I have very thick hair.  My hair is also color treated just for those who wonder.  I will be buying more of this when I run out of it.</li>
            <li> Item came as described and arrived in the time it was promised.  Very easy transaction.</li>
            <li> Like this a lot for after shampooing  and conditioning I like to use this on my wet  hair to wrap or flat iron, I only used it for two and a half weeks too.</li>
            <li> Started using this after a recommendation from my hair stylist.  I was suffering from MAJOR hair breakage, so she told me to give this line a try!!  I like it.....but it&#x27;s VERY heavy.  I have baby fine hair, so I need to water it down before I spray it on my hair.</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by a friend who is a hairdresser. Its does work nicely. Even if you don&#x27;t blow out your hair, it will be smooth and soft</li>
