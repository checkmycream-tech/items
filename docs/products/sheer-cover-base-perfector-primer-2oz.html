    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> There is no product like this anywhere that I know of. I first tried it in a &amp;#34;kit.&amp;#34; I did not like the other products in the kit. The &amp;#34;kit-selling&amp;#34; promo people would absolutely not allow the purchase of the one thing I loved. All or nothing strategy is their sales vision. I was happy to finally find a source. Lessens the appearance of pores. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I was so glad to have found this product on amazon....One tube this size lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> very nice moisturizer  makes your skin feel silky soft -  i&#x27;m sold</li>
            <li> This is the absolutely best stuff ever!</li>

            <li> Product is great.  I have used it for a very long time and hate when I run out.  It fills in most lines and wrinkles, gives your face smooth feeling and your makeup goes on easier.</li>
            <li> Between Sheer Cover and Bare Minerals, I&#x27;ve used nothing else on my face in years.. The primer is awesome and the tube just lasts forever.</li>
            <li> After using liquid foundation forever, I decided to try something different.  I am very satisfied with Sheercover&#x27;s mineral foundation used in conjunction with the base perfector.  Looks very natural and covers many flaws.</li>
            <li> Love how this feels and looks on my face. I use it either alone or under Chanel liquid makeup. The only negative is its price.</li>
            <li> I use it daily, usually after washing my face first thing in the morning.  I apply it just as described and the product allows me to keep my makeup looking &#x27;fresh&#x27; all day long!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you consider purchasing a tube you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Feels like powder going on and lasts. The large tube will last a very long time. Great product, will buy again</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best makeup base ever!!!! Buying it through Amazon was definitely the best way. Next time I need it I&#x27;m going right back to Amazon</li>
            <li> I like the product.  It goes on easy and help keep make up in place. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Helps my skin to look younger and more even.  Highly recommend if you have large pores and fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Great product and service!</li>
            <li> This product makes my face feel so silky smooth. Perfect to put on before foundation.  And you need just a tiny dab, so it lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> This works great I use it daily .my makeup base goes on so smooth it&#x27;s a lot better than just using lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this primer.  Rec&#x27;d a free sample in my Meaningful Beauty package. Makes my skin feel so soft and my makeup just glides on.  When I ran out I knew I had to get some more.  This is the best primer I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife. She used it and she like it a lot when work outside. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this! Silky smooth, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. It tames my oily skin and keeps away the shine. And of course, for a much better price than through your local ProActiv kiosks.</li>
