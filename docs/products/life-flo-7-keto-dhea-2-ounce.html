            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happier!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t want that to happen because you still want your own body to make what it can.</li>
            <li>loved it used it need more</li>
            <li>My skin felt nice</li>
            <li>I really think it helps me sleep through the night and keeps me feeling great!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all I can report about my own experience.  </li>
            <li>The pump bottle is easy to use and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I did not notice any results, however I found this cream easily controllable and much more convenient than a pill.</li>
            <li>My husband has more energy and seem to be in a much better mood.</li>
            <li>More is not always better when it comes to ANY type of hormone replacements or use of products that TWEEK the hormones</li>
            <li>More flab off.</li>
            <li>I guess it was OK</li>
            <li>This is like most of the diet supplements on the market.</li>
            <li>I use many of the Life Flo creams.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have more energy and feel more alert during the day.</li>
            <li>ordered more and will give it more time to help the adrenal support if it can.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a pre-measured pump</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I know that hormonal creams absorb better than pills; this must be true for all hormones.</li>
            <li>I read that 7 Keto is important for losing weight.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any significant changes in my mood, body fat content etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that others have had significant improvements, but I can&#x27;t make that claim here.</li>
            <li>The label says 1 pump per application, but doesn&#x27;t really tell you how many pumps are in there.  </li>
            <li>Surprised, took some more.</li>
            <li>My first bottle of 7-KETO is nearly gone; I am online to order more.  </li>
            <li>Dr is always out of it thanks for the fast easy service</li>
            <li>More energy, muscle strength and general well-being.  </li>
            <li>I used this product consistently for 3 months and noticed nothing in change of energy or hormone balancing.</li>
            <li>Give it a shot if your interested.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a problem if you want to make sure you get the same amount every time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to order more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to order some more</li>
            <li>The cream itself is very well made, the dispenser is excellent, but the product is questionable.</li>
            <li>This is a pleasant lotion that absorbs well, at least into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Too much use of this can induce too much testosterone in your body so use sparingly.</li>
            <li>This has helped me &amp; along with my bio-identical estrogen made by compound pharmacist through Rx and also with use of natural progesterone cream once a week keeps my brain/emotions calm.</li>
            <li>Ladies that had hysterectomy won&#x27;t need to do too much progesterone but need the estrogen still providing you are not at risk for breast cancer.</li>
            <li>Works as I expected and I like being able to adjust the levels and continue using DHEA for the days I stop using the progesterone cream.</li>
            <li>Took this product without expecting much.</li>
            <li>and I never know how much I&#x27;m truly getting.  </li>
            <li>You never want to use too much DHEA, as I&#x27;ve been advised by my doctor that it could cause heart issues.</li>
            <li>our bodies don&#x27;t make 7-Keto DHEA as much</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THERE</li>
            <li>So it may just boil down to using the most efficient type for yourself.  </li>
            <li>but as we get older (I&#x27;m 52...</li>
            <li>Since first writing my review I have lost ANOTHER 5 pounds for a total of 10 pounds!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more cheerful and optimistic all day and less anxious at night.  </li>
            <li>Remember that with hormones,if you use too much, your natural body&#x27;s production of hormones will stop producing as it will think you have enough</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been researching about natural hormones for 20 years.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>However, when I use it I always wake up feeling very groggy and \\&quot;out of it\\&quot; the next day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week now, but I really think I feel the difference.  </li>
            <li>7-Keto DHEA is made naturally in our bodies, it helps regulate our metabolism</li>
            <li>But regular Youthful You DHEA capsules by Enzymatic Therapy turned out to be the real deal for me.</li>
            <li>It does everything one can expect of it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a natural creme that gives sufficient 7-Keto.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>If your body stops making your own natural hormones and you abruptly stop any hormone supplements, you will feel freaked out mentally and physically.</li>
            <li>Also seems to have a profound anti-inflammatory effect.</li>
            <li>I have been dieting on top of using this supplement only drinking water and eating small portion meals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll check back in on the first of next month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to take the homeopathic version of that herb to get all of the side-effects to calm down.</li>
            <li>You want to make sure to use the least amount just enough to replace what your body doesn&#x27;t make anymore.</li>
            <li>I not yet tracking my weight (it&#x27;s been too discouraging), but I am eating less, feeling less hungry, having fewer instrusive thoughts of food and cravings for sweets, and I&#x27;m exercising more. . .</li>
            <li>Expensive and non effective.</li>
            <li>I use a progesterone product that contains a little DHEA and since I would like a little more, I now have added this product.</li>
            <li>I used one pump a day for the first 25 days of last month, and now I am starting the second 25-day round in this month.  </li>
            <li>This negative effect far outweighed any positive effects the product had.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have been getting up earlier, waking up more rested, and getting active immediately; usually I would drag myself out of bed and sit and think about exercising without doing it.</li>

            <li> This did not live up to what it claimed</li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work at all and the packaging, which makes it look like you get three times as much product as you actually do, is so difficult to get into to retrieve the cream that returning it would be the only option.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep coming back to this review every few weeks to note changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t lose those last few pounds</li>
            <li> Seems to help as mentioned, not a strong affect but helpful, but only used for 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this before bed and was hoping it would help me maintain some muscle, as I tend to keep very little even though I&#x27;m on a solid strength-training program.</li>
            <li> OTHER PRO.  </li>
            <li> You know its a challenge going through the change/menopause with our hormones dwendling down.</li>
            <li> down</li>
            <li> The anger and agitation did not come back after the first few days.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> so I wasted my money and can&#x27;t find out how to get a refund</li>
            <li> I had lost 35 pounds a few years ago using the Slim-fast method ( I know, I know it&#x27;s corney)</li>
            <li> I am also taking SAM-e, which seems to prevent outright depression, but I still had very little energy or enthusiasm for anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Always start small and up it as needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I want to pay for another month.</li>
            <li> am not sure how it is supposed to help or not help with that.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product has done anything for me yet.</li>
            <li> I plan to try another brand (perhaps a capsule) to see if it gives me the same effect, but unfortunately this was not the product for me.</li>
            <li> I ended up with about half the hair on my head falling out leaving a thin layer in which you could see thru to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Male or female,DHEA alone in any form is dangerous</li>
            <li> My husbad and I both use a very small amount on our arms,legs or stomach each day.</li>
            <li> Alas, because they put in phenoxyethanol I could not use that one either.</li>
            <li> Very subtle affect but what I wanted for now.</li>
            <li> and I did not benefit unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Not a perfect miracle, but, hey.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate this, didn&#x27;t know how to rate it.</li>
            <li> A real disappointment.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Male or female,DHEA alone in any form is dangerous so I use this 7-Keto which is safer form of DHEA metabolite.My husbad and I both use a very small amount on our arms,legs or stomach each day.My husband has more energy and seem to be in a much better mood.You know its a challenge going through the change/menopause with our hormones dwendling down.Too much use of this can induce too much testosterone in your body so use sparingly.I can tell a difference when I forget to put the cream on my hubby because he is snappy and has no drive and likewise for me.This has helped me &amp; along with my bio-identical estrogen made by compound pharmacist through Rx and also with use of natural progesterone cream once a week keeps my brain/emotions calm.Ladies that had hysterectomy won&#x27;t need to do too much progesterone but need the estrogen still providing you are not at risk for breast cancer. More is not always better when it comes to ANY type of hormone replacements or use of products that TWEEK the hormones so this 7-Keyto should be used with caution and not apply the amount it recommends.Always start small and up it as needed.You will learn to adjust the amount through your emotional and physical outcomes.You want to make sure to use the least amount just enough to replace what your body doesn&#x27;t make anymore.Remember that with hormones,if you use too much, your natural body&#x27;s production of hormones will stop producing as it will think you have enough and you don&#x27;t want that to happen because you still want your own body to make what it can.If your body stops making your own natural hormones and you abruptly stop any hormone supplements, you will feel freaked out mentally and physically.Our bodie makes 3 types of estrogens and they are: estrodial, estrone and estriol.Hope this helps and I&#x27;ve been researching about natural hormones for 20 years.</li>
            <li> I suggest researching the side effects of 7 Keto Dhea use.  After about 30 days of using this product as directed, my hair started falling out.  I ended up with about half the hair on my head falling out leaving a thin layer in which you could see thru to my scalp.  This negative effect far outweighed any positive effects the product had.</li>
            <li> I use a progesterone product that contains a little DHEA and since I would like a little more, I now have added this product. Works as I expected and I like being able to adjust the levels and continue using DHEA for the days I stop using the progesterone cream.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I like having a way to get DHEA without it having to go through the liver. The pump bottle is easy to use and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I have been warned that 7 Keto takes a while to work.  This is a pleasant lotion that absorbs well, at least into my skin.  I have not seen a difference yet.  I&#x27;m not sure if I want to pay for another month.</li>
            <li> This did not live up to what it claimed and I did not benefit unfortunately. The cream itself is very well made, the dispenser is excellent, but the product is questionable.</li>
            <li> A real disappointment. I did not see any difference. No weight loss. No sizzle in sex drive. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I used this product consistently for 3 months and noticed nothing in change of energy or hormone balancing. I am perimenopausal,&lt;br /&gt;and am not sure how it is supposed to help or not help with that. In reality, the &#x27;change&#x27; is just a pain...</li>
            <li> Took this product without expecting much. Suddenly felt flab loss. Surprised, took some more. More flab off. Wow. Works. Not a perfect miracle, but, hey.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed the difference in energy levels.  I took another pill version for a long time; I didn&#x27;t notice any change in energy.  I know that hormonal creams absorb better than pills; this must be true for all hormones.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product has done anything for me yet. It has been 4 weeks now.  Wait and see.</li>
            <li> No smell - texture is light - silly feeling&lt;br /&gt;I applied to inner arms, legs and face no problems / reactions&lt;br /&gt;This is the 1st time I have used this type of product and will have saliva test next month to see if level has increased</li>
            <li> Gives me great energy for work outs without the stimulation of caffeine. Also seems to have a profound anti-inflammatory effect.</li>
            <li> Each application is measured out so no overdosing.  I applied before bed and when I  wake up in the morning I feel warmer, like a hotter metabolism overnight, but not sweaty.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I guess it was OK but it did nothing for me. This is like most of the diet supplements on the market. Expensive and non effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this before bed and was hoping it would help me maintain some muscle, as I tend to keep very little even though I&#x27;m on a solid strength-training program. However, when I use it I always wake up feeling very groggy and \\&quot;out of it\\&quot; the next day. It takes me until mid-afternoon to start feeling myself again. I plan to try another brand (perhaps a capsule) to see if it gives me the same effect, but unfortunately this was not the product for me.</li>
            <li> Cimicifuga Racemosa is a hormone tweaking herb...I do NOT need my hormones messed about. I have to take the homeopathic version of that herb to get all of the side-effects to calm down. It is not being used. Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I use many of the Life Flo creams. I use them for Hormone balancing, but this one I use for weight loss, as well as replenishing DHEA. I read that 7 Keto is important for losing weight.</li>
            <li> It does work for weight loss. I lost belly weight and have been doing some cardio and weight lifting. I use it in the morning. Each pump supplies 15 mg of 7-keto dhea. I use about 5 pumps so about 75 mg 7-keto dhea a day. I feel like I have more energy and feel more alert during the day. I have been dieting on top of using this supplement only drinking water and eating small portion meals. However, this supplement does work to a point. It helped me lose about 6 lbs already. Give it a shot if your interested.</li>
            <li> no noticeable affect whatsoever</li>
            <li> loved it used it need more</li>
            <li> Product is great but it will not pump from the dispenser so I wasted my money and can&#x27;t find out how to get a refund</li>
            <li> I use this every month.  It is good for maintaining weight and feeling like I have some energy.</li>
            <li> Very subtle affect but what I wanted for now. Seems to help as mentioned, not a strong affect but helpful, but only used for 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;Have ordered more and will give it more time to help the adrenal support if it can.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;think&#x27; it works, however, the pump does not always dispense the same amount.  It takes several tries to get the product out and I never know how much I&#x27;m truly getting.  That&#x27;s a problem if you want to make sure you get the same amount every time. You never want to use too much DHEA, as I&#x27;ve been advised by my doctor that it could cause heart issues.</li>
            <li> I used this product every day for 25 days as recommended by the label, and then took the 5 day break. I have not noticed any significant changes in my mood, body fat content etc.  My skin felt nice but, that&#x27;s about it.  I&#x27;ve read that others have had significant improvements, but I can&#x27;t make that claim here.</li>
            <li> Big container and for the price are soooo perfect , great quality&lt;br /&gt;is not greasy and feel so good in the skin , come on time&lt;br /&gt;ohhh and yes this work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week now, but I really think I feel the difference.  At first, I felt a little agitated and on the verge of getting angry, and I had a mild outbreak of acne, but that passed by the third day.  Since then, I have been getting up earlier, waking up more rested, and getting active immediately; usually I would drag myself out of bed and sit and think about exercising without doing it. I&#x27;m more cheerful and optimistic all day and less anxious at night.  I am also taking SAM-e, which seems to prevent outright depression, but I still had very little energy or enthusiasm for anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am post menopause and about 20 lbs overweight.  I not yet tracking my weight (it&#x27;s been too discouraging), but I am eating less, feeling less hungry, having fewer instrusive thoughts of food and cravings for sweets, and I&#x27;m exercising more. . . all good things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep coming back to this review every few weeks to note changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST UPDATE: No weight loss effect, but I continue to notice an improved sense of well being and energy. The anger and agitation did not come back after the first few days.  I used one pump a day for the first 25 days of last month, and now I am starting the second 25-day round in this month.  I am also starting a low calorie/low sugar diet.  I&#x27;ll check back in on the first of next month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND UPDATE: Thought I&#x27;d mention that I get 40 pumps from each jar.  The label says 1 pump per application, but doesn&#x27;t really tell you how many pumps are in there.  The acne and agitation have not come back, the sense of well being continues, but no automatic weight loss.  I do feel like I am \\&quot;creating a space\\&quot; for myself in which to deal with my stress/anxiety/depression-driven eating, however.  So hope springs eternal.</li>
            <li> I rated 7-Keto DHEA 5 stars because IT WORKED for me! 7-Keto DHEA is made naturally in our bodies, it helps regulate our metabolism but as we get older (I&#x27;m 52...Yikes!) our bodies don&#x27;t make 7-Keto DHEA as much so our metabolism s-l-o-w-s down and we gain weight. Since I&#x27;ve been using this (one month) I&#x27;ve lost those stubborn last 5 pounds! I don&#x27;t exercise like I know I should but I do watch my sugar and caloric intake. I had lost 35 pounds a few years ago using the Slim-fast method ( I know, I know it&#x27;s corney) but I couldn&#x27;t lose those last few pounds so I thought I would try 7-Keto DHEA and it worked! I couldn&#x27;t be more happier! I just rub it on my inner arms every night before I go to bed. I love that it has a pre-measured pump so I don&#x27;t have to guess. I&#x27;m back to order more so I thought I would leave some feedback. Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: April 7, 2013. Since first writing my review I have lost ANOTHER 5 pounds for a total of 10 pounds! I&#x27;m back to order some more and I wanted to update you.</li>
            <li> I tried this for several months, but I can&#x27;t say that I noticed any changes.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I did not notice any results, however I found this cream easily controllable and much more convenient than a pill.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin using this product.</li>
            <li> I use one pump before I go to bed each night and so does my husband. I really think it helps me sleep through the night and keeps me feeling great! Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate this, didn&#x27;t know how to rate it. Didn&#x27;t use it when I found out 7-keto DHEA is not the same thing and doesn&#x27;t do the same thing as DHEA does, and that if I took the master hormone pregnenolone it should allow my body to make whatever it needed. Alas, because they put in phenoxyethanol I could not use that one either.</li>
            <li> I JUST RECIVED IT .  I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD A CHANCE TO TRY IT, BUT I REALLY LIKE THERE OTHER PRO.  THERE PRODUCTS ARE GREAT</li>
            <li> This is a total joke. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> My first bottle of 7-KETO is nearly gone; I am online to order more.  After about two weeks of use my skin looked brighter, I had lost a bit of weight, and my pre-menopausal symptoms were gone.  Very satisfied with this cream. I like that it is not metabolized through the liver when used topically, too.</li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work at all and the packaging, which makes it look like you get three times as much product as you actually do, is so difficult to get into to retrieve the cream that returning it would be the only option.</li>
            <li> Despite all the promises of bioidentical hormone creams, I didn&#x27;t notice anything from using this product.  But regular Youthful You DHEA capsules by Enzymatic Therapy turned out to be the real deal for me. After 6 months use I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.  More energy, muscle strength and general well-being.  So it may just boil down to using the most efficient type for yourself.  That&#x27;s all I can report about my own experience.  No, I don&#x27;t work for ET.</li>
            <li> It does everything one can expect of it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a natural creme that gives sufficient 7-Keto.&lt;br /&gt;A recommendable product.</li>
            <li> Love this product My wife and I both use it and our BHRT Dr is always out of it thanks for the fast easy service</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  Worked wonders for me.</li>
