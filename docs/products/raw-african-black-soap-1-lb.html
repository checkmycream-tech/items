            <li>All I can say is I love this soap.</li>
            <li>but I love to wash my body with it as well</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin was better off BEFORE I started using this horrid soap.</li>
            <li>Just after 1 use, my skin feels more moisturized.</li>
            <li>all love it</li>
            <li>It works very well, and I am more than happy with this soap.</li>
            <li>I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for more than 4 days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>Every time when I wash my face with this soap, I apply coconut oil on it and the result is excellent, your skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SOAP VERY CLEAN SMELL AND</li>
            <li>I also use the soap as my shampoo because I love how it is so cleansing and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t anything impressive, but I am sure that if you really wanted to you could put a natural oil like lavender oil onto the soap or something.</li>
            <li>Everything you ever heard about this soap is true!  </li>
            <li>Not bad for a $12.00 investment!    </li>
            <li>will buy this stuff over and over, because I truly think, given it also seems to calm my eczema, that I have found the perfect soap, and the last one I will ever need.</li>
            <li>My baby daughter has very mild eczema and her skin seems softer too.</li>
            <li>I received this soap in a plastic type bag and it arrived just fine.  </li>
            <li>My soap has stayed just fine.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin super soft and makes a great make up remover</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take much soap to work up a nice lather</li>
            <li>This is truly the best soap I have ever used, and  I&#x27;ve used quite a few, drugstore brands, dept. store brands, spa brands, mail-order brands.  </li>
            <li>and she and I can both tell a difference in how smooth her skin is.</li>
            <li>Although the image in the ad was not the product I received, what was sent was was usable, and very well liked.</li>
            <li>Not only is it a great face was</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the way the soap is keeping my skin clean and clearing up my acne and age spots.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Make a rich lather and apply.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, it was okay.</li>
            <li>I think the smell is clean smelling almost like Ivory soap but woodier.</li>
            <li>YOU FEEL REALLY CLEAN USING THIS</li>
            <li>AND IT&#x27;S A CLEAN SOAP</li>
            <li>my husband and I love this soap so much we are re-ordering.</li>
            <li>People comment that my skin is glowing and its true.  </li>
            <li>Just need more than a pound now since I use it so much.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s true that it comes packaged in a baggie, this does not bother me.</li>
            <li>This has made it much softer and more gentile.</li>
            <li>I love this soap, it is clean my skin very good, the only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this soap is that make your skin dry.</li>
            <li>I cut the 1 pound brick into bars for ease of use, and do not let water splash onto the bar while in the shower, as it will wash away quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this item because I was suffering from mild acne.</li>
            <li>Overall, this was a very worthwhile investment and we will continue to purchase the soap on an as-needed basis.</li>
            <li>, it is gentle, nothing artificial (good for our great nature), and it really provides all the wonderful \\&quot;things\\&quot; that other face cleaners promise (I have used a lot, Alba Face Cleaner one of my favorites, but it cannot beat this soap.)   </li>
            <li>A great oil to follow up with is Slice of Nature cold pressed, virgin Argan oil sold here at Amazon, it&#x27;s simply the best oil I&#x27;ve ever put on my skin or in my hair.</li>
            <li>: Make sure you turn off the shower water and get a good lather and let it the soap sit on you skin for at least two minutes before rinsing it off.</li>
            <li>The other good thing about it is we have two Doxies</li>
            <li>This soap really removes my make up and gets my face and body sqeaky clean.</li>
            <li>The first was a container of black soap in putty form, however I am enjoying this soap better.     </li>
            <li>I have been using Dr. Brooners tea tree soap for years and was looking for something that cleaned a little better and had more benefits.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the product except there were little rocks and some larger size rocks or shells or something.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this soap to anyone who wants to feel squeaky clean. :)</li>
            <li>I am so happy with my purchase and will continue to use black soap as my main cleanser.</li>
            <li>The chunk I am using goes in a regular soap box plastic container that you get at the grocery store--I just make sure no water is in the container before I close it.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that it&#x27;s grainy.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s just the odd-looking chunk of what-the-heck you&#x27;ll encounter when you first lay eyes on</li>
            <li>I saw a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>there is plenty of sand in it, so if you care, maybe melt it in hot water, strain out the sand and remix</li>
            <li>it suds up great with little soap and if you pair it with shea butter after your shower say hello soft and even skin.</li>
            <li>We absolutely love how this soap works on the skin--so much healthier looking and actually has a glow.</li>
            <li>I ended up sending the soap back to the seller who was (thankfully) very cooperative and friendly and gave me a refund right away.</li>
            <li>You can really get the full benefits and feel very clean, there may be a slight tingling.</li>
            <li>You really have to try this soap.</li>
            <li>I really like ABS</li>
            <li>Like a lot of reviews said soap is very drying</li>
            <li>Anyway, I really recommend this soap and have passed it on to my family members.    </li>
            <li>so let me know how that might be accomplished.  </li>
            <li>In just one to two weeks, my skin has cleared up so much.  </li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>After usage, we both use Aveeno Baby Cream (with colloidal oatmeal) and our skin is much softer when used with this soap.</li>
            <li>I think this soap is going to be beneficial to my whole family.</li>
            <li>no odor when you soap up and makes a nice fluffy lather too.  </li>
            <li>You will love it and want to throw away your other soaps.</li>
            <li>This was about two years ago and last year I bought 5lbs (lasts a long time, and I have shared with friends and family, even though some of them did not appreciate it and what a waste of my wonderful soap.)</li>
            <li>I really like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but this is on a higher level completely.</li>
            <li>so I know it&#x27;s clean and no residue is left.</li>
            <li>But the smell is just a small price for such a great soap.  </li>
            <li>if feels like it&#x27;s made with a harsh saponifying agent like lye because it&#x27;s very strong and dries my skin out tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just absolutely love black soap.</li>
            <li>However, I highly recommend this soap if you have oily skin, blemishes or break-outs.  </li>
            <li>My wife and daughter have severe, severe eczema and this soap came highly recommended from a friend.</li>
            <li>Not only it cleans your skin, but it also nourishes your skin as well with all these rich natural oils.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a natural cleanser that would clean and clear my skin but not dry it out.</li>
            <li>if you want an all natural way to clear your skin W/O side effects buy this soap now!!!</li>
            <li>Give your skin some time to adjust to this soap though, instead of using it more than a couple times a day at first simply because it is slightly drying to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t have a mild, gentle soap that creates a lot of lather unless you add other lathering ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a high quality soap that produces lots of fine lather when you rub on the soap very slightly.</li>
            <li>First its natural, second it is veryy drying.</li>
            <li>Its pretty gross looking, but once I started to use it had a nice clean feel to it and the smell was not to bad.</li>
            <li>, both of them get very clean and shiny when I bathe them, the black one never has the white flakes on her when I use this soap.</li>
            <li>I recieved blob of black soap bagged up nicely with my other items and so far have been using for over a month.</li>
            <li>I suffer from moderate acne and this helped clear my skin up very well...</li>
            <li>And now that my wife and daughter have been taking antibiotics and using topical cream for their eczema, using the soap has begun to smooth out the rough areas affected by the eczema.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a abrasive soap to steer clear from chemicals compounds I would reccomend it.</li>
            <li>I tend to be very oily especially during the summer</li>
            <li>For storage, I put it in plastic ziplocs because I read that this soap is sensitive to moisture in the air and can &#x27;evaporate&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Only complaint is that it melts fast so make sure you have it in a soap dish with a lid or a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Wow, this soap lasts forever.</li>
            <li>, I never rubbed the soap directly on my body.</li>
            <li>Using a wash cloth, it will also last much longer, and forms a very rich and thick milky lather.</li>
            <li>very clean felling without the harsh chemical associated with the regular soaps out</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a natural product, clearly hand made, so it has some inconsistencies and some chunks, so do not rub the bar directly on your skin, but onto a wash cloth first.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive, sometimes acne prone skin and this soap although slightly drying cleared up my blemishes and made my face glow.</li>
            <li>The soap seemed to clean dirt from my face but it did not have a deep pore cleansing affect that I had expected.</li>
            <li>it was not only clean, but it felt moisturized -- not heavily, as with a moisture-rich commercial soap, but rather in a balanced sort of way, leading me to believe this simply adjusts your skin&#x27;s pH and both cleans deeply and leaves skin supple and hydrated without leaving residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it creates a lot of later because it is a strong, harsh soap.</li>
            <li>And even better than the fact that my skin is less oily, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry!!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only potentially negative thing, and really, who cares what the soap looks like when it works so fabulously?</li>
            <li>&quot; deep, and it&#x27;s soft (but firm) enough to slice easily and still hold up in cut-up, mini-bar form.</li>
            <li>Even though I am in my late 40s, I would still occasionally break out, but not any more.</li>
            <li>That might seem like a bad thing but when you have acne issues, its great.</li>
            <li>First, the down side</li>
            <li>This soap has a subtle natural scent and leaves you feeling clean with no residue.</li>
            <li>As I continued to use it my normally oily skin became excessively dry and irritated.</li>
            <li>The soap has virtually no odor--very very faint pleasant--</li>
            <li>My back looks more clear and feels less irritated already, and my face doesn&#x27;t feel as oily as it usually would by this time of day.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and altho</li>
            <li>Unlike pro-active this really did clear my skin as well, cleared black heads ive had on my face for years!</li>
            <li>to its performance, everything I&#x27;ve read about African Black Soap is apparently true: whatever your skin&#x27;s needs -- if you&#x27;re oily, or dry, or combination -- this stuff tackles it.</li>
            <li>Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to something I&#x27;ve eaten or that my face has come in contact with because my face broke out last night.</li>
            <li>The first time I washed with this soap, I was awe-struck: I have never felt cleaner after rinsing, and when I dried my face</li>
            <li>I was even breaking out in places where I normally didnt break out and it made my skin have this rough look to it.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used the soap on my face, yes, it was drying, so I started using it once daily and gradually working my way up to morning and evening use.  </li>
            <li>I really like black soap overall</li>
            <li>Skin does feel clean but this is only interesting, not pretty, no fragrance but doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this soap, it is clean my skin very good, the only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this soap is that make your skin dry.</li>
            <li> I cut the 1 pound brick into bars for ease of use, and do not let water splash onto the bar while in the shower, as it will wash away quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I was suffering from mild acne.</li>
            <li> Overall, this was a very worthwhile investment and we will continue to purchase the soap on an as-needed basis.</li>
            <li> , it is gentle, nothing artificial (good for our great nature), and it really provides all the wonderful \\&quot;things\\&quot; that other face cleaners promise (I have used a lot, Alba Face Cleaner one of my favorites, but it cannot beat this soap.)   </li>
            <li> A great oil to follow up with is Slice of Nature cold pressed, virgin Argan oil sold here at Amazon, it&#x27;s simply the best oil I&#x27;ve ever put on my skin or in my hair.</li>
            <li> : Make sure you turn off the shower water and get a good lather and let it the soap sit on you skin for at least two minutes before rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> The other good thing about it is we have two Doxies</li>
            <li> This soap really removes my make up and gets my face and body sqeaky clean.</li>
            <li> The first was a container of black soap in putty form, however I am enjoying this soap better.     </li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. Brooners tea tree soap for years and was looking for something that cleaned a little better and had more benefits.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the product except there were little rocks and some larger size rocks or shells or something.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this soap to anyone who wants to feel squeaky clean. :)</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase and will continue to use black soap as my main cleanser.</li>
            <li> The chunk I am using goes in a regular soap box plastic container that you get at the grocery store--I just make sure no water is in the container before I close it.  </li>
            <li> Be aware that it&#x27;s grainy.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just the odd-looking chunk of what-the-heck you&#x27;ll encounter when you first lay eyes on</li>
            <li> I saw a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> there is plenty of sand in it, so if you care, maybe melt it in hot water, strain out the sand and remix</li>
            <li> it suds up great with little soap and if you pair it with shea butter after your shower say hello soft and even skin.</li>
            <li> We absolutely love how this soap works on the skin--so much healthier looking and actually has a glow.</li>
            <li> I ended up sending the soap back to the seller who was (thankfully) very cooperative and friendly and gave me a refund right away.</li>
            <li> You can really get the full benefits and feel very clean, there may be a slight tingling.</li>
            <li> You really have to try this soap.</li>
            <li> I really like ABS</li>
            <li> Like a lot of reviews said soap is very drying</li>
            <li> Anyway, I really recommend this soap and have passed it on to my family members.    </li>
            <li> so let me know how that might be accomplished.  </li>
            <li> In just one to two weeks, my skin has cleared up so much.  </li>
            <li> I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> After usage, we both use Aveeno Baby Cream (with colloidal oatmeal) and our skin is much softer when used with this soap.</li>
            <li> I think this soap is going to be beneficial to my whole family.</li>
            <li> no odor when you soap up and makes a nice fluffy lather too.  </li>
            <li> You will love it and want to throw away your other soaps.</li>
            <li> This was about two years ago and last year I bought 5lbs (lasts a long time, and I have shared with friends and family, even though some of them did not appreciate it and what a waste of my wonderful soap.)</li>
            <li> I really like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but this is on a higher level completely.</li>
            <li> so I know it&#x27;s clean and no residue is left.</li>
            <li> But the smell is just a small price for such a great soap.  </li>
            <li> if feels like it&#x27;s made with a harsh saponifying agent like lye because it&#x27;s very strong and dries my skin out tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just absolutely love black soap.</li>
            <li> However, I highly recommend this soap if you have oily skin, blemishes or break-outs.  </li>
            <li> My wife and daughter have severe, severe eczema and this soap came highly recommended from a friend.</li>
            <li> Not only it cleans your skin, but it also nourishes your skin as well with all these rich natural oils.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a natural cleanser that would clean and clear my skin but not dry it out.</li>
            <li> if you want an all natural way to clear your skin W/O side effects buy this soap now!!!</li>
            <li> Give your skin some time to adjust to this soap though, instead of using it more than a couple times a day at first simply because it is slightly drying to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t have a mild, gentle soap that creates a lot of lather unless you add other lathering ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a high quality soap that produces lots of fine lather when you rub on the soap very slightly.</li>
            <li> First its natural, second it is veryy drying.</li>
            <li> Its pretty gross looking, but once I started to use it had a nice clean feel to it and the smell was not to bad.</li>
            <li> , both of them get very clean and shiny when I bathe them, the black one never has the white flakes on her when I use this soap.</li>
            <li> I recieved blob of black soap bagged up nicely with my other items and so far have been using for over a month.</li>
            <li> I suffer from moderate acne and this helped clear my skin up very well...</li>
            <li> And now that my wife and daughter have been taking antibiotics and using topical cream for their eczema, using the soap has begun to smooth out the rough areas affected by the eczema.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a abrasive soap to steer clear from chemicals compounds I would reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I tend to be very oily especially during the summer</li>
            <li> For storage, I put it in plastic ziplocs because I read that this soap is sensitive to moisture in the air and can &#x27;evaporate&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it melts fast so make sure you have it in a soap dish with a lid or a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Wow, this soap lasts forever.</li>
            <li> , I never rubbed the soap directly on my body.</li>
            <li> Using a wash cloth, it will also last much longer, and forms a very rich and thick milky lather.</li>
            <li> very clean felling without the harsh chemical associated with the regular soaps out</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a natural product, clearly hand made, so it has some inconsistencies and some chunks, so do not rub the bar directly on your skin, but onto a wash cloth first.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive, sometimes acne prone skin and this soap although slightly drying cleared up my blemishes and made my face glow.</li>
            <li> The soap seemed to clean dirt from my face but it did not have a deep pore cleansing affect that I had expected.</li>
            <li> it was not only clean, but it felt moisturized -- not heavily, as with a moisture-rich commercial soap, but rather in a balanced sort of way, leading me to believe this simply adjusts your skin&#x27;s pH and both cleans deeply and leaves skin supple and hydrated without leaving residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it creates a lot of later because it is a strong, harsh soap.</li>
            <li> And even better than the fact that my skin is less oily, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only potentially negative thing, and really, who cares what the soap looks like when it works so fabulously?</li>
            <li> &quot; deep, and it&#x27;s soft (but firm) enough to slice easily and still hold up in cut-up, mini-bar form.</li>
            <li> Even though I am in my late 40s, I would still occasionally break out, but not any more.</li>
            <li> That might seem like a bad thing but when you have acne issues, its great.</li>
            <li> First, the down side</li>
            <li> This soap has a subtle natural scent and leaves you feeling clean with no residue.</li>
            <li> As I continued to use it my normally oily skin became excessively dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> The soap has virtually no odor--very very faint pleasant--</li>
            <li> My back looks more clear and feels less irritated already, and my face doesn&#x27;t feel as oily as it usually would by this time of day.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and altho</li>
            <li> Unlike pro-active this really did clear my skin as well, cleared black heads ive had on my face for years!</li>
            <li> to its performance, everything I&#x27;ve read about African Black Soap is apparently true: whatever your skin&#x27;s needs -- if you&#x27;re oily, or dry, or combination -- this stuff tackles it.</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to something I&#x27;ve eaten or that my face has come in contact with because my face broke out last night.</li>
            <li> The first time I washed with this soap, I was awe-struck: I have never felt cleaner after rinsing, and when I dried my face</li>
            <li> I was even breaking out in places where I normally didnt break out and it made my skin have this rough look to it.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used the soap on my face, yes, it was drying, so I started using it once daily and gradually working my way up to morning and evening use.  </li>
            <li> I really like black soap overall</li>
            <li> Skin does feel clean but this is only interesting, not pretty, no fragrance but doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my body a few times and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much, nor did it break me out into an itchy rash which is a major plus.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found the right mix so it still separates but at least it&#x27;s not leaving my skin irritated and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the soap looks dark and nasty and doesn&#x27;t have that fragrance smell to it like the other natural soap that has lavenadar, it&#x27;s still better than those other natural soaps, even better than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Natural Soap.</li>
            <li> Two small and one large.  </li>
            <li> It did come flat in a block not the cylinder--easier to mail that way.  </li>
            <li> so if you take care of it this will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> If not then it wont last very long.</li>
            <li> It was starting to peel, it was dry and burning.</li>
            <li> In the morning, the acne has dried up considerably.</li>
            <li> I ran to the bathroom and washed my face, after a long day at school my face was oily.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way especially if you use it only for your face.</li>
            <li> I also &#x27;dry&#x27; it off after use since leaving it in a soap dish can also accelerate it&#x27;s ability to evaporate.  </li>
            <li> I have a water softener my skin still gets dry but not with this soap.</li>
            <li> shower/shampoo his hairline is often dry and flakey&#x27; even inside his ears, but with this soap it dosen&#x27;t dry his skin.</li>
            <li> Even when I would follow with moisturizer it would still feel extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Alittle goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> My husband have very dry skin after</li>
            <li> and I only used this for a few days.</li>
            <li> I had to be really careful</li>
            <li> A pound of African soap like this is about as big as a woman&#x27;s hand spread out--if that gives you an idea of size and it is about 2 1/2\\&quot; to 3\\&quot; thick.  </li>
            <li> I was a little confused at first about to use it.</li>
            <li> REMEMBER- purchase only the raw African black soap and not the soap shaped bars that are black.</li>
            <li> I use Aveeno moisturizer in the morning after washing my face because the soap does tend to dry my skin, but at night I use nothing but the black soap.</li>
            <li> but it drys it also,so a little moisturizer is needed after using the African black soap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wet and smoothed, it looks like brown-and-black mottled marble, which is a bonus because when it comes out of the package it is probably the ugliest personal hygiene product you&#x27;ll ever purchase; however, if you were told it was made of dark chocolate and raw nut butters, you&#x27;d want to grab a spoon --</li>
            <li> I have used this soap of and on but never consistently until now.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this will replace all my other face cleansers</li>
            <li> it is from other oils (palm, coconut</li>
            <li> It is clearing up my skin and my dark spots/</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and shampoo usually will dry it out and make it frizz.</li>
            <li> But all you have to do is pinch a small piece (a little goes a long way) and add water.</li>
            <li> ARRIVED A LITTLE LATE BUT CAME IN ENOUGH TIME.</li>
            <li> They used the soap for two weeks and could tell a slight difference, but nothing monumental.</li>
            <li> I never knew this stuff existed until a week ago when my daughter saw Black Soap on Pinterest and expressed interest.</li>
            <li> From reading previous reviews people have said that this soap can also be used as a shampoo</li>
            <li> It also does not bother me that there a little rocks in it.</li>
            <li> I saw a video on YouTube where the lady washes her face with African black soap, applies a thin layer of 100% Shea butter, and then applies a thin layer of  African black soap on the acne (at night).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought black soaps in the past, but they were imitations with black coloring that would come off on washcloths.</li>
            <li> so couple this with a little raw shea butter or black seed oil</li>
            <li> It is a little weird looking, but that&#x27;s because it is so natural</li>
            <li> and it goes away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> : My soap did not look like the round cylinder in the advertisement.  </li>
            <li> I have had cystic acne which is just the worst kind.  </li>
            <li> It dried up a pimple I had almost overnight.</li>
            <li> This worked very well for getting rid of the blemishes on my face and those awful pimple-looking white spots I had on my upper arms.</li>
            <li> It crumbles so is a bit messy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes or the dogs eyes as it burns pretty badly.</li>
            <li> I also use raw shea butter at night after cleansing my face and the acne scars are fading.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and I&#x27;m no spring chicken either.</li>
            <li> My wife, however, has been using it on her face in lieu of her usual face wash (she doesn&#x27;t wear make-up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for the past month</li>
            <li> i use it for shaving no more shaving cream and</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this soap as a shaving soap and it is too hard to use, causing irritation and burning on my skin, almost as if there is remaining lye or ash in the mixture.  </li>
            <li> Everyone should try this at least once.</li>
            <li> but i usually apply a thin layer of jojoba oil after and that usually clears that problem up.</li>
            <li> Just because it didnt work for me doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> This is false advertising.</li>
            <li> End of this very long review: buy it, and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I received my package in the mail, meaning I was expecting to see the size in the picture that I seen on-line, instead I received a brick size of black soap.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations and the smell wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ugly looking soap and doesn&#x27;t have a soapy-pretty scent.  </li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed with this soap.</li>
            <li> It is disgustingly terrible, but you will start to get used to it</li>
            <li> So even though it looks nasty it does seem to do the job</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this soap! This soap really removes my make up and gets my face and body sqeaky clean. My ance scars are fading out already and I only used this for a few days. Leaves my skin super soft and makes a great make up remover and u can even remove ur eye shadow. You really have to try this soap. You will love it and want to throw away your other soaps.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive, sometimes acne prone skin and this soap although slightly drying cleared up my blemishes and made my face glow. I used this on my body a few times and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much, nor did it break me out into an itchy rash which is a major plus. A little bit goes a very long way especially if you use it only for your face. Give your skin some time to adjust to this soap though, instead of using it more than a couple times a day at first simply because it is slightly drying to sensitive skin. A great oil to follow up with is Slice of Nature cold pressed, virgin Argan oil sold here at Amazon, it&#x27;s simply the best oil I&#x27;ve ever put on my skin or in my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like ABS but I don&#x27;t like rocks in my soap. I used it all but with a side-eye...</li>
            <li> Like a lot of reviews said soap is very drying so I made a body oil using coconut oil, bio oil and Shea butter. My skin is so soft and I&#x27;m no spring chicken either.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality soap that produces lots of fine lather when you rub on the soap very slightly. Not only it cleans your skin, but it also nourishes your skin as well with all these rich natural oils. It cleans your skin and you feel refreshed. I love this soap! BEST SOAP I HAVE EVER TRIED. Although the soap looks dark and nasty and doesn&#x27;t have that fragrance smell to it like the other natural soap that has lavenadar, it&#x27;s still better than those other natural soaps, even better than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Natural Soap.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best soap I have ever used. I really like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but this is on a higher level completely. I use this to wash everything, including my hair. I can be a bit drying, so couple this with a little raw shea butter or black seed oil and you&#x27;re all set, nothing else is needed. My skin has never been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a natural product, clearly hand made, so it has some inconsistencies and some chunks, so do not rub the bar directly on your skin, but onto a wash cloth first. Using a wash cloth, it will also last much longer, and forms a very rich and thick milky lather. I cut the 1 pound brick into bars for ease of use, and do not let water splash onto the bar while in the shower, as it will wash away quickly.</li>
            <li> I received this soap in a plastic type bag and it arrived just fine.  It did come flat in a block not the cylinder--easier to mail that way.  A pound of African soap like this is about as big as a woman&#x27;s hand spread out--if that gives you an idea of size and it is about 2 1/2\\&quot; to 3\\&quot; thick.  I actually thought it would be bigger.  I cut mine in chunks and put in a zip lock bag and then in a glass kitchen container and put in a closet--to keep the moisture from it.  The chunk I am using goes in a regular soap box plastic container that you get at the grocery store--I just make sure no water is in the container before I close it.  My soap has stayed just fine.  I am very happy with the product and hope to order again and again.  The soap has virtually no odor--very very faint pleasant--no odor when you soap up and makes a nice fluffy lather too.  I do not find it drying to the skin as some others have said.  I am in my 50&#x27;s--not a teenager with oily skin.  Anyway, I really recommend this soap and have passed it on to my family members.    Update: my husband and I love this soap so much we are re-ordering. I have given the soap to step-daughter who has a baby who gets rashes from something--could it be chemicals and petroleum products?  I am guessing yes. Will update with his results later. I also am giving soap to parents. We absolutely love how this soap works on the skin--so much healthier looking and actually has a glow. I think the smell is clean smelling almost like Ivory soap but woodier. Just simply LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This soap is great! First its natural, second it is veryy drying. That might seem like a bad thing but when you have acne issues, its great. I saw a video on YouTube where the lady washes her face with African black soap, applies a thin layer of 100% Shea butter, and then applies a thin layer of  African black soap on the acne (at night). In the morning, the acne has dried up considerably. Great tip! Loved the video, lovee this soap!</li>
            <li> Everything you ever heard about this soap is true!  I have been using it for just two weeks and I have noticed a difference in the quality of my skin.  I tend to be very oily especially during the summer and I have noticed that I&#x27;m not as oily.  It&#x27;s an ugly looking soap and doesn&#x27;t have a soapy-pretty scent.  However, I highly recommend this soap if you have oily skin, blemishes or break-outs.  I ordered a pound and broke it into three pieces.  Two small and one large.  I am only using it for my face, so it should last me a year!  Not bad for a $12.00 investment!    For storage, I put it in plastic ziplocs because I read that this soap is sensitive to moisture in the air and can &#x27;evaporate&#x27;.  I also &#x27;dry&#x27; it off after use since leaving it in a soap dish can also accelerate it&#x27;s ability to evaporate.  REMEMBER- purchase only the raw African black soap and not the soap shaped bars that are black.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap about a month ago and I absolutely love it.  I suffer from moderate acne and this helped clear my skin up very well...however, I now have acne scars that remain.  This soap is GREAT to remove make-up and your face and/or body will feel refreshingly clean after every use.  I have been using raw/natural shea butter at night to help with the acne scarring.  I definitely recommend this soap to anyone who wants to feel squeaky clean. :)</li>
            <li> I just want to start off by saying that, I was expecting this product to get here on June 8th and it ended up getting here June 2nd, which absolutely made my day :) As soon as I opened the box and saw this ugly hunk of soap sitting on the counter I knew it was love. I ran to the bathroom and washed my face, after a long day at school my face was oily. It didn&#x27;t take much soap to work up a nice lather and I used the soap again last night when I showered, I already am seeing results. My back looks more clear and feels less irritated already, and my face doesn&#x27;t feel as oily as it usually would by this time of day. The scent isn&#x27;t anything impressive, but I am sure that if you really wanted to you could put a natural oil like lavender oil onto the soap or something. All in all, and this coming from a teenager who struggles with oily skin, this soap is already working wonders, and I can&#x27;t wait to see how much more this soap helps! And even better than the fact that my skin is less oily, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry!! This soap is just perfect, it may not be the cutest soap in the world, but looks definitely aren&#x27;t everything!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap several times and decided to review it. I love the soap for my skin and my hair. I have curly hair and shampoo usually will dry it out and make it frizz. This soap is so nice to use. I can shampoo once and when I rinse I can hear it squeak so I know it&#x27;s clean and no residue is left. I live in a dry climate and altho I have a water softener my skin still gets dry but not with this soap. It lathers good and rinses clean. The only thing us there is no fragrance but I guess that would be defeating the purpose. The other good thing about it is we have two Doxies and I use it on them, both of them get very clean and shiny when I bathe them, the black one never has the white flakes on her when I use this soap. Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes or the dogs eyes as it burns pretty badly.</li>
            <li> I bought this item months back and started using it immediately twice a day. After only a short 2 weeks my husband as well as myself saw a diffrence! Unlike pro-active this really did clear my skin as well, cleared black heads ive had on my face for years! if you want an all natural way to clear your skin W/O side effects buy this soap now!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this soap since when it was $5.75/lb or $25.00/5 lbs. This was about two years ago and last year I bought 5lbs (lasts a long time, and I have shared with friends and family, even though some of them did not appreciate it and what a waste of my wonderful soap.) Let me start with the cons: the smell. It is disgustingly terrible, but you will start to get used to it and it goes away in a few minutes. If you wash your hair with it (and my mom does, even though I do not recommend it) the smell will stay until the next wash. But the smell is just a small price for such a great soap.  It removes makeup as well as mascara (feels like you never had it on)- you do not need a makeup remover. It softens your skin, dries the acnes (even during pms-ing), it is gentle, nothing artificial (good for our great nature), and it really provides all the wonderful \\&quot;things\\&quot; that other face cleaners promise (I have used a lot, Alba Face Cleaner one of my favorites, but it cannot beat this soap.)   End of this very long review: buy it, and you will not be disappointed. Now if only the price would stop increasing...</li>
            <li> First, the down side: My soap did not look like the round cylinder in the advertisement.  That&#x27;s the only potentially negative thing, and really, who cares what the soap looks like when it works so fabulously? It came in a plastic tub and looked like a piece of log; my kids say it looks like bread pudding. ;-p    This is truly the best soap I have ever used, and  I&#x27;ve used quite a few, drugstore brands, dept. store brands, spa brands, mail-order brands.  The first few times I used the soap on my face, yes, it was drying, so I started using it once daily and gradually working my way up to morning and evening use.  I have had cystic acne which is just the worst kind.  Even though I am in my late 40s, I would still occasionally break out, but not any more. I also use raw shea butter at night after cleansing my face and the acne scars are fading. My skin is even more beautiful than the times when I was pregnant. People comment that my skin is glowing and its true.  I also use the soap as my shampoo because I love how it is so cleansing and rinses easily. My skin is this soap&#x27;s testimony and now I have my teen-aged sons using it. Their acne breakouts are clearing up too.  I cannot say enough for this soap.</li>
            <li> its good on cleaning the skin but it drys it also,so a little moisturizer is needed after using the African black soap.</li>
            <li> Alittle goes a very long way! My skin tone has evened out since using this product as well. I suggest using this product in the shower.  Be aware that it&#x27;s grainy. I use this in combination with Unrefined Shea Butter.  This is my 3rd week using this product. Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to something I&#x27;ve eaten or that my face has come in contact with because my face broke out last night. I cleaned my face with this product again last night.I&#x27;ll review again after I see if it helps that as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this soap 5 times. For my family and friends, I have a teenager, he used it and his friends saw an improvement in his acne they wanted some. My husband have very dry skin after shower/shampoo his hairline is often dry and flakey&#x27; even inside his ears, but with this soap it dosen&#x27;t dry his skin. With daily use it keeps the flakes away.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter have severe, severe eczema and this soap came highly recommended from a friend. I read the reviews and decided to make the purchase. They used the soap for two weeks and could tell a slight difference, but nothing monumental. My wife, however, has been using it on her face in lieu of her usual face wash (she doesn&#x27;t wear make-up but maybe two or three times a month), and she and I can both tell a difference in how smooth her skin is. And now that my wife and daughter have been taking antibiotics and using topical cream for their eczema, using the soap has begun to smooth out the rough areas affected by the eczema. I would not rely solely on the soap to cure eczema, but I would recommend using it in harmony with medication prescribed by your doctor. Overall, this was a very worthwhile investment and we will continue to purchase the soap on an as-needed basis.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I was suffering from mild acne. The soap seemed to clean dirt from my face but it did not have a deep pore cleansing affect that I had expected. If you are looking for a abrasive soap to steer clear from chemicals compounds I would reccomend it. but if you are suffering from acne look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Its pretty gross looking, but once I started to use it had a nice clean feel to it and the smell was not to bad. So even though it looks nasty it does seem to do the job and I&#x27;ll keep using it and see how it goes. I do like knowing that it doesn&#x27;t have tons of chemicals in it and thats a big plus. I am hoping it will help with my acne.</li>
            <li> I never knew this stuff existed until a week ago when my daughter saw Black Soap on Pinterest and expressed interest. I searched it on Amazon.com, found it, bought it, got it... and LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a 1-lb. brick, so there&#x27;s plenty to share. Ours came in sort of a semicircular wedge about 7\\&quot; across and 1-1/2\\&quot; deep, and it&#x27;s soft (but firm) enough to slice easily and still hold up in cut-up, mini-bar form. I simply sliced off what I needed for daily use to keep atop my bathroom vanity, and stored the rest in a zip-seal plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it&#x27;s wet and smoothed, it looks like brown-and-black mottled marble, which is a bonus because when it comes out of the package it is probably the ugliest personal hygiene product you&#x27;ll ever purchase; however, if you were told it was made of dark chocolate and raw nut butters, you&#x27;d want to grab a spoon -- that&#x27;s just the odd-looking chunk of what-the-heck you&#x27;ll encounter when you first lay eyes on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to its performance, everything I&#x27;ve read about African Black Soap is apparently true: whatever your skin&#x27;s needs -- if you&#x27;re oily, or dry, or combination -- this stuff tackles it. The first time I washed with this soap, I was awe-struck: I have never felt cleaner after rinsing, and when I dried my face it was not only clean, but it felt moisturized -- not heavily, as with a moisture-rich commercial soap, but rather in a balanced sort of way, leading me to believe this simply adjusts your skin&#x27;s pH and both cleans deeply and leaves skin supple and hydrated without leaving residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this stuff over and over, because I truly think, given it also seems to calm my eczema, that I have found the perfect soap, and the last one I will ever need.</li>
            <li> Although the image in the ad was not the product I received, what was sent was was usable, and very well liked. I would however like to receive the product advertised so let me know how that might be accomplished.  Thank you.  Carlene.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I love this soap. It met my expectations and the smell wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> In just one to two weeks, my skin has cleared up so much.  Just just the acne, but it has even my skin tone quite a bit. Worth it!</li>
            <li> I just absolutely love black soap. It is the only thing that I can use on my face that actually clears up my skin. I have really oily skin and this has helped with the controling the oil in my face without leaving me feeling dryed out. I pair it with Argon oil for my face and have the perfect acne solution. Not only is it a great face was but I love to wash my body with it as well it suds up great with little soap and if you pair it with shea butter after your shower say hello soft and even skin. Only complaint is that it melts fast so make sure you have it in a soap dish with a lid or a plastic bag. If not then it wont last very long. I make about 4-5 bars out of 1lb so if you take care of it this will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. Brooners tea tree soap for years and was looking for something that cleaned a little better and had more benefits. I really like black soap overall, this is my second purchase. The first was a container of black soap in putty form, however I am enjoying this soap better.     Tip: Make sure you turn off the shower water and get a good lather and let it the soap sit on you skin for at least two minutes before rinsing it off. You can really get the full benefits and feel very clean, there may be a slight tingling.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt cleaner and smoother in my life. Everyone should try this at least once. I will never use anything else for my face again.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap of and on but never consistently until now. I really enjoy the way the soap is keeping my skin clean and clearing up my acne and age spots. I truly suggest that if you haven&#x27;t tried this soap, please go out and purchase it.It really works.</li>
            <li> I recieved blob of black soap bagged up nicely with my other items and so far have been using for over a month. This soap has a subtle natural scent and leaves you feeling clean with no residue. i do feel that it can be a bit drying but i usually apply a thin layer of jojoba oil after and that usually clears that problem up. From reading previous reviews people have said that this soap can also be used as a shampoo but when i tried this multiple times it would always leave my hair looking and feeling \\&quot;greesy\\&quot;. Overall great body/face soap that is perfect for all skin types alike!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for the past month and I must say that I&#x27;m loving it. It is clearing up my skin and my dark spots/blemishes are getting smaller and lightening up also. I am so happy with my purchase and will continue to use black soap as my main cleanser. I use Aveeno moisturizer in the morning after washing my face because the soap does tend to dry my skin, but at night I use nothing but the black soap. Hopefully this will replace all my other face cleansers</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have oily skin, so breakouts can be a problem. I was searching for a natural cleanser that would clean and clear my skin but not dry it out. This was the answer. I saw a difference after the first use. It not only cleared my skin but also evened out my skin tone. It can also be used to wash your body or hair. I was a little confused at first about to use it. But all you have to do is pinch a small piece (a little goes a long way) and add water. Make a rich lather and apply. That simple.</li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed with this soap. The first day I used it, it was okay. It dried up a pimple I had almost overnight. As I continued to use it my normally oily skin became excessively dry and irritated. Even when I would follow with moisturizer it would still feel extremely dry. I wanted to give it a fair chance so I continued to use it. After about a week I couldnt take it anymore. My skin was SO irritated. It was starting to peel, it was dry and burning. I was even breaking out in places where I normally didnt break out and it made my skin have this rough look to it. My skin was better off BEFORE I started using this horrid soap. I ended up sending the soap back to the seller who was (thankfully) very cooperative and friendly and gave me a refund right away. I do not recommend this soap at all, but everyone is different. Just because it didnt work for me doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> Really great soap. I&#x27;ve bought black soaps in the past, but they were imitations with black coloring that would come off on washcloths. This soap doesn&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Just after 1 use, my skin feels more moisturized. My baby daughter has very mild eczema and her skin seems softer too. After usage, we both use Aveeno Baby Cream (with colloidal oatmeal) and our skin is much softer when used with this soap. I think this soap is going to be beneficial to my whole family. It is a little weird looking, but that&#x27;s because it is so natural and we are used to the chemically processed soap. I will update after a week or so of use and note any pros or cons...</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP VERY CLEAN SMELL AND THE BEST PRICE I&#x27;VE FOUND ONLINE . YOU FEEL REALLY CLEAN USING THIS AND IT&#x27;S A CLEAN SOAP AS WELL</li>
            <li> very clean felling without the harsh chemical associated with the regular soaps out there.&lt;br /&gt;the best part  i use it for shaving no more shaving cream and it  is excellent for shaving .&lt;br /&gt;just beware there are some grainy feel to eat but lathers up well in my palm i don&#x27;t need to put it on my face&lt;br /&gt;over all love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and I love this stuff, it works excellent for acne.  So this is something I&#x27;ll keep in my daily beauty routine.  Just need more than a pound now since I use it so much.</li>
            <li> Wow, this soap lasts forever. Yes, it&#x27;s true that it comes packaged in a baggie, this does not bother me. It also does not bother me that there a little rocks in it. It works very well, and I am more than happy with this soap.</li>
            <li> SMELLS LIKE CRAYON AND TOO BIG SHOULD HAVE BEEN CUT INTO SQUARES PER USE. ARRIVED A LITTLE LATE BUT CAME IN ENOUGH TIME.</li>
            <li> 1) this soap is not from shea butter. it is from other oils (palm, coconut I believe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) if feels like it&#x27;s made with a harsh saponifying agent like lye because it&#x27;s very strong and dries my skin out tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) it creates a lot of later because it is a strong, harsh soap. You can&#x27;t have a mild, gentle soap that creates a lot of lather unless you add other lathering ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this soap as a shaving soap and it is too hard to use, causing irritation and burning on my skin, almost as if there is remaining lye or ash in the mixture.  To overcome this I&#x27;ve made it into a liquid soap and added a bunch of shea butter to soften it and replenish the oils removed. This has made it much softer and more gentile. I haven&#x27;t found the right mix so it still separates but at least it&#x27;s not leaving my skin irritated and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also there is plenty of sand in it, so if you care, maybe melt it in hot water, strain out the sand and remix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;remember Amazon aggregates lots of reviews so this may only apply to one source or distributor.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I received my package in the mail, meaning I was expecting to see the size in the picture that I seen on-line, instead I received a brick size of black soap. He or she need to put a picture of the size that you will receive in your package. This is false advertising.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the product except there were little rocks and some larger size rocks or shells or something. I had to be really careful, I never rubbed the soap directly on my body.</li>
            <li> This worked very well for getting rid of the blemishes on my face and those awful pimple-looking white spots I had on my upper arms. I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for more than 4 days. I alternate using this soap and regular one.</li>
            <li> Like the rating says -- It&#x27;s okay... It crumbles so is a bit messy. Skin does feel clean but this is only interesting, not pretty, no fragrance but doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.  I&#x27;ll use it up but wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it is clean my skin very good, the only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this soap is that make your skin dry. Every time when I wash my face with this soap, I apply coconut oil on it and the result is excellent, your skin is soft and smooth. I would definitely recommend this soap, because I like how my skin looks after using it.</li>
