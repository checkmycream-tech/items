            <li>This one is perfect and not bulky at all.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m doing the best I can here,</li>
            <li>luck to all hunting for their perfect dental</li>
            <li>(The rest of theirs are good though!)</li>
            <li>(Good thing the manufacturer lets you return them for any reason!)</li>
            <li>Quite happy with this product.</li>
            <li>great it helped a lot</li>
            <li>great product as advertised</li>
            <li>This is the BEST mouth piece I have ever used, the fit is perfert.</li>
            <li>I did not slobber, using this guard, which was one good thing.</li>
            <li>Thus, I&#x27;m much more rested.</li>
            <li>The good news is I realized my dentist&#x27;s guard is worth wearing.</li>
            <li>I tend to feel it&#x27;s presence more in my mouth though</li>
            <li>I tend to feel it&#x27;s presence more in my mouth though</li>
            <li>Feel like I clench my teeth more when I wear it to bed.  </li>
            <li>It was just okay, which is why I chose not to spend the money on it again this time and went with this cheaper version.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the most comfortable...</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good product</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure this would be the case for most everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is fine with me because I think wearing something in your mouth should be replaced this often.</li>
            <li>Comfort (this is like the secure, but even stronger....</li>
            <li>I could not get it into a comfortable position.  </li>
            <li>I had the same problem with a Dentek guard that was similar- great idea just not so great in practice.  </li>
            <li>You could use a denture soak, I guess, but most dental guards are pretty easy to clean with soap and water or toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m aware that that isn&#x27;t the most helpful description in the world...</li>
            <li>But now that I&#x27;ve become more aware of it, and have been wearing these guards for 8 years, I can get away with the Slim)years, I can get away with the Slim)</li>
            <li>(we are all unique after all).</li>
            <li>Perfect size for small mouths</li>
            <li>I clean it by rinsing it with water then soaking it in mouthwash in the morning.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still looking for the right one!  </li>
            <li>and this one was as good as the last one.  </li>
            <li>I have bought a number of these type of guards and this one just doesn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
            <li>Sleep Right&#x27;s guards- the Secure Comfort.  </li>
            <li>This product quickly went in the trash</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like having to wear one of these, but this one seems to be the most comfortable one I&#x27;ve found so far...</li>
            <li>I read the reviews before purchasing and I thought the new bite pads design may work more effectively for my constant teeth grinding.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of putting it in some extremely hot water to clean it and melted the skinny piece that attaches the two sides together...really pissed me off...</li>
            <li>From my own personal experience, the SleepRight products that I would recommend are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)  </li>
            <li>Right dental guards for 3 years</li>
            <li>Delivered very fast and works great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t think the soft silicone would hold up to the wear and tear, but it does just fine.</li>
            <li>Cause I didn&#x27;t at first....</li>
            <li>Comfort (which is my personal favorite....</li>
            <li>It was my first mouth guard, and I chewed through it in a year...</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;swivel&amp;#34; action on the bite pads is basically non-existent, so it doesn&#x27;t fit as well.....</li>
            <li>you have a smaller mouth, perhaps this would work OK for you</li>
            <li>Go with the most updated recent, instead.</li>
            <li>Its way better then traditional dental guards, but</li>
            <li>I have been sleeping using this item for over 1 week now, and have decided that it is (a little bit) better than I had originally thought.</li>
            <li>; (dark blue on the box, and says &amp;#34;2X Stronger&amp;#34;) is the model I find to be most comfortable, but it&#x27;s not quite as secure, and doesn&#x27;t provide quite as much protection as the &amp;#34;Dura Comfort&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; (dark blue on the box, and says &amp;#34;2X Stronger&amp;#34;) is the model I find to be most comfortable, but it&#x27;s not quite as secure, and doesn&#x27;t provide quite as much protection as the &amp;#34;Dura Comfort&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Until I find what I&#x27;m looking for, I may go back to the Sleep Right Secure Comfort.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn it enough to see if its well made, but it was easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li>It is a comfortable guard, but as a few people have mentioned, you can easily slide it around from grinding at night.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth paying a little more for the Slim Comfort model.  </li>
            <li>; I&#x27;ve found this one to be the most comfortable, at least for me.</li>
            <li>It looks just like the Slim Fit version, so I didn&#x27;t bother reading further into.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re a real chomper, you&#x27;ll go through it</li>
            <li>Fits and stays in all night, really helps with my grinding and clenched teeth.</li>
            <li>It also feels as though it wants to slide out (sideways), instead of providing the needed bite</li>
            <li>I really like the Slim Comfort model.  </li>
            <li>Also stays in your mouth the whole night.</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t give you much protection, and isn&#x27;t that the point?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*Secure Comfort (is slightly less comfortable, cause it has extra pads that sit up by your top teeth to keep the guard in place)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The material on all of these is soft enough to be comfortable, but I don&#x27;t think it provides much support in keeping the guard in place.  </li>
            <li>; (dark blue on the box, and says &amp;#34;4X Stronger&amp;#34;) is the most secure, and the longest lasting.</li>
            <li>; (dark blue on the box, and says &amp;#34;4X Stronger&amp;#34;) is the most secure, and the longest lasting.</li>
            <li>This was the older version of the product.  </li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s better than the traditional bulky guards, mainly because I will actually wear these every night!!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>and I purchased a normal mouth gaurd.</li>
            <li>Just be careful how you clean it...</li>
            <li>I was only aware of three, until I got this.</li>
            <li>The size would have been OK as my mouth is fairly small.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to order this same item as long as it is available to order.</li>
            <li>The first two nights I woke with pieces of rubber in my cheek, and a horrendous gag reflex because it sits so far in the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li>Right has four different sizes/versions, apparently.</li>
            <li>Because the bite pads can&#x27;t wiggle, the part of the guard that goes across your lower teeth is fixed in it&#x27;s position as well...</li>
            <li>This dental guard is soft and more comfortable, although I wear it upside down because the front piece tends to be uncomfortable for me on my lower gums.</li>
            <li>This one has 6, but they are micro adjustments compared to it&#x27;s counterparts.. and the &amp;#34;last&amp;#34; setting.. or the one that would make it the &amp;#34;biggest&amp;#34; is about the same size as the FIRST setting on the the other guards.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for 1 night so far, and I did make it through the night, but I&#x27;m positive that it doesn&#x27;t provide the same bite-protection as the other SleepRight models that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The area connecting the bite plate has lots of places that bacteria can get in and these places are hard to reach in order to clean it thoroughly.  </li>

            <li> The model/style that I normally buy was not available on Amazon, and this model was cheaper (currently priced at $18.97), so I tried it.</li>
            <li> My main issue with this guard is that it is very difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> I was slightly concerned at first, thinking it might be too small and would get dislodged, but that hasn&#x27;t happened.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I like the new sliding style where the pads don&#x27;t rotate but been using it for a week now with no noticeable issues.</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;d still recommend getting one of the other SleepRight models though</li>
            <li> For myself, it was a complete waste of $18.97!</li>
            <li> Its too loose - it doesn&#x27;t stay in my mouth.</li>
            <li> If you are only need a little bit of protection, and comfort is a priority, this might work for you.</li>
            <li> It is a little less expensive than another brand - but the other brand fits much better.</li>
            <li> This guard rests only on few teeth making and</li>
            <li> Also, the bite guard tends to be a bit harder than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the bite guard tends to be a bit harder than I would like.  </li>
            <li> Noticeably smaller than the previous model, which translates to less discomfort for keeping it your mouth all night.  </li>
            <li> The pads that sit in between your teeth can&#x27;t rotate like their other guards, due to the adjustment joint being a fitted rectangle instead of a circle</li>
            <li> The other three guards have 4 adjustments.</li>
            <li> This guard does not protect against structural damage/shifting due to grinding, but it does seem to reduce the enamel wear.</li>
            <li> However I found this dental guard to be very hard and more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still convinced that this model provides a MINIMUM amount of protection, but it is also less intrusive than the other SleepRight models that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Go find their other ones!</li>
            <li> I think the backing where the teeth go down should be a little thinner, and flexible for the teeth to come down on.</li>
            <li> maybe my mouth is odd...</li>
            <li> I thought it was the same as their SleepRight Slim-Comfort, just in different packaging, but I was WRONG.</li>
            <li> These dental guards are also, but unfortunately this particular model does not come with the ultra durable bite material that some others do.</li>
            <li> Sleep Tight.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and the other guards hit my gums.</li>
            <li> I have trouble falling asleep with it in my mouth because it seems to slide around because it is not latched in like a retainer would be.  </li>
            <li> since Ii know I won&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll continue to wear this guard and slow down the damage.  </li>
            <li> (So yes... when you read about people complaining it&#x27;s too small... believe them.</li>
            <li> It seems way too small (for my mouth anyhow).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is small and fits well.</li>
            <li> (Yes, I was a hard core clincher)..</li>
            <li> I tried a cheaper brand, but the plastic that goes between your teeth was too hard</li>
            <li> It feels thick and akward.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a long and expensive road!  </li>

            <li> I clench my jaw and this has helped me stop while I&#x27;m sleeping.  Thus, I&#x27;m much more rested.</li>
            <li> Repeat customer (5x); I&#x27;ve found this one to be the most comfortable, at least for me. It lasts me about six months.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and the other guards hit my gums. This one is perfect and not bulky at all.</li>
            <li> Sleep Right has four different sizes/versions, apparently. I was only aware of three, until I got this. It looks just like the Slim Fit version, so I didn&#x27;t bother reading further into. This is their least expensive guard, and for a reason!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The pads that sit in between your teeth can&#x27;t rotate like their other guards, due to the adjustment joint being a fitted rectangle instead of a circle (And yes.... I&#x27;m aware that that isn&#x27;t the most helpful description in the world...but I&#x27;m doing the best I can here, people.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The other three guards have 4 adjustments. This one has 6, but they are micro adjustments compared to it&#x27;s counterparts.. and the &amp;#34;last&amp;#34; setting.. or the one that would make it the &amp;#34;biggest&amp;#34; is about the same size as the FIRST setting on the the other guards. (So yes... when you read about people complaining it&#x27;s too small... believe them. Cause I didn&#x27;t at first.... but now I understand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Because the bite pads can&#x27;t wiggle, the part of the guard that goes across your lower teeth is fixed in it&#x27;s position as well... And it&#x27;s a very uncomfortable one at that. It sits below your teeth on your gums...  I could only imagine the blisters it would give you if you kept using it. I don&#x27;t know... maybe my mouth is odd... but I&#x27;m pretty sure this would be the case for most everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just to clarify, you are looking at the SELECT version. Go find their other ones! Which are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Slim Comfort (which is my personal favorite.... it&#x27;s the most comfortable... but if you&#x27;re a real chomper, you&#x27;ll go through it fast)&lt;br /&gt;*Secure Comfort (is slightly less comfortable, cause it has extra pads that sit up by your top teeth to keep the guard in place)&lt;br /&gt;*Dura Comfort (this is like the secure, but even stronger.... It was my first mouth guard, and I chewed through it in a year... (Yes, I was a hard core clincher).. But now that I&#x27;ve become more aware of it, and have been wearing these guards for 8 years, I can get away with the Slim)years, I can get away with the Slim)</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like the new sliding style where the pads don&#x27;t rotate but been using it for a week now with no noticeable issues.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good product</li>
            <li> I had a guard made by my dentist that I found thick and uncomfortable and difficult to talk with.  So I decided to try another that is meant for the bottom teeth.  However I found this dental guard to be very hard and more uncomfortable. This guard rests only on few teeth making and the plastic bite guard does not flex.  It feels thick and akward.  I haven&#x27;t worn it enough to see if its well made, but it was easy to adjust.  The good news is I realized my dentist&#x27;s guard is worth wearing.</li>
            <li> I have bought a number of these type of guards and this one just doesn&#x27;t fit right. Its too loose - it doesn&#x27;t stay in my mouth. It is a little less expensive than another brand - but the other brand fits much better.</li>
            <li> Fits and stays in all night, really helps with my grinding and clenched teeth.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing and I thought the new bite pads design may work more effectively for my constant teeth grinding. Boy was I wrong!! The first two nights I woke with pieces of rubber in my cheek, and a horrendous gag reflex because it sits so far in the back of your mouth. Not satisfied! At all! This product quickly went in the trash and I purchased a normal mouth gaurd. This is a weird design that isn&#x27;t for everyone.</li>
            <li> ***Amazon refers to the model I am writing this review about as the &amp;#34;Select Comfort Dental Guard&amp;#34;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Review Update***  I have been sleeping using this item for over 1 week now, and have decided that it is (a little bit) better than I had originally thought. I&#x27;ve upgraded my rating from a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; to a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; because of this. I&#x27;m still convinced that this model provides a MINIMUM amount of protection, but it is also less intrusive than the other SleepRight models that I&#x27;ve used. If you are only need a little bit of protection, and comfort is a priority, this might work for you. Personally, I&#x27;d still recommend getting one of the other SleepRight models though (see below).&lt;br /&gt;..............................................................................................................................................................................................&lt;br /&gt;I have been using (several different versions of) SleepRight Dental Guard products nightly for a number of years now. The model/style that I normally buy was not available on Amazon, and this model was cheaper (currently priced at $18.97), so I tried it. I&#x27;m wondering now if this is perhaps intended for children? It seems way too small (for my mouth anyhow). I have only used it for 1 night so far, and I did make it through the night, but I&#x27;m positive that it doesn&#x27;t provide the same bite-protection as the other SleepRight models that I&#x27;ve used. The &amp;#34;swivel&amp;#34; action on the bite pads is basically non-existent, so it doesn&#x27;t fit as well.....the pads have to bend/flex in order to shape to your teeth. It also feels as though it wants to slide out (sideways), instead of providing the needed bite protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a smaller mouth, perhaps this would work OK for you (we are all unique after all). For myself, it was a complete waste of $18.97! I&#x27;ll be looking for a retailer who sells the model(s) that I&#x27;m used to using. From my own personal experience, the SleepRight products that I would recommend are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)  Amazon calls it.....&amp;#34;Dura Comfort Dental Night Guard&amp;#34; (dark blue on the box, and says &amp;#34;4X Stronger&amp;#34;) is the most secure, and the longest lasting. I tend to feel it&#x27;s presence more in my mouth though (cheek and gums). Also, the bite guard tends to be a bit harder than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.)  Amazon calls it....&amp;#34;Standard Select Low Profile Night Guard&amp;#34; (dark blue on the box, and says &amp;#34;2X Stronger&amp;#34;) is the model I find to be most comfortable, but it&#x27;s not quite as secure, and doesn&#x27;t provide quite as much protection as the &amp;#34;Dura Comfort&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleep Tight.recommend are:  1.)  Amazon calls it.....&amp;#34;Dura Comfort Dental Night Guard&amp;#34; (dark blue on the box, and says &amp;#34;4X Stronger&amp;#34;) is the most secure, and the longest lasting. I tend to feel it&#x27;s presence more in my mouth though (cheek and gums). Also, the bite guard tends to be a bit harder than I would like.  2.)  Amazon calls it....&amp;#34;Standard Select Low Profile Night Guard&amp;#34; (dark blue on the box, and says &amp;#34;2X Stronger&amp;#34;) is the model I find to be most comfortable, but it&#x27;s not quite as secure, and doesn&#x27;t provide quite as much protection as the &amp;#34;Dura Comfort&amp;#34;.  Sleep Tight.</li>
            <li> The add die this product has picture if the Dura comfort dental guard instead if what it was, thus I was not pleased to receive the wrong product. It was not what I thought I ordered.</li>
            <li> I have used Sleep Right dental guards for 3 years and this one was as good as the last one.  They will all wear out about after 3-6 months.  This is fine with me because I think wearing something in your mouth should be replaced this often.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST mouth piece I have ever used, the fit is perfert. I will continue to order this same item as long as it is available to order.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst of their mouthguards. I thought it was the same as their SleepRight Slim-Comfort, just in different packaging, but I was WRONG. This is so flimsy it twisted in my mouth and I bit through it in 2 weeks. Do Not Buy. (The rest of theirs are good though!)</li>
            <li> Noticeably smaller than the previous model, which translates to less discomfort for keeping it your mouth all night.  I was slightly concerned at first, thinking it might be too small and would get dislodged, but that hasn&#x27;t happened.  Quite happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having to wear one of these, but this one seems to be the most comfortable one I&#x27;ve found so far...Just be careful how you clean it...I made the mistake of putting it in some extremely hot water to clean it and melted the skinny piece that attaches the two sides together...really pissed me off...I only had it about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> great it helped a lot</li>
            <li> This was the older version of the product.  I would not purchase this same version again.  Go with the most updated recent, instead.</li>
            <li> I really like the Slim Comfort model.  With this model the bite pads do not rotate so I could not get it into a comfortable position.  The size would have been OK as my mouth is fairly small.  It&#x27;s definitely worth paying a little more for the Slim Comfort model.  I also tried the Dura Comfort, but it was way too bulky for me.  (Good thing the manufacturer lets you return them for any reason!)</li>
            <li> Perfect size for small mouths and it does the job protecting my teethes from grinding.  Also stays in your mouth the whole night.</li>
            <li> These dental guards are also, but unfortunately this particular model does not come with the ultra durable bite material that some others do.</li>
            <li> Delivered very fast and works great.&lt;br /&gt;It is small and fits well.</li>
            <li> This is like my 4th time I got it I just watch the price and bamm order one</li>
            <li> So uncomfortable.  Makes my jaw hurt.  Feel like I clench my teeth more when I wear it to bed.  I have trouble falling asleep with it in my mouth because it seems to slide around because it is not latched in like a retainer would be.  I bought this at the advice of my dentist and need to find a different solution for my teeth grinding at night. :(</li>
            <li> After having it in, all I could think about was this thing in my mouth. Its way better then traditional dental guards, but I think the backing where the teeth go down should be a little thinner, and flexible for the teeth to come down on. I did not slobber, using this guard, which was one good thing.</li>
            <li> great product as advertised</li>
            <li> My main issue with this guard is that it is very difficult to clean.  The area connecting the bite plate has lots of places that bacteria can get in and these places are hard to reach in order to clean it thoroughly.  You could use a denture soak, I guess, but most dental guards are pretty easy to clean with soap and water or toothpaste.  It is a comfortable guard, but as a few people have mentioned, you can easily slide it around from grinding at night.  That doesn&#x27;t give you much protection, and isn&#x27;t that the point?  I&#x27;ve had another one of Sleep Right&#x27;s guards- the Secure Comfort.  It was just okay, which is why I chose not to spend the money on it again this time and went with this cheaper version.&lt;br /&gt;I do like this type of guard that fits on your lower teeth rather than wear a big bulky one....but I&#x27;m still looking for the right one!  The material on all of these is soft enough to be comfortable, but I don&#x27;t think it provides much support in keeping the guard in place.  I had the same problem with a Dentek guard that was similar- great idea just not so great in practice.  Until I find what I&#x27;m looking for, I may go back to the Sleep Right Secure Comfort. I still think it&#x27;s better than the traditional bulky guards, mainly because I will actually wear these every night!!&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all hunting for their perfect dental guard- it&#x27;s a long and expensive road!  Hope this information helps.</li>
            <li> I have been using this same product for the last three years without any concerns.  I do wish I could just stop the grinding, but since Ii know I won&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll continue to wear this guard and slow down the damage.  This guard does not protect against structural damage/shifting due to grinding, but it does seem to reduce the enamel wear.</li>
            <li> i like this because i grind my teeth at night and this keeps my teeth protected.  my dentist says i&#x27;ll tend to need crowns</li>
            <li> I have a horrible teeth grinding problem when I sleep. I tried a cheaper brand, but the plastic that goes between your teeth was too hard and I still had problems with headaches and sore jaw. This dental guard is soft and more comfortable, although I wear it upside down because the front piece tends to be uncomfortable for me on my lower gums. You wouldn&#x27;t think the soft silicone would hold up to the wear and tear, but it does just fine. I clean it by rinsing it with water then soaking it in mouthwash in the morning.</li>
