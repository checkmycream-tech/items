            <li> I LOVE Alterna Caviar Anti Aging Rapid Repair Spray Instant Shine and Moisture!  It has been a game a changer in the way my hair looks and feels.  Perfect in the winter months, when hair tends to be drier and frizzier.  Just spray a little on the damaged areas, and my hair looks amazing!  It&#x27;s calm and the smell is incredible!  Cheapest I&#x27;ve found this pricey product is from an Amazon vendor.  ENJOY!:)</li>
            <li> Love the smell and what it does for my hair.  Keeps it glossy and shiny.  Turns my hair to a million bucks instantly.</li>
            <li> As expected, thankyou</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best! Added shine with a fine mist, just don&#x27;t overspray or gets crunchy. Smells lovely, vaguely grape.</li>
            <li> It did take a bit longer than hoped, but I was very satisfied with the product! Saved me time and money!</li>
            <li> best product around. I use it while flat ironing my hair. been trying other products for years and I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Thanks, I love this product make my hair shining. I went to my favorite store and I could find. I found it in amazon thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have very fried bleach blonde hair. Lately it seems like no matter what it will not hold any shine and looks so drab and dry. I decided to give this product a try. I got it in the mail today and sprayed just a little bit on and the first thing I noticed was the amazing smell! It made my hair super shiny! It looks healthy again! SO glad I found this!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product multiple times before ordering on Amazon. I love love this product. .  I have natural thick hair and this helps me manage my hair better. It smells great! It helps decrease blow drying time. It&#x27;s definitely a hair protector!!</li>
            <li> great value, last for a very long time.  Makes hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> the product I received has not been the same product I have ordered in the past. It did nothing for my hair and put whie spots on my wall I would not order this product again from this company.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for 10 years it never disappoints, shine, protection a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Great hair healing product!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t over drench hair.. just a few sprays!</li>
            <li> Ok. the idea of Caviar on my hair is absurd, but it works. I have long very curly hair that tangles and knots terribly at night - especially if I sleep with my hair in a pony tail. Spritz this on, wait a few seconds and I can brush through the tangles with a minimal amount of hair being pulled out. It is very oily, at least in the quantities that I use to untangle this mess, so I do it just before washing my hair and then shampoo it twice. It&#x27;s also ridiculously expensive, but it works considerably better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Because of the expense, I only use it when my hair is badly knotted, and the bottle will last several months.</li>
            <li> Great product.  However, its scent is too strong for me since I have chronic sinusitis. It irritates my sinuses.</li>
            <li> I always use this product, great to freshen your hair and gives great shine. Good for everyday! I love it&#x60;!</li>
            <li> Will continue to use the Alterna Caviar Anti Aging Rapid Repair Spray. Only thing that lasts and really helps hair in all kinds of weather conditions. If you color your hair this is the best. leaves hair soft and with natural shine.</li>
