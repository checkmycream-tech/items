            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Has good qual its but hurts When taking off</li>
            <li>This stuff is as good as Boscia but way cheaper.</li>
            <li>I love this product it has a very nice smell and the blackheads on my face are decreasing.</li>
            <li>I love this mask!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I used the cleanser and seems to do nicely</li>

            <li>They arrive as describe I love this product is on the rage in Korea and getting a lot of good reviews here in the USA to I try it</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s rather nice and florally too.</li>
            <li>There are no products that I have purchased that remove everything in your pores, but this one has been the best so far.  </li>
            <li>It made my face very smooth</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and is easy to peel.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m allergic to most everything-</li>
            <li>It also states on the bottle that you shouldn&#x27;t use it more than twice a week</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would take more than just hair</li>
            <li>Biore strips work much better at removing blackheads.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t put it on any hair because it will hurt.</li>
            <li>I was glad this came in sooner than i though.</li>
            <li>You have to put an even tick amount of the cream on your face for easy and better results.</li>
            <li>do recommend this product because it&#x27;s really cheap for two bottles.</li>
            <li>The first thing I want to say is the mask smelled really good to me personally, not too strong but a light scent.</li>
            <li>Tighter pores and less oily skin, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>This product exfoliates the face very well (smooth as butter).</li>
            <li>Just remember don&#x27;t  apply near hair because it will rip it off for sure and it hurts if you&#x27;re  not used to waxing.</li>
            <li>I will probably use it again only because I still own it</li>
            <li>is fun to put on and</li>
            <li>Of course I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it and tried it right away.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean, soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the better charcoal masks.</li>
            <li>I would have most likely given this 5 stars if I would have gotten what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>is funny</li>
            <li>It came out as some kind of goo (LOL) and was very sticky, oh and a very dark black</li>
            <li>I apply it on T zone and cheek pores only avoiding fine hair</li>
            <li>This product waxes the face very well</li>
            <li>but I really wanted it to remove stubborn blackheads on my nose and chin.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and really peels off all the gunk in my pores.</li>
            <li>After peeling the mask I noticed it didn&#x27;t get to many black heads</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend you steam your face to loosen the stuff in your pores before applying this product.  </li>
            <li>but the price is a tad to high for me.</li>
            <li>It states that it removes blackheads and although it does to an extent I think it took off dead skin for the most part.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend using it often because for me it kind of dried out my skin, especially the edges of my nose.</li>
            <li>and I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, especially in my T zone</li>
            <li>My face is soft and no break outs.</li>
            <li>It dried pretty fast and hurt to peel off.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything other than rip hair out of my face.</li>
            <li>so when my little cousins saw me with it on my face they first screamed then started laughing.</li>
            <li>First, I can say is use enough to their a thick enough layer to peel but not too much to where it&#x27;s dripping.</li>
            <li>so try to finish putting it on your face fast then lie down so it stays in place.</li>
            <li>If you have dry or sensitive skin, use a moisturizing cream before putting the Diaso mask.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>

            <li> If you have dry or sensitive skin, use a moisturizing cream before putting the Diaso mask.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I strictly use it on less sensitive areas after the firat use.</li>
            <li> As it dries, it becomes very thin so try to put more on when it&#x27;s wet goo.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skin is sensitive to scented products or is easily dried out after using masks</li>
            <li> Even when putting on a thick layer of it, pulling it off, the substance felt way to weak to be able to pick anything up.</li>
            <li> I purchased the dual packs and a day later they arrived so no problems with shipping as indicated with other reviews.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, put it on thick and your pores will like shrink so small.</li>
            <li> my skin was SO extremely dry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it a few times</li>
            <li> BUT it did get all of the dead skin on my face and left my skin feeling INCREADIBLY</li>
            <li> So like the other reviews, be careful around the hairline and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> a little strange my dog bark at me when he saw me...</li>
            <li> Boscia dupe.&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy the Boscia black facial peel</li>
            <li> It also runs down a little when wet</li>
            <li> It actually didn&#x27;t remove anything at all for me, which sucks since that was the reason why I bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking that it would snatch all my black heads, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> because the color is black make u look</li>
            <li> Definitely not for the weak.</li>
            <li> Pulls off those little hairs.....and skin.</li>
            <li> It removed a lot of dead skin, but it removed zero blackheads.</li>
            <li> but if you have DRY skin STAY AWAY!!!!!</li>
            <li> Worked well but was painful in certain areas of the face.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works yet</li>
            <li> cause it will be painful to remove later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  give me wrong</li>
            <li> but of course they thought I looked weird.</li>
            <li> It has a faint scent to it</li>
            <li> but it went away after I used some cold water to wash off the residue.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this product! Definitely one of the better charcoal masks. Dries quickly, put it on thick and your pores will like shrink so small. I have very oily skin, especially in my T zone and I also have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;m allergic to most everything- this product does not irritate my skin at all. Tighter pores and less oily skin, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I would have most likely given this 5 stars if I would have gotten what I ordered.  I ordered the charcoal mask, not the cream cleanser.  I used the cleanser and seems to do nicely but, like I said, it was NOT what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking that it would snatch all my black heads, but it didn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t  give me wrong, it worked to some extent because it pealed away A LOT of dirt off my face. Just remember don&#x27;t  apply near hair because it will rip it off for sure and it hurts if you&#x27;re  not used to waxing.</li>
            <li> I love this product it has a very nice smell and the blackheads on my face are decreasing.</li>
            <li> This product exfoliates the face very well (smooth as butter). This product waxes the face very well (beware your eyebrows). This product does not remove blackheads, not one. It made my face very smooth which I like but I really wanted it to remove stubborn blackheads on my nose and chin. Oh well, my hunt continues....</li>
            <li> I love this mask! It dries fast and really peels off all the gunk in my pores.</li>
            <li> The first thing I want to say is the mask smelled really good to me personally, not too strong but a light scent. It came out as some kind of goo (LOL) and was very sticky, oh and a very dark black so when my little cousins saw me with it on my face they first screamed then started laughing. I thought I looked awesome (hahaha) but of course they thought I looked weird. It states that it removes blackheads and although it does to an extent I think it took off dead skin for the most part. As it dries, it becomes very thin so try to put more on when it&#x27;s wet goo. It also runs down a little when wet so try to finish putting it on your face fast then lie down so it stays in place. It dried pretty fast and hurt to peel off. I felt a stinging sensation after I finished peeling it off but it went away after I used some cold water to wash off the residue. I don&#x27;t recommend using it often because for me it kind of dried out my skin, especially the edges of my nose. It also states on the bottle that you shouldn&#x27;t use it more than twice a week so try not to. I&#x27;ve only tried it a few times so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works yet but I hope this helps somewhat.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would take more than just hair but it didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything other than rip hair out of my face. I will probably use it again only because I still own it but I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> It removed a lot of dead skin, but it removed zero blackheads. Biore strips work much better at removing blackheads. I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Definitely not for the weak. Pulls off those little hairs.....and skin. Works though.</li>
            <li> Works great for me . I apply it on T zone and cheek pores only avoiding fine hair cause it will be painful to remove later.</li>
            <li> I purchased the dual packs and a day later they arrived so no problems with shipping as indicated with other reviews. This product got into the crease part of my nose unlike the pore strips.  It also pulled out some facial hair I was unaware I had, ouch! So like the other reviews, be careful around the hairline and eyebrows.  I also purchased the facial sauna by Revlon and I highly recommend you steam your face to loosen the stuff in your pores before applying this product.  There are no products that I have purchased that remove everything in your pores, but this one has been the best so far.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Definitely does not remove blackheads. It actually didn&#x27;t remove anything at all for me, which sucks since that was the reason why I bought it. Even when putting on a thick layer of it, pulling it off, the substance felt way to weak to be able to pick anything up.</li>
            <li> Has good qual its but hurts When taking off</li>
            <li> Boscia dupe.&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy the Boscia black facial peel but the price is a tad to high for me. I saw this product and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. This stuff is as good as Boscia but way cheaper. The only draw back I have is this mask hurts a lil when you pull it off. Just make sure you don&#x27;t put it on any hair because it will hurt. My face is soft and no break outs.</li>
            <li> meh everyone in my beauty group raves about this mask but if you have DRY skin STAY AWAY!!!!! I took it off and youd think if been crawling around in the desert my skin was SO extremely dry! If your skin is oily then this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> Worked well but was painful in certain areas of the face. I strictly use it on less sensitive areas after the firat use.</li>
            <li> They arrive as describe I love this product is on the rage in Korea and getting a lot of good reviews here in the USA to I try it and it works as face mask go is fun to put on and because the color is black make u look a little strange my dog bark at me when he saw me... I call his name and he was like who that heck are u ohhh now I know and he came and kinda lick me... I soo need to take a pic of him is funny lol.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It leaves my skin clean, soft and fresh. It has a nice smell and is easy to peel. You have to put an even tick amount of the cream on your face for easy and better results. Also, avoid hair areas. I recommend to esteem and wash your face before using this product. If you have dry or sensitive skin, use a moisturizing cream before putting the Diaso mask.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I was glad this came in sooner than i though. Of course I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it and tried it right away. I took a shower and decided to use it after I wash my face. First, I can say is use enough to their a thick enough layer to peel but not too much to where it&#x27;s dripping. (Yes it&#x27;ll drip. Even though the consistency is close to a gel. It has a faint scent to it that&#x27;s rather nice and florally too. After peeling the mask I noticed it didn&#x27;t get to many black heads BUT it did get all of the dead skin on my face and left my skin feeling INCREADIBLY soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product because it&#x27;s really cheap for two bottles. If you&#x27;re skin is sensitive to scented products or is easily dried out after using masks then I would say this product isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
