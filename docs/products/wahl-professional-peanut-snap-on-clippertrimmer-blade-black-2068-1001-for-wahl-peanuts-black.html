            <li>seen these for a more of a better price read the reviews and decided to go with them</li>
            <li>thinking about ordering 1 more for a just incase</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great how cheap replacement blades are, and they just pop right on.</li>
            <li>blade is sharp, the comb is perfectly formed, it fits like an OEM part should.</li>
            <li>the Wahl peanut is a great little edger and is also good for buzzer over comb.</li>
            <li>Now they stay fastened and cut hair easily.</li>
            <li>It fit perfectly and worked as expected.</li>
            <li>Best little blade for the best little clippers.  </li>
            <li>The snap-on head for my Peanut was making a rattling sound and coming off while shaving, so I bought a replacement.  </li>
            <li>But the replacement blade teeth are longer than the original head.  </li>
            <li>So when I shave with the Peanut replacement head, it does not shave as close as the original blade</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as original one did.</li>
            <li>Fits like a glove on the peanut and works like the original.</li>
            <li>I had not realized how worn out my original set of blades were.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m excited to use them since i haven&#x27;t turned them on since the break.</li>
            <li>But still great and far superior to any other trimmers I have used over 10 years.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and replacement blade is extremely affordable and works great!</li>
            <li>Cool.</li>
            <li>different color than the picture, black which matches the peanut clipper perfect fit and clip on.</li>
            <li>These little clippers work great for maintaining poodle feet and faces.</li>
            <li>love that i could fix my old clipper blade that is in black&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love my Peanut again the clippers run and look like new again after i dropped the first set and chipped one of the tooth of the blades.  </li>
            <li>They were very prompt in sending, And I will do business with them again!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>but when i dropped it the blade/clip broke off and well wasn&#x27;t able to clip back on.</li>
            <li>I use it to Flat Top with.  </li>
            <li>When compared to my ~6 year old original blades, I could see that the blades truly do self sharpen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This blade is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and quick delivery!</li>
            <li>Made my Peanut brand new without having to buy the whole thing</li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace an older blade.</li>
            <li>Like the reviews say not as sharp as the original blade.</li>
            <li>Product works just fine with Black Wahl Peanut.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old peanut works like new.</li>
            <li>I needed a replacement blade after a little tooth at the rear of my original blade snapped off.</li>

            <li> The blade already broke.</li>
            <li> The snap-on head for my Peanut was making a rattling sound and coming off while shaving, so I bought a replacement.  The replacement head fits.  I like that I can get black to match my Peanut.  But the replacement blade teeth are longer than the original head.  And the gap is wider.  So when I shave with the Peanut replacement head, it does not shave as close as the original blade teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the replacement package said &amp;#34;standard.&amp;#34;  Maybe there is a &amp;#34;closer/tighter&amp;#34; replacement head.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
            <li> Best little blade for the best little clippers.  Made in USA.  Cool.</li>
            <li> Only problem with these blades are when you drop it the plastic backing that holds it ontop the clipper that allows it to snap into place break as well. over all great product.</li>
            <li> It cuts hair perfectly.</li>
