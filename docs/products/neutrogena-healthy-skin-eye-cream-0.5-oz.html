            <li>Trusting that this a good brand and good price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this eye cream for years, it is a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t sting eyes at all.</li>
            <li>- feels good in the application process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find it to be great at maintaining wrinkle free eyes, but it would probably not be great for people who already have wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I am very pleased that it does not hurt my skin.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s eyes are happy so me too :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and it would look amazing within the hour.</li>
            <li>but for a couple of those years I&#x27;ve noticed an amazing change on his skin around his eyes.</li>
            <li>I can see an amazing difference.</li>
            <li>, about it&#x27;s effect on my skin, umm, I am still kind of undecided on it.</li>
            <li>There are better eye creams out there, but this one is good for the months that you can&#x27;t afford your HG cream.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time with this product yet, but it feels nice under my eyes and on my lids.</li>
            <li>It is a handy size to carry on trips with me.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it here, and will reorder soon.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>My most favorite eye cream!</li>
            <li>I liked Burt&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s suitable for her eyes now.</li>
            <li>This cream is not heavy, but it moisturizes my eye area wonderfully.</li>
            <li>great produce and the right price.</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes was so bright and soft, everyone I knew commented on how great (all of)</li>
            <li>Please keep in mind that products with alpha hydroxy acid should not be worn out in the sunlight, as our skin becomes more susceptible to damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I do love the way it moisturizes and feels on my skin though.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Nothing can stop wrinkles but this product sure makes them &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; better.</li>
            <li>They are not puffy, but rather more gaunt looking.  </li>
            <li>I used the Neutrogena for 2 more days until I read the directions.  </li>
            <li>Much better $ here than stores.</li>
            <li>think with these type of products depends on your skin complexion &amp; genetics for the most part, so</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>Love the alpha hydroxy.  </li>
            <li>I use this eye cream most of the time.  </li>
            <li>I have used Neutrogena for years and love all of their products.  </li>
            <li>This is okay, I started to use Vichy.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using Neutrogena products for many years.</li>
            <li>but Neutrogena makes it a bit better.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena&#x27;s Health Skin Anti-Wrinkle day cream, so I decided to give this eye cream a shot.</li>
            <li>Love this product and have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again as I was hoping for better results.</li>
            <li>Product was ok.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t know him better I would think there was some beauty surgery or something like botox involved.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>This product seemed to help, but I needed much more moisturizing to make my eyes look younger/dewy/moisturized sufficiently.</li>
            <li>More for eye moisturizing - though I doubt most need that.</li>
            <li>I really love the results that I am seeing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it and its not something that will end up in my medicine cabinet museum. :)</li>
            <li>i love this</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer</li>
            <li>Some reviewers might be pleased with the product, but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>I lol still older with lot of wickles.</li>
            <li>Its great for under eye makeup because it is not thick.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a nice smell not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I have used this product so far for 3 months with great results.</li>
            <li>but I am glad its still available on line.     </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive eyes and skin.</li>
            <li>Applies easily.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in fast and is perfect for the sensitive under eye area.  </li>
            <li>No irritation and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to bring on</li>
            <li>It is effective and gentle!  </li>
            <li>This product is supposed to reduce the appearance of fine lines around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>I credit this fine potion.</li>
            <li>I can blend my makeup just fine over this product.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen difference on fine lines yet.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to get it so much cheaper and have it delivered to my door rather then buying it at the store.</li>
            <li>I definitely think this is a great eye cream for the price.</li>
            <li>It is important to keep your skin hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light yet moist.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and isn&#x27;t too oily, then dries fast so that I can apply my makeup.</li>
            <li>Its way cheaper than most of the other eye creams out there, but still does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in the past esp the drug store dupe version and both are awesome.</li>
            <li>The consistency on this eye cream is rich.</li>
            <li>This varies in price on various online beauty websites by as much as $5 ($8 - $13,) but for an eye cream under about $15, it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li>Maybe at a younger age this would have worked better for me, but at 41, not so effective.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I wanted to start taking better care of my skin and in general be more proactive about preventative care.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream, 0.5 Ounce really does work</li>
            <li>This shipped quick, just like we all like.  </li>
            <li>When I last ran out, I decided to try the Neutrogena eye cream because I usually love Neutrogena products, and it was a better price than the Olay.  </li>
            <li>it works different for each individual but for me wonderful</li>
            <li>Unfortunately--I cannot use this particular Healthy skin eye cream , because it makes</li>
            <li>I like this eye cream even better then some of my high end skincare</li>
            <li>My face is usually non-allergic, I have always had a good response to most cosmetics.</li>
            <li>This hasn&#x27;t done much for my fine lines, but boy does it help with puffiness around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>This product worked great for me after just 1 week my very dark circles and puffiness disappeared.</li>
            <li>This product performs far better then the price would suggest.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fragrance-free, which seems to be annoyingly rare in eye creams.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a warning that it makes you more sensitive to sunlight.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are 40 something years old but they look much younger with this stuff, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>my under eyes wrinkles look worth.</li>
            <li>I love it, used it for years and so far, no wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Got it super fast and it works!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this eye cream, it&#x27;s super light, and it is really good!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent cream!  </li>
            <li>I think it has the right consistency.</li>
            <li>Which is actually good in an eye cream; active AHA ingredients don&#x27;t belong in an eye cream, they would sting and burn your eyes to the point that you couldn&#x27;t continue using it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say the day cream works better than the eye cream, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the market though for a more natural product (trying to taper off of so many chemicals in items we use regularly).</li>
            <li>This product was shipped super fast and came just as described.</li>
            <li>so small, but really good, and you don&#x27;t need big quantities, nice cream</li>
            <li>Put it on first, then put your face hydration product.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve purchased it.</li>
            <li>Great stuff...have been using it for at least 15 years.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and she only got irritation and more puffiness, so test it out for allergies.</li>
            <li>Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li>I could have used this when I was younger but need something creamier and more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This eye cream didn&#x27;t turn out to be as awesome as I expected due to the reviews I read on this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to not expect too much from these kinds of OTC products but this cream (more like a lotion) is actually working!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I noticed positive results within 7 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and love it.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that if I applied the cream before I went to bed I would wake up with pretty much no puffyness</li>
            <li>not greasy, a small pearl sized amount is good for all around both eyes.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and seems to hydrate for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>Have certainly made the circuit of creams, serums, gels and oils for under eye care.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m certain this is not my imagination.  </li>
            <li>Maybe others have totally benefited from it and it does say on the tube \\&quot;Clinically proven to visibly reduce the appearance of fine lines around the eye area\\</li>
            <li>and it appears like it really does work, while probably it&#x27;s not?.</li>
            <li>but this... um....).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing this product and I don&#x27;t really recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I just put it on, doesn&#x27;t notice much of a difference</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really tell a difference</li>
            <li>It feels quite soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Not irritating.</li>
            <li>Gentle to the eyes and skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I like Vichy better even if its a tad more expensive but we are worth it girls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this item for 3 months and haven&#x27;t seen much for change.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really see difference</li>
            <li>but it does feel really soothing</li>
            <li>I think they try to use the best ingredients even if the raw materials are more expensive.</li>
            <li>moisturizes gently and soaks into skin to allow for application of makeup or other lotions on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now, and already I can notice puffiness, dark circles, and fine lines dissapearing!</li>
            <li>- I checked to see how long I had slept because I figured it was due to a good nights sleep.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my crow&#x27;s feet and under my eyes, it is a little better for the reasonable price you pay.</li>
            <li>Got what I expected and it was so easy to order and receive.  </li>
            <li>As a male, I only commit to two products, the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream and a hydrating face cream.  </li>
            <li>It has already become a favorite even after only using it a short time now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on its effect on crows feet, but as a moisturizer, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>I have tried several, and I keep going back to this, the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream.</li>
            <li>Great product for black women under eye dark circles.</li>
            <li>works amazing on my sensitive skin especially when i get rashes or dry skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin around the eyes with light lines.</li>
            <li>I notice that when I smile a lot at the end of the day I have the deep wrinkles like everybody else.</li>
            <li>This is a good product but ended up not being moisturizing enough for middle aged skin.  </li>
            <li>Is non irritating, with good results.</li>
            <li>I use this daily and can&#x27;t really say it gets rid of the bags under my eyes--but it is more affordable than some of the other eye products.</li>
            <li>The price for Neutrogena is great and it also doesn&#x27;t cause any allergic reactions like some other products have in the past.</li>
            <li>I live in TX and burn walking across a parking lot</li>
            <li>The fine line are disappearing and also the dark circles.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t think I had dark circles or puffy eyes or wrinkles, but literally within 24 hours I noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I do prefer the other products in this same line though - the Healthy Skin line.</li>
            <li>Eyes looking much younger, skin is soft and supple, fine lines look reduced, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, not too greasy or too dry.</li>
            <li>This has hardly any other use to be honest, wish I could give it no stars!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons - broke out and doesn&#x27;t do much to clear up eyes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nearly</li>
            <li>I have to say I like it so far but just started using it to try and lighten up the circles under my eyes and moisturize around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>This was suggested to me to use for my eyelids which have become sensitive to a lot of products.</li>
            <li>Dont know if it&#x27;s becasue product is working, or im to sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>Works well with my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30s</li>
            <li>I really like Neutrogena&#x27;s products, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s only me</li>
            <li>you are in your 20s or early 30s</li>
            <li>Time to go natural</li>
            <li>I am still too young for wrinkles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>It may just be that I have especially dry skin which is why I still gave it 3 stars, but now I know the Olay is worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is just a decent, inexpensive eye cream for those who want a moderately moisturizing product without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>This is a product to prevent lines and to hold on to the good condition of your skin, but I would use a very thick cream under it, as well, if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However it helps when your eyes are PUFFY or there is a high chance they will be puffy the next day.</li>
            <li>For 15 gms, it&#x27;s pretty expensive, mostly because it&#x27;s from the brand Neutrogena (I have had positive experience from other products of this brand</li>
            <li>I am 29, so I don&#x27;t need a super heavy duty eye cream yet.</li>
            <li>There are countless more expensive and higher end formulas out there</li>
            <li>My skin is not extra sensitive, but this cream started to irritate it after a week of use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s recommended by dermatologists, especially for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This one is not any better and maybe a little less moisturizing than some.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and provides a good base for other makeup products</li>
            <li>A small amount goes a long way toward softening fine lines and keeping the eye area moist.  </li>
            <li>I got the Neutrogena because it had positive reviews and was inexpensive; I got the RoC because it was a brand that I heard a lot of people recommend for dark circles under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But some how this little miracle works its magic in less than ten minutes.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams some which have actually made my under eyes look worse.</li>
            <li>It is plain OK, I have been using it properly and it hasn&#x27;t made a difference when it comes down to the tone of my skin</li>
            <li>have dry skin and very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>the next morning when I woke up I had forgotten about getting these products - first time I&#x27;ve bought anything other than Irish Spring and toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Recently my skin began to noticeably age, especially around the eyes, with this large red melanoma spot on my left eyelid which I&#x27;ve had and has continued to grow slightly for about 3 years.</li>

            <li> Ok, so this is my story with this awesome product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena healthy eye cream for about a month and very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Really a good product and well priced.  </li>

            <li> I CANNOT SAY IT REMOVES WRINKLES, BUT IT FEELS GOOD ON MY EYES.  </li>
            <li> NEUTROGENA PRODUCTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD SELECTION FOR ME.</li>
            <li> Good price for this product.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream does a good job of smoothing the skin around the eye.</li>
            <li> Trusting that this a good brand and good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye cream for years, it is a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t sting eyes at all.</li>
            <li> - feels good in the application process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find it to be great at maintaining wrinkle free eyes, but it would probably not be great for people who already have wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am very pleased that it does not hurt my skin.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s eyes are happy so me too :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> and it would look amazing within the hour.</li>
            <li> but for a couple of those years I&#x27;ve noticed an amazing change on his skin around his eyes.</li>
            <li> I can see an amazing difference.</li>
            <li> , about it&#x27;s effect on my skin, umm, I am still kind of undecided on it.</li>
            <li> There are better eye creams out there, but this one is good for the months that you can&#x27;t afford your HG cream.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time with this product yet, but it feels nice under my eyes and on my lids.</li>
            <li> It is a handy size to carry on trips with me.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find it here, and will reorder soon.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> My most favorite eye cream!</li>
            <li> I liked Burt&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s suitable for her eyes now.</li>
            <li> This cream is not heavy, but it moisturizes my eye area wonderfully.</li>
            <li> great produce and the right price.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes was so bright and soft, everyone I knew commented on how great (all of)</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind that products with alpha hydroxy acid should not be worn out in the sunlight, as our skin becomes more susceptible to damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I do love the way it moisturizes and feels on my skin though.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing can stop wrinkles but this product sure makes them &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; better.</li>
            <li> They are not puffy, but rather more gaunt looking.  </li>
            <li> I used the Neutrogena for 2 more days until I read the directions.  </li>
            <li> Much better $ here than stores.</li>
            <li> think with these type of products depends on your skin complexion &amp; genetics for the most part, so</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li> Love the alpha hydroxy.  </li>
            <li> I use this eye cream most of the time.  </li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena for years and love all of their products.  </li>
            <li> This is okay, I started to use Vichy.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is okay.  </li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena products for many years.</li>
            <li> but Neutrogena makes it a bit better.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena&#x27;s Health Skin Anti-Wrinkle day cream, so I decided to give this eye cream a shot.</li>
            <li> Love this product and have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again as I was hoping for better results.</li>
            <li> Product was ok.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t know him better I would think there was some beauty surgery or something like botox involved.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to help, but I needed much more moisturizing to make my eyes look younger/dewy/moisturized sufficiently.</li>
            <li> More for eye moisturizing - though I doubt most need that.</li>
            <li> I really love the results that I am seeing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it and its not something that will end up in my medicine cabinet museum. :)</li>
            <li> i love this</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer</li>
            <li> Some reviewers might be pleased with the product, but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I lol still older with lot of wickles.</li>
            <li> Its great for under eye makeup because it is not thick.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a nice smell not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I have used this product so far for 3 months with great results.</li>
            <li> but I am glad its still available on line.     </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive eyes and skin.</li>
            <li> Applies easily.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in fast and is perfect for the sensitive under eye area.  </li>
            <li> No irritation and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to bring on</li>
            <li> It is effective and gentle!  </li>
            <li> This product is supposed to reduce the appearance of fine lines around the eye area.  </li>
            <li> I credit this fine potion.</li>
            <li> I can blend my makeup just fine over this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen difference on fine lines yet.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to get it so much cheaper and have it delivered to my door rather then buying it at the store.</li>
            <li> I definitely think this is a great eye cream for the price.</li>
            <li> It is important to keep your skin hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light yet moist.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and isn&#x27;t too oily, then dries fast so that I can apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> Its way cheaper than most of the other eye creams out there, but still does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past esp the drug store dupe version and both are awesome.</li>
            <li> The consistency on this eye cream is rich.</li>
            <li> This varies in price on various online beauty websites by as much as $5 ($8 - $13,) but for an eye cream under about $15, it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li> Maybe at a younger age this would have worked better for me, but at 41, not so effective.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to start taking better care of my skin and in general be more proactive about preventative care.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream, 0.5 Ounce really does work</li>
            <li> This shipped quick, just like we all like.  </li>
            <li> When I last ran out, I decided to try the Neutrogena eye cream because I usually love Neutrogena products, and it was a better price than the Olay.  </li>
            <li> it works different for each individual but for me wonderful</li>
            <li> Unfortunately--I cannot use this particular Healthy skin eye cream , because it makes</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream even better then some of my high end skincare</li>
            <li> My face is usually non-allergic, I have always had a good response to most cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t done much for my fine lines, but boy does it help with puffiness around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> This product worked great for me after just 1 week my very dark circles and puffiness disappeared.</li>
            <li> This product performs far better then the price would suggest.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fragrance-free, which seems to be annoyingly rare in eye creams.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a warning that it makes you more sensitive to sunlight.  </li>
            <li> My eyes are 40 something years old but they look much younger with this stuff, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> my under eyes wrinkles look worth.</li>
            <li> I love it, used it for years and so far, no wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Got it super fast and it works!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this eye cream, it&#x27;s super light, and it is really good!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent cream!  </li>
            <li> I think it has the right consistency.</li>
            <li> Which is actually good in an eye cream; active AHA ingredients don&#x27;t belong in an eye cream, they would sting and burn your eyes to the point that you couldn&#x27;t continue using it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say the day cream works better than the eye cream, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the market though for a more natural product (trying to taper off of so many chemicals in items we use regularly).</li>
            <li> This product was shipped super fast and came just as described.</li>
            <li> so small, but really good, and you don&#x27;t need big quantities, nice cream</li>
            <li> Put it on first, then put your face hydration product.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve purchased it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff...have been using it for at least 15 years.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and she only got irritation and more puffiness, so test it out for allergies.</li>
            <li> Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> I could have used this when I was younger but need something creamier and more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This eye cream didn&#x27;t turn out to be as awesome as I expected due to the reviews I read on this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to not expect too much from these kinds of OTC products but this cream (more like a lotion) is actually working!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I noticed positive results within 7 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and love it.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that if I applied the cream before I went to bed I would wake up with pretty much no puffyness</li>
            <li> not greasy, a small pearl sized amount is good for all around both eyes.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and seems to hydrate for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> Have certainly made the circuit of creams, serums, gels and oils for under eye care.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m certain this is not my imagination.  </li>
            <li> Maybe others have totally benefited from it and it does say on the tube \\&quot;Clinically proven to visibly reduce the appearance of fine lines around the eye area\\</li>
            <li> and it appears like it really does work, while probably it&#x27;s not?.</li>
            <li> but this... um....).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing this product and I don&#x27;t really recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I just put it on, doesn&#x27;t notice much of a difference</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really tell a difference</li>
            <li> It feels quite soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Not irritating.</li>
            <li> Gentle to the eyes and skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like Vichy better even if its a tad more expensive but we are worth it girls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for 3 months and haven&#x27;t seen much for change.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really see difference</li>
            <li> but it does feel really soothing</li>
            <li> I think they try to use the best ingredients even if the raw materials are more expensive.</li>
            <li> moisturizes gently and soaks into skin to allow for application of makeup or other lotions on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now, and already I can notice puffiness, dark circles, and fine lines dissapearing!</li>
            <li> - I checked to see how long I had slept because I figured it was due to a good nights sleep.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my crow&#x27;s feet and under my eyes, it is a little better for the reasonable price you pay.</li>
            <li> Got what I expected and it was so easy to order and receive.  </li>
            <li> As a male, I only commit to two products, the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream and a hydrating face cream.  </li>
            <li> It has already become a favorite even after only using it a short time now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on its effect on crows feet, but as a moisturizer, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> I have tried several, and I keep going back to this, the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream.</li>
            <li> Great product for black women under eye dark circles.</li>
            <li> works amazing on my sensitive skin especially when i get rashes or dry skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin around the eyes with light lines.</li>
            <li> I notice that when I smile a lot at the end of the day I have the deep wrinkles like everybody else.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but ended up not being moisturizing enough for middle aged skin.  </li>
            <li> Is non irritating, with good results.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and can&#x27;t really say it gets rid of the bags under my eyes--but it is more affordable than some of the other eye products.</li>
            <li> The price for Neutrogena is great and it also doesn&#x27;t cause any allergic reactions like some other products have in the past.</li>
            <li> I live in TX and burn walking across a parking lot</li>
            <li> The fine line are disappearing and also the dark circles.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t think I had dark circles or puffy eyes or wrinkles, but literally within 24 hours I noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I do prefer the other products in this same line though - the Healthy Skin line.</li>
            <li> Eyes looking much younger, skin is soft and supple, fine lines look reduced, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, not too greasy or too dry.</li>
            <li> This has hardly any other use to be honest, wish I could give it no stars!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons - broke out and doesn&#x27;t do much to clear up eyes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nearly</li>
            <li> I have to say I like it so far but just started using it to try and lighten up the circles under my eyes and moisturize around the eye area.  </li>
            <li> This was suggested to me to use for my eyelids which have become sensitive to a lot of products.</li>
            <li> Dont know if it&#x27;s becasue product is working, or im to sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> Works well with my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s</li>
            <li> I really like Neutrogena&#x27;s products, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s only me</li>
            <li> you are in your 20s or early 30s</li>
            <li> Time to go natural</li>
            <li> I am still too young for wrinkles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> It may just be that I have especially dry skin which is why I still gave it 3 stars, but now I know the Olay is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is just a decent, inexpensive eye cream for those who want a moderately moisturizing product without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> This is a product to prevent lines and to hold on to the good condition of your skin, but I would use a very thick cream under it, as well, if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However it helps when your eyes are PUFFY or there is a high chance they will be puffy the next day.</li>
            <li> For 15 gms, it&#x27;s pretty expensive, mostly because it&#x27;s from the brand Neutrogena (I have had positive experience from other products of this brand</li>
            <li> I am 29, so I don&#x27;t need a super heavy duty eye cream yet.</li>
            <li> There are countless more expensive and higher end formulas out there</li>
            <li> My skin is not extra sensitive, but this cream started to irritate it after a week of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recommended by dermatologists, especially for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This one is not any better and maybe a little less moisturizing than some.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and provides a good base for other makeup products</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way toward softening fine lines and keeping the eye area moist.  </li>
            <li> I got the Neutrogena because it had positive reviews and was inexpensive; I got the RoC because it was a brand that I heard a lot of people recommend for dark circles under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But some how this little miracle works its magic in less than ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams some which have actually made my under eyes look worse.</li>
            <li> It is plain OK, I have been using it properly and it hasn&#x27;t made a difference when it comes down to the tone of my skin</li>
            <li> have dry skin and very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> the next morning when I woke up I had forgotten about getting these products - first time I&#x27;ve bought anything other than Irish Spring and toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Recently my skin began to noticeably age, especially around the eyes, with this large red melanoma spot on my left eyelid which I&#x27;ve had and has continued to grow slightly for about 3 years.</li>
            <li> have seen dramatic changes on my fine lines and wrinkles....</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  </li>
            <li> I love the squeeze tube (instead of a hard container) because you can squeeze every last bit out and there is less waste.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin in some areas of the face, especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li> After single application, the skin around the eyes became red, flaky and itchy.</li>
            <li> I have atleast 5 other neutrogena products that I use regularly and so such a product comes as a shocker!</li>
            <li> I do believe I&#x27;m mainly screwed in that sense when it comes down to dark</li>
            <li> I have found this cream is not nearly as hydrating as the Olay</li>
            <li> will continue using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised it works so well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for so long.</li>
            <li> Very oily, with a slow absorption.</li>
            <li> I noticed that other individuals have also mentioned such reactions</li>
            <li> With all skin related products it can only do a little with every use.</li>
            <li> It is just the right amount of moisture around the eyes so that I can still put on my eye make up without it mixing with it and getting all sloppy.  </li>
            <li> Even still, midway through the day my undereye area is visibly dry.  </li>
            <li> I needed this because the skin around my eyes was getting uncomfortably dry.  </li>
            <li> only been using it for a few weeks and the wrinkle lines under my eyes are actually dissipating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting to be that age where my lower eye area is starting to show dark circles....</li>
            <li> A tiny eye cream without any package or box, which makes me a little worried about its quality and date....</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream for several years now but all of a sudden this year it has become hard to find.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s anti wrinkle cream works like a dream and was one of my most used facial creams this past winter we had in New york which was brutal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That doesn&#x27;t mean they were completely gone, just noticeably lighter.  </li>
            <li> In fact, after the first couple of uses, you can&#x27;t even smell it anymore because by then you would get used to the faint smell.</li>
            <li> This moisturizes, but not as effectively as other brands I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other eye creams.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that when you put other under-eye creams on they end up all over your face because of how oily they are.</li>
            <li> This never worked for me, and it was pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to do the job.  </li>
            <li> package is quite small in size, looks much bigger in the picture.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because at 40 I started to get dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This product is not for dark under eye circle as indicated online.  </li>
            <li> The box nor the tube indicates it is for dark under eye circles.  </li>
            <li> Dark circles and puffiness gone in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> I often work at night so dark circles and puffiness happen.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on smoother and the dark circles are fading.</li>
            <li> I get dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It also says nothing about helping with dark circles under your eyes, where it&#x27;s advertised as helping with that issue on amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles around my eyes, but have always had dark circles because of my allergies.  </li>
            <li> And dark circles are not so dark as it was before.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as it was described, the web page said works on dark circles but that is not on the package</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all..</li>
            <li> Tried it for 3 months..not even 2% of dark circles reduced</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with hopes that it would remove dark circles.  </li>
            <li> It says it reduces dark circles.</li>
            <li> I just bought it for my dark circles and got no results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh or irritating.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to get the job done!</li>
            <li> Nope, 1 hour less than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is competitive when buying it with Amazon Subscription as it&#x27;s about 3-4 less than CVS.</li>
            <li> I noticed smoother, softer skin after less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li> It slightly moisturizes</li>
            <li> It takes a few times to lessen the dark circles and it does not work for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> In addition, the white cream is hard to blend in all the way unless you use a really small amount and feels like it is sitting on the surface of your skin instead of penetrating it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also helping the little crinkles.</li>
            <li> This product seems to lighten this problem area a little bit, time will tell.  </li>
            <li> Made my eyes a little dried</li>
            <li> One of the few products that  I can use around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried a few, but this one never stings my skin or eyes, and soaks in thoroughly.</li>
            <li> crying</li>
            <li> , when I use this product, it makes my eyes burns for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> For the few times I used it now it seems to work as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> I use it only when I have tired eyes from lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if my wrinkles are less, but my skin has done will with it,</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s done anything for my dark circles and puffiness, I haven&#x27;t noticed, but it hasn&#x27;t made it worse like other products have.</li>
            <li> But not for this one, on the second morning of using this product, all my under eye area and face was covered with red painful spots.  </li>
            <li> how refreshed I would look with just a little help!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is working yet</li>
            <li> This eye cream has brightened them and I just use a small amount under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Small wrinkles disappeared.</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t started yet, I have the confidence that it will deliver its usual excellence.</li>
            <li> I was so used to having tired eyes and dark circles that I had no idea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 10 years and don&#x27;t plan on switching.</li>
            <li> Like the day after you ate salty foods/ a late night/</li>
            <li> Ahhh, aging sucks</li>
            <li> The eye cream nourishes the delicate skin under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Not liquidy nor thick.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used the expensive Lancome and other European very expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> I was very frustrated and about to loose hope.</li>
            <li> As it is, I can carelessly slather it all over my eye area with no stinging or burning.</li>
            <li> Found all these weird bumps around the spot where I applied it.  </li>
            <li> I mistakenly bought this eye cream instead of ageless intensive eye cream, and I am very disappointed , because it is not the same, and its horrible, maybe it has to do something with the fact, that it had no original box</li>
            <li> I have the worst dark circles..</li>
            <li> It smells bad to me but if it works, I will suffer through the smell.</li>
            <li> I cant not smaill happyly :(</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> It has a VERY faint smell of medicine/pharmacy!.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer in Neutrogena products. I think they try to use the best ingredients even if the raw materials are more expensive.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for me...</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to reduce the appearance of fine lines around the eye area.  It contains Alpha Hydroxy in it and it&#x27;s supposed to be anti-ageing. That&#x27;s what attracted me to this product. I have used it for 1 month now and it&#x27;s nearly over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just take a tiny dot on my ring finger and work it around my eyes in a patting/dabbing motion. I think it has the right consistency. Not liquidy nor thick. Very easy to apply. It has a VERY faint smell of medicine/pharmacy!. But it&#x27;s a nice smell not bad at all. In fact, after the first couple of uses, you can&#x27;t even smell it anymore because by then you would get used to the faint smell. This cream can be applied under makeup too but I have never tried that. Also, it says to apply it twice a day but I apply it only in the night. Please keep in mind that products with alpha hydroxy acid should not be worn out in the sunlight, as our skin becomes more susceptible to damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, about it&#x27;s effect on my skin, umm, I am still kind of undecided on it. I am 25 by the way and I don&#x27;t actually have a lot of lines around my eyes. I *think* the lines on the crow&#x27;s feet area are lesser. But, you know how sometimes you like to make yourself believe that a product is working and it appears like it really does work, while probably it&#x27;s not?. Jeez!.. Does that even make any sense?. But that&#x27;s how I feel about this product. Maybe others have totally benefited from it and it does say on the tube \\&quot;Clinically proven to visibly reduce the appearance of fine lines around the eye area\\&quot;. I think I am fooling myself into thinking that this product works. For 15 gms, it&#x27;s pretty expensive, mostly because it&#x27;s from the brand Neutrogena (I have had positive experience from other products of this brand but this... um....).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing this product and I don&#x27;t really recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s done anything for my dark circles and puffiness, I haven&#x27;t noticed, but it hasn&#x27;t made it worse like other products have.</li>
            <li> I just put it on, doesn&#x27;t notice much of a difference</li>
            <li> Really a good product and well priced.  I was thrilled to get it so much cheaper and have it delivered to my door rather then buying it at the store.</li>
            <li> I have to say I like it so far but just started using it to try and lighten up the circles under my eyes and moisturize around the eye area.  Can&#x27;t tell you if it is working.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 3 weeks to a month.  I do love the way it moisturizes and feels on my skin though.</li>
            <li> great produce and the right price.</li>
            <li> One of the few products that  I can use around my eyes.  Not sure if it is working yet but I am very pleased that it does not hurt my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 and people often comment on how much younger I look. I credit this fine potion. I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 10 years and don&#x27;t plan on switching. There are countless more expensive and higher end formulas out there and I&#x27;ve tried a few, but this one never stings my skin or eyes, and soaks in thoroughly. Could be genetics, but I give some credit to Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> This shipped quick, just like we all like.  This moisturizes, but not as effectively as other brands I&#x27;ve used so I won&#x27;t use this one again.  Maybe at a younger age this would have worked better for me, but at 41, not so effective.</li>
            <li> Very oily, with a slow absorption. Used for 3 weeks, no results.won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> For several years I have been using the Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum.  When I last ran out, I decided to try the Neutrogena eye cream because I usually love Neutrogena products, and it was a better price than the Olay.  I have found this cream is not nearly as hydrating as the Olay and I have to apply 2 layers (morning and night - so 4 applications throughout the day).  Even still, midway through the day my undereye area is visibly dry.  In addition, the white cream is hard to blend in all the way unless you use a really small amount and feels like it is sitting on the surface of your skin instead of penetrating it.  It may just be that I have especially dry skin which is why I still gave it 3 stars, but now I know the Olay is worth the money.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really tell a difference</li>
            <li> This product was shipped super fast and came just as described. I definitely think this is a great eye cream for the price. There are better eye creams out there, but this one is good for the months that you can&#x27;t afford your HG cream.</li>
            <li> I noticed positive results within 7 days. I use it once a day and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> It feels quite soft and fresh.  I use it during the day, and at night and I feel it is working.</li>
            <li> Have certainly made the circuit of creams, serums, gels and oils for under eye care.  This product performs far better then the price would suggest.  I have used it for several years now, and it continues to do the job that I want.  Goes on easily and seems to hydrate for the entire day.  Put it on first, then put your face hydration product.  As a male, I only commit to two products, the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream and a hydrating face cream.  It is important to keep your skin hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time with this product yet, but it feels nice under my eyes and on my lids. It has a good texture, not greasy. I can blend my makeup just fine over this product. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to start taking better care of my skin and in general be more proactive about preventative care. So I didn&#x27;t think I had dark circles or puffy eyes or wrinkles, but literally within 24 hours I noticed a HUGE difference. The skin around my eyes was so bright and soft, everyone I knew commented on how great (all of) my skin looked. I was so used to having tired eyes and dark circles that I had no idea how refreshed I would look with just a little help! Love this product.</li>
            <li> Started using this on my eyes.  I don&#x27;t really notice any difference.  It&#x27;s sometimes will make my eyes tear up.</li>
            <li> Nothing can stop wrinkles but this product sure makes them &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; better. I notice that when I smile a lot at the end of the day I have the deep wrinkles like everybody else. I use it on my crow&#x27;s feet and under my eyes, it is a little better for the reasonable price you pay. I am a man and I have tried everything around my eyes and this seems to be good for the price.</li>
            <li> This varies in price on various online beauty websites by as much as $5 ($8 - $13,) but for an eye cream under about $15, it&#x27;s very good. It claims to have AHA ingredients, but though the ingredients&#x27; list includes glycolic acid and ascorbic acid, they aren&#x27;t listed as \\&quot;active\\&quot; ingredients and they come in about the middle of the list of standard ingredients. Which is actually good in an eye cream; active AHA ingredients don&#x27;t belong in an eye cream, they would sting and burn your eyes to the point that you couldn&#x27;t continue using it. As it is, I can carelessly slather it all over my eye area with no stinging or burning. It&#x27;s also fragrance-free, which seems to be annoyingly rare in eye creams. Fragrances in eye creams will also sting your eyes. This is just a decent, inexpensive eye cream for those who want a moderately moisturizing product without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t done much for my fine lines, but boy does it help with puffiness around the eyes.  For me, this product really diminishes the congested, puffy look that started a few years ago that nothing seemed to help.  I&#x27;m on my third tube and I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because at 40 I started to get dark circles under my eyes.  They are not puffy, but rather more gaunt looking.  Looked like I was closer to 50, especially when tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this and RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream at the same time.  I got the Neutrogena because it had positive reviews and was inexpensive; I got the RoC because it was a brand that I heard a lot of people recommend for dark circles under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the Neutrogena on at night and the next morning when I woke up I had forgotten about getting these products - first time I&#x27;ve bought anything other than Irish Spring and toothpaste.  When I looked in the mirror I immediately noticed a difference - I checked to see how long I had slept because I figured it was due to a good nights sleep.  Nope, 1 hour less than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That doesn&#x27;t mean they were completely gone, just noticeably lighter.  I used the Neutrogena for 2 more days until I read the directions.  There&#x27;s a warning that it makes you more sensitive to sunlight.  I live in TX and burn walking across a parking lot so I decided to put this away for when it&#x27;s cloudy &amp; switched to the RoC.  I put it on at night and in the morning and it seems to keep making improvements...enough that I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> The price-to-value ratio of this eye cream is quite wonderful!  This is a 5-start eye cream at a 2-star price.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye even compared to ones that cost $40.  I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past esp the drug store dupe version and both are awesome. I recommend this product. It&#x27;s reasonably priced. I don&#x27;t know ir Neutrogena makes this anymore because I try to find it at WallgrEens, however I&#x27;ll look in CVS and Rite Aid. If anything I&#x27;ll buy agaain from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My face is usually non-allergic, I have always had a good response to most cosmetics. But not for this one, on the second morning of using this product, all my under eye area and face was covered with red painful spots.  I washed my face and applied soothing cream and yet no change. I noticed that other individuals have also mentioned such reactions but there is no such thing mentioned on the product! If this is a possibility, then why not put it out there on the box. I have atleast 5 other neutrogena products that I use regularly and so such a product comes as a shocker! I am definitely getting rid of it and suggesting others to not purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;A big no-no, if you want to save yourself from allergies.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream, 0.5 Ounce really does work and I like the product. It&#x27;s not harsh or irritating.</li>
            <li> This was suggested to me to use for my eyelids which have become sensitive to a lot of products. Seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> have seen dramatic changes on my fine lines and wrinkles....But my questions to everyone out there using this product....Does anyone experience burning sensation when applying it under your eyes??? OMG!! It burns!! Dont know if it&#x27;s becasue product is working, or im to sensitive to it. I dont see no redness at all..Anyone?</li>
            <li> This product worked great for me after just 1 week my very dark circles and puffiness disappeared. I have used this product so far for 3 months with great results. I had ran out for a week and noticed the puffiness returning. I won&#x27;t run out again!!&lt;br /&gt;Guess it works different for each individual but for me wonderful</li>
            <li> This product is not for dark under eye circle as indicated online.  The box nor the tube indicates it is for dark under eye circles.  That is the only reason why i bought the product. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other eye creams. This one is not any better and maybe a little less moisturizing than some. I used to use a Burt&#x27;s Bees product, but it has come under some concern about a changed formula. So, I thought I would try this one. I liked Burt&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my eyes. Not irritating. Haven&#x27;t seen difference on fine lines yet.</li>
            <li> I like this !  It is effective and gentle!  You only need a small amount to get the job done!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and love it.  It&#x27;s light yet moist.  Gentle to the eyes and skin.  Applies easily.  I like the container and it&#x27;s affordable.  Much better $ here than stores.</li>
            <li> Works well with my sensitive eyes. Not always in stock at my local retail. Good deal here, and didn&#x27;t leave the house!</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream even better then some of my high end skincare creams.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s doing a great job of softening and smoothing my under eye area. It has already become a favorite even after only using it a short time now.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this for a long time. I&#x27;m not surprised it works so well.&lt;br /&gt; Neutrogena&#x27;s anti wrinkle cream works like a dream and was one of my most used facial creams this past winter we had in New york which was brutal. I will use this eye cream alongside theÂ cream. Great products, im very happy ðŸ˜„ with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Made my eyes a little dried</li>
            <li> This eye cream didn&#x27;t turn out to be as awesome as I expected due to the reviews I read on this product! It is plain OK, I have been using it properly and it hasn&#x27;t made a difference when it comes down to the tone of my skin and I have been using it for 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think with these type of products depends on your skin complexion &amp; genetics for the most part, so I do believe I&#x27;m mainly screwed in that sense when it comes down to dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it helps when your eyes are PUFFY or there is a high chance they will be puffy the next day. Like the day after you ate salty foods/ a late night/ crying etc etc etc. I did notice that if I applied the cream before I went to bed I would wake up with pretty much no puffyness &amp; I would apply it in the morning too and it would look amazing within the hour. And I haven&#x27;t found any products that work that well in that sense.</li>
            <li> My most favorite eye cream! Goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve purchased it. I have eye allergies and this eye cream has been a god-send for me. It soothes my the skin around my eyes and helps the skin heal if it has become irritated by something else. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream that does not make my eyes burn or itch.  It is just the right amount of moisture around the eyes so that I can still put on my eye make up without it mixing with it and getting all sloppy.  It has worked to improve they way the skin around my eyes looks and feels. My eyes are 40 something years old but they look much younger with this stuff, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff...have been using it for at least 15 years.  It soaks in fast and is perfect for the sensitive under eye area.  Love the alpha hydroxy.  Girls, if you&#x27;re over 40, these are the two words you want to remember:  alpha hydroxy!</li>
            <li> I mistakenly bought this eye cream instead of ageless intensive eye cream, and I am very disappointed , because it is not the same, and its horrible, maybe it has to do something with the fact, that it had no original box and it was not sealed. Unfortunately--I cannot use this particular Healthy skin eye cream , because it makes my under eyes wrinkles look worth.</li>
            <li> just as I had ordered</li>
            <li> I use this eye cream most of the time.  It is a handy size to carry on trips with me.  I order this often from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena for years and love all of their products.  I use this eye cream and it goes on nicely and makes the area around my eyes feel great.  Will use this again and again.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is okay, I started to use Vichy. I like Vichy better even if its a tad more expensive but we are worth it girls. But make your choice you know&lt;br /&gt;your skin. The consistency on this eye cream is rich.</li>
            <li> A tiny eye cream without any package or box, which makes me a little worried about its quality and date....</li>
            <li> I am a man who is concerned about wrinkles. I tried alot of different products because I have acne-prone skin. This product stays where it is supposed to under your eyes and over your crows-feet. I have noticed that when you put other under-eye creams on they end up all over your face because of how oily they are. I am 49 and have noticed a good change in the appearance of my lines and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this eye cream, it&#x27;s super light, and it is really good!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent cream!  I will buy it again and again and again</li>
            <li> wife has used for years</li>
            <li> Works as intended and advertised</li>
            <li> I bought this from a drug store a couple of years ago. It actually works! Dark circles and puffiness gone in a matter of minutes. I love this stuff! I often work at night so dark circles and puffiness happen. But some how this little miracle works its magic in less than ten minutes. It takes a few times to lessen the dark circles and it does not work for wrinkles. It smells bad to me but if it works, I will suffer through the smell. But I give 5 stars for actually doing what it advertises. Unlike the hundreds of products that don&#x27;t.    I cant find it in stores but I am glad its still available on line.     One thing though I gave it to my mom and she only got irritation and more puffiness, so test it out for allergies.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and can&#x27;t really say it gets rid of the bags under my eyes--but it is more affordable than some of the other eye products.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is okay.  I think I&#x27;m still a bit lost as to what an eye cream should do.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll notice the difference in 40 years when I don&#x27;t have wrinkles around my eyes and my friends do.  I just don&#x27;t see that it is doing anything.</li>
            <li> I HAVE NOT USED THIS BEFORE.  IT APPEARS TO BE SOOTHING TO MY EYES.  I HAVE ALLERGIES AND THIS IS HELPFUL.  I CANNOT SAY IT REMOVES WRINKLES, BUT IT FEELS GOOD ON MY EYES.  NEUTROGENA PRODUCTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD SELECTION FOR ME.</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream.  It moisturizes well, around the eyes.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. I have been using Neutrogena products for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting to be that age where my lower eye area is starting to show dark circles.... boo. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week and I&#x27;m already noticing results. My makeup goes on smoother and the dark circles are fading. It&#x27;s also helping the little crinkles. Ahhh, aging sucks but Neutrogena makes it a bit better.</li>
            <li> Hi, everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife use this cream every time when go out. She says that it makes wonders with her under-eye skin! 3 minutes and there is no trace of sleepless night or something like that! My wife&#x27;s eyes are happy so me too :)</li>
            <li> I get dark circles under my eyes. This eye cream has brightened them and I just use a small amount under my eyes. Will continue to use!  Great product for black women under eye dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin in some areas of the face, especially around the eyes. I have used this eye cream for several years now but all of a sudden this year it has become hard to find. I was thrilled to find it here, and will reorder soon.</li>
            <li> Feels great around the eyes</li>
            <li> My skin is not extra sensitive, but this cream started to irritate it after a week of use. I stopped for a couple of weeks, then decided to give it another try. After single application, the skin around the eyes became red, flaky and itchy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft,gentle to the eyes.</li>
            <li> Good price for this product.  So convenient to have it delivered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now, and already I can notice puffiness, dark circles, and fine lines dissapearing! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena&#x27;s Health Skin Anti-Wrinkle day cream, so I decided to give this eye cream a shot. It works well. No irritation and is easy to apply. Overall, I&#x27;d say the day cream works better than the eye cream, but it&#x27;s not bad. Keeps the area around my eyes moisturized. I&#x27;m in my early 30s so I can&#x27;t comment on its effect on crows feet, but as a moisturizer, it&#x27;s decent. I do prefer the other products in this same line though - the Healthy Skin line.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way toward softening fine lines and keeping the eye area moist.  Love this product and have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> Got what I expected and it was so easy to order and receive.  Good product at a competitive price!</li>
            <li> This eye cream does a good job of smoothing the skin around the eye. Is non irritating, with good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for 3 months and haven&#x27;t seen much for change. I add on before I put on my makeup and before I go to bed. Nothing... I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again as I was hoping for better results. It goes on nicely and isn&#x27;t too oily, then dries fast so that I can apply my makeup. The price is competitive when buying it with Amazon Subscription as it&#x27;s about 3-4 less than CVS.</li>
            <li> I really like Neutrogena&#x27;s products, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s only me or it happens to everybody, when I use this product, it makes my eyes burns for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Product was ok. Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This stuff works but it takes time. With all skin related products it can only do a little with every use.</li>
            <li> This never worked for me, and it was pretty expensive. It also says nothing about helping with dark circles under your eyes, where it&#x27;s advertised as helping with that issue on amazon. I could not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to do the job.  I love the squeeze tube (instead of a hard container) because you can squeeze every last bit out and there is less waste.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  Currently looking at the eye mask for the swelling under my eyes; or scheduling a facial to see what they recommend.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used the expensive Lancome and other European very expensive brands.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles around my eyes, but have always had dark circles because of my allergies.  This product seems to lighten this problem area a little bit, time will tell.  The price for Neutrogena is great and it also doesn&#x27;t cause any allergic reactions like some other products have in the past.</li>
            <li> My wife likes Neutrogena products. This eye cream absorbs very good, has nice smell. Small wrinkles disappeared. And dark circles are not so dark as it was before. My wife likes this cream, cos it&#x27;s suitable for her eyes now.</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is my story with this awesome product. My husband has been using this cream for years now...Probably 3-4 but for a couple of those years I&#x27;ve noticed an amazing change on his skin around his eyes. If I didn&#x27;t know him better I would think there was some beauty surgery or something like botox involved. Recently my skin began to noticeably age, especially around the eyes, with this large red melanoma spot on my left eyelid which I&#x27;ve had and has continued to grow slightly for about 3 years. I was told the only way of removing it was with surgery but that was not a option for me so I&#x27;ve dealt with it and try to cover it with makeup. One day about 3 weeks ago, I began to use his Neutrogena Eye Cream but without letting him know. Just to try it for a couple days not imagining what was going to happen. Aside from brighter skin around the eyes, diminishing lines and circles, I could not believe my eyes...LITERALLY!!! That reddish melanoma spot on my Left Eyelid dissapeared!!!I could not believe it. I guess it&#x27;s the \\&quot;Melibiose\\&quot; ingredient and everything else included. I went on AMAZON and found it for a much lesser price than the drugstore. Bought it immediately and received it in no time... two days! I can see an amazing difference. Now I understand why my husband swears by this cream and never goes without it! Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as it was described, the web page said works on dark circles but that is not on the package</li>
            <li> I am 29, so I don&#x27;t need a super heavy duty eye cream yet. I have tried several, and I keep going back to this, the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream. I just ordered my third tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and very sensitive eyes. This cream is not heavy, but it moisturizes my eye area wonderfully. And it doesn&#x27;t irritate them at all. I find it to be great at maintaining wrinkle free eyes, but it would probably not be great for people who already have wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in your 20s or early 30s, this is a wonderful eye cream!</li>
            <li> i love this product. so inexpensive and it WORKS.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if my wrinkles are less, but my skin has done will with it,</li>
            <li> For the few times I used it now it seems to work as I hoped it would. Easy to bring on</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin around the eyes with light lines. This product seemed to help, but I needed much more moisturizing to make my eyes look younger/dewy/moisturized sufficiently. This is a product to prevent lines and to hold on to the good condition of your skin, but I would use a very thick cream under it, as well, if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome cream! Makes the area under my eyes look great. I always notice a difference soon after using-I have been using this cream for 3 years now and will continue to use it</li>
            <li> I have the worst dark circles..Trusting that this a good brand and good price.,i tried.Not worth it at all..Tried it for 3 months..not even 2% of dark circles reduced</li>
            <li> The eye cream nourishes the delicate skin under the eyes.  I use it only when I have tired eyes from lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> Description says this is for Puffy eyes, Trust me. This is not for puffy eyes, neither does it say so on the package. More for eye moisturizing - though I doubt most need that. This has hardly any other use to be honest, wish I could give it no stars!</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream - it&#x27;s affordable, non greasy and doesn&#x27;t have any odor.</li>
            <li> I noticed smoother, softer skin after less than two weeks.  My skin is very sensitive and I had no irritation.</li>
            <li> Got it super fast and it works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement with skin around eyes while using this product. I will not reorder this product again.</li>
            <li> This is moisturizing without feeling greasy.  I love it, used it for years and so far, no wrinkles. Great value for affordable price.</li>
            <li> did wonders for my undereyes.  The fine line are disappearing and also the dark circles. I really love the results that I am seeing</li>
            <li> This is a good product but ended up not being moisturizing enough for middle aged skin.  I could have used this when I was younger but need something creamier and more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to not expect too much from these kinds of OTC products but this cream (more like a lotion) is actually working!&lt;br /&gt;Have only been using it for a few weeks and the wrinkle lines under my eyes are actually dissipating. I don&#x27;t know how it is possible&lt;br /&gt;but i&#x27;m certain this is not my imagination.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it and its not something that will end up in my medicine cabinet museum. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye cream for years, it is a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t sting eyes at all. It goes on smoothly and provides a good base for other makeup products</li>
            <li> i love this i will buy i again</li>
            <li> Its way cheaper than most of the other eye creams out there, but still does a great job.  I needed this because the skin around my eyes was getting uncomfortably dry.  If you&#x27;re looking for something without a lot of dubious anti-aging claims, I think this is your best bet.</li>
            <li> Consistently great product.</li>
            <li> so small, but really good, and you don&#x27;t need big quantities, nice cream</li>
            <li> I always like Neutrogena products.  Though I haven&#x27;t started yet, I have the confidence that it will deliver its usual excellence.</li>
            <li> didnt work that great</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really see difference</li>
            <li> Irritates the eye the next day.  Found all these weird bumps around the spot where I applied it.  Time to go natural people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - feels good in the application process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - broke out and doesn&#x27;t do much to clear up eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer it&#x27;s perfect and not so greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive eyes and skin. I have been using this eye cream for so long. Its great for under eye makeup because it is not thick. I can put this on then put my concealer on. Not stinging yea !</li>
            <li> Use it every night.  Great seller</li>
            <li> Im 32 and felt my under eye skin was starting to show signs of aging. I have tried many eye creams some which have actually made my under eyes look worse. I used Roc for senstive eyes and it made under eyes look extra crepey. I was very frustrated and about to loose hope. I have been using Neutrogena healthy eye cream for about a month and very happy with the results. Eyes looking much younger, skin is soft and supple, fine lines look reduced, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, not too greasy or too dry. I think sometimes you have to try a bunch of different products to find what suits your skin. This product might not work for others but it works great for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with hopes that it would remove dark circles.  It slightly moisturizes but that&#x27;s it. Some reviewers might be pleased with the product, but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I have very sensitive skin and this has never irritated my skin.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes!  I&#x27;m in the market though for a more natural product (trying to taper off of so many chemicals in items we use regularly).</li>
            <li> Does a great job of smoothing out your eyelids before applying shadow and prevents creases.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product actually reduces swelling but it does feel really soothing and I use it nightly</li>
            <li> Nothing didn&#x27;t happend To my face:/ I lol still older with lot of wickles. I cant not smaill happyly :(</li>
            <li> It says it reduces dark circles. Well it did not. In fact I did not notice any effects. I am still too young for wrinkles and puffy eyes. I just bought it for my dark circles and got no results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena products for years.  It&#x27;s recommended by dermatologists, especially for sensitive skin.  I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> works amazing on my sensitive skin especially when i get rashes or dry skin around my eyes. moisturizes gently and soaks into skin to allow for application of makeup or other lotions on top. not greasy, a small pearl sized amount is good for all around both eyes. package is quite small in size, looks much bigger in the picture.</li>
