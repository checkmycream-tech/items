            <li>I really like this Vitamin C cleanser.</li>
            <li>My skin feels extremely clean after washing, but never dry.</li>
            <li>This product really does take it all off.</li>
            <li>It tightens without drying it out like so many other products have.</li>
            <li>Love it combined with all my other Radha beauty products.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my face feeling nice and clean and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li>Most of my other cleansing products seemed to work, but nothing compared to this!</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;ve not heard of this company before, it was highly rated and for those of us who are very conscious of our skin.......... other customers&#x27; reviews are very important.</li>
            <li>I love that Radha Beauty Vitamin C Cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like many other facial cleansers on the market.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>so i highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so ive been very careful of what kind of product i use for my skin especially to my face.</li>
            <li>It did sting my eye just a little when I tried to use it for mascara removal but its really more of a face make up cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was hesitant to try a new cleanser, but I&#x27;m so grateful I did!</li>
            <li>Gentle on my sensitive redheaded complexion.</li>
            <li>- It gently cleanses my sensitive skin without stinging, burning, etc...</li>
            <li>Ive always had a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>face feeling clean ,not tight or dry</li>
            <li>too early to tell!</li>
            <li>The cleanser foams nicely yet does not leave my skin feeling tight and dry as some cleansers do.</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C Cleanser is NO different and really works</li>
            <li>She is 16 years old and is breaking out a lot.</li>
            <li>I am really liking this cleanser and will definitely purchase in the future, I highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to smell also</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for my eczema!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if this has really done anything to improve my skin, overall.</li>
            <li>My skin, THANKS ME...it is tighter, wrinkles aren&#x27;t as deep, and my age spots have faded.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this product makes my skin so soft and radiant.</li>
            <li>A nice thin consistency that the skin soaks up.</li>
            <li>I generally have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have used it everyday for about two weeks now and it leaves my skin feeling clean but not overdone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleanser as well as the entire Radha Beauty line.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face and feeling smooth and exfoliated, without the harsh debris!</li>
            <li>Cleans my skin very well, without making it overly dry.</li>
            <li>It comes in a generous sized bottle.&lt;br /&gt; - I only need a tiny squeeze to wash my whole face and neck!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean after I use the cleanser, yet it is not drying nor irritating.</li>

            <li> The scent is mild.</li>
            <li> I am also noticing more evenness in my skintone, which I hope only gets better.</li>
            <li> , that is very modern in appearance by the way!</li>
            <li> I really like it, does a great job of cleaning my face every night and it seems like this mixed with their retinol cr√®me has really improved the fine lines I was getting.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to those looking for a gentle, yet effective cleanser.</li>

            <li> I really like this Vitamin C Cleanser by Radha Beauty!</li>

            <li> This product didn&#x27;t last me long though because my husband tried it and loved it</li>
            <li> I have not had a cleanser leave my face feeling so amazing and clean but not tight and harsh.  </li>
            <li> - I put this on my konjac sponge and it has nice little suds that cleans my skin</li>
            <li> Beside that, personally, I haven&#x27;t experienced anything bad about it, just it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> All of Radha Beauty products I&#x27;ve tried has been high end, and given me results!</li>

            <li> I really like this Vitamin C cleanser.</li>
            <li> My skin feels extremely clean after washing, but never dry.</li>
            <li> This product really does take it all off.</li>
            <li> It tightens without drying it out like so many other products have.</li>
            <li> Love it combined with all my other Radha beauty products.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face feeling nice and clean and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Most of my other cleansing products seemed to work, but nothing compared to this!</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve not heard of this company before, it was highly rated and for those of us who are very conscious of our skin.......... other customers&#x27; reviews are very important.</li>
            <li> I love that Radha Beauty Vitamin C Cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like many other facial cleansers on the market.</li>
            <li> It feels super refreshing on my skin and didn&#x27;t dry it out like other cleansers do.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> so i highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so ive been very careful of what kind of product i use for my skin especially to my face.</li>
            <li> It did sting my eye just a little when I tried to use it for mascara removal but its really more of a face make up cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was hesitant to try a new cleanser, but I&#x27;m so grateful I did!</li>
            <li> Gentle on my sensitive redheaded complexion.</li>
            <li> - It gently cleanses my sensitive skin without stinging, burning, etc...</li>
            <li> Ive always had a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> face feeling clean ,not tight or dry</li>
            <li> too early to tell!</li>
            <li> The cleanser foams nicely yet does not leave my skin feeling tight and dry as some cleansers do.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Cleanser is NO different and really works</li>
            <li> She is 16 years old and is breaking out a lot.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this cleanser and will definitely purchase in the future, I highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to smell also</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for my eczema!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this has really done anything to improve my skin, overall.</li>
            <li> My skin, THANKS ME...it is tighter, wrinkles aren&#x27;t as deep, and my age spots have faded.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this product makes my skin so soft and radiant.</li>
            <li> A nice thin consistency that the skin soaks up.</li>
            <li> I generally have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have used it everyday for about two weeks now and it leaves my skin feeling clean but not overdone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleanser as well as the entire Radha Beauty line.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face and feeling smooth and exfoliated, without the harsh debris!</li>
            <li> Cleans my skin very well, without making it overly dry.</li>
            <li> It comes in a generous sized bottle.&lt;br /&gt; - I only need a tiny squeeze to wash my whole face and neck!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean after I use the cleanser, yet it is not drying nor irritating.</li>
            <li> It definitely dissolves the make up because I don&#x27;t see much of it on the washcloth either and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry or tight.</li>
            <li> all from this due to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This seemed to get down deep into the pores, leaving my face soft and mosturized.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather like other facial cleansers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only need a tiny amount, a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> face felt really dry after using it and also felt like something didn&#x27;t wash</li>
            <li> Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> this does NOT dry your face out or mke it feel tight.  </li>
            <li> I feel like these ingredients set the product apart from some of the drug store brands that are full of questionable unpronounceable ingredients.</li>
            <li> I feel it cleans deep down, this will be my cleanser from now on.</li>
            <li> Less than a dime size is enough for face and neck.</li>
            <li> As with their other products, a little bit goes a long way, so this container should last me for quite a while.</li>
            <li> After cleansing, I use Radha&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum, Radha&#x27;s Eye Gel, Radha&#x27; Retinol Cream, mixed with a little of Radha&#x27;s Fractionated Coconut Oil.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather a ton and dry out my skin or leave it feeling tight either.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other brand cleansers that I have used, it does not make me break out.</li>
            <li> so your other products will work.  </li>
            <li> but I half expected it to be foamy</li>
            <li> but this product does not have any bad scent and so comfortable to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other products from Radha and I like them all.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people cursed with combination skin and with the season change I end up with a dull, dry, flaky complexion almost no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> I notice blemishes and dark spots fading!</li>
            <li> It does NOT lather into a foamy mess though! :</li>
            <li> and I notice dark spots slowly diminishing.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin C cleansers in the past that had a citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li> I usually have to put a moisturizer on immediately after washing my face, but it is not needed with this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I really like Radha, but so disappointed with this skincare line.</li>
            <li> Hated everything about this product: the runny Vaseline consistency, the weak artificial citrus scent, and the lack of foaming/cleansing action.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at 1st.</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out terribly.</li>
            <li> makes my eyes sting horribly.</li>

            <li> The Vitamin C Facial Cleanser is the perfect addition Radha&#x27;s skin care line. My skin feels very clean after I use the cleanser, yet it is not drying nor irritating. Unlike some other brand cleansers that I have used, it does not make me break out. The scent is mild. As with their other products, a little bit goes a long way, so this container should last me for quite a while.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my favorite morning cleansers since it leaves my skin fresh and clean but not dry. There is no scent, which is great for those sensitive to fragrance. I also use it as a second cleanser at night after removing my makeup with an oil. I have combo oily skin and this has worked great! I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> If you want your skin to peel off, try this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome.  A tiny bit goes a long ways.  Great product</li>
            <li> Hated everything about this product: the runny Vaseline consistency, the weak artificial citrus scent, and the lack of foaming/cleansing action.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Gentle on my sensitive redheaded complexion.</li>
            <li> I really like this Vitamin C Cleanser by Radha Beauty! It comes in a 4 fl oz. orange squeeze tube, that is very modern in appearance by the way! This Vitamin C Cleanser is made in the USA in a FDA-Registered Facility, and is cruelty free! This ALL NATURAL cleanser has antioxidants, is moisturizing, and helps to fade sun spots and smooth skin texture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Do I Love About It?:&lt;br /&gt; - It comes in a generous sized bottle.&lt;br /&gt; - I only need a tiny squeeze to wash my whole face and neck!&lt;br /&gt; - I put this on my konjac sponge and it has nice little suds that cleans my skin well!&lt;br /&gt; - It does NOT lather into a foamy mess though! :)&lt;br /&gt; - It gently cleanses my sensitive skin without stinging, burning, etc...&lt;br /&gt; - Does not have a scent!&lt;br /&gt; - Leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, hydrated, and tightened/toned (not in a uncomfortable way though)&lt;br /&gt; - My skin feels SO clean afterwards, but is still really silky to touch!&lt;br /&gt; - My face looks refreshed, renewed, and glows after continuous use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I REALLY like this face cleanser! It is one of the better face washes I have tried, well...ever! All of Radha Beauty products I&#x27;ve tried has been high end, and given me results! This Vitamin C Cleanser is NO different and really works well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** I received this product to try for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. ALL opinions are my own and MY OWN ONLY! I would never recommend a product I wouldn&#x27;t and don&#x27;t use myself! *****</li>
            <li> I received this cleanser for my honest and unbiased review. I was skeptical at 1st. But as soon as I tried it, I was hooked. My face felt deep cleaned. Most of my other cleansing products seemed to work, but nothing compared to this! This seemed to get down deep into the pores, leaving my face soft and mosturized. I had no breakouts, no stinging of the eyes, and it removed my eye makeup with ease. I highly recommend this cleanser. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is fantastic. It leaves my combination skin softer, brighter, and feeling fresh. The cleanser foams nicely yet does not leave my skin feeling tight and dry as some cleansers do. I have used vitamin C cleansers in the past that had a citrus fragrance. This cleanser has no fragrance.  I only need about a pea sized amount to cleanse my face, neck, and d√©colletage.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff, good ingredients, makes my skin glow</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Got this for my daughter. She said it lathered and felt really good. She only used it once so far but really liked it, thank you for a great product</li>
            <li> My all time favorite cleanser! Leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh</li>
            <li> This cleanser is wonderful, leaves my skin so soft and feeling great. I feel it cleans deep down, this will be my cleanser from now on. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I got this free item for testing and review purposes. My daughter loved this product. She is 16 years old and is breaking out a lot. It gave her a very smooth and clean feeling after use. It is unscented and that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li> Another great item sent to me by Radha.  It&#x27;s so gentle but still feels like it&#x27;s cleaning your skin.  This product didn&#x27;t last me long though because my husband tried it and loved it and I also let my pre-teen use it on his face. Yeah it&#x27;s that gentle!</li>
            <li> I am really liking this cleanser, it makes my skin feel smooth, soft and I notice dark spots slowly diminishing. I use this both morning and night and I also add a drop of Radha Tea Tree Oil to it to cleanse my face- I notice blemishes and dark spots fading! I am really liking this cleanser and will definitely purchase in the future, I highly recommend trying this product! I was lucky enough to try this product for free but this is 100% my own opinion.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I would recommend this product to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn on this product. Personally, I didn&#x27;t like it. But I passed it to my husband who does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather like other facial cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;My face felt really dry after using it and also felt like something didn&#x27;t wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really have a scent.&lt;br /&gt;The amount of lathering it created wasn&#x27;t an issue for him&lt;br /&gt;Said it left his face very clean and felt great.&lt;br /&gt;Said he would purchase again</li>
            <li> I really like it, does a great job of cleaning my face every night and it seems like this mixed with their retinol cr√®me has really improved the fine lines I was getting. Back to getting the &amp;#34; is that your sister? dude that&#x27;s your mom, no way&amp;#34; comments again</li>
            <li> Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this has been the best product that I have tried from Radha so far. I am one of those people cursed with combination skin and with the season change I end up with a dull, dry, flaky complexion almost no matter what I do. This cleanser really seems to help. I don&#x27;t really know why but I half expected it to be foamy but it&#x27;s not, which doesn&#x27;t detract any from the product for me but I might like to try the same ingredients in a foaming cleanser too if they ever make one. I do love that even though it is made with vitamin C, which I assumed might be a little strong, it also has and rose hip and other natural oils. I feel like these ingredients set the product apart from some of the drug store brands that are full of questionable unpronounceable ingredients. The end result of using this is it gets the daily buildup off without stinging or tightness. The cleanser is a light, clear gel with no disconcernable scent so I would consider it a good pick for men or women. I have used it everyday for about two weeks now and it leaves my skin feeling clean but not overdone. I have tons left in the tube but I would definitely buy another when this one is finished.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleanser!! It leaves my skin so smooth. It tightens without drying it out like so many other products have. I usually have to put a moisturizer on immediately after washing my face, but it is not needed with this cleanser. I was given this product to try out and review and I am so glad that I had this opportunity!! This is my go to face wash from here on out!!!</li>
            <li> Great cleanser! My skin feels soft, smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I really like this Vitamin C cleanser. It feels super refreshing on my skin and didn&#x27;t dry it out like other cleansers do.</li>
            <li> Love it .  I saw a change in my completion within a week</li>
            <li> The product is good. My skin feels clean and smooth, fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Ive always had a very sensitive skin so ive been very careful of what kind of product i use for my skin especially to my face. I tried this cleanser from radha and i dont regret. It makes my skin so smooth, lighter and brighten it up and helps it tighten that leaves no wrinkles. I am sensitive to smell also but this product does not have any bad scent and so comfortable to use so i highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided in review purposes.</li>
            <li> After only one week of using the Vitamin C Cleanser, I am already loving it! My skin feels extremely clean after washing, but never dry. I am also noticing more evenness in my skintone, which I hope only gets better. I highly recommend this product to those looking for a gentle, yet effective cleanser. Looking forward to trying more of this line!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Vitamin C facial cleanser by Radha Beauty! It&#x27;s so gentle! I have very sensitive skin and was hesitant to try a new cleanser, but I&#x27;m so grateful I did! My skin has never looked or felt better! I highly recommend this cleanser as well as the entire Radha Beauty line. My skin is has greatly improved to the touch as well as in appearance since I began using the Radha Skin care line! This cleanser is a valued addition! Thank you again Radha Beauty!!!!</li>
            <li> Having a good facial cleanser is important and Radha does a great job with this product!  I love that it is so free and clear of anything not needed, leaves my face feeling truly clean!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. Less than a dime size is enough for face and neck. Very viscous and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. Will buy more and will be looking into more of their products. Arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Awesome face wash! Smells nice. Only need a tiny amount, a little goes a long way!! My face is glowing after cleansing. Then I use Radha Vitamin C serum. A nice thin consistency that the skin soaks up. I follow up with Radha moisturizer. I&#x27;m a simple girl. Easy routine and works for me. I hide this from my daughter because I don&#x27;t want to share. If you don&#x27;t smile, Radha will refund you. I&#x27;m smiling!!!!</li>
            <li> just started using this product! too early to tell!</li>
            <li> Amazing cleanser!  Takes make up off nicely!</li>
            <li> makes my eyes sting horribly. Cleans well and feels good on the skin, but not for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser. It has a nice smell and so far works well. I was given a coupon to try this product for free and I am very happy with it so far!!</li>
            <li> A great, light weight cleanser. Doesn&#x27;t break me out. Gentle enough for my eczema! A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this has really done anything to improve my skin, overall. But I do like it. I generally have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother it in anyway. It doesn&#x27;t lather a ton and dry out my skin or leave it feeling tight either. I&#x27;ve tried a few other products from Radha and I like them all. Try em out, they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li> Very nice, light &amp; clean feeling after use, leaving a gentle scent of aloe. So far, it&#x27;s been wonderful, &amp; haven&#x27;t broken out @ all from this due to sensitive skin. I&#x27;d def buy again          VERIFIED PURCHASE</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin soft and brightens your skin complexion.&lt;br /&gt;All of their products are Amazing!</li>
            <li> Radha Beauty Vitamin C Cleanser works great at removing every trace of dirt and makeup from my face. After using this product for about a week I noticed my pores were shrinking, my skin looked more radiant and my fine lines were softening. I love that Radha Beauty Vitamin C Cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like many other facial cleansers on the market. I also love that this cleanser works to help reduce sunburn cells to correct the damage caused by sun exposure. As a runner, I run outside often so anything that helps with sun damage is wonderful! Disclosure: I received product(s) for free, in exchange for my honest review. I only recommend products I&#x27;ve used personally, and believe will be good fit for consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found my review helpful, please remember to click &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; below! :)</li>
            <li> Love it combined with all my other Radha beauty products. It&#x27;s a great addition. Leaves my face squeaky clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> love this cleanser leaves face feeling clean ,not tight or dry</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that its tube is so cheap! All the text and graphic are not printed on the tube! It looks like that a generic plastic tube is used and then paper label is stick around it. Very cheap and unprofessional packaging! Beside that, personally, I haven&#x27;t experienced anything bad about it, just it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this after reading the reviews, but after two weeks of using this product, my face is oily and breaking out. I really like Radha, but so disappointed with this skincare line.</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out terribly.</li>
            <li> it seems to be helping with my skin its smoother and looks healthier than ever</li>
            <li> I will purchase this item again.  I only wish it contained some crystals, etc., so I could feel the &amp;#34;scrubbing action&amp;#34;  like another product I&#x27;ve used.  Though I&#x27;ve not heard of this company before, it was highly rated and for those of us who are very conscious of our skin.......... other customers&#x27; reviews are very important.</li>
            <li> Love this...this does NOT dry your face out or mke it feel tight.  It thoroughly cleans and leaves your skin feeling GOOD and LOOKING GOOD.  This is the first. step to having good skin and this is A MUST. You have to have clean skin so your other products will work.  After cleansing, I use Radha&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum, Radha&#x27;s Eye Gel, Radha&#x27; Retinol Cream, mixed with a little of Radha&#x27;s Fractionated Coconut Oil.  My skin, THANKS ME...it is tighter, wrinkles aren&#x27;t as deep, and my age spots have faded.  THANK YOU RADHA...YOU WORK FOR ME !!!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  I feel like I am doing something really healthy for my skin!  I have not had a cleanser leave my face feeling so amazing and clean but not tight and harsh.  Love this product and company.  HONEST review left for receipt of product.</li>
            <li> This is a great face wash. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks each night.. It has no smell, good ingredients and cleans great! It doesn&#x27;t lather at all so you might not think its working but it is.  I have used products that seem like they&#x27;re cleaning your face and then you use a toner and see dirt on the cotton pad.  This product really does take it all off. No dirt comes off on the cotton pad.  It did sting my eye just a little when I tried to use it for mascara removal but its really more of a face make up cleanser.  It definitely dissolves the make up because I don&#x27;t see much of it on the washcloth either and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry or tight. It&#x27;s really a nice product.  This company has the fastest delivery as well.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using this regularly since it was sent to me for review. Perfect timing, since we love using it after a hot day in the sun. Great value, top, since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. Cleans my skin very well, without making it overly dry. I have oily skin and this product makes my skin so soft and radiant. I was given a bottle to sample. I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been good with my skin type, I have Rosacia and my skin hasn&#x27;t been irritated by this product.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and so far so good.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face feeling nice and clean and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face and feeling smooth and exfoliated, without the harsh debris!</li>
