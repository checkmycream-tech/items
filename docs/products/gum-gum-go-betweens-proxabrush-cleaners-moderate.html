            <li>While these did not work on my teeth, I found a perfect use for them; cleaning out the ports on my hummingbird feeders.</li>
            <li>I have some spaces between my teeth, and this product is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Floss and Proxabrush together work perfectly!</li>

            <li>It is a very good brand</li>
            <li>great for getting out the stuff that nestles between your teeth</li>
            <li>Then I give her Temptations treats as a reward and she is a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great cleaning in between teeth after brushing</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>these are great.</li>
            <li>I find them very effective in cleaning between teeth.</li>
            <li>Okay, so these are one of those things you buy with the best of intentions and then stick in your purse and forget to use.</li>
            <li>It is good product.</li>
            <li>it works really good....</li>
            <li>good and bend like some do.</li>
            <li>This is ann excellent way to clean food and plaque from between teeth and protect teeth from decay and gum inflation.</li>
            <li>Probably just the kind of error that is bound to happen sometimes.</li>
            <li>the proxa brush works great; make sure you get the right width!!</li>
            <li>These are med but good for my spaces between my teeth keep food out and easier then flossing, the brushes are strong and bristle work  </li>
            <li>The product is useful and good to have.</li>
            <li>Better to have if I used it,</li>
            <li>have to make sure the size before buying.</li>
            <li>It removes particles between each tooth even better than floss.  </li>
            <li>the better</li>
            <li>cleaners are SO much better than floss.</li>
            <li>LOVE THESE</li>
            <li>I believe that they work a lot better than floss.  </li>
            <li>These specialty brushes come in many shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li>He said the go between pulls debris much better than flossing thread.  </li>
            <li>better than tooth picks</li>
            <li>Nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>Love this item, use them all the time.</li>
            <li>MORE CHEAPLY MADE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, very helpful to me/.</li>
            <li>Not exactly what it is made for, but these are great for brushing my cat&#x27;s teeth!</li>
            <li>It gets between the teeth, and easy removes food particles.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so easy and convenient</li>
            <li>/&gt;so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry with you at all times.</li>
            <li>I have a mouth full of dental work, many crowns and gold inlays.</li>
            <li>I will be returning these and hoping to stock up on the previous design since they were perfect for my bridge and gap issues.</li>
            <li>LOVED THE ORIGINAL VERSION.THIS NEW VERSION IS PATHETIC,CERTAINLY</li>
            <li>fit in a pocket, purse, etc.</li>
            <li>They get in there where I couldn&#x27;t with anything else and really clean them up.</li>
            <li>My old dentist called these things &amp;#34;bottle brushes&amp;#34; and it is an apt description.</li>
            <li>He loves them and the dentist only gives good report.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if that&#x27;s true, but massages do supposedly increase blood circulation, so perhaps it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Here is a classic example of a company designing a product which wears out rapidly so you have to buy more---</li>
            <li>highly recommend these for cat owners who want to keep their kitties&#x27; teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>Our dentist recommended these and we have used them since and will continue because they&#x27;re easy to use and work very well to get between teeth.  </li>
            <li>Once you find the correct size brush for the gaps in your teeth that allow something like this to be used for easy cleaning, it is a very helpful tool for supplementing flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li>These are very useful for certain dental situations.  </li>
            <li>As good as expected...........</li>
            <li>I could use them, and it wasn&#x27;t worth my while complaining.</li>
            <li>These brushes are the right size but they have a foul taste and odor.</li>
            <li>Why they thought this was potentially a better design is just plain bizarre!</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT COLLAPSED DURING FIRST USE.I</li>
            <li>Hoping my next dental check-up will show better gum condition, you know, those #&#x27;s the dentist calls out 2,3..</li>
            <li>This product claims to massage your gums, and that such massages are healthy for gums.</li>
            <li>Just be aware of this issue, so you don&#x27;t accidentally swallow the brush tip when it does break off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying they should be like daggers, but they could make them so as to last a lot longer, and still be safe to use,  if they wanted.</li>
            <li>He said the difference is phenomenal compared to regular flossing.  </li>
            <li>One would have to have fairly large gaps between their teeth in order for these to work.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>: The Narrow-sized metal brush tips break off after a while, but you&#x27;ll get much use out of each brush before that happens.</li>
            <li>The Medium size really gets in there without causing any damage to to my crowns.</li>
            <li>SUPPOSED NEW AND IMPPROVED VERSION IS A JOKE !</li>
            <li>They kindly sent me a few of the old version they had on hand, but we&#x27;ve used them up.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is that you need more than one brush size because of the different gaps between your teeth.</li>
            <li>OK product and need replacement quite often as it will break off after a few weeks use.</li>
            <li>My dentist will occasionally give me a free one when I have a visit, but they do ultimately need replacing.</li>
            <li>I am going to stick with the soft picks, those are a 5+ product for sure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, no complaints.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>70 years old, I&#x27;m trying to keep as&lt;</li>
            <li>OBVIOUSLY THE NEW VERSION WAS DEVELOPED</li>
            <li>If one has larger than normal spaces between teeth</li>
            <li>barely works!</li>
            <li>The Soft Picks fit through all of them and they feel like they are cleaning your teeth, these feel a little too rough like they are grinding your teeth</li>
            <li>I ordered both moderate size and tight size and the moderate was way too big to fit between my teeth and the tight was even hard to fit between some of them.  </li>

            <li> They COULD use wires holding the little brushes which would last a long time, but choose to use too fine &amp; flimsy a wire, so they will turn to &amp;#34;flimsy city&amp;#34; and become unusable a few uses.</li>
            <li> The picture shows a proxabrush in a little case, highly portable.</li>

            <li> There are places where my brush and regular floss-er miss and these are so handy for picking up those annoying particles.</li>
            <li> I put a little paste (for cats) on the GUM bristles, and another glob on the back of my non-brush hand.</li>
            <li> I bought these here because I could find only the tight (green) size locally.</li>
            <li> they work as expected</li>
            <li> I brush one side of her mouth, dip the brush in the glob on my hand and do the other side.</li>
            <li> Wide, Medium, and Narrow.</li>
            <li> I  have a couple of tight spots though here</li>
            <li> (Tight)</li>
            <li> I use the Narrow and Medium sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> waste the money.</li>
            <li> Most cats eventually develop plaque and then gum disease, so my vet gave me cat toothpaste and a small brush, but my cat HATED the toothbrush, which was a mini version of the ones humans use.</li>
            <li> The plastic backing and bristles were just too big and uncomfortable for her mouth.</li>
            <li> I have the small ones.</li>
            <li> Then, I learned that you have to press it hard into the cap for the notch to catch making it extremely difficult to pull back out and recap.</li>
            <li> I use them to substitute for threading a flosser through a complex bridge.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT.I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND HAVE THROWN  THE NEW PRODUCT AWAY</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t press it hard past this silly notch, the brush slips out in your mouth!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but unfortunately they are too thick for the separation of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I use thin ones ther e</li>
            <li> i should have found a  THIN brush not the medium.  </li>
            <li> The new design of the GUM travel size proxa brushes is horrible.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Expensive problems.</li>
            <li> BUT WAY TOO EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> For starters, when you turn the cap over to make an extension, or handle for the brush, it&#x27;s shorter and awkward to handle.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing.</li>
            <li> AND I AM TRYING OTHERS AS A SUBSTITUTE.VERY,VERY DISAPPOINTED !</li>
            <li> These were revised a while ago, and I think they are just terrible.  </li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I am addicted to the [[ASIN:B000GGJCM0 GUM Soft-Picks-40ct]] so I got these to check out. I ordered both moderate size and tight size and the moderate was way too big to fit between my teeth and the tight was even hard to fit between some of them.  The Soft Picks fit through all of them and they feel like they are cleaning your teeth, these feel a little too rough like they are grinding your teeth and I&#x27;d worry about that with long term use.  I am going to stick with the soft picks, those are a 5+ product for sure.&lt;br /&gt;*Update/fyi to birders* While these did not work on my teeth, I found a perfect use for them; cleaning out the ports on my hummingbird feeders. They get in there where I couldn&#x27;t with anything else and really clean them up.</li>
            <li> These were recommended by my dentist&#x27;s hygienist, and they do seem to help remove plaque and tartar between my teeth. So far, no complaints. We&#x27;ll see what she thinks at my next checkup. She specifically recommended the Moderate size (red). I bought these here because I could find only the tight (green) size locally.</li>
            <li> These brushes are the right size but they have a foul taste and odor. I would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> It is good product. I bought it for my mum.</li>
            <li> It is a very good brand but unfortunately they are too thick for the separation of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended these and we have used them since and will continue because they&#x27;re easy to use and work very well to get between teeth.  These are medium but they come in several sizes to accomodate differing needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, very helpful to me/. I  use  them  to follow up on brushing..  I  have a couple of tight spots though here it doe sn&#x27;t work well. I use thin ones ther e</li>
            <li> my dissatisfaction is entirely my fault.  i should have found a  THIN brush not the medium.  ouch.  the proxa brush works great; make sure you get the right width!!</li>
            <li> These were revised a while ago, and I think they are just terrible.  The wires in the brush collapse almost immediately.  I complained to the company and asked them to go back to the old design.  They kindly sent me a few of the old version they had on hand, but we&#x27;ve used them up.</li>
            <li> great for getting out the stuff that nestles between your teeth</li>
            <li> SUPPOSED NEW AND IMPPROVED VERSION IS A JOKE ! THE PRODUCT COLLAPSED DURING FIRST USE.I LOVED THE ORIGINAL VERSION.THIS NEW VERSION IS PATHETIC,CERTAINLY A MORE CHEAPLY MADE PRODUCT.I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND HAVE THROWN  THE NEW PRODUCT AWAY AND I AM TRYING OTHERS AS A SUBSTITUTE.VERY,VERY DISAPPOINTED !OBVIOUSLY THE NEW VERSION WAS DEVELOPED TO SAVE MANUFACTURING COSTS AND INCREASE PROFITS !</li>
            <li> Wow. If you think your floss is getting everything--try one of these! I have some spaces between my teeth, and this product is wonderful! Floss and Proxabrush together work perfectly!</li>
            <li> The new design of the GUM travel size proxa brushes is horrible. Unlike the previous round design, the new ones are slightly flat on the sides. For starters, when you turn the cap over to make an extension, or handle for the brush, it&#x27;s shorter and awkward to handle.

If you don&#x27;t press it hard past this silly notch, the brush slips out in your mouth! Why they thought this was potentially a better design is just plain bizarre! I will be returning these and hoping to stock up on the previous design since they were perfect for my bridge and gap issues. Terrible!</li>

            <li> Okay, so these are one of those things you buy with the best of intentions and then stick in your purse and forget to use. But that&#x27;s a user error and no reflection on the product. The product is useful and good to have. Better to have if I used it, but oh, well.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what it is made for, but these are great for brushing my cat&#x27;s teeth! Most cats eventually develop plaque and then gum disease, so my vet gave me cat toothpaste and a small brush, but my cat HATED the toothbrush, which was a mini version of the ones humans use. The plastic backing and bristles were just too big and uncomfortable for her mouth. Even the finger brushes for infants were too uncomfy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GUM Go-betweens turned out to be perfect! Now every night she hops up on the sink for her tooth brushing. I put a little paste (for cats) on the GUM bristles, and another glob on the back of my non-brush hand. I brush one side of her mouth, dip the brush in the glob on my hand and do the other side. Then I give her Temptations treats as a reward and she is a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these for cat owners who want to keep their kitties&#x27; teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> As good as expected........... Fast Shipping...recommond to people for daily use.....it works really good....have to make sure the size before buying.</li>
            <li> Once you find the correct size brush for the gaps in your teeth that allow something like this to be used for easy cleaning, it is a very helpful tool for supplementing flossing and brushing. I use mine daily. My old dentist called these things &amp;#34;bottle brushes&amp;#34; and it is an apt description.</li>
            <li> I have the small ones. (Tight) I thought these would be a tad wider. I was wrong. One would have to have fairly large gaps between their teeth in order for these to work. If one has to force it, damage will be done to the gums will will lead to problems. Expensive problems.</li>
            <li> It removes particles between each tooth even better than floss.  Hoping my next dental check-up will show better gum condition, you know, those #&#x27;s the dentist calls out 2,3..5,6- the lower the number the better and that&#x27;s what this product is for!</li>
            <li> My husband only uses these. He loves them and the dentist only gives good report.</li>
            <li> The picture shows a proxabrush in a little case, highly portable. What I got was proxabrushes by themselves, for insertion in a handle.  I could use them, and it wasn&#x27;t worth my while complaining. Probably just the kind of error that is bound to happen sometimes. The brushes themselves i would give four stars.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing. It&#x27;s a hassle, the floss gets stuck in my teeth or it breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cleaners are SO much better than floss. It gets between the teeth, and easy removes food particles. And it&#x27;s so easy and convenient that use it several times a day, sometimes just while watching TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not just a teeth cleaner. This product claims to massage your gums, and that such massages are healthy for gums. I have no idea if that&#x27;s true, but massages do supposedly increase blood circulation, so perhaps it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes in three sizes, as measured by the gap size between your teeth -- Wide, Medium, and Narrow. I use the Narrow and Medium sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: The Narrow-sized metal brush tips break off after a while, but you&#x27;ll get much use out of each brush before that happens. Just be aware of this issue, so you don&#x27;t accidentally swallow the brush tip when it does break off. I&#x27;ve never had that happen, but the tips did sometimes break off while between my teeth, and I had to manually pull the tip out from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE BUT WAY TOO EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> Been using these for years. I believe that they work a lot better than floss.  Only drawback is that you need more than one brush size because of the different gaps between your teeth.</li>
            <li> These are med but good for my spaces between my teeth keep food out and easier then flossing, the brushes are strong and bristle work  good and bend like some do.</li>
            <li> waste the money. barely works!</li>
            <li> My dentist will occasionally give me a free one when I have a visit, but they do ultimately need replacing. I find them very effective in cleaning between teeth. I have a mouth full of dental work, many crowns and gold inlays. The Medium size really gets in there without causing any damage to to my crowns. There are places where my brush and regular floss-er miss and these are so handy for picking up those annoying particles.</li>
            <li> Only works between some teeth.</li>
            <li> This is ann excellent way to clean food and plaque from between teeth and protect teeth from decay and gum inflation.</li>
            <li> These specialty brushes come in many shapes and sizes. The seller&#x27;s description was helpful to me. Next purchase will be for a different size.</li>
            <li> Here is a classic example of a company designing a product which wears out rapidly so you have to buy more--- it&#x27;s called planned obsolescence. They COULD use wires holding the little brushes which would last a long time, but choose to use too fine &amp; flimsy a wire, so they will turn to &amp;#34;flimsy city&amp;#34; and become unusable a few uses. Quintessential corporate greed! I&#x27;m not saying they should be like daggers, but they could make them so as to last a lot longer, and still be safe to use,  if they wanted.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s doctor told him to start using Go-Between because plague was building up and causing gum disease.  He said the difference is phenomenal compared to regular flossing.  He said the go between pulls debris much better than flossing thread.  His mouth feels fresher as well.</li>
            <li> better than tooth picks</li>
            <li> Great cleaning in between teeth after brushing</li>
            <li> i think these work great! I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Hairy toothpicks-----speedy flossing</li>
            <li> they work as expected</li>
            <li> OK product and need replacement quite often as it will break off after a few weeks use. Should last longer.</li>
            <li> Great product. Does the job, all you have to do is follow the instructions and it accomplishes everything it says it will.  Came on time, packed well, will recommend it to a friend.  Nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> The best seller, and product</li>
            <li> Love this item, use them all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought every size they have of these.&lt;br /&gt;At 70 years old, I&#x27;m trying to keep as&lt;br /&gt;many of my teeth as possible and these&lt;br /&gt;certainly help me in that effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They fit in a pocket, purse, etc. and are&lt;br /&gt;so easy to use.</li>
            <li> If one has larger than normal spaces between teeth these are great. Easy to carry with you at all times. Remember, do not force the brush between teeth use floss!</li>
