            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>My makeup looks very nice when worn over this primer.</li>
            <li>My foundation went on over it very nicely.  </li>
            <li>A very nice product.</li>
            <li>Amazing cream!</li>
            <li>Amazing silky feel without the oily residue!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product  Wish it had more for the price..</li>
            <li>I found it works best if you wait just a couple of minutes before applying foundation on top of it.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the oil off all day but even more impressive, it makes applying makeup a cinch as it smooths out the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes your skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look virtually flawless and feels so good and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a good product I ordered after getting a sample.</li>
            <li>I think Loreal over the counter product Miracle Blur may be just as good.</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>Just what I need to get a good finish.</li>
            <li>When you spread on your face and let it sit for a bit, it turns into velvety smooth canvas to help bring  out the best in your makeup.</li>
            <li>velvet skin makes your skin feel silky and smooth and makeup goes on flawless and does not stick into my wrinkles,</li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>This product is described on DHC website as good for all skin types.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the velvet skin coat...</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a good makeup primer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It slides on like a silky, smooth, heavenly dream taking all the oiliness off of your face and making it as close to perfect as a product can!  </li>
            <li>its good</li>
            <li>Good under foundation.  </li>
            <li>It feels wonderfully silky smooth to the touch and is scentless and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Olive made sure I got my order ahead of schedule, and the product was just as good as I remembered!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for filling in large pore areas when you want to look your best.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try heard good reviews but didn&#x27;t work great with my skin as a primer or pore minimizer just ended up more oily</li>
            <li>Have always loved this product &amp; happy a better price online as I use it all the time.</li>
            <li>Super happy with it!</li>
            <li>This is perhaps one of my very VERY favorite products.</li>
            <li>Very very nice, very smooth and silky</li>
            <li>I read many great reviews for this.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to everyone, works great, love it.</li>
            <li>VERY NICE AND MAKES MY SKIN VERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>I found this product and brand by receiving a sample from the company in the mail and was so happy to find that I was able to order it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is one of my very favorite products.  </li>

            <li>Love!  </li>
            <li>I read many reviews before purchasing and also purchased the $5 tube of Lanacane, and I have to say, I see zero difference!</li>
            <li>Using this, I get a beautiful smooth, matte finish that stays moist all day.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it smooths the skin &amp; reduces the look of the pores, creating a more even skin texture!</li>
            <li>I really love this make-up primer!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>LOVE this Primer!  </li>
            <li>i love using this before I apply my makeup!</li>
            <li>you can use alone &amp; just dust some blush &amp; your finishing powder over it + lipgloss &amp; go or makes a great canvas to set &amp; keep your full routine in place all day!</li>
            <li>but it absolutely doesn&#x27;t work if you tried to hide your pore!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is beyond amazing and lives up to its name in turning skin into velvet-</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how well it covers pores and absorbs oil.</li>
            <li>The velvet appearance of my skin when i use this is quite amazing</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>SO ITS REALLY AMAZING</li>
            <li>I received a sample in the mail once and tried, OMG this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing and makes your skin feel like velvet.</li>
            <li>the fell is truly silky and amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice and silky.  </li>
            <li>Never had anything this nice...</li>
            <li>the texture it imparts to skin is indescribable, my face feels like a rose petal.     </li>
            <li>So nice alone instead of foundation in the summer.</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey and</li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin (mostly forehead and nose).  </li>
            <li>I wanted to buy DHC Velvet Skin Coat after loving the sample I received in the mail.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin look really nice after applying foundation.</li>
            <li>and they were all just okay, but not as good as DHC.</li>
            <li>Try either Sephora&#x27;s own brand primer or Photo Finish by Smashbox.</li>
            <li>Also, I have found that in the warm summer weather, Velvet Skin Coat helps to keep makeup from sliding off.</li>
            <li>It is nice around the eyes and cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to use a DHC product that I haven&#x27;t  liked and that goes for this one as well.  </li>
            <li>Received a sample in the mail and liked it.</li>
            <li>The stuff is nice but for the cost&lt;br /&gt;The amount seems minimum.</li>
            <li>but product is nice.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for a couple of years and was thrilled that I could buy it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>A NICE FEELING,</li>
            <li>Covers pores and wrinkles with nice velvety effect  </li>
            <li>Trying to embrace getting older, this stuff is going to be my best friend!</li>
            <li>Great Product - makeup goes on smoothly - face is so soft - I love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>Superior product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very natural and excellent make-up</li>
            <li>It will be great if the price was lower and the amount more significant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best primer I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>awesome as a primer, just so people know this is not for a foundation, it is clear not tinted.</li>
            <li>I originally tried this as a sample and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product, arrived very quickly......very happy customer!</li>
            <li>It works great to smooth skin and keep it shine free.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Make my face feel very smooth</li>
            <li>My skin feels very smooth after I put on this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin very smooth and helps makeup go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is one of the very best primers I have come across, it applies smoothly and creates a wonderful base to apply make-up resulting in a wonderful finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and therefor is gone in a jiffy, too quick to find out if it is good</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and can be used under makeup or just on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Lovely texture that helps your foundation go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>Gives you that lovely airbrushed look.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love how ithe leaves my skin velvety.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love the feel of my skin after applying.  </li>
            <li>I had better luck with Prime Time from Sephora.  </li>
            <li>Love it, if I put it on my eyes, eye shadow stays longer.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t love me</li>
            <li>Love DHC velvet skin coat.  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Love the feel of velvet on my face.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this primer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 5 years.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, leaves a nice matte finish.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel when I apply.  </li>
            <li>tends to make my face look more matte</li>
            <li>This was the best price especially with</li>
            <li>the free shipping cause believe me, I looked everywhere!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li>But it is great for the whole face.</li>
            <li>Love this product .  </li>
            <li>Velvet skin coat controls oil better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>most days I can go all day without redoing my make-up.  </li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>Love the way it feels on my face.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t quite sure if it would do what it said but decided to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>give it a try, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.    </li>
            <li>This is my favorite DHC product.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>It may just be my imagination, but the sample of Velvet Skin Coat performed better than the purchased product.  </li>
            <li>And also the tube seems to have more air than product in it.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>MY SKIN IS NOT AWFUL</li>
            <li>THIS IS AN OK PRIMER, BUT THAT&#x27;S ABOUT IT.</li>

            <li>Love how the cream seems to disappear but leaves the shin soft and looking refreshed.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth it.  </li>

            <li>I teach at a fitness studio, and my makeup stays absolutely fresh through sweaty workouts and teaching classes all morning.  </li>

            <li>Makeup goes on easierer &amp; stays fresh longer.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my makeup looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li>This only helps to soothe rather than irritate, and most importantly doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems different than the free sample I had tried and enjoyed..  </li>
            <li>It might be considered pricey, but worth every velvety cent.  </li>
            <li>so I feel it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>those rare occasions when I do wear makeup</li>
            <li>I have tried so many beauty products for my sensitive skin and almost always end up dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I liked a sample I tried well enough to purchase.</li>
            <li>For me, I had to use about two big pea drops worth to cover my face effectively (more than I thought I&#x27;d need), and it works about average for a primer, I was expecting something way more amazing.</li>
            <li>Have used it a long time - light enough yet provides great moisture.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve compared to other brands, and this one is superior.</li>
            <li>The price was right, too.  </li>
            <li>velvet is right, your makeup will stay put, you won&#x27;t look like a clown.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and it soaks right in for a matte finish.</li>
            <li>It comes in right at $21.00 dollars.  </li>
            <li>When I put this velvet skin coat over that pore, it fills it right in so you cannot even notice it.  </li>
            <li>Right before applying foundation, apply this all over face.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the smooth feeling (almost like graphite) on the skin.</li>
            <li>Great little product!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft and makeup glides on easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, including Laura mercier, Mac, jane iredale, bare minerals.</li>
            <li>and it keeps your skin feeling so nice all day long.</li>
            <li>I want to echo what others have said -- this product makes my skin look and feel terrific, and is a perfect primer for foundation or even just a little powder.  </li>
            <li>You only need a tiny amount to get great results.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and leaves your skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my skin feel smooth and matte even without foundation, and it really does minimize the looks of pores and wrinkles on ur skin when u apply it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this because it was #2 on a few top primer reviews that I had read.</li>
            <li>I like the way this product goes on;  very soft and smooth but no residue.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery and</li>
            <li>One doesn&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li>This requires two full minutes before application of make-up and it didn&#x27;t make a big difference in my fine lines</li>
            <li>DHC&#x27;s Velvet Skin Coat is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Out of the tube, it comes out more of a solid texture (a bit more solid than say vaseline??)</li>
            <li>But for oily-skinned ppl who don&#x27;t have much wrinkles, this product is heaven-sent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what the name states....</li>
            <li>and it REALLY works!</li>
            <li>It really keeps my makeup looking fresh, I can work all day and still look like a million bucks.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels silky smooth and soft hours after I use it.  </li>
            <li>i am 50ish and suffer from hot flashes and sweats.</li>
            <li>if you can afford the habit ;)</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products and it&#x27;s definitely not the most expensive.  </li>
            <li>This product makes foundation look natural and smooth.</li>
            <li>and my make-up looks so much nicer!</li>
            <li>Will continue to be one of my essential products, love it.</li>
            <li>I was concerned at first about the size of the tube and the price, but after a couple of uses, I realized that if I use it over moisturizer (and I LOVE the DHC Enzyme Q10 Cream as a moisturizer), I use just a tiny bit of Velvet Skin Coat.  </li>
            <li>That makes the tube last longer and makes the product a better value.    </li>
            <li>but overall i like it :)</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Another DHC product that I buy consistently.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and use it daily.</li>
            <li>This cream makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims it will.  </li>
            <li>Really really smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting to see if after hydrating my skin more this doesn&#x27;t have the same effect.</li>
            <li>Personally, not too many.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft and smooth when you put it on</li>
            <li>Wish so much we had had primers decades ago!</li>
            <li>I first got this as a sample and immediately had to order some.  </li>
            <li>It really feels like velvet!  </li>
            <li>I am a former model and in my spare time I love to paint with oils.  </li>
            <li>Would love to see it in a larger size.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and makes my face  feel so soft.</li>
            <li>in Tucson&#x27;s hot summer.</li>
            <li>Not terribly, but enough to not want to use it.  </li>
            <li>I tried it a few times (just to be fair) and then tossed it.</li>
            <li>This product is good, however,  I did not notice much difference from this makeup primer compared to Cover Girl&#x27;s primer at half the cost and four times</li>
            <li>Great product but the tube is small for $20.00!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for under make up, silky smooth and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and feels great, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s doing anything for my tiny lines...</li>
            <li>The product is just ok for me, but since the tube is so small it will be good for packing for a short trip.</li>
            <li>Loved the product, but too little quantity for too much money...</li>
            <li>It does not really have much of a scent, which is nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better used in problem areas, so if you think your whole face is a problem (as I sometimes do) look for a different primer.  </li>
            <li>Hard to describe, but it just makes your skin look amazing, with or without foundation!</li>
            <li>Do they have special offers once in a while?</li>
            <li>very nice but very small tube</li>
            <li>Velvet Skin Coat by DHC is proof that good things come in small packages.</li>
            <li>I still gave it three stars because it does give a nice matte effect to my skin and minimizes the appearance of large pores, so I still wear it on days when I&#x27;m going au naturel to cut down on shine.</li>
            <li>Goes a long ways very worth the money!</li>
            <li>and it works much better for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying using it and feeling this help moisturize my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>If you have large pores, put this on them before makeup and it helps reduce the look.</li>
            <li>This product does help in the application of makeup while helping to minimize the appearance of large skin pores.  </li>
            <li>Maybelline: pure silicon.</li>
            <li>I have large pores.</li>
            <li>I go back and forth trying different brands (Stila&#x27;s new one is good)</li>
            <li>It was not that good, especially for Chicago weather, it makes your skin very dry.</li>
            <li>Only need a tiny bit under foundation to smooth out fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have used this in the past and liked it very much.</li>
            <li>this is the best perfector on the market, i used to just order samples, and the little tubes last forever because you only use a lttle bit.</li>
            <li>It just takes a small amount smoothed over the face to create a great, velvety, matte surface for makeup (or bare skin).  </li>
            <li>It really does make your skin feel like velvet.  </li>
            <li>It really help me to do my makeup</li>
            <li>Does require using an astringent and closing up your pores, as you are essentially filling in the pores for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Really makes skin feel like velvet.</li>
            <li>it feels very silky</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this primer in an order I once made and absolutely had to buy the real thing.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>What I really like is that I have an oily face and using this primer</li>
            <li>and I get very oily skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>does what it says and really helps in the Ga humidity of summer.</li>
            <li>This product does absolutely nothing except clogged my pores.</li>
            <li>I REALLY DON&#x27;T SEE THE THRILL OF THIS.</li>
            <li>Expected more from it</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Will probably be purchasing a more expensive favorite because it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>but this product adds that extra smooth touch.[[ASIN:</li>

            <li>I really like this primer.</li>
            <li>This product helped minimize pores on my nose but didn&#x27;t do much for shine on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very velvety and powdery feeling, but does not leave a matte finish.</li>
            <li>Yes it really fills-in all those cracks around eyes.....</li>

            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>Lanacane costs $5 bucks at the drugstore; you get twice as much, and it works just as well.</li>
            <li>i have used Model in a Bottle to set makeup, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i dont really have wrinkles</li>
            <li>really feels like velvet.</li>
            <li>Another product with too much hype and no results.</li>
            <li>Too much money for doing nothing.</li>
            <li>It seems to create a thin, clear veneer on your skin that provides a nice matte finish to your face most of the day.</li>
            <li>Either way, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>(very flowery scent)</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel smooth and makeup last all day.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so smooth, not to mention it hid lots of my wrinkles and pores looked smaller.</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference when I use this vs. when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This product used under your foundation, will help to keep smooth skin and a longer lasting day of make-up.  </li>
            <li>It really helps control</li>

            <li>It makes your foundation go on so much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way it goes on</li>
            <li>Clear and light, makes skin feel soothed, soft, and matte in appearance without changing skin tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took the advice of other reviewers before purchasing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than the other two.</li>
            <li>I have only tried a sample of this, but so far I have found that it goes on smoothly and controls the oil pretty well.</li>
            <li>I just love it and wouldn&#x27;t use any other primer.</li>
            <li>It really makes a visible difference on this nearly 70 yr old face!!</li>
            <li>Once you start to rub it on it really feels powdery, velvety, smooth and dry.</li>
            <li>the container is kind of small</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s surprising when you first receive it how small it is - especially since it&#x27;s $20.00.  </li>
            <li>They have wonderful olive based cosmetics, but I prefer the Velvet Skin Coat above all others I have tried and the price is half that of Lancôme and much less also than Smash Box.</li>
            <li>Applying this all over the face prior to foundation gives a flawless finish, and one that is less likely to grab the make-up in the tiny creases of my aging skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried the sample of this product and was amazed at how smooth and soft it left my skin, so I bought it here</li>
            <li>I think it is basically a silicone product that puts a thin, smooth layer on top of your face so that your makeup just glides on.</li>
            <li>love this product, doesn&#x27;t really cover much, just slightly and leaves skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>the Supernatural: Winner.</li>
            <li>I still love makeup though, and I love my primers (silly, I know).  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and all of the products I&#x27;ve named in this review have worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and foundations and powders generally break me out.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the seller.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend the product, however.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is better than you can get buying directly from DHC, plus you can get the free super-saver shipping if your order totals at least $25, whereas DHC requires you to buy at least $85 worth of products in order to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li>After I wash my face with Dove beauty bar, I use Insta Natural 100% Pure Argan Oil, then I use DHC Velvet Skin Coat before I apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this makes your skin feel, but it is a little pricey for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>Love this but a little pricey.</li>
            <li>sure to let it set for a little before foundation, allowing that coat of &amp;#34;velvet skin&amp;#34; to perform)</li>
            <li>It really leaves your skin velvety soft.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be 68 years old very soon .  </li>
            <li>Before I started using this a few years ago I would constantly be touching up my makeup because my face would get greasy or the makeup would just wear off over the course of the day.</li>
            <li>I normally use a primer from Sallys beauty supply.</li>
            <li>This is the only one worth the money.  </li>
            <li>First things first, my skin is quirky as heck and sensitive like a newborn baby.  </li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel velvety, but it does not smooth over most flaws or cause my makeup to go on smoother or stay on longer.</li>
            <li>Your skin now has a lovely, smooth velvety coat to go with as is or apply your favorite makeup base.</li>
            <li>I have dry flaky skin with a little rosacea for good measure.</li>
            <li>It really makes the makeup go on smoothly (and you also end up using less foundation than you normally would).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 43 years old with medium skin (not oily or dry) with light wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It feels so silky, and it provides a nice, rich feeling base for makeup which glides on smoothly after the primer has been applied.</li>
            <li>Just put a tiny bit on your face right before you put on your foundation.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t live up to their hype.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for year, and now I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>It makes applying make-up a new experience.  </li>
            <li>I like it much better than similar products by other high end</li>
            <li>I only wish it was available in a larger tube or jar.  </li>
            <li>great pre-make-up base, smooth.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have color, great base to smooth skin</li>
            <li>I wish it comes in a larger tube though since I find that the product runs out too fast (or maybe I&#x27;m using too much of it during each application).  </li>
            <li>Only use during night time event b/c it can dry pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Spoils me  because I love the way it smooths then keeps make up from an oily or uneven appearance!</li>
            <li>I saw the review here that said it had the exact same ingredients as Lanacane Gel.  </li>
            <li>The Lanacane Gel contains corn starch, which VSC does not, but they are, otherwise, pretty similar.</li>
            <li>For all I can tell it is the exact same product.</li>
            <li>Have used this for years makes your skin soft and pores disappear!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are other products out there, that will work better and last longer.</li>
            <li>and she had the exact same things to say.</li>
            <li>It is pricey as well, but not more so than most high-end primers.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I closes the large pores on my nose &amp; gives my skin an all over matte yet not dry finish.  </li>
            <li>--I always appreciate the reviewers that research these details--but it feels like it has silicone, which lasts just long enough for makeup to slide on smoothly, stay there, and lot leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure if this is the holy grail of primers, but it works really well and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Also, if my skin is very dry, it will make my dry patches more noticeable after I put foundation on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 48 years old and have medium skin and a very clear complexion.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m OLD - very old.</li>
            <li>-  takes care of any stickiness from moisturizers or creams - leaves my skin soft and smooth; like down.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to use this from all the great reviews, but I have to say I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li>However, after getting a few free samples from DHC, this is one product I cannot live without.  </li>
            <li>Its hard to describe this little tube-its just great</li>
            <li>This is a foundation primer and is worth every single penny!  </li>
            <li>until I realized it has the exact same major ingredients as Lanacane anti-chafing gel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big makeup/lotion/product user, but I decided to try something to help smooth out rough looking skin from over the years.  </li>
            <li>This one has no shine and yet is soft creamy to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It is light on the skin as well, not oily or heavy.</li>
            <li>It does glide on, makes your skin feel so soft, and it keeps the shine away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I also can have sensitive skin and this never makes me break out.</li>
            <li>Cheaper at Amazon than from DHC directly.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had problems with breakouts or irritations.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten this directly from DHC before.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft ad refresh.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this product is that once you try it, you will be absolutely hooked.</li>
            <li>I use it without make up and it makes my face feel really soft.</li>
            <li>I apply it before my make up and it makes my skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>This is a creamy opaque gel which truly goes on like velvet and gives your skin, beneath your foundation, a soft look of perfection.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and velvety</li>
            <li>I am 71 years old.  </li>
            <li>This product makes your skin feel incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>It is non greasy and makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and isn&#x27;t oily under make-up.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference between a cheaper brand and this one as far as looks to my skin.</li>
            <li>You do not need to use much and should apply only in the oily areas.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, &amp; my mineral powder makeup can&#x27;t keep up, but with this product, it last hours longer that it would without it!</li>
            <li>Product makes skin and lips feel soft and reduces lip wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old.</li>
            <li>A minute amount is all you need to have your skin feel so soft and plump...  </li>
            <li>Really makes your face look fresher and your pores smaller.  </li>
            <li>I have a naturally oily face and this primer helps minimize the amount of oil on my face.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy, not slippery.</li>
            <li>going for the natural look with this stuff is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Takes away a shiny face and leaves a soft finish.</li>
            <li>I just wish the tube was bigger because it goes fast.</li>
            <li>It does work well for smoothing soft lines under eyes</li>
            <li>DHC makes the best makeup base primer out there.  </li>
            <li>loved it but too expensive</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 20 yrs and find it the very best  makeup base.  </li>
            <li>I use the DHC Velvet Skin Coat before applying my liquid base, and it helps my makeup go on flawlessly - hiding skin imperfections and decreasing the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>An almost perfect base for liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome base product to use under your foundation, after you put your moisturizer on.  </li>
            <li>It creates a flawless foundation under base makeup or can be worn alone.</li>
            <li>I find it good but too expensive.  </li>
            <li>I have a permanent very open pore right next to my nose near my cheek.  </li>
            <li>Using the other same two products, but not this, the foundation doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly</li>
            <li>As you get older, the skin loses moisture and make-up just doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It only takes very little to get a smooth face!  </li>
            <li>I have added this product to my daily skin care routine, I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>Instantly mattifies skin and lasts pretty well, especially if you use powder as well.</li>
            <li>and a lot of ppl wrote in their reviews that a little goes a long way, but i dont think thats really true, but its not like you have to use a whole bunch of it to cover ur face.</li>
            <li>but it left my skin feeling dry and more wrinkled looking than other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>A small drop covers the face allowing liquid or powder makeup to go smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>again, pure silicon but three times the price of the Maybelline and not only didn&#x27;t work well but didn&#x27;t work well with my moisturizer - created a white residue.</li>
            <li>Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind</li>
            <li>Monistat chaffing gel works/feels exactly the same as this primer and is only $5 in a bigger tube!</li>
            <li>I use it on moisturized bare skin with no other makeup.</li>
            <li>I used to order directly from DHC but since it was about the same price with no shipping on Amazon</li>
            <li>Sometimes I will even skip my foundation and just wear this bare,</li>
            <li>I like it underneath Bare Minerals powder.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel really soft, but doesn&#x27;t minimize the look of pores or help makeup last longer.</li>
            <li>It completely hides my one open pore and it stays that way all day.  </li>
            <li>Every product, no matter how natural, fragrance-free, or dermatologist recommended has the potential to irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>but you do have to be careful and not use too much.</li>
            <li>I do not like to wear makeup, so I often just spread this &amp;#34;miracle potion&amp;#34; on my face and my naturally red/irritated/blotchy dry skin becomes extremely soft and even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a very small amount but leaves your skin smooth and silky feeling</li>
            <li>I apply a very small dab of this lightly across my cheeks, nose and chin after moisturizer and before foundation.</li>
            <li>(very oily and separated), Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream (thick and makes your wrinkles pronounced), and Makeup Forever Primer</li>
            <li>but I am going to start right away because those little lines on your upper lip almost disappear immediately.  </li>
            <li>This was okay, but definitely no better than what you can by a Walmart or Target for a lot less.</li>
            <li>It does keep your makeup on very well, but for me not worth the complexion woes.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant about purchasing this product because I&#x27;ve tried other similar ones</li>
            <li>It smoothes over all of the lines, collagen pockets and what other flaws you get in your 50&#x27;s, I really think this stuff makes me look way younger!</li>
            <li>Using this product helps tone down my oily areas and just gives me an even glow across my whole face.</li>
            <li>It made the little fine lines between my brows look less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Plus when I&#x27;m wearing this primer, I only have to use half the foundation I normally would without it!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a primer that would help fill in fine lines, smooth out pores, and create a natural-looking base for my make-up.</li>
            <li>I paid twenty for my little tube and it will last a while if I&#x27;m just using it on my problem areas and not my whole face.</li>

            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> My makeup looks very nice when worn over this primer.</li>
            <li> My foundation went on over it very nicely.  </li>
            <li> A very nice product.</li>
            <li> Amazing cream!</li>
            <li> Amazing silky feel without the oily residue!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product  Wish it had more for the price..</li>
            <li> I found it works best if you wait just a couple of minutes before applying foundation on top of it.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the oil off all day but even more impressive, it makes applying makeup a cinch as it smooths out the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes your skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look virtually flawless and feels so good and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a good product I ordered after getting a sample.</li>
            <li> I think Loreal over the counter product Miracle Blur may be just as good.</li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> Just what I need to get a good finish.</li>
            <li> When you spread on your face and let it sit for a bit, it turns into velvety smooth canvas to help bring  out the best in your makeup.</li>
            <li> velvet skin makes your skin feel silky and smooth and makeup goes on flawless and does not stick into my wrinkles,</li>
            <li> Good stuff</li>
            <li> This product is described on DHC website as good for all skin types.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the velvet skin coat...</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a good makeup primer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It slides on like a silky, smooth, heavenly dream taking all the oiliness off of your face and making it as close to perfect as a product can!  </li>
            <li> its good</li>
            <li> Good under foundation.  </li>
            <li> It feels wonderfully silky smooth to the touch and is scentless and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Olive made sure I got my order ahead of schedule, and the product was just as good as I remembered!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for filling in large pore areas when you want to look your best.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try heard good reviews but didn&#x27;t work great with my skin as a primer or pore minimizer just ended up more oily</li>
            <li> Have always loved this product &amp; happy a better price online as I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Super happy with it!</li>
            <li> This is perhaps one of my very VERY favorite products.</li>
            <li> Very very nice, very smooth and silky</li>
            <li> I read many great reviews for this.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to everyone, works great, love it.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE AND MAKES MY SKIN VERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> I found this product and brand by receiving a sample from the company in the mail and was so happy to find that I was able to order it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is one of my very favorite products.  </li>
            <li> DHC has many great products...</li>
            <li> She looks more youthful with very nice skin with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this cream/moisterizer!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally in love, and I&#x27;ll continue to use this product for the rest of my life (if I can)!  </li>
            <li> Really smooth!!</li>
            <li> I really love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>

            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love!  </li>
            <li> I read many reviews before purchasing and also purchased the $5 tube of Lanacane, and I have to say, I see zero difference!</li>
            <li> Using this, I get a beautiful smooth, matte finish that stays moist all day.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Another plus is that it smooths the skin &amp; reduces the look of the pores, creating a more even skin texture!</li>
            <li> I really love this make-up primer!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> What a treasure to of found this when I needed a pick me up the most!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE this Primer!  </li>
            <li> i love using this before I apply my makeup!</li>
            <li> you can use alone &amp; just dust some blush &amp; your finishing powder over it + lipgloss &amp; go or makes a great canvas to set &amp; keep your full routine in place all day!</li>
            <li> but it absolutely doesn&#x27;t work if you tried to hide your pore!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is beyond amazing and lives up to its name in turning skin into velvet-</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how well it covers pores and absorbs oil.</li>
            <li> The velvet appearance of my skin when i use this is quite amazing</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> SO ITS REALLY AMAZING</li>
            <li> I received a sample in the mail once and tried, OMG this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is amazing and makes your skin feel like velvet.</li>
            <li> the fell is truly silky and amazing.  </li>
            <li> Nice and silky.  </li>
            <li> Never had anything this nice...</li>
            <li> the texture it imparts to skin is indescribable, my face feels like a rose petal.     </li>
            <li> So nice alone instead of foundation in the summer.</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey and</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin (mostly forehead and nose).  </li>
            <li> I wanted to buy DHC Velvet Skin Coat after loving the sample I received in the mail.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin look really nice after applying foundation.</li>
            <li> and they were all just okay, but not as good as DHC.</li>
            <li> Try either Sephora&#x27;s own brand primer or Photo Finish by Smashbox.</li>
            <li> Also, I have found that in the warm summer weather, Velvet Skin Coat helps to keep makeup from sliding off.</li>
            <li> It is nice around the eyes and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to use a DHC product that I haven&#x27;t  liked and that goes for this one as well.  </li>
            <li> Received a sample in the mail and liked it.</li>
            <li> The stuff is nice but for the cost&lt;br /&gt;The amount seems minimum.</li>
            <li> but product is nice.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a couple of years and was thrilled that I could buy it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> A NICE FEELING,</li>
            <li> Covers pores and wrinkles with nice velvety effect  </li>
            <li> Trying to embrace getting older, this stuff is going to be my best friend!</li>
            <li> Great Product - makeup goes on smoothly - face is so soft - I love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Superior product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very natural and excellent make-up</li>
            <li> It will be great if the price was lower and the amount more significant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the best primer I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> awesome as a primer, just so people know this is not for a foundation, it is clear not tinted.</li>

            <li> it gave me more of a smooth look and makes skin soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and smooth, which helps my makeup go on more evenly.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel soft and smooth and makeup goes on better.</li>
            <li> It also feels good on the face - very silk and soft.  </li>
            <li> I gave this one star for quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Received this quickly.  </li>
            <li> Looks just as smooth at the end of the day as it did when I first put it on in the morning.</li>
            <li> and have found it consistent in smooth coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told I have very pretty skin</li>
            <li> I will definitely use this product for a long time, as the benefits are great!</li>
            <li> I used this for my 1st time this past week and loved it!</li>
            <li> This product really works well!!  </li>
            <li> It leaves a velvety coat on the skin, makes it easy to apply makeup and makes skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I had a free sample and thought it was very nice so ordered a small tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like this product it is smoothing my fine lines,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do not know how they do this, but in any light this stuff makes me look lovelier than i really am.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and my skin really does feel like velvet.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product  </li>
            <li> This really does fill in the &amp;#34;craters&amp;#34; to make a smooth surface.</li>
            <li> My skin really does feel velvet smooth</li>
            <li> Smooth and gentle, yet does the trick of minimizing pores.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great and saved a few bucks ordering threw amazon.</li>
            <li> you really only need it on your forehead, nose, sides of nose and chin, this is an amazing primer</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t think it worth the price and won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> Love how the cream seems to disappear but leaves the shin soft and looking refreshed.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Really soft and feels like velvet for sure.  </li>
            <li> I teach at a fitness studio, and my makeup stays absolutely fresh through sweaty workouts and teaching classes all morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Loreal&#x27;s Miracle blur and liked it enough</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Makeup goes on easierer &amp; stays fresh longer.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my makeup looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li> This only helps to soothe rather than irritate, and most importantly doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems different than the free sample I had tried and enjoyed..  </li>
            <li> It might be considered pricey, but worth every velvety cent.  </li>
            <li> so I feel it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> those rare occasions when I do wear makeup</li>
            <li> I have tried so many beauty products for my sensitive skin and almost always end up dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I liked a sample I tried well enough to purchase.</li>
            <li> For me, I had to use about two big pea drops worth to cover my face effectively (more than I thought I&#x27;d need), and it works about average for a primer, I was expecting something way more amazing.</li>
            <li> Have used it a long time - light enough yet provides great moisture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared to other brands, and this one is superior.</li>
            <li> The price was right, too.  </li>
            <li> velvet is right, your makeup will stay put, you won&#x27;t look like a clown.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and it soaks right in for a matte finish.</li>
            <li> It comes in right at $21.00 dollars.  </li>
            <li> When I put this velvet skin coat over that pore, it fills it right in so you cannot even notice it.  </li>
            <li> Right before applying foundation, apply this all over face.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the smooth feeling (almost like graphite) on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great little product!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft and makeup glides on easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, including Laura mercier, Mac, jane iredale, bare minerals.</li>
            <li> and it keeps your skin feeling so nice all day long.</li>
            <li> I want to echo what others have said -- this product makes my skin look and feel terrific, and is a perfect primer for foundation or even just a little powder.  </li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount to get great results.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and leaves your skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel smooth and matte even without foundation, and it really does minimize the looks of pores and wrinkles on ur skin when u apply it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this because it was #2 on a few top primer reviews that I had read.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product goes on;  very soft and smooth but no residue.  </li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and</li>
            <li> One doesn&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li> This requires two full minutes before application of make-up and it didn&#x27;t make a big difference in my fine lines</li>
            <li> DHC&#x27;s Velvet Skin Coat is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Out of the tube, it comes out more of a solid texture (a bit more solid than say vaseline??)</li>
            <li> But for oily-skinned ppl who don&#x27;t have much wrinkles, this product is heaven-sent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what the name states....</li>
            <li> and it REALLY works!</li>
            <li> It really keeps my makeup looking fresh, I can work all day and still look like a million bucks.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels silky smooth and soft hours after I use it.  </li>
            <li> i am 50ish and suffer from hot flashes and sweats.</li>
            <li> if you can afford the habit ;)</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products and it&#x27;s definitely not the most expensive.  </li>
            <li> This product makes foundation look natural and smooth.</li>
            <li> and my make-up looks so much nicer!</li>
            <li> Will continue to be one of my essential products, love it.</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first about the size of the tube and the price, but after a couple of uses, I realized that if I use it over moisturizer (and I LOVE the DHC Enzyme Q10 Cream as a moisturizer), I use just a tiny bit of Velvet Skin Coat.  </li>
            <li> That makes the tube last longer and makes the product a better value.    </li>
            <li> but overall i like it :)</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Another DHC product that I buy consistently.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and use it daily.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims it will.  </li>
            <li> Really really smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting to see if after hydrating my skin more this doesn&#x27;t have the same effect.</li>
            <li> Personally, not too many.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so soft and smooth when you put it on</li>
            <li> Wish so much we had had primers decades ago!</li>
            <li> I first got this as a sample and immediately had to order some.  </li>
            <li> It really feels like velvet!  </li>
            <li> I am a former model and in my spare time I love to paint with oils.  </li>
            <li> Would love to see it in a larger size.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and makes my face  feel so soft.</li>
            <li> in Tucson&#x27;s hot summer.</li>
            <li> Not terribly, but enough to not want to use it.  </li>
            <li> I tried it a few times (just to be fair) and then tossed it.</li>
            <li> This product is good, however,  I did not notice much difference from this makeup primer compared to Cover Girl&#x27;s primer at half the cost and four times</li>
            <li> Great product but the tube is small for $20.00!  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for under make up, silky smooth and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and feels great, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s doing anything for my tiny lines...</li>
            <li> The product is just ok for me, but since the tube is so small it will be good for packing for a short trip.</li>
            <li> Loved the product, but too little quantity for too much money...</li>
            <li> It does not really have much of a scent, which is nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better used in problem areas, so if you think your whole face is a problem (as I sometimes do) look for a different primer.  </li>
            <li> Hard to describe, but it just makes your skin look amazing, with or without foundation!</li>
            <li> Do they have special offers once in a while?</li>
            <li> very nice but very small tube</li>
            <li> Velvet Skin Coat by DHC is proof that good things come in small packages.</li>
            <li> I still gave it three stars because it does give a nice matte effect to my skin and minimizes the appearance of large pores, so I still wear it on days when I&#x27;m going au naturel to cut down on shine.</li>
            <li> Goes a long ways very worth the money!</li>
            <li> and it works much better for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying using it and feeling this help moisturize my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have large pores, put this on them before makeup and it helps reduce the look.</li>
            <li> This product does help in the application of makeup while helping to minimize the appearance of large skin pores.  </li>
            <li> Maybelline: pure silicon.</li>
            <li> I have large pores.</li>
            <li> I go back and forth trying different brands (Stila&#x27;s new one is good)</li>
            <li> It was not that good, especially for Chicago weather, it makes your skin very dry.</li>
            <li> Only need a tiny bit under foundation to smooth out fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and liked it very much.</li>
            <li> this is the best perfector on the market, i used to just order samples, and the little tubes last forever because you only use a lttle bit.</li>
            <li> It just takes a small amount smoothed over the face to create a great, velvety, matte surface for makeup (or bare skin).  </li>
            <li> It really does make your skin feel like velvet.  </li>
            <li> It really help me to do my makeup</li>
            <li> Does require using an astringent and closing up your pores, as you are essentially filling in the pores for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Really makes skin feel like velvet.</li>
            <li> it feels very silky</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this primer in an order I once made and absolutely had to buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> What I really like is that I have an oily face and using this primer</li>
            <li> and I get very oily skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> does what it says and really helps in the Ga humidity of summer.</li>
            <li> This product does absolutely nothing except clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> I REALLY DON&#x27;T SEE THE THRILL OF THIS.</li>
            <li> Expected more from it</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Will probably be purchasing a more expensive favorite because it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> but this product adds that extra smooth touch.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It really is velvet in texture, leaves no residue</li>
            <li> I really like this primer.</li>
            <li> This product helped minimize pores on my nose but didn&#x27;t do much for shine on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very velvety and powdery feeling, but does not leave a matte finish.</li>
            <li> Yes it really fills-in all those cracks around eyes.....</li>
            <li> If you have very oily skin</li>

            <li> Just a tiny amount is needed and makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> Lanacane costs $5 bucks at the drugstore; you get twice as much, and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> i have used Model in a Bottle to set makeup, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i dont really have wrinkles</li>
            <li> really feels like velvet.</li>
            <li> Another product with too much hype and no results.</li>
            <li> Too much money for doing nothing.</li>
            <li> It seems to create a thin, clear veneer on your skin that provides a nice matte finish to your face most of the day.</li>
            <li> Either way, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> (very flowery scent)</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smooth and makeup last all day.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so smooth, not to mention it hid lots of my wrinkles and pores looked smaller.</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference when I use this vs. when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product used under your foundation, will help to keep smooth skin and a longer lasting day of make-up.  </li>
            <li> It really helps control</li>
            <li> This is an absolute miracle when applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> It makes your foundation go on so much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way it goes on</li>
            <li> Clear and light, makes skin feel soothed, soft, and matte in appearance without changing skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I took the advice of other reviewers before purchasing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than the other two.</li>
            <li> I have only tried a sample of this, but so far I have found that it goes on smoothly and controls the oil pretty well.</li>
            <li> I just love it and wouldn&#x27;t use any other primer.</li>
            <li> It really makes a visible difference on this nearly 70 yr old face!!</li>
            <li> Once you start to rub it on it really feels powdery, velvety, smooth and dry.</li>
            <li> the container is kind of small</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s surprising when you first receive it how small it is - especially since it&#x27;s $20.00.  </li>
            <li> They have wonderful olive based cosmetics, but I prefer the Velvet Skin Coat above all others I have tried and the price is half that of Lancôme and much less also than Smash Box.</li>
            <li> Applying this all over the face prior to foundation gives a flawless finish, and one that is less likely to grab the make-up in the tiny creases of my aging skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried the sample of this product and was amazed at how smooth and soft it left my skin, so I bought it here</li>
            <li> I think it is basically a silicone product that puts a thin, smooth layer on top of your face so that your makeup just glides on.</li>
            <li> love this product, doesn&#x27;t really cover much, just slightly and leaves skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> the Supernatural: Winner.</li>
            <li> I still love makeup though, and I love my primers (silly, I know).  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and all of the products I&#x27;ve named in this review have worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and foundations and powders generally break me out.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the seller.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend the product, however.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is better than you can get buying directly from DHC, plus you can get the free super-saver shipping if your order totals at least $25, whereas DHC requires you to buy at least $85 worth of products in order to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li> After I wash my face with Dove beauty bar, I use Insta Natural 100% Pure Argan Oil, then I use DHC Velvet Skin Coat before I apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this makes your skin feel, but it is a little pricey for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Love this but a little pricey.</li>
            <li> sure to let it set for a little before foundation, allowing that coat of &amp;#34;velvet skin&amp;#34; to perform)</li>
            <li> It really leaves your skin velvety soft.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be 68 years old very soon .  </li>
            <li> Before I started using this a few years ago I would constantly be touching up my makeup because my face would get greasy or the makeup would just wear off over the course of the day.</li>
            <li> I normally use a primer from Sallys beauty supply.</li>
            <li> This is the only one worth the money.  </li>
            <li> First things first, my skin is quirky as heck and sensitive like a newborn baby.  </li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel velvety, but it does not smooth over most flaws or cause my makeup to go on smoother or stay on longer.</li>
            <li> Your skin now has a lovely, smooth velvety coat to go with as is or apply your favorite makeup base.</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky skin with a little rosacea for good measure.</li>
            <li> It really makes the makeup go on smoothly (and you also end up using less foundation than you normally would).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 43 years old with medium skin (not oily or dry) with light wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It feels so silky, and it provides a nice, rich feeling base for makeup which glides on smoothly after the primer has been applied.</li>
            <li> Just put a tiny bit on your face right before you put on your foundation.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t live up to their hype.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for year, and now I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> It makes applying make-up a new experience.  </li>
            <li> I like it much better than similar products by other high end</li>
            <li> I only wish it was available in a larger tube or jar.  </li>
            <li> great pre-make-up base, smooth.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have color, great base to smooth skin</li>
            <li> I wish it comes in a larger tube though since I find that the product runs out too fast (or maybe I&#x27;m using too much of it during each application).  </li>
            <li> Only use during night time event b/c it can dry pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Spoils me  because I love the way it smooths then keeps make up from an oily or uneven appearance!</li>
            <li> I saw the review here that said it had the exact same ingredients as Lanacane Gel.  </li>
            <li> The Lanacane Gel contains corn starch, which VSC does not, but they are, otherwise, pretty similar.</li>
            <li> For all I can tell it is the exact same product.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years makes your skin soft and pores disappear!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are other products out there, that will work better and last longer.</li>
            <li> and she had the exact same things to say.</li>
            <li> It is pricey as well, but not more so than most high-end primers.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I closes the large pores on my nose &amp; gives my skin an all over matte yet not dry finish.  </li>
            <li> --I always appreciate the reviewers that research these details--but it feels like it has silicone, which lasts just long enough for makeup to slide on smoothly, stay there, and lot leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say for sure if this is the holy grail of primers, but it works really well and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also, if my skin is very dry, it will make my dry patches more noticeable after I put foundation on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 years old and have medium skin and a very clear complexion.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m OLD - very old.</li>
            <li> -  takes care of any stickiness from moisturizers or creams - leaves my skin soft and smooth; like down.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited to use this from all the great reviews, but I have to say I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, after getting a few free samples from DHC, this is one product I cannot live without.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to describe this little tube-its just great</li>
            <li> This is a foundation primer and is worth every single penny!  </li>
            <li> until I realized it has the exact same major ingredients as Lanacane anti-chafing gel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big makeup/lotion/product user, but I decided to try something to help smooth out rough looking skin from over the years.  </li>
            <li> This one has no shine and yet is soft creamy to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It is light on the skin as well, not oily or heavy.</li>
            <li> It does glide on, makes your skin feel so soft, and it keeps the shine away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also can have sensitive skin and this never makes me break out.</li>
            <li> Cheaper at Amazon than from DHC directly.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had problems with breakouts or irritations.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten this directly from DHC before.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft ad refresh.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is that once you try it, you will be absolutely hooked.</li>
            <li> I use it without make up and it makes my face feel really soft.</li>
            <li> I apply it before my make up and it makes my skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This is a creamy opaque gel which truly goes on like velvet and gives your skin, beneath your foundation, a soft look of perfection.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and velvety</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old.  </li>
            <li> This product makes your skin feel incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> It is non greasy and makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and isn&#x27;t oily under make-up.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference between a cheaper brand and this one as far as looks to my skin.</li>
            <li> You do not need to use much and should apply only in the oily areas.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, &amp; my mineral powder makeup can&#x27;t keep up, but with this product, it last hours longer that it would without it!</li>
            <li> Product makes skin and lips feel soft and reduces lip wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old.</li>
            <li> A minute amount is all you need to have your skin feel so soft and plump...  </li>
            <li> Really makes your face look fresher and your pores smaller.  </li>
            <li> I have a naturally oily face and this primer helps minimize the amount of oil on my face.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy, not slippery.</li>
            <li> going for the natural look with this stuff is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Takes away a shiny face and leaves a soft finish.</li>
            <li> I just wish the tube was bigger because it goes fast.</li>
            <li> It does work well for smoothing soft lines under eyes</li>
            <li> DHC makes the best makeup base primer out there.  </li>
            <li> loved it but too expensive</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 20 yrs and find it the very best  makeup base.  </li>
            <li> I use the DHC Velvet Skin Coat before applying my liquid base, and it helps my makeup go on flawlessly - hiding skin imperfections and decreasing the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> An almost perfect base for liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome base product to use under your foundation, after you put your moisturizer on.  </li>
            <li> It creates a flawless foundation under base makeup or can be worn alone.</li>
            <li> I find it good but too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have a permanent very open pore right next to my nose near my cheek.  </li>
            <li> Using the other same two products, but not this, the foundation doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly</li>
            <li> As you get older, the skin loses moisture and make-up just doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It only takes very little to get a smooth face!  </li>
            <li> I have added this product to my daily skin care routine, I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li> Instantly mattifies skin and lasts pretty well, especially if you use powder as well.</li>
            <li> and a lot of ppl wrote in their reviews that a little goes a long way, but i dont think thats really true, but its not like you have to use a whole bunch of it to cover ur face.</li>
            <li> but it left my skin feeling dry and more wrinkled looking than other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> A small drop covers the face allowing liquid or powder makeup to go smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li> again, pure silicon but three times the price of the Maybelline and not only didn&#x27;t work well but didn&#x27;t work well with my moisturizer - created a white residue.</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind</li>
            <li> Monistat chaffing gel works/feels exactly the same as this primer and is only $5 in a bigger tube!</li>
            <li> I use it on moisturized bare skin with no other makeup.</li>
            <li> I used to order directly from DHC but since it was about the same price with no shipping on Amazon</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will even skip my foundation and just wear this bare,</li>
            <li> I like it underneath Bare Minerals powder.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel really soft, but doesn&#x27;t minimize the look of pores or help makeup last longer.</li>
            <li> It completely hides my one open pore and it stays that way all day.  </li>
            <li> Every product, no matter how natural, fragrance-free, or dermatologist recommended has the potential to irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> but you do have to be careful and not use too much.</li>
            <li> I do not like to wear makeup, so I often just spread this &amp;#34;miracle potion&amp;#34; on my face and my naturally red/irritated/blotchy dry skin becomes extremely soft and even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a very small amount but leaves your skin smooth and silky feeling</li>
            <li> I apply a very small dab of this lightly across my cheeks, nose and chin after moisturizer and before foundation.</li>
            <li> (very oily and separated), Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream (thick and makes your wrinkles pronounced), and Makeup Forever Primer</li>
            <li> but I am going to start right away because those little lines on your upper lip almost disappear immediately.  </li>
            <li> This was okay, but definitely no better than what you can by a Walmart or Target for a lot less.</li>
            <li> It does keep your makeup on very well, but for me not worth the complexion woes.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about purchasing this product because I&#x27;ve tried other similar ones</li>
            <li> It smoothes over all of the lines, collagen pockets and what other flaws you get in your 50&#x27;s, I really think this stuff makes me look way younger!</li>
            <li> Using this product helps tone down my oily areas and just gives me an even glow across my whole face.</li>
            <li> It made the little fine lines between my brows look less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Plus when I&#x27;m wearing this primer, I only have to use half the foundation I normally would without it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a primer that would help fill in fine lines, smooth out pores, and create a natural-looking base for my make-up.</li>
            <li> I paid twenty for my little tube and it will last a while if I&#x27;m just using it on my problem areas and not my whole face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak too much to whether it causes breakouts or not;  lately, I&#x27;ve been getting some small breakouts, but can&#x27;t isolate it to a particular product (I&#x27;ve changed lotions and foundation at the same time, so it&#x27;s hard to tell which, if any, might be the cause).</li>
            <li> and I could include it with other items I was ordering, I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is the same as when I buy direct from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Goes a long way, I like the narrow tip, so you don&#x27;t dispense too much.  </li>
            <li> I realize a tiny bit goes a long way so this tube will last awhile</li>
            <li> you need to get used to it and know how much concealer to apply over it, because if you make mistakes (like applying too much concealer in one area), you might have a hard time \\&quot;moving\\&quot; your makeup around your face because the Velvet Coat won&#x27;t let it go!!</li>
            <li> at the same time it somehow moisturizes for even coverage and makes your cheeks feel like little velvet soft pillows!</li>
            <li> It DOES last a long time, like everyone is saying.</li>
            <li> Product will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> Also a tiny bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I put just a tiny bit on before my foundation and it keeps my foundation in place all day long.</li>
            <li> Since I only use it on my nose it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It did not do anything to my skin other than major break outs.</li>
            <li> More money wasted thanks to false reviews!!</li>
            <li> The tube seems expensive but it lasts easily six months and often longer.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it gets dry and crumbly toward the end of the tube.  </li>
            <li> I do need to apply moisturizer prior to the Velvet Skin Coat application though or else my skin is too dry.</li>
            <li> It feels creamy and dry at the same time somehow.</li>
            <li> only use on &#x27;trouble spots&#x27;  makes skin silky soft and even for makeup application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still young and only had a few pores I was trying to fill</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by the price, the old adage &#x27; a little dab&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> True, a little goes a long way, but it&#x27;s not worth it to me to pay this amount for so little product.</li>
            <li> this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Am a long term fan of this.</li>
            <li> this sounds strange but</li>
            <li> The primer was SO much smaller than i really expected.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I did think the tube was smaller than expected.  </li>
            <li> Loved the feel of this velvet skin coat base.</li>
            <li> This product feels like velvet, and it dulls down the shinny spots on my face and gives my skin a soft an even tone.</li>
            <li> and I can see tiny streaks from my fingers and other minor application problems.</li>
            <li> I can also verify that it lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> It makes my pores seem really small and makes my skin silky soft!</li>
            <li> I recently ran out of it and read other reviews on primers.</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed and will stick with my Dermalogica which I love!</li>
            <li> it goes on feeling matte and dry but</li>
            <li> Might have something to do with living at altitude where the air is so dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin tends to be on the dry side and Velvet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a single tube for about 2 years now and still haven&#x27;t used it up.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a very small amount, if too much is used, it is slightly oily.</li>
            <li> The Deep Cleansing Oil lasts for several months and a small amount of the makeup primer goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> ;&#x27; and it fills in pores and small wrinkles and makes your face baby soft.  </li>
            <li> I have used both the DHC velvet skin coat and the DHC deep cleansing oil previously and would recommend both products.  </li>
            <li> Just know you can get the same results for less money with the Lanacane.</li>
            <li> I read previous reviews about Lanacane being similar to this product</li>
            <li> After putting it on then going to my foundation I found that my skin looked very dry and had to take it all off.  </li>
            <li> , I can simply use a little of this and then a bit of face powder</li>
            <li> I have occasionally used it alone, without foundation, and while it doesn&#x27;t give you any coverage, it does give you a little bit of improvement in skin texture.  </li>
            <li> Skin Coat gives that little extra smoothing that I like.  </li>
            <li> I Found that I only have to apply a small dab and it goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> i cannot use heavy facial creams, and that is where this comes into play.</li>
            <li> For this reason, i don&#x27;t use it everyday but only when I go out somewhere.</li>
            <li> Does not fill in lines as I expected.  </li>
            <li> There is not much per Tube</li>
            <li> Total waste, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Not much in the tube and the formula didn&#x27;t &#x27;glide&#x27; on my face.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and it keeps the oil down all day long.</li>
            <li> Also, it makes my expensive, department store makeup slide right off of my nose.</li>
            <li> What sets it apart from other primers is that it doesn&#x27;t feel like an oily or wet moisturizer that your pores have to absorb--</li>
            <li> For the price I really expected more, was disappointed and won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Not gooey, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> , YOU NEED JUST LITTLE, GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> Just remember that a little goes a long way when applying Velvet Skin Coat.  </li>
            <li> I only have to apply it once a day (usually in the morning) and don&#x27;t have to reapply it.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if Corn Huskers lotion wouldn&#x27;t do the same at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> It should be a component of other makeups instead of a separate product</li>
            <li> Unlike some other primers, I don&#x27;t break out and it doesn&#x27;t settle in my pores.</li>
            <li> I would not go out in the evening without redoing my makeup due to the \\&quot;oil slick\\&quot; on my face.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how to keep that from happening so that the contents of the entire tube is usable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands that are a bit cheaper, but they do not compare.</li>
            <li> a lot due to Jane Iredale</li>
            <li> Love the product but was disappointed in the amount received for the price.  </li>
            <li> I apply just a small amount and it last all day.</li>
            <li> If you use regular moisturizer, it&#x27;s too slick and doesn&#x27;t stay in place.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also about $5 cheaper here than other sites.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with other primers</li>
            <li> Part of that is due to DHC Vevet Skin Coat.  </li>
            <li> Forget all other makeup primers.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other makeup primers but none compare.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; like some of the other primers on the market, in fact, it feels the slightest bit chalky when you apply it.  </li>
            <li> I use it even on days when I don&#x27;t wear any other make-up.  </li>
            <li> Only a small amount will give your face a pearly appearance...soft and matte.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only drawback: the small container.  </li>
            <li> and I like that a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrific base to wear under makeup, giving a uniform texture to skin and allowing makeup to glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have broken out in rashes when I have used other DHC products, but this one has caused me no problems.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> I have spots that have to be hidden and it does not mix well with other products.  </li>
            <li> A very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly; I generally put a small amount on my finger place where needed (for me usually around the eye area, forehead, and &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; lines), give it a minute then</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, in my opinion it was not worth it for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a magical base cost.</li>
            <li> but you only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> the tube is rather small but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I had noticed my face was shiny with my previous face creams.  </li>
            <li> and I use less makeup.</li>
            <li> Previous to using VSC</li>
            <li> , I hate doing without, just wish it would not be as pricey, its worth every penny but for seniors with low income one must sacrifice something else.</li>
            <li> I used each on half my face.  </li>
            <li> Less touch ups</li>
            <li> I really feel that it smooths out my wrinkles and sets a soft base for my foundation.</li>
            <li> I still get a bit oily at the end of the day but a lot less than if I didn&#x27;t apply this primer.  </li>
            <li> like I read in previous reviews.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning under foundation, and I can use less foundation.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and shy away from makeup as I think it makes me look much older now.</li>
            <li> On average I go through about two and a half tubes a year, that&#x27;s how little you have to use.   </li>
            <li> It takes just a little bit.  </li>
            <li> BUT THERE IS A LITTLE DISCOLORATION.</li>
            <li> In clears all the little imperfections for the day.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I can get away with wearing just this primer with a little bit of bronzer or blush.</li>
            <li> --it does help, but it still looks a little oily by afternoon.</li>
            <li> - I try to give my moisturizer a few minutes to absorb.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  </li>
            <li> Wear it everyday under my make up.</li>
            <li> Then DHC sent me a brochure by mail with a few samples including this one.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and creates a velvety base for your foundation or tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I had used the Clinique pore-minimizer lotion for a few years before I tried this, but Velvet Skin Coat beats the Clinique primer hands-down for its velvety finish (even over sunscreen)  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone as I found it a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Way too small of a bottle for the price and not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not good for dry skin at all.  </li>
            <li> It gives your skin a tighter feeling without feeling stiff.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little of the product to provide a smooth base for makeup.  </li>
            <li> I use a small amount on each side of my face.  </li>
            <li> The Velvet Skin Coat  made my make-up look smoother and creamier than usual.  </li>
            <li> (Dr. Brandt Pores No More).</li>
            <li> While velvety feeling, was not pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> like the velvety feel of this product!&lt;br /&gt;But, it is a small tube</li>
            <li> This tube is small.  </li>
            <li> No more pores</li>
            <li> I have been putting a small bit on every day from this sample packet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds of base.  </li>
            <li> (acting as a base for my make-up)were the same.  </li>
            <li> I use far less foundation when I have this a base coat.  </li>
            <li> I am a hard sell on make-up, and I purchase almost everything at Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> This product sucks.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
            <li> It is a very small tube</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive for the tiny amount in the tube</li>
            <li> No better or worse than others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> so you use less, plus it keeps your makeup in place for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Try it!!!  </li>
            <li> It is hard to describe biut I have been using it for years to give my skin a soft matte finish or improved base for foundation - you can see and feel the difference  </li>
            <li> There are less expensive primers that will do the job.</li>
            <li> So may try that to do a comparison as the lanocane is much less expensive.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s up?why is it taking so longtime get it ridiculous</li>
            <li> it is not greasy or heavy or shiny like some expensive creams.</li>
            <li> This is not good &amp;#34;for</li>
            <li> B001G9022K Jane Iredale PurePressed Base Mineral Foundation SPF 20, Natural - Refill]]</li>
            <li> This is about the third make up base</li>
            <li> It smoothed out the bumpy skin on my cheeks without irritating them at all.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the two tubes were outdated</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what I say!!</li>
            <li> This product is a best-kept secret!</li>
            <li> IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE SIZE</li>
            <li> On the expensive side.</li>
            <li> but was disappointed with how small the tub was for the price.</li>
            <li> I was wrong</li>
            <li> A person can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> but it is extremely expensive.  </li>
            <li> Expensive for the results.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and it is very difficult to get an even coat of foundation on without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction too bad</li>
            <li> so kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in DHC products.</li>
            <li> However, after applying it and then using my basecoat, it distorts my base coat in a way that I cannot wear it.  </li>
            <li> This product should be used as a base to reduce oiliness under your foundation.  </li>
            <li> I hate to say this, but I&#x27;ve used this for years.</li>
            <li> I hate to be without it.</li>
            <li> : I hated this.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this cream/moisterizer!  I had noticed my face was shiny with my previous face creams.  This one has no shine and yet is soft creamy to the touch.  It makes my skin feel great.  I only wish it was available in a larger tube or jar.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever be switching to another cream.</li>
            <li> Gives a great finish to make-up even if you don&#x27;t wear any.  Gives you that lovely airbrushed look.  It&#x27;s a setting powder without the powdery look.</li>
            <li> YEs!  Absolutely love this stuff - ready to order more -  takes care of any stickiness from moisturizers or creams - leaves my skin soft and smooth; like down.  And I&#x27;m OLD - very old.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  It really does make your skin feel like velvet.  It takes just a little bit.  Love it.  I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about purchasing this product because I&#x27;ve tried other similar ones and they didn&#x27;t live up to their hype.  DHC&#x27;s Velvet Skin Coat is exactly as advertised.  It makes my face feel smooth and silky, and my makeup glides on and has a flawless finish, which in itself is great as my skin is not perfect.  It is colorless so it can be used on any skin color.  I only have to apply it once a day (usually in the morning) and don&#x27;t have to reapply it.  It is light on the skin as well, not oily or heavy. You don&#x27;t have to use  ton of it either.  I use a small amount on each side of my face.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> This is a good product I ordered after getting a sample. Amount is pretty small. I think Loreal over the counter product Miracle Blur may be just as good.</li>
            <li> Always getting samples in the mail, but never used them UNTIL one day, I tried it on a whim. I was so impressed I ordered this. It does glide on, makes your skin feel so soft, and it keeps the shine away. It is costly.</li>
            <li> I always keep a backup of this product. It&#x27;s great for filling in large pore areas when you want to look your best.</li>
            <li> It really help me to do my makeup but it absolutely doesn&#x27;t work if you tried to hide your pore!!!!! So I don&#x27;t think it worth the price and won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> Love how ithe leaves my skin velvety.</li>
            <li> This really does smooth out fine lines and make your skin look very smooth. Does require using an astringent and closing up your pores, as you are essentially filling in the pores for a smooth finish. Not gooey, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I had a sample of it years ago and never could remember the name of it. I was thrilled when I found out what it was and ordered it right away.</li>
            <li> Love how the cream seems to disappear but leaves the shin soft and looking refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big makeup/lotion/product user, but I decided to try something to help smooth out rough looking skin from over the years.  My makeup and skin look almost flawless!  I can also verify that it lasts a long time!  I recently returned from Paris, where I used it every am around 9, and it would last till 9pm!  I&#x27;m totally in love, and I&#x27;ll continue to use this product for the rest of my life (if I can)!  :)</li>
            <li> This is beyond amazing and lives up to its name in turning skin into velvet- you can use alone &amp; just dust some blush &amp; your finishing powder over it + lipgloss &amp; go or makes a great canvas to set &amp; keep your full routine in place all day!</li>
            <li> This stuff feels like &amp;#34;velvet&amp;#34;.  I wear it alone without makeup and it gives me that even skin look.  its not greasy or too dry, just perfect.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps one of my very VERY favorite products. It is one of the very best primers I have come across, it applies smoothly and creates a wonderful base to apply make-up resulting in a wonderful finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product after moisturizer - I try to give my moisturizer a few minutes to absorb. Usually, I apply first thing then do something else and then apply velvet Skin Coat. Use sparingly; I generally put a small amount on my finger place where needed (for me usually around the eye area, forehead, and &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; lines), give it a minute then apply your make up. I find giving moisturizer and primer just a minute between makes everything work well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also can have sensitive skin and this never makes me break out. I  just always remember the MUSTS for maintaining my skin: drink water, rest, moisturizer and never sleep with make-up on.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of my skin after applying.  Not sure if Corn Huskers lotion wouldn&#x27;t do the same at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Had a skin reaction first week wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the product or the Rosacea, has cleared since.</li>
            <li> Nice and silky.  Only need a tiny bit under foundation to smooth out fine lines.</li>
            <li> this is a unique product. It is hard to describe biut I have been using it for years to give my skin a soft matte finish or improved base for foundation - you can see and feel the difference  The tube seems expensive but it lasts easily six months and often longer.  I am in my fifties and not a big make up person, but when I want to look especially put together this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this once I ordered it because of the reviews.  It does cause the make up to slide on like silk but it left my skin feeling dry and more wrinkled looking than other products I&#x27;ve tried.  I had better luck with Prime Time from Sephora.  By the way it might be helpful to mention I&#x27;m in my mid forties.  So to the younger girls out there you will probably like this product.</li>
            <li> Love it, if I put it on my eyes, eye shadow stays longer.  Really makes skin feel like velvet.</li>
            <li> Light, almost weightless.  Goes a long way, I like the narrow tip, so you don&#x27;t dispense too much.  Really smooth!!</li>
            <li> not a :drugstore product. a designer primer</li>
            <li> this product is great it feels very silky</li>
            <li> I loved it but it didn&#x27;t love me I had an allergic reaction too bad it felt wonderful on my skin</li>
            <li> Love DHC velvet skin coat.  I like giving it as gifts.</li>
            <li> DHC makes the best makeup base primer out there.  It goes on smoothly, makes your skin feel great, and lasts a long time.  You may only need to reapply once (and that is if you are going from the office to a restaurant or a night out). Olive made sure I got my order ahead of schedule, and the product was just as good as I remembered!  The price was right, too.  I highly recommend the seller.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It sets up your face for an airbrushed look when applying any liquid makeup over it.  It should be a component of other makeups instead of a separate product</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Cheaper at Amazon than from DHC directly.</li>
            <li> Spoils me  because I love the way it smooths then keeps make up from an oily or uneven appearance!</li>
            <li> velvet is right, your makeup will stay put, you won&#x27;t look like a clown.  It just smooothesss things out.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of velvet on my face.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this primer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 5 years.  I used to order directly from DHC but since it was about the same price with no shipping on Amazon and I could include it with other items I was ordering, I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is the same as when I buy direct from the manufacturer.  It goes on smooth, leaves a nice matte finish.  I don&#x27;t allover makeup, so I just use it on my nose and eyelids.  It takes the shine away and primes my lashes and lids for eyeshadow and mascara.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this primer in an order I once made and absolutely had to buy the real thing. It literally makes your face feel like velvet. What sets it apart from other primers is that it doesn&#x27;t feel like an oily or wet moisturizer that your pores have to absorb-- it goes on feeling matte and dry but at the same time it somehow moisturizes for even coverage and makes your cheeks feel like little velvet soft pillows!</li>
            <li> If you have large pores, put this on them before makeup and it helps reduce the look. heck yea baby! Back to my 20s!</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel when I apply.  It also makes my makeup go on smoother.  I like to wear it w/o make up.  I will absolutely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I started using this product because of a sample that I received and it made my face look so smooth that I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. Unlike some other primers, I don&#x27;t break out and it doesn&#x27;t settle in my pores. What I really like is that I have an oily face and using this primer tends to make my face look more matte and I use less makeup. This was the best price especially with the free shipping cause believe me, I looked everywhere!</li>
            <li> Gives your skin a smooth dewy finish, no pores at all, and it minimizes fine wrinkles. I use it on moisturized bare skin with no other makeup. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out (the Olay version did). (I wash my face with water only, use Keihl&#x27;s Ultra face cream.) A very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Out of the tube, it comes out more of a solid texture (a bit more solid than say vaseline??) Once you start to rub it on it really feels powdery, velvety, smooth and dry. This texture lasts ALL day, it does for me and I get very oily skin. Some of the ppl that don&#x27;t like it says that it worsens the appearance of their wrinkles. While i don&#x27;t know that, I can see why that would be. But for oily-skinned ppl who don&#x27;t have much wrinkles, this product is heaven-sent! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I have extremely sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had problems with breakouts or irritations.  It takes very little of the product to provide a smooth base for makeup.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what the name states....velvet coat.  Your skin now has a lovely, smooth velvety coat to go with as is or apply your favorite makeup base.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I have oily skin, and it soaks right in for a matte finish. My foundation glides on over it like a dream. Plus when I&#x27;m wearing this primer, I only have to use half the foundation I normally would without it!</li>
            <li> I have gotten this directly from DHC before.  This stuff is the greatest for under your make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product. It makes my skin feel so soft ad refresh. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> This is about the third make up base I have tried. It is extremely light weight and my favorite one of all</li>
            <li> This product is excellent!  It feels like velvet being rubbed across your face.  It does a great job minimizing pores and wrinkles with or without makeup.  Sometimes I only use it around the eye area because of the price.  But it is great for the whole face.</li>
            <li> This product does help in the application of makeup while helping to minimize the appearance of large skin pores.  I particularly like the smooth feeling (almost like graphite) on the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a magical base cost. Feels like satin on your face.</li>
            <li> makes my skin glow and my pores shrink</li>
            <li> Great stuff and it REALLY works!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite under-eye primer, it never fails to make my skin look smoother, and helps fill fine-lines.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this product .  Leaves my skin very smooth.  Perfect name velvet.</li>
            <li> I have used both the DHC velvet skin coat and the DHC deep cleansing oil previously and would recommend both products.  The package was delivered within the time I was given as well.  The Deep Cleansing Oil lasts for several months and a small amount of the makeup primer goes a long way.  Great deal!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff !!!!  Have used it a long time - light enough yet provides great moisture.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Velvet skin coat controls oil better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used.  My skin is super oily and has been a problem for me forever.  After using \\&quot;Velvet Skin Coat\\&quot; (VSC), most days I can go all day without redoing my make-up.  Previous to using VSC I would not go out in the evening without redoing my makeup due to the \\&quot;oil slick\\&quot; on my face.  I really love this product!</li>
            <li> Okay. Doesn&#x27;t minimize shine enough</li>
            <li> Amazing cream! Never had anything this nice...it feels like velvet on your skin.</li>
            <li> Velvet Skin Coat by DHC is proof that good things come in small packages. Don&#x27;t be put off by the price, the old adage &#x27; a little dab&#x27;ll do you&#x27; has never been so true. I use it daily, and the stuff lasts forever! On average I go through about two and a half tubes a year, that&#x27;s how little you have to use.   As a makeup primer, this is hands down the best product I have ever used. It really keeps my makeup looking fresh, I can work all day and still look like a million bucks.  Before I started using this a few years ago I would constantly be touching up my makeup because my face would get greasy or the makeup would just wear off over the course of the day. Not anymore!  Sometimes I will even skip my foundation and just wear this bare, the texture it imparts to skin is indescribable, my face feels like a rose petal.     The only downside to this product is that once you try it, you will be absolutely hooked. It&#x27;s an integral part of my beauty routine and I can&#x27;t imagine not using it.  Give it a try and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
            <li> DHC Velvet Skin Coat&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product it is smoothing my fine lines,&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this product again</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels on my face.  Helps keep makeup even.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I received a sample of this...wasn&#x27;t quite sure if it would do what it said but decided to try it anyway.  The Velvet Skin Coat  made my make-up look smoother and creamier than usual.  I use it without make up and it makes my face feel really soft.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this in the mail &amp; I was hooked. I have super sensitive skin and foundations and powders generally break me out.  This stuff works like a charm.  I apply it before my make up and it makes my skin soft and silky. My makeup lasts all day without breakouts or irritation.  I will never go without it again!</li>
            <li> This is a creamy opaque gel which truly goes on like velvet and gives your skin, beneath your foundation, a soft look of perfection.</li>
            <li> As expected. Costly for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well to give a matte, smooth finish to my skin.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it gets dry and crumbly toward the end of the tube.  Not sure how to keep that from happening so that the contents of the entire tube is usable.  Might have something to do with living at altitude where the air is so dry.  Anyone at sea level have this issue?</li>
            <li> love love love this primer, make your face feel and look so smooth and velvet to the touch.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes your skin fell like silk, which allows makeup application to glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where I got a sample of this,  but I love it.  My skin feels silky smooth and soft hours after I use it.  Buy it and give yourself a treat.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific base to wear under makeup, giving a uniform texture to skin and allowing makeup to glide on smoothly. I&#x27;ve compared to other brands, and this one is superior. It&#x27;s also neutral in color, so any skin shade can use it. I wear only tinted moisturizer for makeup, and this makes it last all day without shine. A great product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It makes my skin feel so soft and velvety and I can wear it without makeup.  It minimizes wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. does what it says and really helps in the Ga humidity of summer. It is a very small tube but you only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It is amazing how well it covers pores and absorbs oil. It could be used alone it covers so well, but works great under makeup. I&#x27;ve tried other brands that are a bit cheaper, but they do not compare.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd tube of Velvet Skin Coat.  I agree that the tube is tiny for the money but it is well worth it.  I makes my skin feel and look smooth.  I closes the large pores on my nose &amp; gives my skin an all over matte yet not dry finish.  I wear it with as well as without make up, depending upon how I feel.  I am 71 years old.  I wish it came in a larger tube.  I love it.  I have only ordered mine from DHC, but if I can get it elsewhere cheaper, I will.  It is $21.00 a tube at DHC.</li>
            <li> i received a sample of this wonderful product and immediately after using it could feel the &#x27;velvet&#x27; on my face. i am 50ish and suffer from hot flashes and sweats. i cannot use heavy facial creams, and that is where this comes into play. it is not greasy or heavy or shiny like some expensive creams. give it a try, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.    nancy j</li>
            <li> This is my favorite DHC product. A bit of sunscreen and Velvet Skin Coat is all I need for the day. Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin surface \\&quot;smooth as silk\\&quot;, making makeup/foundation flow easily and evenly when  applying. I do think DHC can make this product easier to use if the hole in the dispensing nozzle were larger.  You have to apply some force to squeeze it from the tube....need to rethink packaging.  Would highly recommend the product, however.</li>
            <li> Great service I always used this. So nice alone instead of foundation in the summer.</li>
            <li> Very very nice, very smooth and silky</li>
            <li> great pre-make-up base, smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is a best-kept secret! Hard to describe, but it just makes your skin look amazing, with or without foundation!</li>
            <li> Love the product but feel it is too expensive to reorder. There are less expensive primers that will do the job.</li>
            <li> makes my face feel like velvet</li>
            <li> I read many great reviews for this. This product is horrible. It did not do anything to my skin other than major break outs.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT..WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> It may just be my imagination, but the sample of Velvet Skin Coat performed better than the purchased product.  I now skip my moisturizer, because my face is shiny before I even get finished applying the rest of my makeup if I use it before applying Velvet Skin Coat.  I didn&#x27;t seem to have to do that with the sample.  And also the tube seems to have more air than product in it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have color, great base to smooth skin</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  This product does absolutely nothing except clogged my pores. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great little product!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  It keeps my skin from drying out, greatly reduces amount of foundation I use, and even allows me to go without foundation if I want.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product  Wish it had more for the price..</li>
            <li> I REALLY DON&#x27;T SEE THE THRILL OF THIS. I AM 54 AND CANNOT USE THIS WITHOUT MAKEUP. MY SKIN IS NOT AWFUL BUT THERE IS A LITTLE DISCOLORATION. THIS IS AN OK PRIMER, BUT THAT&#x27;S ABOUT IT. IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE SIZE AND WHAT IT DOESN&#x27;T DO. I DEFINITELY WILL NOT BE PURCHASING IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> This stuff truly makes your skin feel like velvet! My husband couldn&#x27;t stop rubbing my cheeks!</li>
            <li> Make my face feel very smooth</li>
            <li> I use this all by itself without applying any foundation. It makes my skin look silky. Kind of pricey and the tube is rather small but a little goes a long way. For this reason, i don&#x27;t use it everyday but only when I go out somewhere. It helps keep the shine under control.</li>
            <li> I dont know... Ive put it on and i didnt notice any visible difference before and after. Expected more from it so kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It seems, to me, my make up goes on smoother &amp; looks better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the samples from the magazines I&#x27;d get in the mail.  Finally decided I would buy some, glad I did.  Really soft and feels like velvet for sure.  It only takes very little to get a smooth face!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this product in one way.  It absolutely makes your skin look smooth and wrinkle free.  However, after applying it and then using my basecoat, it distorts my base coat in a way that I cannot wear it.  I have spots that have to be hidden and it does not mix well with other products.  If you can use this without makeup over it, it is great, but I have to have makeup.  I asked if there are specific makeups that should be used with it, and was told that it should work with any makeup.  Not mine, and I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds of base.  This is not good &amp;#34;for me&amp;#34; - maybe for you!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to use this from all the great reviews, but I have to say I&#x27;m a little disappointed. For me, I had to use about two big pea drops worth to cover my face effectively (more than I thought I&#x27;d need), and it works about average for a primer, I was expecting something way more amazing. It&#x27;s an okay product, but I will not be purchasing again. Will probably be purchasing a more expensive favorite because it&#x27;s worth it (Dr. Brandt Pores No More).</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, arrived very quickly......very happy customer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different foundation primers, and this one is by far the best; it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve purchased more than once.  I use Jane Iredale mineral makeup foundation, and with the DHC Velvet Skin Coat, I need just a quick once-over with my mineral makeup.  I teach at a fitness studio, and my makeup stays absolutely fresh through sweaty workouts and teaching classes all morning.  It DOES last a long time, like everyone is saying. Oh, and I&#x27;m 56, so this is definitely not just for the younger ladies. I get complements on my skin just about daily--a lot due to Jane Iredale but this product adds that extra smooth touch.[[ASIN:B001G9022K Jane Iredale PurePressed Base Mineral Foundation SPF 20, Natural - Refill]]</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever found to use under makeup. Makes skin feel so smooth, and I&#x27;m over 50.</li>
            <li> Love the product but was disappointed in the amount received for the price.  The tube wasn&#x27;t even full of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, I was surprise to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Most amazing primer I have ever used! I have used several and this one is incredible!  Goes a long ways very worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love it.  If you have oily skin use only in winter.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try heard good reviews but didn&#x27;t work great with my skin as a primer or pore minimizer just ended up more oily</li>
            <li> I put this on before my make up or sometimes when I am lounging around the house. It makes my pores seem really small and makes my skin silky soft!</li>
            <li> I returned my Urban Decay eye primer. The DHC velvet coat is not an eye primer, but I use it as one, and it works. It really is velvet in texture, leaves no residue, my eye makeup stays put. I put some all over my face, under my eyes and on my eye lids. Just what I need to get a good finish. Update: I really like this primer. Am a long term fan of this. When you spread on your face and let it sit for a bit, it turns into velvety smooth canvas to help bring  out the best in your makeup.</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels on my skin. Perfect primer before makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I took the advice of other reviewers before purchasing. It is an excellent product. A small amount goes a long way. Makes the face look and feel better and foundation glides on over it for a better appearance overall. Wish it came 3x larger in size.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin (mostly forehead and nose).  This product helped minimize pores on my nose but didn&#x27;t do much for shine on my forehead.  I agree with the others that it seems to help foundation set more evenly. However, and this is the however that will keep me from buying it again,  I paid $27 for 0.5 oz.  I have not yet tried Smashbox&#x27;s primer (although it also gets rave reviews) and at $35 (or so...some variation on price depending on where you buy) for 1.8 oz, the smashbox sounds much more appealing.  Also, I disagree with others who have indicated that this product amount will last 6 months.  If you were to use this product solely on your nose, then yes it will last 6 months.  As I use it all over my face, I don&#x27;t see this 0.5 oz amount provided lasting beyond 2 months.</li>
            <li> Velvet skin is a great name for this product! It really leaves your skin velvety soft.</li>
            <li> This product goes on silky &amp; smooth. It does give a &amp;#34;velvet&amp;#34; finish. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It makes such a wonderful difference on how your makeup glides on. Doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> Love it! Wouldn&#x27;t leave the house without it.</li>
            <li> velvet skin makes your skin feel silky and smooth and makeup goes on flawless and does not stick into my wrinkles, just using it without makeup is just marvelous, I hate doing without, just wish it would not be as pricey, its worth every penny but for seniors with low income one must sacrifice something else. Its hard to describe this little tube-its just great, everybody should try it because one cannot describe how beautiful and silky it makes the skin feel</li>
            <li> This product is great!  On the expensive side. But I wish they sold it in a gallon drum.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I love it! It makes my skin look virtually flawless and feels so good and smooth. You only need a dab to do your entire face. Anyone could use this product but I&#x27;m in my 40s and it is the single best primer I have tried!</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy DHC Velvet Skin Coat after loving the sample I received in the mail.  I saw the review here that said it had the exact same ingredients as Lanacane Gel.  I ordered it (the VSC) anyway, but also bought a tube of Lanacane Gel (paid $6.99 for one ounce). The Lanacane Gel contains corn starch, which VSC does not, but they are, otherwise, pretty similar. I used each on half my face.  Both the immediate results and longer term (acting as a base for my make-up)were the same.  I gave it 5 stars because I do love the results.  Just know you can get the same results for less money with the Lanacane.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a makeup primer for a couple of weeks now. It goes on very velvety and powdery feeling, but does not leave a matte finish. I don&#x27;t think it reduces oily shine, but it gives  skin a smooth, nice surface for applying foundation. It only takes a very small amount, if too much is used, it is slightly oily.</li>
            <li> The velvet appearance of my skin when i use this is quite amazing I do not know how they do this, but in any light this stuff makes me look lovelier than i really am.</li>
            <li> The only product best ever; better than Sheer Cover which I love intensely! Different consistency, smaller amount needed, all day refreshed/soft feeling.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin feel incredibly soft.  Never used a primer before, but I&#x27;ll continue to buy this just for the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> The one and only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 star is because there is just not enough product for the price. It is a great primer. It goes on so smooth and my skin really does feel like velvet. Good stuff if you can afford the habit ;)</li>
            <li> loved it but too expensive</li>
            <li> This product is great! I apply just a small amount and it last all day. It really is like applying velvet, the cream is so smooth! I Found that I only have to apply a small dab and it goes a LONG way. It also prevents me from having to apply my makeup multiple times a day. It does not really have much of a scent, which is nice. I have added this product to my daily skin care routine, I cannot live without it! **Update this sounds strange but Monistat chaffing gel works/feels exactly the same as this primer and is only $5 in a bigger tube! **</li>
            <li> This is the best primer on the market.  You can do without foundation when you use DHC Velvet Skin Coat.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product  There is nothing out there like this  Love,Love, Love how my skin looks and feels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You use only the smallest amount to achieve great results  Ladies with oily skin, this is a must</li>
            <li> So, who would compare the human face to an artist&#x27;s canvas? Of course, a make-up artist!! They have been using tricks like primers before you could buy them on the market.  Now their are a dozen choices; \\&quot;which one do you choose.\\&quot;  This is one of the best products and it&#x27;s definitely not the most expensive.  It comes in right at $21.00 dollars.  It creates silk, no 1200 thread count sheet silk skin. It&#x27;s smooth, light and goes along way.  At least that&#x27;s what I say!!</li>
            <li> Great skin cream.  It truly makes one&#x27;s skin feel like velvet.  I love the way it makes my skin feel. Make-up lasts longer, too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I used to buy it all the time.  At some point, I stopped receiving the DHC catalogs and stopped ordering.  Very happy to have found it again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone interesting in smooth skin.  It is great.</li>
            <li> Velvet skin coat is the perfect name. This does make your skin feel  as smooth as velvet. A little goes a long way. Makeup goes on smoother and my skin looks alot better with it. If you have never used a primer and are thinking of using one, this is the one to get. I will never use another. I have rosacea  and this feels great on my skin. Love it. A+++++++++++++. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I tried the sample of this product and was amazed at how smooth and soft it left my skin, so I bought it here the container is kind of small but a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve used Loreal&#x27;s Miracle blur and liked it enough but this make-up primer is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes your skin feel, but it is a little pricey for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> My favourite make up primer.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is non greasy and makes your skin soft. It&#x27;s great under make-up.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using velvet skincoat for years. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up....only foundation and lipstick. This product makes foundation look natural and smooth. It fills in imperfections.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel like velvet. It smooths out wrinkles and evens makeup application to give your skin a flawless look. I won&#x27;t be without this product ever again</li>
            <li> This product is great. I love how my skin feels after a lite application. It takes a very small amount but leaves your skin smooth and silky feeling</li>
            <li> Yes it really fills-in all those cracks around eyes.....but was disappointed with how small the tub was for the price.</li>
            <li> I think this is what&#x27;s referred to as a &amp;#34;primer,&amp;#34; which I always thought was just another gimmick to sell yet another cream.  As someone else said, I think it came as a sample in an advertisement; I can&#x27;t imagine why I would have ordered it otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Velvet Skin Coat&amp;#34; has solved a problem I didn&#x27;t even know I had.  As you get older, the skin loses moisture and make-up just doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly.  If you put on more, you look like a clown.  If you use regular moisturizer, it&#x27;s too slick and doesn&#x27;t stay in place.  I haven&#x27;t looked to see what&#x27;s in it--I always appreciate the reviewers that research these details--but it feels like it has silicone, which lasts just long enough for makeup to slide on smoothly, stay there, and lot leave a greasy residue. I couldn&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> I normally use a primer from Sallys beauty supply. I recently ran out of it and read other reviews on primers. I thought a primer was just a primer, no big deal, there will be no difference. I used this for my 1st time this past week and loved it! I was wrong a primer is not just a primer. I noticed with this it gave me more of a smooth look and makes skin soft. I got lots of compliments on my skin. Will definately be buying again!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for year, and now I can&#x27;t live without it.  It makes your face feel like velvet.  Will be using for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This product is described on DHC website as good for all skin types.  However, it contains talc and silica.  Not good for dry skin at all.  My face became drier and scalier throughout the day with this on.  If you have very oily skin it is probably great.  I bought Smashbox instead and it works much better for dry skin.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to everyone, works great, love it. Excellent product!!!  Protects the pores of the skin&lt;br /&gt;so no dirt gets in.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using a trial packet that I got in the mail.  It makes my skin soft and isn&#x27;t oily under make-up.  I also liked the CoQ10 moisturizer but at $64 I can&#x27;t enjoy it that much!</li>
            <li> Loved the product, but too little quantity for too much money... They should figure out a way to reduce the price</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes your skin feel just like velvet as it smooths the skin, just as the name suggests.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of compliments since I&#x27;ve started using Velvet Coat under my makeup.  Feels wonderful and silky.  Definitely a reorder!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my face silky smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause&lt;br /&gt;breakouts and my make-up looks so much nicer!</li>
            <li> It works great to smooth skin and keep it shine free. I just wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> This product really works well!!  I have been pleased with the feel, and how it helps my makeup look nice all day long.  I have been quite pleased with the product and service I received.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the best primer I&#x27;ve used.  Worth every penny.  It feels like silk and my makeup lasts longer during the day.  Less touch ups</li>
            <li> This product is heavenly on the skin.</li>
            <li> Does not fill in lines as I expected.  While velvety feeling, was not pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> This will make your skin feel like silk. It is amazing. I got a sample in a catalog and then had to find it. Makes your make up last all day too. Just wonderful.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  Makeup goes on easierer &amp; stays fresh longer.  Seems to fill in fine lines so that skin looks smoother.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel, however, the price is a bit steep. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference between a cheaper brand and this one as far as looks to my skin. If you don&#x27;t mind the price, it feels great!</li>
            <li> This product should be used as a base to reduce oiliness under your foundation.  You do not need to use much and should apply only in the oily areas.</li>
            <li> It does as it&#x27;s expected and makes my skin look flawless.  Love!  You only need a tiny amount to get great results.</li>
            <li> this is the best product ever made in this world.  Glad I can order through Amazon now instead of just DHC</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel like velvet.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and will keep on using it. have recommended it to others. Have even sent it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is best primer to face before foundation (or alone) that I have ever used.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.  It makes a smooth as satin finish on the face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible! If it weren&#x27;t so pricey, I&#x27;d wear it every day. It &amp;#34;polishes&amp;#34; your skin, and makes it look smooth. I wear it over foundation, or alone, without make-up, to smooth the feel &amp; appearance of my skin. It&#x27;s the only skin/beauty product I&#x27;ve been 100% happy with. It&#x27;s a must for any woman. It makes me feel good about my skin, and I&#x27;m 66 and starting to wrinkle!</li>
            <li> My skin feels very smooth after I put on this product. Amazingly smooth in fact, like I can&#x27;t stop touching my cheeks. My makeup looks very nice when worn over this primer. I read many reviews before purchasing and also purchased the $5 tube of Lanacane, and I have to say, I see zero difference! For all I can tell it is the exact same product.</li>
            <li> This really feels like velvet on your skin.  It&#x27;s also about $5 cheaper here than other sites. Wear it everyday under my make up.</li>
            <li> I hate to say this, but I&#x27;ve used this for years. I think it is basically a silicone product that puts a thin, smooth layer on top of your face so that your makeup just glides on. Of course, you don&#x27;t need it- but once you use it, you won&#x27;t stop.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and this product is great</li>
            <li> Love the DHC Velvet Skin. I use it all the time and I order from Amazon because of the price and free shipping. I hate to be without it. Feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my makeup glide on</li>
            <li> This is the best primer I&#x27;ve found. I go back and forth trying different brands (Stila&#x27;s new one is good) but this is the best. It really does make your skin feel like velvet. Just a tiny amount is needed and makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I love this &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34;. It makes my skin feel very soft and makeup glides on easily. I wear it with or without foundation. A &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> Lovely texture that helps your foundation go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 20 yrs and find it the very best  makeup base.  It is a perfect product.</li>
            <li> This really does fill in the &amp;#34;craters&amp;#34; to make a smooth surface. I like it underneath Bare Minerals powder. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> I apply a very small dab of this lightly across my cheeks, nose and chin after moisturizer and before foundation. What a difference! Using the other same two products, but not this, the foundation doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly and I can see tiny streaks from my fingers and other minor application problems. Using this, I get a beautiful smooth, matte finish that stays moist all day. I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> This product is lightweight.  It fills the &amp;#34;pot holes&amp;#34; and smoothes the surface! Helps makeup stay put longer also.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! You just have to try it to see how awesome it works!!! I put it on under a BB cream but it works well by itself too!</li>
            <li> I use this under my sunscreen makeup and it is an awesome foundation.  Makes my skin look smooth and sometimes I go out with only the skin coat--no makeup.  Keeps my makeup looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Love this! I have very oily skin, &amp; my mineral powder makeup can&#x27;t keep up, but with this product, it last hours longer that it would without it! &#x3D;) Another plus is that it smooths the skin &amp; reduces the look of the pores, creating a more even skin texture!</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> Allows foundation to cling evenly to my skin so actually results in economy. Glad I ordered two.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It makes my skin feel soft and smooth, which helps my makeup go on more evenly.</li>
            <li> Product makes skin and lips feel soft and reduces lip wrinkles. Product will last a really long time. Small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i love this product, the first time i tried it was about six years ago when i got the catalog, with a couple of samples of velvet skin coat in it. this is the best perfector on the market, i used to just order samples, and the little tubes last forever because you only use a lttle bit. its GREAT</li>
            <li> This is the best and I have tried numerious  primers.  Makes your skin look and feel like silk.  I cannot say enough about it.</li>
            <li> This is everything that it was advertised to be. I place a couple of dabs on my face and my skin is smooth as silk. My pores reduce in size and appearance on my face and neck with a youthful glow that lasts all day. I have to get more!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this for deep lines. There is not much per Tube so I use sparingly !</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, Love it</li>
            <li> Amazing silky feel without the oily residue!  PERFECT for smoothing on before applying make up.  And a little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> I read Amazon reviews before buying......don&#x27;t know why my experience with this product is so different!  This product sucks.  When you squeeze it out and rub on, it beads and some falls on bathroom counter.  I can only imagine if one actually uses it, how it might clog pores.  Total waste, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I had been given a sample of DHC Velvet Skin Coat, which I used and it was wonderful.  I purchased two of these and they don&#x27;t do anything for my face like the sample did.  I don&#x27;t know if the two tubes were outdated but the sample was excellent.  I will not be buying this product again.  I am disappointed in DHC products.</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used for several years, and you put it on after your day moisturizer, and it feels great when you put&lt;br /&gt;your foundation on. A person can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this but a little pricey. Still a nice treat and works beautifully! Makes skin feel soft and smooth and makeup goes on better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly awesome.  It take a regular face and makes it shine.  In clears all the little imperfections for the day. put it on a clean face before makeup. you will also love the texture.</li>
            <li> Best primer I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;ve tried many, including Laura mercier, Mac, jane iredale, bare minerals. This one is far superior and works well on my oily,sensitive,  rosecea skin! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase !</li>
            <li> Does everything it claims and more.  I use this and blush.  Nothing else.  Makes skin look flawless. I&#x27;m 68 years old.</li>
            <li> My elderly aunt turned me on to DHC products and she swears by this primer. It goes on smooth and blurs fine lines and large pores and makes my foundation go on really smoothly. My skin really does feel velvet smooth and sometimes I can get away with wearing just this primer with a little bit of bronzer or blush. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with other primers so I can&#x27;t say for sure if this is the holy grail of primers, but it works really well and a little bit goes a long way. Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Gives skin a smooth finish....with or without foundation</li>
            <li> great product, great price</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my skin look so smooth and velvety!</li>
            <li> VERY NICE AND MAKES MY SKIN VERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> Clear and light, makes skin feel soothed, soft, and matte in appearance without changing skin tone. Great for guys or those like me with sensitive skin and can&#x27;t wear powder/foundation to cover up oily skin. This only helps to soothe rather than irritate, and most importantly doesn&#x27;t make me breakout. Will continue to be one of my essential products, love it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product and then ordered it.  It goes on easily and leaves your skin so soft.  It is colorless and goes on under your makeup.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years makes your skin soft and pores disappear!</li>
            <li> The Best!!!!!!!!! I need more!!!!!!!!!!! iT LEAVES YOUR FACE FEELING LIKE SILK, PLEASE SEND ME SOME MORE, YOU NEED JUST LITTLE, GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> Just love the smooth look this &amp;#34;velvet&amp;#34; coat gives my powder based makeup.  Looks just as smooth at the end of the day as it did when I first put it on in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with DHC Velvet Skin Coat.  This is a foundation primer and is worth every single penny!  This goes on quite smoothly and has a bit of a powdery finish.  I have worn this alone and with foundation.  It does a fantastic job of evening out skin tones and filling in lines and wrinkles.  I found this product and brand by receiving a sample from the company in the mail and was so happy to find that I was able to order it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I want to echo what others have said -- this product makes my skin look and feel terrific, and is a perfect primer for foundation or even just a little powder.  I was concerned at first about the size of the tube and the price, but after a couple of uses, I realized that if I use it over moisturizer (and I LOVE the DHC Enzyme Q10 Cream as a moisturizer), I use just a tiny bit of Velvet Skin Coat.  That makes the tube last longer and makes the product a better value.    However, even if I were using it rapidly, I suspect I would continue to buy it.  It really feels and looks great.</li>
            <li> LOVE THS STUFF.  mAKES YOU FACE FEEL LIKE SILK</li>
            <li> Great for filling in pores and making skin look flawless. I prefer a matte look on my forehead. This seems soften the appearence of my skin without making me shiny or greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It eliminates the need for powder or foundation as it smooths and silkens  the appearance of skin. Glad I can get it cheaper and faster than from DHC. If other skin care or makeup companies had this formula they&#x27;d have a best seller. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. Only use during night time event b/c it can dry pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I tried it in samples that were mailed to me.  I really feel that it smooths out my wrinkles and sets a soft base for my foundation.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my skin feels when I wear this.</li>
            <li> It is for my wife, she loves the product and I am glad that she does.  She looks more youthful with very nice skin with this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this primer. It really makes my skin feel smooth and matte even without foundation, and it really does minimize the looks of pores and wrinkles on ur skin when u apply it. Reason for it being 4 stars is that... The primer was SO much smaller than i really expected. and a lot of ppl wrote in their reviews that a little goes a long way, but i dont think thats really true, but its not like you have to use a whole bunch of it to cover ur face. but overall i like it :)</li>
            <li> very nice but very small tube and therefor is gone in a jiffy, too quick to find out if it is good</li>
            <li> One of the best products of its kind. I love using it under foundation cream. Smooth and gentle, yet does the trick of minimizing pores.</li>
            <li> This is my only face product. Love it!!</li>
            <li> it is a grat product I gave in to my Granddaughter for her birthday she loves it also</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My fine lines are disappearing and my makeup goes on wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I have had people in my workplace ask what I am doing different.  So I know it works.</li>
            <li> I imagine this is the type of product celebrities use to give the appearance of perfect skin without your having to spend a fortune for it. I use the DHC Velvet Skin Coat before applying my liquid base, and it helps my makeup go on flawlessly - hiding skin imperfections and decreasing the appearance of wrinkles. I absolutely love it and highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> did not perform as well as the sample</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great and saved a few bucks ordering threw amazon.</li>
            <li> DHC Velvet Skin Coat is a wonderful moisturizer. I am enjoying using it and feeling this help moisturize my dry skin.  It works for me.</li>
            <li> I really love this make-up primer!  It smooths the skin beautifully so make-up glides on. It is a bit pricey for the size of the tube.  I also purchased Lanacane Anti-Chafing Gel, which is supposed to work as a primer as well but at a reduced price, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, so can&#x27;t compare the two products.</li>
            <li> Love this under make up.  Fills tiny lines in complexion to improve the look of foundation.</li>
            <li> best primer I have ever used.  goes on smooth and feels velvety.  Makes my skin look really nice after applying foundation.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this primer.  I love it!  It feels so silky, and it provides a nice, rich feeling base for makeup which glides on smoothly after the primer has been applied.</li>
            <li> This product is the best thing anyone could use on their face. A minute amount is all you need to have your skin feel so soft and plump...  By itself or under make up it is great.</li>
            <li> An almost perfect base for liquid foundation.  Have been using this for about 10 yrs. and have found it consistent in smooth coverage.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and feels great, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s doing anything for my tiny lines...</li>
            <li> love this product, doesn&#x27;t really cover much, just slightly and leaves skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the velvet skin coat...until I realized it has the exact same major ingredients as Lanacane anti-chafing gel.  Lanacane costs $5 bucks at the drugstore; you get twice as much, and it works just as well. ;-)</li>
            <li> Delivers a non greasy smooth finish and creates a fabulous base coat prior to foundation application.  Will purchase this primer again when my supply runs low.</li>
            <li> Really makes your face look fresher and your pores smaller.  I will never be without this product!  It is also cheaper to buy it from  you than DHC.</li>
            <li> Great product but the tube is small for $20.00!  Probably won&#x27;t buy again!</li>
            <li> I originally tried this as a sample and loved it.  I have a naturally oily face and this primer helps minimize the amount of oil on my face.  I use it prior to applying liquid-based foundation.  I still get a bit oily at the end of the day but a lot less than if I didn&#x27;t apply this primer.  It also feels good on the face - very silk and soft.  I read previous reviews about Lanacane being similar to this product but I didn&#x27;t want to risk it since I was putting this stuff on my face!  Also a tiny bit goes a long way so I feel one tube will last you a while.</li>
            <li> Another DHC product that I buy consistently.  This is an awesome base product to use under your foundation, after you put your moisturizer on.  It makes your foundation glide on and it makes fine lines almost disappear.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  No fragrance is a plus!</li>
            <li> IT MAKES MY SKIN LOOK SO SMOOTH,LIKE VELVET.  I&#x27;M A SENIOR SO ITS REALLY AMAZING</li>
            <li> This product makes eye shadow glide on comfortably and takes away shine if your moisturizer leaves a greasy look.  I love this product and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I had a free sample and thought it was very nice so ordered a small tube.&lt;br /&gt;It seems different than the free sample I had tried and enjoyed..  it is thinner and does  not cover as well, so more of it is needed. It&#x27;s very expensive for the tiny amount in the tube and I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It goes on very smooth, making your skin feel silky and keeps my makeup on much longer.</li>
            <li> Loved the feel of this velvet skin coat base. It&#x27;s silky and makes your face feel soft, and goes on great. I feel I didn&#x27;t get a full tube of the merchandise, being you can&#x27;t see through it, and it seems to be going to quickly to have been full.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and liked it very much. I was offered samples from Lancôme, Smash Box, etc. and they were all just okay, but not as good as DHC. They have wonderful olive based cosmetics, but I prefer the Velvet Skin Coat above all others I have tried and the price is half that of Lancôme and much less also than Smash Box. You will love it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample in the mail once and tried, OMG this stuff is amazing.  It was shipped from England so it took awhile but worth the wait!</li>
            <li> i have used Model in a Bottle to set makeup, and it works very well. Then DHC sent me a brochure by mail with a few samples including this one. wow! i was totally impressed. this product is a total MAKEUP GRABBER. it holds on to it like glue and keeps it in place. you need to get used to it and know how much concealer to apply over it, because if you make mistakes (like applying too much concealer in one area), you might have a hard time \\&quot;moving\\&quot; your makeup around your face because the Velvet Coat won&#x27;t let it go!! i mostly apply it around the eyes and it is PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dont really have wrinkles so i dont know if it smoothes them out. But once you&#x27;re finished applying your foundation, i recommend you AIRBRUSH your makeup with Coastal Scents&#x27; Silica powder OR ELF&#x27;s HD powder.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to see DHC products offered thru Amazon, I have used their products for several years and am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  It does exactly what it claims it will.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I am a hard sell on make-up, and I purchase almost everything at Wal-Mart.  However, after getting a few free samples from DHC, this is one product I cannot live without.  I am a 42-year-old lady who often gets mistaken for a college student.  Part of that is due to DHC Vevet Skin Coat.  Applying this all over the face prior to foundation gives a flawless finish, and one that is less likely to grab the make-up in the tiny creases of my aging skin.  It&#x27;s like putting a coat of 20-year-old skin over my face before I head out for the day.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Not much in the tube and the formula didn&#x27;t &#x27;glide&#x27; on my face. Try either Sephora&#x27;s own brand primer or Photo Finish by Smashbox.</li>
            <li> Love how this fills in lines.  I use it every day after my foundation.</li>
            <li> This is the best primer I have ever used. It is so silky smooth and keeps my makeup intact all day.</li>
            <li> No better or worse than others I have tried.  Somewhat disappointed and will stick with my Dermalogica which I love!</li>
            <li> love it, have used before</li>
            <li> Another great product from DHC!!!!! makes your skin appear so smooth. Just put a tiny bit on your face right before you put on your foundation. really feels like velvet.</li>
            <li> This is the best product around to keep your make-up fresh all day long!  Just remember that a little goes a long way when applying Velvet Skin Coat.  I will definitely use this product for a long time, as the benefits are great!</li>
            <li> I love this product...smooths out fine lines and leaves your skin feeling like velvet</li>
            <li> Another product with too much hype and no results. I tried it a few times (just to be fair) and then tossed it. Life is too short to put up with products which don&#x27;t deliver as promised.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about five years and am a big fan. It feels really good on my face, and it seems to make smoothing on foundation much easier. Once the makeup is on, I think my whole look is more polished with Velvet Skin Coat underneath the foundation. Also, I have found that in the warm summer weather, Velvet Skin Coat helps to keep makeup from sliding off. I have sensitive skin and have broken out in rashes when I have used other DHC products, but this one has caused me no problems. The price on Amazon is better than you can get buying directly from DHC, plus you can get the free super-saver shipping if your order totals at least $25, whereas DHC requires you to buy at least $85 worth of products in order to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li> So great.the only primer I will ever use. Not heavy, not slippery. Perfect.</li>
            <li> It was not that good, especially for Chicago weather, it makes your skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of skin primers and have been searching for the absolute best. I did a test of the following primers on my skin at the same time:&lt;br /&gt;- Chanel - Le Blanc de Chanel Sheer Illuminator&lt;br /&gt;- Philosophy - the Present&lt;br /&gt;- Philosophy - the Supernatural&lt;br /&gt;- Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind&lt;br /&gt;- DHC Velvet Skin Coat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 43 years old with medium skin (not oily or dry) with light wrinkles. I was looking for a primer that would help fill in fine lines, smooth out pores, and create a natural-looking base for my make-up. Here are the results I found, in ranked order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Philosophy the Supernatural: Winner. Easy to put on, did the best overall job of meeting my objectives. Very natural and excellent make-up base.&lt;br /&gt;2. Chanel: Silicon-free, which I appreciate. Definitely a great runner-up.&lt;br /&gt;3. Philosophy the Present: I don&#x27;t love this stuff but it&#x27;s better than the other two. This requires two full minutes before application of make-up and it didn&#x27;t make a big difference in my fine lines&lt;br /&gt;4. Maybelline: pure silicon. felt like smoothing on plastic and didn&#x27;t have great results.&lt;br /&gt;5. DHC Velvet Skin Coat: I hated this. again, pure silicon but three times the price of the Maybelline and not only didn&#x27;t work well but didn&#x27;t work well with my moisturizer - created a white residue.</li>
            <li> Forget all other makeup primers.  This is the only one worth the money.  I have used Velvet Skin Coat for years.  I was delighted when I saw that I could buy it from Amazon and get my points instead of buying it direct through DHC (and then having to pay shipping too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not used this product, you should.  I use far less foundation when I have this a base coat.  And on those days I don&#x27;t want to bother with foundation, I can simply use a little of this and then a bit of face powder and I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I am in my 50&#x27;s and shy away from makeup as I think it makes me look much older now. going for the natural look with this stuff is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wear it over my  moisturizer and no makeup. It smoothes over all of the lines, collagen pockets and what other flaws you get in your 50&#x27;s, I really think this stuff makes me look way younger! I absolutely love it. I was sent samples, got hooked right off the batt and ordered the full tube! What a treasure to of found this when I needed a pick me up the most! Trying to embrace getting older, this stuff is going to be my best friend!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactlyhow my skin feels to the touch.  I use it with or wihout makeup, and it makes me feel better about my skin.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a good makeup primer.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try DHC Velvet Skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like the velvety feel of this product!&lt;br /&gt;But, it is a small tube and you have to use quit a bit to fully cover your face!&lt;br /&gt;There are other products out there, that will work better and last longer.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product goes on;  very soft and smooth but no residue.  I found it works best if you wait just a couple of minutes before applying foundation on top of it.  It really makes the makeup go on smoothly (and you also end up using less foundation than you normally would).  It doesn&#x27;t affect the coverage of the makeup, but the final look is a lot smoother than if you don&#x27;t use the primer.  I have occasionally used it alone, without foundation, and while it doesn&#x27;t give you any coverage, it does give you a little bit of improvement in skin texture.  I can&#x27;t speak too much to whether it causes breakouts or not;  lately, I&#x27;ve been getting some small breakouts, but can&#x27;t isolate it to a particular product (I&#x27;ve changed lotions and foundation at the same time, so it&#x27;s hard to tell which, if any, might be the cause).</li>
            <li> Best primer on the market, hands down!!!</li>
            <li> Velvet Coat works great! I don&#x27;t wear make-up once I apply, there is no need. I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I love Velvet Skin and it really does make my skin feel like velvet. It goes on easy and can be used under makeup or just on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Velvet Skin Coat gave my skin a smooth look and feel.  My foundation went on over it very nicely.  It did seem to minimize the appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li> Had gotten a sample in the mail and just love it so ordered a tube to try.  Someone had written that the ingredients are the same as what is in Lanocane anti chafing gel.  So may try that to do a comparison as the lanocane is much less expensive.</li>
            <li> By all my favorite face item</li>
            <li> It might be considered pricey, but worth every velvety cent.  A perfect base for my makeup! It really makes a visible difference on this nearly 70 yr old face!!</li>
            <li> For the price I really expected more, was disappointed and won&#x27;t be buying this product again. Too much money for doing nothing.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Use it once and my skin got itchy and does not cover fine line. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product and price from Amazon! Moisturizes like a glacé so it is non greasy. It also makes skin feel incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> This was okay, but definitely no better than what you can by a Walmart or Target for a lot less. Makes your skin feel really soft, but doesn&#x27;t minimize the look of pores or help makeup last longer. Gave it to my daughter-in-law and she had the exact same things to say.</li>
            <li> This product stays true to it&#x27;s name.  It leaves a velvety coat on the skin, makes it easy to apply makeup and makes skin soft and smooth.  This is my favorite product from the DHC line.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and cannot say enough good things about this product! It makes your skin so smooth under makeup or without. I would not want to go without it. I have tried other makeup primers but none compare. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> This is amazing and makes your skin feel like velvet. Just wonderful over the eyelids and around the eyes. Use on my entire face. Will reorder this product.</li>
            <li> Feels absolutely wonderful and smooths out skin beautifully. The item&#x27;s description does not do it any justice at all! LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Best makeup primer out of all I&#x27;ve tried.  Velvet finish - makes your skin look much younger and makeup goes much further.  I wish it came in a larger size.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I only wish it would come in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It gives your skin a tighter feeling without feeling stiff.  It is nice around the eyes and cheeks.  It lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> It seems to create a thin, clear veneer on your skin that provides a nice matte finish to your face most of the day. Use it under your regular makeup.</li>
            <li> This product is the softest thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased for my skin.  It makes your makeup last longer for 2 reasons.  It&#x27;s so creamy, it blends your foundation perfectly so you use less, plus it keeps your makeup in place for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Try it!!!  Seriously!</li>
            <li> LOVE this primer.  Have used Urban Decay and Smashbox photofinish (Hydrating) and nothing works as well as DHC Velvet Skin Coat!</li>
            <li> This tube is small.  I realize a tiny bit goes a long way so this tube will last awhile but it&#x27;s surprising when you first receive it how small it is - especially since it&#x27;s $20.00.  I only use it on one tiny space on my face.  I have a permanent very open pore right next to my nose near my cheek.  When I put this velvet skin coat over that pore, it fills it right in so you cannot even notice it.  It completely hides my one open pore and it stays that way all day.  I don&#x27;t wear foundation. I only wear a translucent powder over my entire face.  I&#x27;m 48 years old and have medium skin and a very clear complexion.  When I spread this on my face, it feels velvety.  Really really smooth and soft.  I think if the tube was bigger I would use a larger amount and spread it over my face , everywhere I have wrinkles starting to show.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this product &amp; happy a better price online as I use it all the time. Packaged well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> Jury is still out.  After putting it on then going to my foundation I found that my skin looked very dry and had to take it all off.  I&#x27;m waiting to see if after hydrating my skin more this doesn&#x27;t have the same effect.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin very smooth and helps makeup go on very smoothly. I like the way it makes my skin look when I go out without makeup.  I just question value since this tube is probably the length of your middle finger  True, a little goes a long way, but it&#x27;s not worth it to me to pay this amount for so little product.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and creates a velvety base for your foundation or tinted moisturizer. I do need to apply moisturizer prior to the Velvet Skin Coat application though or else my skin is too dry. The look you&#x27;ll achieve is a matte and smooth complexion. I wish it comes in a larger tube though since I find that the product runs out too fast (or maybe I&#x27;m using too much of it during each application).  Either way, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is one of my very favorite products.  It creates a flawless foundation under base makeup or can be worn alone. It minimizes pores and fine lines. Super happy with it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It keeps the oil off all day but even more impressive, it makes applying makeup a cinch as it smooths out the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li> How many times in your life do you say something is life changing?  Personally, not too many.  I received a sample of this product inside a magazine and I am forever changed.  It takes the place of foundation and powder.  It slides on like a silky, smooth, heavenly dream taking all the oiliness off of your face and making it as close to perfect as a product can!  I would pay a hundred bucks for a tube of this product - no exaggeration.  I am comparing it to Mirabella Prime Time for face and eyes (very oily and separated), Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream (thick and makes your wrinkles pronounced), and Makeup Forever Primer (very flowery scent)...I promise you, if there was ever a product to try...that is universally appealing to every skin color/type..this is IT!  I put it close to my eyes and it holds my blush and eye shadow on to perfection!  Zero scent or yucky texture!  Zero color to have to match!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes your skin feel so soft and smooth when you put it on and it keeps your skin feeling so nice all day long. I have oily skin and it keeps the oil down all day long.</li>
            <li> it works well; however, too pricey for me.</li>
            <li> Product goes on so smooth and keeps my face nice all day without becoming oilly</li>
            <li> I gave this one star for quick shipping. However....it does nothing for oily skin like I read in previous reviews. People please don&#x27;t state that this controls oily skin because it doesn&#x27;t!! If you are not blotting your face within an hour of applying make up you do not HAVE oily skin! More money wasted thanks to false reviews!!</li>
            <li> I discovered Velvet Skin Coat through a sample a couple of years ago, and have purchased it and used it ever since.  It just takes a small amount smoothed over the face to create a great, velvety, matte surface for makeup (or bare skin).  I had used the Clinique pore-minimizer lotion for a few years before I tried this, but Velvet Skin Coat beats the Clinique primer hands-down for its velvety finish (even over sunscreen)  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> First things first, my skin is quirky as heck and sensitive like a newborn baby.  Every product, no matter how natural, fragrance-free, or dermatologist recommended has the potential to irritate my skin.  I still love makeup though, and I love my primers (silly, I know).  I&#x27;ve tried sample after sample of primers from the highest end of the market to the lowest and they&#x27;ve all left me with clogged pores and pimples.  Not this stuff.  It smoothed out the bumpy skin on my cheeks without irritating them at all.  It made the little fine lines between my brows look less noticeable.  I thought it made my makeup look better.  It does make your skin feel velvety.  The downside?  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; like some of the other primers on the market, in fact, it feels the slightest bit chalky when you apply it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as an all over primer for this reason.  It&#x27;s better used in problem areas, so if you think your whole face is a problem (as I sometimes do) look for a different primer.  Also, if my skin is very dry, it will make my dry patches more noticeable after I put foundation on.  It is pricey as well, but not more so than most high-end primers.  I paid twenty for my little tube and it will last a while if I&#x27;m just using it on my problem areas and not my whole face.</li>
            <li> smooths out your face and foundations just glide on.  Makes your face feel great.</li>
            <li> I have only tried a sample of this, but so far I have found that it goes on smoothly and controls the oil pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful to use under my makeup.  Makes my skin feel smooth and makeup last all day.</li>
            <li> Wish so much we had had primers decades ago! This is nice and light, not gummy. Evens out texture so foundation goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li> If DHC ever decides to discontinue this product, I hope they let me know so that I can buy a lifetime supply before it goes away.  I love this product and have been using it for years.  It truly does make your skin feel like velvet. I use it even on days when I don&#x27;t wear any other make-up.  Not sticky, easy to apply, and dries to a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a sample of it in the mail and been looking for it, and finally found it here on Amazon!!! I use with out putting make up on I just put it on and some blush and go it does what it says it does!!</li>
            <li> I have yet to use a DHC product that I haven&#x27;t  liked and that goes for this one as well.  My skin tends to be on the dry side and Velvet Skin Coat gives that little extra smoothing that I like.  Don&#x27;t know if anybody else has tried mixing it with their liquid foundation but that&#x27;s how I use it.</li>
            <li> I first got this as a sample and immediately had to order some.  Makeup goes on smoother and has more staying power throughout the day.  It actually does make your skin feel like velvet.  I just love it and wouldn&#x27;t use any other primer.</li>
            <li> is nice, gives a smooth look.</li>
            <li> Right before applying foundation, apply this all over face.  Voila!  No more pores&lt;br /&gt;(Make sure to let it set for a little before foundation, allowing that coat of &amp;#34;velvet skin&amp;#34; to perform)</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!  It makes my skin look and feel like velvet.  I will order some more even though it is a bit pricy.  I know you&amp;#34;ll love it  also.  I haven&#x27;t used it all the time yet but I am going to start right away because those little lines on your upper lip almost disappear immediately.  You won&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> I like it but it is extremely expensive.  It will be great if the price was lower and the amount more significant.  I find it good but too expensive.  Do they have special offers once in a while?</li>
            <li> This product does make your skin appear smoother and flawless.</li>
            <li> This is a super product! Makes your skin feel so smooth, not to mention it hid lots of my wrinkles and pores looked smaller. It does what it says so I feel it was worth every penny. One doesn&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li> Received a sample in the mail and liked it. Ordered it. I like the way it feels on my skin, but I thought it would prevent my face from looking oily--it does help, but it still looks a little oily by afternoon.</li>
            <li> Love it,can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> I found a sample of this in a magazine. Wow!  It really feels like velvet!  I have been putting a small bit on every day from this sample packet.  I&#x27;m going to order this tube and hope it does the same thing.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I put just a tiny bit on before my foundation and it keeps my foundation in place all day long.</li>
            <li> Used this product for several years.  Absolutely love it.  Foundation glides on and stays on.</li>
            <li> This is a product I never want to be without.  It makes applying make-up a new experience.  I am a former model and in my spare time I love to paint with oils.  I know the importance of preparing a canvas.  The same applies to your face.  Apply the primer and as you apply your make up, your skin will look absolutely flawless.  You will find that your make up lasts longer, fewer emergency touch ups throughout the day.  To try DCH VELVET SKIN COAT will make you a believer!</li>
            <li> love the consistency of this the fell is truly silky and amazing.  will buy again.  arrived well package and on time</li>
            <li> works very nicely under make-up and is especially effective around lip lines. Have bought before will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great primer. Really makes a difference when I use this vs. when I don&#x27;t. Been using it for years!</li>
            <li> LOVE this Primer!  I have Rosacea and it is very difficult to get an even coat of foundation on without irritating my skin.  This product goes on like silk and makes your skin feel like silk.  No irritation.  Make-up stays in place all day. Noticeable difference in the texture of my skin, fine lines, etc. after application.</li>
            <li> Great Product - makeup goes on smoothly - face is so soft - I love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Only a small amount will give your face a pearly appearance...soft and matte. Goes on quickly and adds no color of its own. Takes away a shiny face and leaves a soft finish.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes your skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Makes your skin look so nice and smooth. I am 69 and do not a a winkle on my face.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> The stuff is nice but for the cost&lt;br /&gt;The amount seems minimum.</li>
            <li> Superior product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Received this quickly.  I did think the tube was smaller than expected.  Also, there seems to be a lot of air bubbles in the product when dispensing...am I getting what I paid for?  Probably won&#x27;t order again but product is nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month and I still don&#x27;t have it- what&#x27;s up?why is it taking so longtime get it ridiculous</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky skin with a little rosacea for good measure. I do not like to wear makeup, so I often just spread this &amp;#34;miracle potion&amp;#34; on my face and my naturally red/irritated/blotchy dry skin becomes extremely soft and even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On those rare occasions when I do wear makeup, I apply this as a primer and the foundation goes on smoothly and does not look &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> Putting on makeup without this miracle worker is like wearing a sexy dress without a slip.  It just doesn&#x27;t feel right!  A small drop covers the face allowing liquid or powder makeup to go smooth as silk.  I wear it alone on &amp;#34;days off&amp;#34;&#x27; and it fills in pores and small wrinkles and makes your face baby soft.  I have been using this product for ten plus years and never, ever run out.</li>
            <li> Love this as a primer to wear under make up. It smoothed out big pores and gives the appearance of leveled skin. I just wish the tube was bigger because it goes fast. But, you can&#x27;t have it all! 😄</li>
            <li> used many primers and this is absolutely the best...goes on like silk and gives you the silky finish you want.  Great product.. DHC has many great products...they have quality ingredients also.</li>
            <li> This goes on very smooth and helps minimize most smaller scars. It feels creamy and dry at the same time somehow. Fantastic under foundation.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a couple of years and was thrilled that I could buy it on Amazon.  You are rapidly becoming my first &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; shopping site.  Thank you for making buying so simple.</li>
            <li> I did not find one iota of difference in using this product after being eager to try it.  At the moment it is still sitting in my drawer.  I would not recommend this product to anyone as I found it a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product feels like velvet, and it dulls down the shinny spots on my face and gives my skin a soft an even tone. I apply this over my moisturizer and makeup. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> the proof is in the name - it makes your skin feel like velvet</li>
            <li> I have tried so many beauty products for my sensitive skin and almost always end up dissapointed. This is amazing!! It makes my make up look flawless! I even wear it when I am not wearing make up and always get compliments on how smooth my skin looks! I am a customer for LIFE!</li>
            <li> only use on &#x27;trouble spots&#x27;  makes skin silky soft and even for makeup application. was drying when used on spots that did not need assist</li>
            <li> Love it. Skin so smooth and when apply amke up above it looks flawless!! A friend recommend it and i recommend to everyone else :))</li>
            <li> The only product I ever used similar to this was made by Estee Lauder and cost over 3 times what I paid for DHC Velvet Skin Coat.  After I wash my face with Dove beauty bar, I use Insta Natural 100% Pure Argan Oil, then I use DHC Velvet Skin Coat before I apply my makeup.  I&#x27;ve been told I have very pretty skin and I&#x27;ll be 68 years old very soon .  DHC does make your skin feel like velvet.  I have very sensitive skin, and all of the products I&#x27;ve named in this review have worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> found samples in mailbox, tried it and fell in love.  This product used under your foundation, will help to keep smooth skin and a longer lasting day of make-up.  It&#x27;s only drawback: the small container.  Would love to see it in a larger size.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for under make up, silky smooth and a little goes a long way. I use it every morning under foundation, and I can use less foundation. I like it much better than similar products by other high end mKe up and skin care companies I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin feel like velvet. I wish it was a tad bit cheaper, but it does the job. I put it on under my make-up, or just on my face in the morning or after my shower, so I usually only use it once a day. I do like it a lot!</li>
            <li> I have large pores. The Velvet Skin Coat deffently makes them appear smaller under my liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> its good but there are better primers out there</li>
            <li> i love using this before I apply my makeup! It goes on so smooth and makes my face  feel so soft. a great product</li>
            <li> Great product!  Makes your skin feel like SILK!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product..I use it over my moisturizer and foundation before adding blush and lipstick.  It really helps control&lt;br /&gt;shine in Tucson&#x27;s hot summer.</li>
            <li> Skin looks great with foundation using this product. Like a translucent powder but silky. Love it under foundation too for a very finished look. Keeps the shine at bay.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Smooth like silk on my skin. I wish it came in a bigger tube.</li>
            <li> THIS GIVES YOUR FACE A NICE FEELING, BUT FOR THE PRICE, I DON&#x27;T EXPECT TO ORDER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel like velvet.</li>
            <li> A very nice product. I had used the sample and decided I would definitely like to use primer every day.[[ASIN:B0027WPJRI DHC Velvet Skin Coat 0.52 oz. Net wt.]]</li>
            <li> awesome as a primer, just so people know this is not for a foundation, it is clear not tinted. but if your looking for a primer for your makeup, this fills your pores and then your foundation just glides on top. you really only need it on your forehead, nose, sides of nose and chin, this is an amazing primer</li>
            <li> My favorite primer but you do have to be careful and not use too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 with oily skin in the t-zone.  Even wiping my face throughout the day doesn&#x27;t get rid of the shine. Using this product helps tone down my oily areas and just gives me an even glow across my whole face.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this because it was #2 on a few top primer reviews that I had read. I don&#x27;t have a problem with acne but this stuff broke me out in pores I didn&#x27;t even know I had. Also, it makes my expensive, department store makeup slide right off of my nose. It does work well for smoothing soft lines under eyes but that&#x27;s about the only thing that it&#x27;s good for. I&#x27;m still young and only had a few pores I was trying to fill but it didn&#x27;t get the job done. Way too small of a bottle for the price and not worth it.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel velvety, but it does not smooth over most flaws or cause my makeup to go on smoother or stay on longer. I still gave it three stars because it does give a nice matte effect to my skin and minimizes the appearance of large pores, so I still wear it on days when I&#x27;m going au naturel to cut down on shine. However, in my opinion it was not worth it for the price and I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute miracle when applying makeup.  It makes your foundation go on so much smoother.  I definitely will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> I wear this over sunscreen since it seems like every sunscreen on the planet creates huge amounts of shine.  Instantly mattifies skin and lasts pretty well, especially if you use powder as well.</li>
            <li> I liked a sample I tried well enough to purchase. It is a really-small-tube. I prefer Colorscience primers. I think they do a nicer job and you get a lot more product for the money. The product is just ok for me, but since the tube is so small it will be good for packing for a short trip.</li>
            <li> Covers pores and wrinkles with nice velvety effect  Good under foundation.  Sometimes causes a &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; look but mostly a lovely product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup but for a special occasion I&#x27;ll use this as an extra touch.  I like the way it leaves my skin feeling and I like that a little goes a very long way.  I&#x27;ve had a single tube for about 2 years now and still haven&#x27;t used it up.  I really like the way it goes on and if you wear foundation I bet it will be even better than it is without.  For me it&#x27;s just an added treat and works great.</li>
            <li> This product is good, however,  I did not notice much difference from this makeup primer compared to Cover Girl&#x27;s primer at half the cost and four times the quantity.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping took 5 weeks to get and I was charged $8.50 for 0.5 ozs!!  At a cost of $27.00 for Velvet Skin, I will buy Cover Girl&#x27;s product again for $11.00!</li>
            <li> Expensive for the results. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I found this to cause my skin to erupt.  Not terribly, but enough to not want to use it.  It does keep your makeup on very well, but for me not worth the complexion woes.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected. Love this product leaves yours skin like porcelain.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I only use it to fill in and camouflage the pores on my nose and for this it works like a miracle! Since I only use it on my nose it lasts a long time. Sometimes I use it without any make up. I don&#x27;t want to go anywhere in public without a bit of Velvet Skin Coat on my nose. It feels wonderfully silky smooth to the touch and is scentless and non-greasy. I use Lancombe LaBase as a make up primer for the rest of my face.</li>
