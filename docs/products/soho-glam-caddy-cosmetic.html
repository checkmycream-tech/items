            <li>It&#x27;s soo cute</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I had been for a better way to organize my make up and bathroom and after looking at all reviews and products online and in store I found this.</li>
            <li>so I use it for a portable desk top essentials carrier</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up lot of space and stores so many things in there.</li>
            <li>I put brushes, primers, bb creams, highlighters, makeup tools, eye liners, and more.</li>
            <li>and I bought the SOHO Expandable Cylinder Vanity Acrylic Organizer and placed it on top of the InterDesign Drawers.</li>
            <li>Love this organizer.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have enough space it will look perfect.</li>

            <li>I received my SOHO Expandable Vanity Organizer today and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Also, it would be more convenient if the pull out compartments were deeper.</li>
            <li>I would like a square one better because some of the compartments are not visible when things are loaded in.</li>
            <li>All around a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for people who don&#x27;t have too much makeup.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to hold more then a small/travel size</li>
            <li>and I was not even able to use the wings for eye shadow compartments.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>it holds a lot more stuff</li>
            <li>This organizer is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but that is okay.</li>
            <li>It keeps everything so organized, which I love.</li>
            <li>so I am quite pleased all around.</li>
            <li>Is elegant and confortable.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>Now I have more room on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>i use most often.</li>
            <li>Im glad to consolidate my makeup obsession.</li>
            <li>I have one of  the expandable cyclinder&#x27;s sitting on top of each of the 3 drawer storage containers.  </li>
            <li>It is also very cute and looks good on my new makeup table.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed by how much this container can hold; my dresser top looks a lot neater thanks to this!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>and it has cleaned up my vanity area quite a bit and made the makeup I use most easy to find.</li>
            <li>Throughout the remainder I hold 2 bulky lipsticks, 2 slim lip glosses, 3 bulky eyeshadows, mascara, 2 eye liners (and I could easily add another 15 in that section), foundation, consealer and powder, and browbone powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am organized and pleased.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect size for everything that I use often enough that I want it readily available.</li>
            <li>I love it and all my brushes have a space to fit now :)</li>
            <li>Nice heavy acrylic container, perfect addition to my vanity.</li>
            <li>Face cleansing pads fit perfectly in the middle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does it look fabulous, it holds everything perfectly!</li>
            <li>I can see everything easily and it&#x27;s all very accessible as well.</li>
            <li>It looks very cool on my vanity.  </li>
            <li>but it looks pretty nice filled with stuff!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really able to fit anything in them.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, my husband likes that its organized and doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I plan to check out some D.I.Y videos to see how I can creatively organize my items that didn&#x27;t fit (shadows, hd powder, primer).</li>
            <li>I really like it keeps my stuff good, but I just don&#x27;t like how my brushes stick out a lot maybe</li>
            <li>It is good for every day make up To be your make up more organized all the day and easy reach the specific kind of makeup</li>
            <li>Looks nicer than the picture as well, specially with stuff in it!</li>
            <li>the top is fine, i fit two foundation, two BB cream tubes, studio fix tube foundation, and all my brushes, it&#x27;ll do</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased it to put my makeup, I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day, but I do my hair every day sometimes more than once a day.</li>
            <li>The drawers seem a bit flimsy but overall good product!</li>
            <li>Keeps makeup organized and easy to find.</li>
            <li>it does store my tools neatly and within easy reach.</li>
            <li>so I can find it easily.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to see what&#x27;s in it, and that it&#x27;s acrylic</li>
            <li>And it makes application so easy, because of how I have organized things.</li>
            <li>so I can find what I m looking for easily.</li>
            <li>Many compartment and is easy to clean and wash out after ti starts to build up make up gunk.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty handy</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly on my vanity love the little drawers!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for small space and can store many makeup stuffs.</li>
            <li>The quality is fine, but I don&#x27;t like how the compartments are.</li>
            <li>This is awesome, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it because the picture made it look so small, and even though I looked at the measurements I just couldn&#x27;t picture it.  </li>
            <li>Now all my beauty products are organized and my dresser is super neat!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with this little acrylic makeup holder.</li>
            <li>But overall I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li>My eye shadow brushes do fit in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for organizing makeup brushes, with several compartments</li>
            <li>It feels very sturdy and the acrylic is of nice quality.</li>
            <li>i thought it would fit all my makeup</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s important to me.</li>
            <li>FIT LOTS OF BRUSHES</li>
            <li>Fantastic use of space.</li>
            <li>I threw out all my cheap corner store stuff, and went to Nordstroms.</li>
            <li>But I have over 20 makeup brushes -- they all fit -- just finding the 1</li>
            <li>Overall, good organizer,  Attractive, durable clear plastic.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look at all cheap.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my everyday make up.</li>
            <li>Extra storage space is great wherever you find it, eh?&lt;br /&gt;Hubby loves it and that in itself speaks volumes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t fit any of my powder boxes/compacts/sets in here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a ton of makeup, or if they do, a place for just the daily stuff.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of space, so this particular one fit the bill!!</li>
            <li>It does hold more than the *normal* amount of makeup that you&#x27;d need for every day in a convenient spot, but if you have a lot of makeup that you want to organize, you may need more than one of these -  or an additional organizer.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for me, all of my most essential makeup, along with brushed, is now organized and quickly found!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome little organizational tool for any bathroom!</li>
            <li>this ls exactly as advertised love it</li>
            <li>I have a small vanity and this is perfect to put it on there.</li>
            <li>I was nervous to buy, but it was worth the risk!</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trust me, it looks better in real life!</li>
            <li>I have decided after months of procrastination to finally clean up my make-up basket.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and cute, only thing is that I received it cracked at the bottom.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s transparent and clean look.</li>
            <li>I have to stick my foundation in the back (on a good day if they&#x27;ll fit),</li>
            <li>Has many compartments, looks good, works as expected.</li>
            <li>(I love clear acrylic because it is strong, easy to clean</li>
            <li>This little gadget is perfect for storing my daily makeup on the counter and keeping it organized and tidy yet easily accessible.</li>
            <li>The first time she saw it she said how much she really liked it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got my makeup done, verified that I loved the look, and bought all the necessary items.</li>
            <li>THUS, I am organized and good for the next year or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>The material is such great quality, actually looks kind of luxurious.</li>
            <li>I really was pleased.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>looks great with my other makeup holder.</li>
            <li>It streamlines my morning makeup routine because I can find everything quickly.</li>
            <li>The middle section was perfect for my coastal scents brushes as they have long handles, and the side sections are perfect for my bare essential brushes.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and arrived well packaged.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>It is actually really pretty in a way, the light reflects and makes a bit of a rainbow color at the edges.</li>
            <li>My bathroom vanity is so much more organized now, and I only have to move the one thing to clean the counter!</li>
            <li>after putting all my makeup into it i never realized how much i had and didn&#x27;t use!!</li>
            <li>I really like it!!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>I was able to organize all of my make-up most easily except for putting things in those little pop out compartments on the bottom.</li>
            <li>It holds a lot more that expected, and I find it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Well-designed, and the compartments vary in size enough to fit all sorts of odds and ends--everything from brushes to bottles to foundations and more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid of knocking anything over</li>
            <li>and I love that its clear</li>
            <li>It looks really nice and gave me a lot of room for some brushes, ponytails, and smaller make up items.</li>
            <li>I love that it too is clear</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty cool -</li>
            <li>anyways, it&#x27;s pretty cool looking..</li>
            <li>Definitely worth to get one.</li>
            <li>was well worth money paid for it.</li>
            <li>This is bigger than what I expected it to be, but it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the sides to fit in the corner of the counter top or open all the way.</li>
            <li>It is worth it for this alone.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s spots for brushes, eye shadows, lipsticks but not really any good space for my liquid foundations.</li>
            <li>I was surprised since it came very nicely packaged, but it was obvious that the cracks couldn&#x27;t have appeared when the product was shipped (it was packed in 3 boxes with a lot of cushioning around).</li>
            <li>I bought this because I don&#x27;t have a lot of space in my bathroom and wanted something to fit on the toilet tank top.  </li>
            <li>Now only if they could find a way to also clean my bushes. :-)</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted to keep my brushes, and other makeup tools in a neat and organized manner..very good to have as a makeup artist....</li>
            <li>Holds all of my make up in one place, now I have it right at hand.  </li>
            <li>Great product for storing small makeup items.</li>
            <li>Works great for small places</li>
            <li>This container sits perfectly on my desk, but I wish the side drawers were a little bigger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy I bought it, because I haven&#x27;t found anything better, but it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li>I would definitely suggest this to anyone who has a lot of makeup brushes and wants to organize them nicely.</li>
            <li>The trimmer and attachments fit well in the top, the instructions go in one of the bottom compartments, and that leaves one empty bottom compartment for...</li>
            <li>The bottom tier is split in two sections that open out to store flatter items like eye primer tubes or single shadow pans; this is nice because this tier adds storage capacity without taking up additional precious counter space.</li>
            <li>Durable but waay Smaller than I envisioned.. wouldnt pay more than $10.00 for this.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>ok, thought it would be bigger.</li>
            <li>It is not too big, so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on my counter, which is great especially because I&#x27;ll be taking it to my dorm with me.</li>
            <li>I need to invest in more of these, with different size sections.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to organize my makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very neat!</li>
            <li>Exactly what&#x27;s in description.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I need it to.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Who wants to receive a cracked item they paid for?!</li>
            <li>Besides, Im sure your bathroom has enough color ;)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>since its clear itll go with any type f vanity, even though its plastic it doesnt look cheap at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more to keep my studio organized...think I&#x27;ll go for a bigger size...</li>
            <li>While I do use this for most of my makeup, the compartments are not very big</li>
            <li>But it definitely made my counter space a lot better.</li>
            <li>I am able to store all of my everyday make up items (foundation, make up brushes, tweezers, comb, eyeshadow, mascara, eyeliner, bobby-pins, make up sponge, etc) easily.</li>
            <li>although the packaging does not say so, I think it may be acrylic (if not, it is a very nice hard plastic).  </li>
            <li>Great, holds all my brushes and small make up tubes!</li>
            <li>Comes in handy for jewelry making too: tools on top, jump rings, wire, gemstones, chains, fasteners in various other compartments.</li>
            <li>This fits perfectly on top of the 7-drawer acrylic organizer I bought and holds some of the larger brushes and cosmetic bottles that are too large for the drawers.</li>
            <li>I found this with positive reviews which I used</li>
            <li>You can fit a lot more brushes in the big middle space than in my pic,(I</li>
            <li>Mine holds 8 brushes in the large middle compartment (and could easily hold another 9 similarly---ranging from eyeshadow brush to powder brush).</li>
            <li>and it fits on my vanity nicely and keeps my mess of makeup together</li>
            <li>I bought this organizer a few weeks ago and I love it!</li>
            <li>Although I wish it was a little bigger, ( even if I had to pay more ) I love it.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I haven&#x27;t even wiped it down when cleaning my bathroom, as it doesn&#x27;t need it!  </li>
            <li>It looks great with any color bathroom and doesn&#x27;t look cheap, which I was afraid of.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to look for anything when I am getting ready.</li>
            <li>Helps organize my makeup very well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that much</li>
            <li>This keeps everything organized and looks much nicer than the makeup bag I had sitting in its place before.</li>
            <li>I recomment this product to anyone that wants to be organized.  </li>
            <li>none of them could fit in the bottom, i only got a concealer in there.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter space, but it can hold a lot of stuff.</li>
            <li>that is well designed and very functional.  </li>
            <li>It looks very neat on the shelf.</li>
            <li>Still can&#x27;t give it more than 2 stars for it looking all scratched and cracked when empty.</li>
            <li>I can reach for the handles of my jewelry making tools really fast</li>
            <li>Not meant for every item you have, but can fit your daily essentials.</li>
            <li>It fits on the corner of my table and doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and,</li>
            <li>I see this making my morning routine much easier.</li>
            <li>I oftentimes leave my go-to makeup all over the counter when I am rushing to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up too much space and the sides come in and out when needed.</li>
            <li>I really like the vanity organizer.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and this has really solved it.  </li>
            <li>Very helpfull.</li>
            <li>it will hold any brush, liner, etc securely in any of the different sized spaces.</li>
            <li>Over all, I am absolutely thrilled I bought this, much less clutter on my sink!</li>
            <li>Much smaller than I imagined, but very useful.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the compartments are different as far as how high the walls are for shorter or taller objects and the sizes of each compartment</li>
            <li>It was $5 more every other place I looked.</li>
            <li>It is kind of small.</li>
            <li>It seems very well constructed, and the retail packaging looks as if you would spend significantly more at a big box store for the same product.</li>
            <li>Has many different compartments in different sizes</li>
            <li>THE MAIN REASON</li>
            <li>Most of them are Mac and the space is deep enough to hold them upright.</li>
            <li>First off lemme say this thing seems small but holds so many brushes, eyeliners, ect.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I think it looks really high end</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li>This is a cute little organizer that serves</li>
            <li>I love this little organizer.</li>
            <li>Love this little thing.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the two little pop out drawers on the bottom.</li>
            <li>This was purchased as a gift for my 13 year old daughter who is really into her makeup.  </li>
            <li>It is petite (which I wanted, only wanted to store my daily make up, the rest of my make up is in the drawer), nicely constructed, and made of solid material.</li>
            <li>Nice thick acrylic.</li>
            <li>Also, I, being the clutz that I am, dropped it right after I opened it and discovered that the pull our drawers can actually pop out all the way if desired!</li>
            <li>The rest of this is divided up into sections of various widths with one central round deep holder that&#x27;s ideal for eye or lip pencils and mascaras.</li>
            <li>I can fit my lipsticks, and other things along that size, in the pull out compartments.</li>
            <li>and it still looks brand new.  </li>
            <li>I already put my everyday make-up brushes in them (with some crystal fillers at the bottom) and it looks amazing next to my acrylic make-up storage chests, my acrylic nail polish wall displays and my Vanity Mirror</li>
            <li>Have no drawers near sink, and top was always messy.  </li>
            <li>Plastic is thick &amp; very strong.</li>
            <li>Its cute but a bit small.</li>
            <li>and small enough to fit in a smaller size area, and easy to find everything.</li>
            <li>This little item held more than a BIG one I&#x27;ve had for years!!</li>
            <li>I bought this to go with the InterDesign Clear Drawers ([[ASIN:B008FX4NTI B008FX4NTI]] which store the rest of my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s clear, so</li>
            <li>They re in clear view</li>
            <li>Its clear</li>
            <li>I bought this to sit ontop of two InterDesign Clear Drawers.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s heavy and sturdy and all my cosmetics fit well in it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when i got it</li>
            <li>but it doesnt matter, I got rid of all of my old</li>
            <li>All other smaller products fit snugly in the front compartments.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t even imagine how much make-up, and brushes fit into this organizer and it takes up such a little amount of space!</li>
            <li>middle section is perfect for long brushes, but then it blocks the back section from view (if you have it against a wall).&lt;br /&gt;The bottom sections I found useless, unless you leave them open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice organizer for makeup or other small items (safety pins, buttons, nails, jewelry, etc.)</li>
            <li>if this organizer was a little taller my brushes wouldn&#x27;t be sliding left and right and sticking out too much.</li>
            <li>I recently bought new items.</li>
            <li>I use the pull out bottom for solo eyeshadows (like sample, deluxe sample, or individual sizes), the outer sections for nail polishes and other smaller stuff, and the middle section fits my dry shampoo</li>
            <li>I wish it had at least one open compartment on top that was deeper for brushes.</li>
            <li>Holds my brushes only in the middle really.</li>
            <li>I did keep a few lipsticks from Walgreens that are super bulky.</li>
            <li>Super heavy duty, holds a lot.</li>
            <li>This is a neat little organizer with vanity top appeal due to</li>
            <li>I do wish that the tallest compartment was in the back so that everything was visible at first glance, instead of it being in the middle blocking the back compartment.</li>
            <li>I searched and searched and there is no other make up organizer like this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I bought this initially for makeup purposes, but they went to my old address accidentally.</li>
            <li>the day before they had barely sent me an email saying that it was shipped...</li>
            <li>i was so surprised because it had said that it was only shipped the day before!!</li>
            <li>This will not work for full size products (unless small like lipstick, etc.)</li>
            <li>So if you have a few brushes and few lip sticks and few shadows and blushes, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t big enough to store much more than daily makeup, so if you have a lot of shadows or lipsticks and such this might be too small.</li>
            <li>I store a couple of eyeliner pencils and all of my brushes in the center (large powder, blush, blending, eyeliner, angled eyeliner, eye shadow, setting, with lots of room for more), then I keep a blush and a bronzer in one of the half-moon side sections, my mineral powder and small eye shadow quad in the other side, and then in the individual slots I keep mascaras, a gel eyeliner pot, a concealer stick, and lip balms/glosses.</li>
            <li>will fit well in the outer sections with my primer, foundation and concealer in the center and my eye shadows and blushes in one exapandable side and my setting powder and flat beautyblender in the other side.  </li>
            <li>The Organizer a little small, but it can store many things like brushes, lipsticks, eyeliners , mascara.</li>
            <li>Much smaller than expected, not sure what would even fit in this thing.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering two more, one for my other go-to brush set and the other for my everyday make-up.  </li>
            <li>This item is super small!</li>
            <li>not to big or to small fits in an area just right and has enough space for my makeup</li>
            <li>Makes me feel organized and all my brushes fit, some eyeliners, lipsticks and other small items.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who has a hard time keeping up with their cosmetics or are a tad messy :)</li>
            <li>I decided to use the expandable sections to store my brush cleaning materials (for everyday quick cleaning) in one side and my brush guards and extra wipes in the the other side.  </li>

            <li> Its a pretty good size too!</li>

            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I had been for a better way to organize my make up and bathroom and after looking at all reviews and products online and in store I found this.</li>
            <li> so I use it for a portable desk top essentials carrier</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up lot of space and stores so many things in there.</li>
            <li> I put brushes, primers, bb creams, highlighters, makeup tools, eye liners, and more.</li>
            <li> and I bought the SOHO Expandable Cylinder Vanity Acrylic Organizer and placed it on top of the InterDesign Drawers.</li>
            <li> Love this organizer.</li>

            <li> I use most o the time in it</li>
            <li> I received my SOHO Expandable Vanity Organizer today and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Also, it would be more convenient if the pull out compartments were deeper.</li>
            <li> I would like a square one better because some of the compartments are not visible when things are loaded in.</li>
            <li> All around a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for people who don&#x27;t have too much makeup.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to hold more then a small/travel size</li>
            <li> and I was not even able to use the wings for eye shadow compartments.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> it holds a lot more stuff</li>
            <li> This organizer is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but that is okay.</li>
            <li> It keeps everything so organized, which I love.</li>
            <li> so I am quite pleased all around.</li>
            <li> Is elegant and confortable.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> Now I have more room on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> i use most often.</li>
            <li> Im glad to consolidate my makeup obsession.</li>
            <li> I have one of  the expandable cyclinder&#x27;s sitting on top of each of the 3 drawer storage containers.  </li>
            <li> It is also very cute and looks good on my new makeup table.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed by how much this container can hold; my dresser top looks a lot neater thanks to this!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> and it has cleaned up my vanity area quite a bit and made the makeup I use most easy to find.</li>
            <li> Throughout the remainder I hold 2 bulky lipsticks, 2 slim lip glosses, 3 bulky eyeshadows, mascara, 2 eye liners (and I could easily add another 15 in that section), foundation, consealer and powder, and browbone powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am organized and pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for everything that I use often enough that I want it readily available.</li>
            <li> I love it and all my brushes have a space to fit now :)</li>
            <li> Nice heavy acrylic container, perfect addition to my vanity.</li>
            <li> Face cleansing pads fit perfectly in the middle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does it look fabulous, it holds everything perfectly!</li>
            <li> I can see everything easily and it&#x27;s all very accessible as well.</li>
            <li> It looks very cool on my vanity.  </li>
            <li> but it looks pretty nice filled with stuff!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really able to fit anything in them.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, my husband likes that its organized and doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan to check out some D.I.Y videos to see how I can creatively organize my items that didn&#x27;t fit (shadows, hd powder, primer).</li>
            <li> I really like it keeps my stuff good, but I just don&#x27;t like how my brushes stick out a lot maybe</li>
            <li> It is good for every day make up To be your make up more organized all the day and easy reach the specific kind of makeup</li>
            <li> Looks nicer than the picture as well, specially with stuff in it!</li>
            <li> the top is fine, i fit two foundation, two BB cream tubes, studio fix tube foundation, and all my brushes, it&#x27;ll do</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased it to put my makeup, I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day, but I do my hair every day sometimes more than once a day.</li>
            <li> The drawers seem a bit flimsy but overall good product!</li>
            <li> Keeps makeup organized and easy to find.</li>
            <li> it does store my tools neatly and within easy reach.</li>
            <li> so I can find it easily.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to see what&#x27;s in it, and that it&#x27;s acrylic</li>
            <li> And it makes application so easy, because of how I have organized things.</li>
            <li> so I can find what I m looking for easily.</li>
            <li> Many compartment and is easy to clean and wash out after ti starts to build up make up gunk.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty handy</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my vanity love the little drawers!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for small space and can store many makeup stuffs.</li>
            <li> The quality is fine, but I don&#x27;t like how the compartments are.</li>
            <li> This is awesome, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it because the picture made it look so small, and even though I looked at the measurements I just couldn&#x27;t picture it.  </li>
            <li> Now all my beauty products are organized and my dresser is super neat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this little acrylic makeup holder.</li>
            <li> But overall I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> My eye shadow brushes do fit in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for organizing makeup brushes, with several compartments</li>
            <li> It feels very sturdy and the acrylic is of nice quality.</li>
            <li> i thought it would fit all my makeup</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s important to me.</li>
            <li> FIT LOTS OF BRUSHES</li>
            <li> Fantastic use of space.</li>
            <li> I threw out all my cheap corner store stuff, and went to Nordstroms.</li>
            <li> But I have over 20 makeup brushes -- they all fit -- just finding the 1</li>
            <li> Overall, good organizer,  Attractive, durable clear plastic.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look at all cheap.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my everyday make up.</li>
            <li> Extra storage space is great wherever you find it, eh?&lt;br /&gt;Hubby loves it and that in itself speaks volumes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t fit any of my powder boxes/compacts/sets in here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a ton of makeup, or if they do, a place for just the daily stuff.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of space, so this particular one fit the bill!!</li>
            <li> It does hold more than the *normal* amount of makeup that you&#x27;d need for every day in a convenient spot, but if you have a lot of makeup that you want to organize, you may need more than one of these -  or an additional organizer.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me, all of my most essential makeup, along with brushed, is now organized and quickly found!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome little organizational tool for any bathroom!</li>
            <li> this ls exactly as advertised love it</li>
            <li> I have a small vanity and this is perfect to put it on there.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to buy, but it was worth the risk!</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trust me, it looks better in real life!</li>
            <li> I have decided after months of procrastination to finally clean up my make-up basket.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and cute, only thing is that I received it cracked at the bottom.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s transparent and clean look.</li>
            <li> I have to stick my foundation in the back (on a good day if they&#x27;ll fit),</li>
            <li> Has many compartments, looks good, works as expected.</li>
            <li> (I love clear acrylic because it is strong, easy to clean</li>
            <li> This little gadget is perfect for storing my daily makeup on the counter and keeping it organized and tidy yet easily accessible.</li>
            <li> The first time she saw it she said how much she really liked it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got my makeup done, verified that I loved the look, and bought all the necessary items.</li>
            <li> THUS, I am organized and good for the next year or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> The material is such great quality, actually looks kind of luxurious.</li>
            <li> I really was pleased.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> looks great with my other makeup holder.</li>
            <li> It streamlines my morning makeup routine because I can find everything quickly.</li>
            <li> The middle section was perfect for my coastal scents brushes as they have long handles, and the side sections are perfect for my bare essential brushes.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and arrived well packaged.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> It is actually really pretty in a way, the light reflects and makes a bit of a rainbow color at the edges.</li>
            <li> My bathroom vanity is so much more organized now, and I only have to move the one thing to clean the counter!</li>
            <li> after putting all my makeup into it i never realized how much i had and didn&#x27;t use!!</li>
            <li> I really like it!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> I was able to organize all of my make-up most easily except for putting things in those little pop out compartments on the bottom.</li>
            <li> It holds a lot more that expected, and I find it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Well-designed, and the compartments vary in size enough to fit all sorts of odds and ends--everything from brushes to bottles to foundations and more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid of knocking anything over</li>
            <li> and I love that its clear</li>
            <li> It looks really nice and gave me a lot of room for some brushes, ponytails, and smaller make up items.</li>
            <li> I love that it too is clear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty cool -</li>
            <li> anyways, it&#x27;s pretty cool looking..</li>
            <li> Definitely worth to get one.</li>
            <li> was well worth money paid for it.</li>
            <li> This is bigger than what I expected it to be, but it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> You can adjust the sides to fit in the corner of the counter top or open all the way.</li>
            <li> It is worth it for this alone.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s spots for brushes, eye shadows, lipsticks but not really any good space for my liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> I was surprised since it came very nicely packaged, but it was obvious that the cracks couldn&#x27;t have appeared when the product was shipped (it was packed in 3 boxes with a lot of cushioning around).</li>
            <li> I bought this because I don&#x27;t have a lot of space in my bathroom and wanted something to fit on the toilet tank top.  </li>
            <li> Now only if they could find a way to also clean my bushes. :-)</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted to keep my brushes, and other makeup tools in a neat and organized manner..very good to have as a makeup artist....</li>
            <li> Holds all of my make up in one place, now I have it right at hand.  </li>
            <li> Great product for storing small makeup items.</li>
            <li> Works great for small places</li>
            <li> This container sits perfectly on my desk, but I wish the side drawers were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I bought it, because I haven&#x27;t found anything better, but it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li> I would definitely suggest this to anyone who has a lot of makeup brushes and wants to organize them nicely.</li>
            <li> The trimmer and attachments fit well in the top, the instructions go in one of the bottom compartments, and that leaves one empty bottom compartment for...</li>
            <li> The bottom tier is split in two sections that open out to store flatter items like eye primer tubes or single shadow pans; this is nice because this tier adds storage capacity without taking up additional precious counter space.</li>
            <li> Durable but waay Smaller than I envisioned.. wouldnt pay more than $10.00 for this.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> ok, thought it would be bigger.</li>
            <li> It is not too big, so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on my counter, which is great especially because I&#x27;ll be taking it to my dorm with me.</li>
            <li> I need to invest in more of these, with different size sections.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to organize my makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very neat!</li>
            <li> Exactly what&#x27;s in description.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need it to.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Who wants to receive a cracked item they paid for?!</li>
            <li> Besides, Im sure your bathroom has enough color ;)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> since its clear itll go with any type f vanity, even though its plastic it doesnt look cheap at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more to keep my studio organized...think I&#x27;ll go for a bigger size...</li>
            <li> While I do use this for most of my makeup, the compartments are not very big</li>
            <li> But it definitely made my counter space a lot better.</li>
            <li> I am able to store all of my everyday make up items (foundation, make up brushes, tweezers, comb, eyeshadow, mascara, eyeliner, bobby-pins, make up sponge, etc) easily.</li>
            <li> although the packaging does not say so, I think it may be acrylic (if not, it is a very nice hard plastic).  </li>
            <li> Great, holds all my brushes and small make up tubes!</li>
            <li> Comes in handy for jewelry making too: tools on top, jump rings, wire, gemstones, chains, fasteners in various other compartments.</li>
            <li> This fits perfectly on top of the 7-drawer acrylic organizer I bought and holds some of the larger brushes and cosmetic bottles that are too large for the drawers.</li>
            <li> I found this with positive reviews which I used</li>
            <li> You can fit a lot more brushes in the big middle space than in my pic,(I</li>
            <li> Mine holds 8 brushes in the large middle compartment (and could easily hold another 9 similarly---ranging from eyeshadow brush to powder brush).</li>
            <li> and it fits on my vanity nicely and keeps my mess of makeup together</li>
            <li> I bought this organizer a few weeks ago and I love it!</li>
            <li> Although I wish it was a little bigger, ( even if I had to pay more ) I love it.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I haven&#x27;t even wiped it down when cleaning my bathroom, as it doesn&#x27;t need it!  </li>
            <li> It looks great with any color bathroom and doesn&#x27;t look cheap, which I was afraid of.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to look for anything when I am getting ready.</li>
            <li> Helps organize my makeup very well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that much</li>
            <li> This keeps everything organized and looks much nicer than the makeup bag I had sitting in its place before.</li>
            <li> I recomment this product to anyone that wants to be organized.  </li>
            <li> none of them could fit in the bottom, i only got a concealer in there.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter space, but it can hold a lot of stuff.</li>
            <li> that is well designed and very functional.  </li>
            <li> It looks very neat on the shelf.</li>
            <li> Still can&#x27;t give it more than 2 stars for it looking all scratched and cracked when empty.</li>
            <li> I can reach for the handles of my jewelry making tools really fast</li>
            <li> Not meant for every item you have, but can fit your daily essentials.</li>
            <li> It fits on the corner of my table and doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and,</li>
            <li> I see this making my morning routine much easier.</li>
            <li> I oftentimes leave my go-to makeup all over the counter when I am rushing to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up too much space and the sides come in and out when needed.</li>
            <li> I really like the vanity organizer.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and this has really solved it.  </li>
            <li> Very helpfull.</li>
            <li> it will hold any brush, liner, etc securely in any of the different sized spaces.</li>
            <li> Over all, I am absolutely thrilled I bought this, much less clutter on my sink!</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I imagined, but very useful.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the compartments are different as far as how high the walls are for shorter or taller objects and the sizes of each compartment</li>
            <li> It was $5 more every other place I looked.</li>
            <li> It is kind of small.</li>
            <li> It seems very well constructed, and the retail packaging looks as if you would spend significantly more at a big box store for the same product.</li>
            <li> Has many different compartments in different sizes</li>
            <li> THE MAIN REASON</li>
            <li> Most of them are Mac and the space is deep enough to hold them upright.</li>
            <li> First off lemme say this thing seems small but holds so many brushes, eyeliners, ect.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I think it looks really high end</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li> This is a cute little organizer that serves</li>
            <li> I love this little organizer.</li>
            <li> Love this little thing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the two little pop out drawers on the bottom.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my 13 year old daughter who is really into her makeup.  </li>
            <li> It is petite (which I wanted, only wanted to store my daily make up, the rest of my make up is in the drawer), nicely constructed, and made of solid material.</li>
            <li> Nice thick acrylic.</li>
            <li> Also, I, being the clutz that I am, dropped it right after I opened it and discovered that the pull our drawers can actually pop out all the way if desired!</li>
            <li> The rest of this is divided up into sections of various widths with one central round deep holder that&#x27;s ideal for eye or lip pencils and mascaras.</li>
            <li> I can fit my lipsticks, and other things along that size, in the pull out compartments.</li>
            <li> and it still looks brand new.  </li>
            <li> I already put my everyday make-up brushes in them (with some crystal fillers at the bottom) and it looks amazing next to my acrylic make-up storage chests, my acrylic nail polish wall displays and my Vanity Mirror</li>
            <li> Have no drawers near sink, and top was always messy.  </li>
            <li> Plastic is thick &amp; very strong.</li>
            <li> Its cute but a bit small.</li>
            <li> and small enough to fit in a smaller size area, and easy to find everything.</li>
            <li> This little item held more than a BIG one I&#x27;ve had for years!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with the InterDesign Clear Drawers ([[ASIN:B008FX4NTI B008FX4NTI]] which store the rest of my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s clear, so</li>
            <li> They re in clear view</li>
            <li> Its clear</li>
            <li> I bought this to sit ontop of two InterDesign Clear Drawers.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s heavy and sturdy and all my cosmetics fit well in it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when i got it</li>
            <li> but it doesnt matter, I got rid of all of my old</li>
            <li> All other smaller products fit snugly in the front compartments.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even imagine how much make-up, and brushes fit into this organizer and it takes up such a little amount of space!</li>
            <li> middle section is perfect for long brushes, but then it blocks the back section from view (if you have it against a wall).&lt;br /&gt;The bottom sections I found useless, unless you leave them open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice organizer for makeup or other small items (safety pins, buttons, nails, jewelry, etc.)</li>
            <li> if this organizer was a little taller my brushes wouldn&#x27;t be sliding left and right and sticking out too much.</li>
            <li> I recently bought new items.</li>
            <li> I use the pull out bottom for solo eyeshadows (like sample, deluxe sample, or individual sizes), the outer sections for nail polishes and other smaller stuff, and the middle section fits my dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I wish it had at least one open compartment on top that was deeper for brushes.</li>
            <li> Holds my brushes only in the middle really.</li>
            <li> I did keep a few lipsticks from Walgreens that are super bulky.</li>
            <li> Super heavy duty, holds a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a neat little organizer with vanity top appeal due to</li>
            <li> I do wish that the tallest compartment was in the back so that everything was visible at first glance, instead of it being in the middle blocking the back compartment.</li>
            <li> I searched and searched and there is no other make up organizer like this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this initially for makeup purposes, but they went to my old address accidentally.</li>
            <li> the day before they had barely sent me an email saying that it was shipped...</li>
            <li> i was so surprised because it had said that it was only shipped the day before!!</li>
            <li> This will not work for full size products (unless small like lipstick, etc.)</li>
            <li> So if you have a few brushes and few lip sticks and few shadows and blushes, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t big enough to store much more than daily makeup, so if you have a lot of shadows or lipsticks and such this might be too small.</li>
            <li> I store a couple of eyeliner pencils and all of my brushes in the center (large powder, blush, blending, eyeliner, angled eyeliner, eye shadow, setting, with lots of room for more), then I keep a blush and a bronzer in one of the half-moon side sections, my mineral powder and small eye shadow quad in the other side, and then in the individual slots I keep mascaras, a gel eyeliner pot, a concealer stick, and lip balms/glosses.</li>
            <li> will fit well in the outer sections with my primer, foundation and concealer in the center and my eye shadows and blushes in one exapandable side and my setting powder and flat beautyblender in the other side.  </li>
            <li> The Organizer a little small, but it can store many things like brushes, lipsticks, eyeliners , mascara.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected, not sure what would even fit in this thing.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering two more, one for my other go-to brush set and the other for my everyday make-up.  </li>
            <li> This item is super small!</li>
            <li> not to big or to small fits in an area just right and has enough space for my makeup</li>
            <li> Makes me feel organized and all my brushes fit, some eyeliners, lipsticks and other small items.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has a hard time keeping up with their cosmetics or are a tad messy :)</li>
            <li> I decided to use the expandable sections to store my brush cleaning materials (for everyday quick cleaning) in one side and my brush guards and extra wipes in the the other side.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the small price!</li>
            <li> as the item is small, but it will hold makeup brushes, eyeliner, mascara, and all the other *little* odds and ends that would otherwise get lost in the abyss most people call a &amp;#34;drawer.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It takes up alot less room than my old makeup organizer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mainly to store my makeup brushes, although I also put a few other items in here such as eyeliner pencils and my eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> Plus the line I bought goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not extremely lightweight, it has a slight heaviness to it which makes it sturdy when placed on a surface.</li>
            <li> certain things dont fit properly since its round and could be awkward for square shaped compacts, but all makeup comes in weird containers sometimes.it really helped organize my makeup.</li>
            <li> Not normal sized make up.</li>
            <li> size loose powders.</li>
            <li> I had various small bags and makeup tucked in various cupboards.</li>
            <li> It fits all of my long brushes in the middle compartment, and I have quite a few of them.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was fed up with my crap everywhere all the way past my sink n over into &amp;#34;his side&amp;#34; with his sink lol.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was causing a huge cluttery mess and the husband wasn&#x27;t the biggest fan.</li>
            <li> and it was a little bit smaller than I thought, but fits all my lipsticks/lipgloss and brushes.</li>
            <li> Do wish it was a little bigger though.</li>
            <li> I use it daily to store my little bits and it hasn&#x27;t chipped or warped or even discolored.  </li>
            <li> I do think that there is a spot on the back that had space to be a little drawer</li>
            <li> Yes its a hard clear plastic.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to keep the ugly box on top of my dresser.</li>
            <li> In the center I have 6 lip glosses, 2 eyebrow pencils and an eyeshadow brush standing up.</li>
            <li> In the center I keep my brush and hair comb.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I threw the packaging right away</li>
            <li> I like the organization aspect of this vanity (and that it&#x27;s a clear plastic), but I found some of sections too shallow for my brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will give the star back since it really is not their fault for the small size in the wings.  </li>
            <li> The bottom two sections are too small for multiple items of makeup</li>
            <li> I use a ton of tools with handles plus I have a lot of small office items like pens and such.</li>
            <li> I use this to organize paint, brushes, glitter, glue and other items while crafting.</li>
            <li> I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for Mrs Tex,along with other styles, and she just loves them.</li>
            <li> The the other compartments I keep hair ties, and bobby pins.</li>
            <li> It does hold alot of items, but it really only holds 2 face powders (one in each drawer) or small lotion containor.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not spin or rotate, so you have to manually turn it to get to the items on the other side.  </li>
            <li> But overall does the trick for now at least.</li>
            <li> After all, if I am going to set it down on the counter anyway, I might as well set it down 3 inches farther up into a neat little compartment.</li>
            <li> This is a less pricey version of an organizer I had my eye on for awhile.</li>
            <li> Slightly deeper drawers would make this a 5 star item.</li>
            <li> I was worried it&#x27;d look a little junky on my vanity</li>
            <li> She loves the design and all the little cubbies to put her makeup in.</li>
            <li> and I use both for all of my tools and lots of other small things I need beside me when I&#x27;m making jewelry.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend, so she could have a little bit of organization for her vanity.</li>
            <li> put some little hair combs in there, but who knows.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this little makeup organizer to eliminate my need to leave my makeup scattered everywhere.</li>
            <li> Hold my brushes and all the little things.</li>
            <li> I keep qtips and floss picks in the little side drawers and makeup in the rest</li>
            <li> I like how it has two little boxes in the bottom</li>
            <li> I use the drawers for my blushes, other than that they are sort of pointless.</li>
            <li> used a shot glass to hold my two fave brushes tighter) and with little beads(craft store)</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t take up a lot of space, but they hold all my everyday stuff.  </li>
            <li> I use this to store my everyday makeup like (foundation, blush, eyeliner, mascara, lipgloss,, etc</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of make-up, get something else because this will not fit a lot of things.</li>
            <li> , dont waste your money on this</li>
            <li> It was SO frustrating to find the one thing I needed under the heap of misc items on the end tables, especially when I was in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Can hold quite a few.</li>
            <li> It stores a lot of brushes, in a few stand-up compartments, so it&#x27;s a little hard to keep them organized.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this little organizer!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> And if its too small, you can always order another one</li>
            <li> Small and compact.  </li>
            <li> I use it for small desk accessories.</li>
            <li> so can hold small charms, metal items, even sand or torn paper.</li>
            <li> Has suprising a lot of space for things for being as small as it is.</li>
            <li> and it could be small</li>
            <li> no more opening drawers and causing messes.</li>
            <li> Small yet holds a lot.</li>
            <li> Why it is so hard to sweep my makeup into my makeup drawer, I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
            <li> If you like MAC products they DO NOT FIT in here!!</li>
            <li> ( not an ad, seriously)</li>
            <li> It keeps all those annoying little things off my counter but also away from getting mixed up and broken in the drawer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this for months now</li>
            <li> i have never been so organized and finding my tools and makeup is no longer a pecking game.</li>
            <li> Are you tired of seeing makeup all over the countertop?</li>
            <li> I hated having my daily things all over the bathroom counter</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not perfect for all of my makeup</li>
            <li> They are a bit tedious to deal with in getting stuff in and out.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I have already ran out of space</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my base</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This thing is awesome! I was looking for something to put all of my Birchbox samples in and this works perfectly. This will not work for full size products (unless small like lipstick, etc.) as the item is small, but it will hold makeup brushes, eyeliner, mascara, and all the other *little* odds and ends that would otherwise get lost in the abyss most people call a &amp;#34;drawer.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Has many compartments, looks good, works as expected. Love that it is transparent. I like the sliding compartments where I store erasers and such.Compact as well.</li>
            <li> Holds all of my make up in one place, now I have it right at hand.  Don&#x27;t have to look for anything when I am getting ready.</li>
            <li> Love it! I was worried it&#x27;d look a little junky on my vanity but it looks pretty nice filled with stuff! Wish it was bigger though.</li>
            <li> Great makeup organizer! Its made with really great quality as well! I would definitely recommend to buy!</li>
            <li> Got one today from Wal-Mart (cheaper)..... love it</li>
            <li> I wish I gotten a larger one but functions perfectly</li>
            <li> Keeps makeup organized and easy to find.</li>
            <li> Lovee itt ! Beautiful, Perfect for Brushes and small eyeshadows</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved it</li>
            <li> Super impressed with this organizer! It works perfectly for make-up storage/organization and fits SOOO much in it. Well-designed, and the compartments vary in size enough to fit all sorts of odds and ends--everything from brushes to bottles to foundations and more. Finding everything I need for my morning routine has never been so easy--thank you, organization gods!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this along with two of the InterDesign 3 Drawer Storage Organizers, and these products are a match made in heaven. The cylinder vanity fits perfectly across the top of the two drawer organizers, and all of my make-up is finally in one place. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things I&#x27;ve ever gotten on Amazon, I love this!!</li>
            <li> These are great!  They don&#x27;t take up a lot of space, but they hold all my everyday stuff.  My bathroom vanity is so much more organized now, and I only have to move the one thing to clean the counter!</li>
            <li> Perfect for makeup organization</li>
            <li> I wish it had at least one open compartment on top that was deeper for brushes. it does store my tools neatly and within easy reach. I&#x27;m not afraid of knocking anything over and I can see everything. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> I love this organizer! It is perfect for all my makeup, but I still leave some of my stuff that I don&#x27;t use as often in a different bag. This container sits perfectly on my desk, but I wish the side drawers were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> It is kind of small. My eye shadow brushes do fit in it.</li>
            <li> This fits perfectly on top of the 7-drawer acrylic organizer I bought and holds some of the larger brushes and cosmetic bottles that are too large for the drawers. Looks great and the quality is also very good. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Durable but waay Smaller than I envisioned.. wouldnt pay more than $10.00 for this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this little organizer!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s soo cute and I love that its clear so I can see my makeup! I use this to store my everyday makeup like (foundation, blush, eyeliner, mascara, lipgloss,, etc) It is a miniature organizer but hey! It can store ALOT of stuff. And if its too small, you can always order another one it&#x27;s only 15 bucks! I would totally recommend this to anyone!!!!! Great organizer!!!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Has many different compartments in different sizes so it&#x27;s not perfect for all of my makeup but I made it work and it has cleaned up my vanity area quite a bit and made the makeup I use most easy to find.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mainly to store my makeup brushes, although I also put a few other items in here such as eyeliner pencils and my eyelash curler.  It&#x27;s great for organizing makeup brushes, with several compartments so I can separate the brushes I use daily from the ones I only use on occasion.  The drawers are pretty small and don&#x27;t store much, but I have a few items in them.  I bought this to go with the InterDesign Clear Drawers ([[ASIN:B008FX4NTI B008FX4NTI]] which store the rest of my makeup.  The SOHO organizer fits perfectly on top, and the whole system looks great and is very easy to find what I&#x27;m looking for!</li>
            <li> Good quality product. Nice thick acrylic.</li>
            <li> this ls exactly as advertised love it</li>
            <li> Great, holds all my brushes and small make up tubes! Saves my bathrooms organization.</li>
            <li> Helps organize my makeup very well</li>
            <li> This item is super small! If you have a lot of make-up, get something else because this will not fit a lot of things.</li>
            <li> I like the organization aspect of this vanity (and that it&#x27;s a clear plastic), but I found some of sections too shallow for my brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The middle section is perfect for long brushes, but then it blocks the back section from view (if you have it against a wall).&lt;br /&gt;The bottom sections I found useless, unless you leave them open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I bought it, because I haven&#x27;t found anything better, but it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li> Love it. Keeps everything in its place.</li>
            <li> I had been for a better way to organize my make up and bathroom and after looking at all reviews and products online and in store I found this. It looks really nice and gave me a lot of room for some brushes, ponytails, and smaller make up items. Looks nicer than the picture as well, specially with stuff in it!</li>
            <li> ok, thought it would be bigger. didn&#x27;t work out for cosmetics so I use it for a portable desk top essentials carrier</li>
            <li> This is not a product for people that own a lot of make a products. I don&#x27;t have that much and it was a little bit smaller than I thought, but fits all my lipsticks/lipgloss and brushes. The bottom compartment has enough space for my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> It fits a lot of stuff in it and helps me organize all my make-up and things. I use the pull out bottom for solo eyeshadows (like sample, deluxe sample, or individual sizes), the outer sections for nail polishes and other smaller stuff, and the middle section fits my dry shampoo perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very awesome, and the clear plastic lets you either leave it as is to see everything or decorate it to your liking.</li>
            <li> Item we&#x27;ll describe, wife like it. Was a gift as addition to a vanity and makeup furniture, great buy...Juan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear holder with bottom closable tray</li>
            <li> smaller than i thought but serves its purpose</li>
            <li> Perfect! I have so much makeup, and all of my most used things fit perfectly in it! It is not too big, so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on my counter, which is great especially because I&#x27;ll be taking it to my dorm with me. Also, I, being the clutz that I am, dropped it right after I opened it and discovered that the pull our drawers can actually pop out all the way if desired! Excellent purchase, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a cute little organizer that serves it&#x27;s purpose.  I need to invest in more of these, with different size sections.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for everything that I use often enough that I want it readily available. I store a couple of eyeliner pencils and all of my brushes in the center (large powder, blush, blending, eyeliner, angled eyeliner, eye shadow, setting, with lots of room for more), then I keep a blush and a bronzer in one of the half-moon side sections, my mineral powder and small eye shadow quad in the other side, and then in the individual slots I keep mascaras, a gel eyeliner pot, a concealer stick, and lip balms/glosses. It feels very sturdy and the acrylic is of nice quality. This keeps everything organized and looks much nicer than the makeup bag I had sitting in its place before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this little acrylic makeup holder. The bottom tier is split in two sections that open out to store flatter items like eye primer tubes or single shadow pans; this is nice because this tier adds storage capacity without taking up additional precious counter space. The rest of this is divided up into sections of various widths with one central round deep holder that&#x27;s ideal for eye or lip pencils and mascaras. I was impressed by how much this container can hold; my dresser top looks a lot neater thanks to this!</li>
            <li> This little gadget is perfect for storing my daily makeup on the counter and keeping it organized and tidy yet easily accessible. It isn&#x27;t big enough to store much more than daily makeup, so if you have a lot of shadows or lipsticks and such this might be too small.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I don&#x27;t have a lot of space in my bathroom and wanted something to fit on the toilet tank top.  This fits perfect.  I can open up the arms and fully use all the compartments with no problem.  It keeps things organized and i don&#x27;t have to go searching for anything at the bottom of a bag.</li>
            <li> This fits my face and eye creams perfectly so that I can leave everything ORGANIZED on my bathroom counter and not have to dig through my cabinets or drawers.</li>
            <li> I love this organizer!  This is another great product to have to keep items organized.  I use it in my bathroom for my makeup brushes and things of that nature!  It holds a lot ot items too!  I love that it too is clear and you can see everything that you have in there!  I love products that help keep me organized and things in their place!  I recomment this product to anyone that wants to be organized.  Great product and thank you!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for small space and can store many makeup stuffs. I have a small vanity and this is perfect to put it on there. It doesn&#x27;t take up lot of space and stores so many things in there. I put brushes, primers, bb creams, highlighters, makeup tools, eye liners, and more. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I have decided after months of procrastination to finally clean up my make-up basket. I found this with positive reviews which I used and I bought the SOHO Expandable Cylinder Vanity Acrylic Organizer and placed it on top of the InterDesign Drawers. Perfect! It&#x27;s so neat now!</li>
            <li> I use this to organize my vanity and it works great. It keeps things uncluttered and close at hand. I am think of buying another one.</li>
            <li> Love this organizer. It was $5 more every other place I looked. Great deal!</li>
            <li> This is a less pricey version of an organizer I had my eye on for awhile. I&#x27;m very impressed with how many products it can hold and still stay without easy reach. It streamlines my morning makeup routine because I can find everything quickly. Now only if they could find a way to also clean my bushes. :-)</li>
            <li> It is good for every day make up To be your make up more organized all the day and easy reach the specific kind of makeup</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my 13 year old daughter who is really into her makeup.  She loves the design and all the little cubbies to put her makeup in. It does hold more than the *normal* amount of makeup that you&#x27;d need for every day in a convenient spot, but if you have a lot of makeup that you want to organize, you may need more than one of these -  or an additional organizer.</li>
            <li> i have never been so organized and finding my tools and makeup is no longer a pecking game. recommend. size fits well on my vanity.</li>
            <li> If you like MAC products they DO NOT FIT in here!! No blushes, no powder, studio tech, bronzer, none of them could fit in the bottom, i only got a concealer in there. the top is fine, i fit two foundation, two BB cream tubes, studio fix tube foundation, and all my brushes, it&#x27;ll do but im just going to get a cosmocube, dont waste your money on this</li>
            <li> gave this to my daughter for her 18th bday and she loves it.  it keeps all her make up organized just the way she likes it.</li>
            <li> not to big or to small fits in an area just right and has enough space for my makeup</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it. Small and compact.  Not for those who have a TON of makeup.</li>
            <li> Not too big and it fits on my vanity nicely and keeps my mess of makeup together, It looks really nice.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to organize my makeup. It doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter space, but it can hold a lot of stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this organizer a few weeks ago and I love it! The bottom two sections are too small for multiple items of makeup so I ended up just putting in cotton balls and Q-tips. The middle section was perfect for my coastal scents brushes as they have long handles, and the side sections are perfect for my bare essential brushes. I would definitely suggest this to anyone who has a lot of makeup brushes and wants to organize them nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this initially for makeup purposes, but they went to my old address accidentally. By the time I got them I had found a solution for makeup, so I use them at my desk to organize various office items. It&#x27;s really pretty cool - I can see what I need and it keeps everything tidy. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> the day before they had barely sent me an email saying that it was shipped...i was like woooow they said it would be at my doorstep the next day too...turns out it actually was!!! well not literally, as i was pulling my car out the delivery truck gave it to me!! i was so surprised because it had said that it was only shipped the day before!! anyways, it&#x27;s pretty cool looking..i thought it would fit all my makeup but it didn&#x27;t..after putting all my makeup into it i never realized how much i had and didn&#x27;t use!! but it is pretty handy</li>
            <li> This is a nice organizer for makeup or other small items (safety pins, buttons, nails, jewelry, etc.) that is well designed and very functional.  There are side drawers that easily open and close to ensure that your valuables don&#x27;t get lost.  I think the size is perfect.  My only complaint is that it does not spin or rotate, so you have to manually turn it to get to the items on the other side.  The price is great.  I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product for storing small makeup items.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and compartments. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not extremely lightweight, it has a slight heaviness to it which makes it sturdy when placed on a surface. It&#x27;s very neat! Exactly what&#x27;s in description. I really like it!! 😁</li>
            <li> The Organizer a little small, but it can store many things like brushes, lipsticks, eyeliners , mascara. If you don&#x27;t have enough space it will look perfect.</li>
            <li> Perfect design and good quality. Definitely worth to get one. ( not an ad, seriously) the one u never wanna miss</li>
            <li> This was one of the greatest space-saving decisions I have made. Love it!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need it to.  It totally cleared up my vanity and everything is in its place so I can find it easily.  I might get a second one.</li>
            <li> It was easy to assemble and it was beautiful. was well worth money paid for it. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This organizer fits all of my cosmetics plus some.  It looks very cool on my vanity.  The drawers close or they can open for added storage.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a hard time keeping up with their cosmetics or are a tad messy :)</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;ve been very nice had it not arrived cracked in 6 places. I was surprised since it came very nicely packaged, but it was obvious that the cracks couldn&#x27;t have appeared when the product was shipped (it was packed in 3 boxes with a lot of cushioning around). So... It was packed and shipped cracked to me. Unfortunately, I threw the packaging right away so I can&#x27;t return it. Otherwise, it&#x27;s heavy and sturdy and all my cosmetics fit well in it. It looks very neat on the shelf. Still can&#x27;t give it more than 2 stars for it looking all scratched and cracked when empty.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Love it!</li>
            <li> This organizer was so PERFECT for me that I bought another one just after I got the first one and I use both for all of my tools and lots of other small things I need beside me when I&#x27;m making jewelry. I use a ton of tools with handles plus I have a lot of small office items like pens and such. It was SO frustrating to find the one thing I needed under the heap of misc items on the end tables, especially when I was in a hurry. I love being able to see everything before I reach for them. I can reach for the handles of my jewelry making tools really fast and that&#x27;s important to me. I love the fact that the compartments are different as far as how high the walls are for shorter or taller objects and the sizes of each compartment so I can organize quite well. It has two drawers at the bottom so I can pull the drawers out to open them and the compartments are a lot larger than I thought they were! It&#x27;s well worth the small price!</li>
            <li> This is bigger than what I expected it to be, but it&#x27;s awesome. I love it and all my brushes have a space to fit now :)</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Love everything about this. It fits all my every day makeup necessities perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love this. You can adjust the sides to fit in the corner of the counter top or open all the way. Fits my stuff perfectly.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be smaller but perfect size!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very pretty. I use it for small desk accessories.</li>
            <li> I use this to organize paint, brushes, glitter, glue and other items while crafting. I like that it&#x27;s clear, so it&#x27;s easy to see what&#x27;s in it, and that it&#x27;s acrylic so can hold small charms, metal items, even sand or torn paper. Comes in handy for jewelry making too: tools on top, jump rings, wire, gemstones, chains, fasteners in various other compartments. I now consider this item THE must-have on my craft table.</li>
            <li> A+ FOR SHIPPING NICELY PACKED NO CRACKS FIT LOTS OF BRUSHES THATS THE MAIN REASON I BOUGHT IT I STACKED LOOKS NICE EASY ACCESS TO MY STUFF</li>
            <li> I was nervous to buy, but it was worth the risk! looks great with my other makeup holder. Shipped quickly and arrived well packaged.</li>
            <li> I received the item within two days of purchasing. It&#x27;s nice and cute, only thing is that I received it cracked at the bottom. Not too happy about that! Who wants to receive a cracked item they paid for?!</li>
            <li> The quality is fine, but I don&#x27;t like how the compartments are. I wasn&#x27;t really able to fit anything in them.</li>
            <li> Perfectly designed!  A place for my daily tools.</li>
            <li> Keeps my make-up well organized.</li>
            <li> Love this and use as makeup storage for my brushes, primers, tweezers, etc.  Very good quality and so cute on my counter.  Would definitely recommend this product and would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Fantastic use of space. Its perfect to hold many brushes as well as makeup items tools and look neat and stylish</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It holds all my makeup, because I decided to keep things simple. I threw out all my cheap corner store stuff, and went to Nordstroms. I got my makeup done, verified that I loved the look, and bought all the necessary items. Then I just had a department store bag, and wanted something efficient. I came online and BEHOLD. This holds everything from my blush to brushes to my foundation. I did keep a few lipsticks from Walgreens that are super bulky. I love it. Now my makeup takes up the counterspace of my two palms together. And it makes application so easy, because of how I have organized things. Most importantly, my husband likes that its organized and doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So should you buy it? I say yes. Mine holds 8 brushes in the large middle compartment (and could easily hold another 9 similarly---ranging from eyeshadow brush to powder brush). Throughout the remainder I hold 2 bulky lipsticks, 2 slim lip glosses, 3 bulky eyeshadows, mascara, 2 eye liners (and I could easily add another 15 in that section), foundation, consealer and powder, and browbone powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am organized and pleased. Its also helped me see that I honestly have all that I need and don&#x27;t need anymore makeup. I threw out quiet a bit as I organized this. I had various small bags and makeup tucked in various cupboards. Plus the line I bought goes a long way. THUS, I am organized and good for the next year or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No it doesn&#x27;t spin. Yes its a hard clear plastic. But it is functional. Besides, Im sure your bathroom has enough color ;)</li>
            <li> This organizer is the BEST ever. The material is such great quality, actually looks kind of luxurious. I use this to store lipgloss, chubby sticks, eyeliners and eye pencils. I have bought another one for my brushes. I really LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Cute! I love the way my makeup looks in this. Not meant for every item you have, but can fit your daily essentials. Slightly deeper drawers would make this a 5 star item.</li>
            <li> I love this little organizer. It fits on the corner of my table and doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all. I have 24 of my favorite lipsticks on the top. Most of them are Mac and the space is deep enough to hold them upright. It is worth it for this alone. In the center I have 6 lip glosses, 2 eyebrow pencils and an eyeshadow brush standing up. I haven&#x27;t used the bottom pull out spaces and don&#x27;t need them. Any one who wears make up needs this and will appreciate it no end.</li>
            <li> great product, great service!</li>
            <li> This is a neat little organizer with vanity top appeal due to it&#x27;s transparent and clean look. I was able to organize all of my make-up most easily except for putting things in those little pop out compartments on the bottom. They are a bit tedious to deal with in getting stuff in and out. I might get another one soon as I am sure I will have more things to put away.</li>
            <li> Holds so many products!! Nice heavy acrylic container, perfect addition to my vanity.</li>
            <li> Cute and reliable, durable. Makes me feel organized and all my brushes fit, some eyeliners, lipsticks and other small items.</li>
            <li> I love it so much! Now all my beauty products are organized and my dresser is super neat! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It stores a lot of brushes, in a few stand-up compartments, so it&#x27;s a little hard to keep them organized.  But I have over 20 makeup brushes -- they all fit -- just finding the 1 I&#x27;m looking for is a bit of a trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the 2 bottom, swing-out compartments.  I fill them with cotton squares &amp; q-tips.  Overall, good organizer,  Attractive, durable clear plastic.  Looks high-end.  Plastic is thick &amp; very strong.</li>
            <li> Great For makeup and brushes</li>
            <li> Are you tired of seeing makeup all over the countertop? I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for Mrs Tex,along with other styles, and she just loves them. It doesn&#x27;t look at all cheap. Initially it sat in its box unopened, I put it on the vanity. The first time she saw it she said how much she really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, it looks better in real life!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks</li>
            <li> It is cute and practical.The pull out tray is not as tall as I has hoped.  My only regret is that I did not purchase the larger organizer.</li>
            <li> Loove! Perfect for my everyday make up. I keep the make up I use most o the time in it</li>
            <li> Holds my brushes only in the middle really. Can hold quite a few. I put eyeliners and mascaras in the second tier, and ones I don&#x27;t use as often to the back. The drawers hold my tweezers.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me, all of my most essential makeup, along with brushed, is now organized and quickly found!</li>
            <li> Works great for small places</li>
            <li> It is well made, a good price, and it is great to see where I have put everything.  Face cleansing pads fit perfectly in the middle.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh! Love this little thing. You can&#x27;t even imagine how much make-up, and brushes fit into this organizer and it takes up such a little amount of space! Great little item and great as a gift!</li>
            <li> It fits all my makeup and it looks great! i love all the storage places and it looks great sitting anywhere!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend, so she could have a little bit of organization for her vanity. It seems very well constructed, and the retail packaging looks as if you would spend significantly more at a big box store for the same product.</li>
            <li> I received my SOHO Expandable Vanity Organizer today and I love it.  It is very sturdy and, although the packaging does not say so, I think it may be acrylic (if not, it is a very nice hard plastic).  I already put my everyday make-up brushes in them (with some crystal fillers at the bottom) and it looks amazing next to my acrylic make-up storage chests, my acrylic nail polish wall displays and my Vanity Mirror (I love clear acrylic because it is strong, easy to clean and I can see everything without having to search).  I decided to use the expandable sections to store my brush cleaning materials (for everyday quick cleaning) in one side and my brush guards and extra wipes in the the other side.  I will be ordering two more, one for my other go-to brush set and the other for my everyday make-up.  I think some of my go-to lipsticks, lip glosses, eyeliners, mascaras, etc. will fit well in the outer sections with my primer, foundation and concealer in the center and my eye shadows and blushes in one exapandable side and my setting powder and flat beautyblender in the other side.  I see this making my morning routine much easier.</li>
            <li> Love it. I was surprised when i got it.. doesn&#x27;t even look like plastic... Super heavy duty, holds a lot. Fits perfectly on my vanity love the little drawers!</li>
            <li> I use this organizer for  my make-up.  It holds a lot more that expected, and I find it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I got this to hold my husband&#x27;s Groomsman set, since the tray that comes with it is pitiful.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it look fabulous, it holds everything perfectly! The trimmer and attachments fit well in the top, the instructions go in one of the bottom compartments, and that leaves one empty bottom compartment for...ME!&lt;br /&gt;I put some little hair combs in there, but who knows. Extra storage space is great wherever you find it, eh?&lt;br /&gt;Hubby loves it and that in itself speaks volumes.&lt;br /&gt;I may eventually buy one for makeup brushes...but most of the compartments are not so great for tall brushes...hmmm...will have to give this some more thought!</li>
            <li> Its perfect it fits all my makeup and looks too cute!!</li>
            <li> Just what my niece needed to help get her room organized. It was a Christmas gift and she loved it.</li>
            <li> The organizer helps greatly.  I have a lot of makeup and this displays them nicely.  They re in clear view so I can find what I m looking for easily.</li>
            <li> I just received this today, and I am so happy I bought it. It fits all of my long brushes in the middle compartment, and I have quite a few of them. I can fit my lipsticks, and other things along that size, in the pull out compartments. All other smaller products fit snugly in the front compartments. I do wish that the tallest compartment was in the back so that everything was visible at first glance, instead of it being in the middle blocking the back compartment. Also, it would be more convenient if the pull out compartments were deeper. Over all, I am absolutely thrilled I bought this, much less clutter on my sink!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was hoping for! I oftentimes leave my go-to makeup all over the counter when I am rushing to get ready in the morning. Needless to say, it was causing a huge cluttery mess and the husband wasn&#x27;t the biggest fan. Why it is so hard to sweep my makeup into my makeup drawer, I&#x27;ll never know. I decided to purchase this little makeup organizer to eliminate my need to leave my makeup scattered everywhere. After all, if I am going to set it down on the counter anyway, I might as well set it down 3 inches farther up into a neat little compartment. So far, so good. It has transformed my counter top into a nicely organized surface. I am able to store all of my everyday make up items (foundation, make up brushes, tweezers, comb, eyeshadow, mascara, eyeliner, bobby-pins, make up sponge, etc) easily. I absolutely love the two little pop out drawers on the bottom. I searched and searched and there is no other make up organizer like this on Amazon. It is petite (which I wanted, only wanted to store my daily make up, the rest of my make up is in the drawer), nicely constructed, and made of solid material. It is actually really pretty in a way, the light reflects and makes a bit of a rainbow color at the edges. I think it looks really high end and it was incredibly affordable! I really love this product!</li>
            <li> Its cute but a bit small. I would like a square one better because some of the compartments are not visible when things are loaded in. Still using it though.</li>
            <li> I use this for my hair brushes, blushes, and eye shadows. It is perfect to display makeup. It doesn&#x27;t take up too much space and the sides come in and out when needed. All around a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> certain things dont fit properly since its round and could be awkward for square shaped compacts, but all makeup comes in weird containers sometimes.it really helped organize my makeup. since its clear itll go with any type f vanity, even though its plastic it doesnt look cheap at all.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted to keep my brushes, and other makeup tools in a neat and organized manner..very good to have as a makeup artist....I&#x27;m ordering more to keep my studio organized...think I&#x27;ll go for a bigger size...</li>
            <li> This is a great peace. Although I wish it was a little bigger, ( even if I had to pay more ) I love it. In the bottom revolving compartment I keep q-tips, no dust gets on them and I don&#x27;t have to keep the ugly box on top of my dresser. In the center I keep my brush and hair comb. The the other compartments I keep hair ties, and bobby pins. I had originally purchased it to put my makeup, I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day, but I do my hair every day sometimes more than once a day. This cylinder keeps my most used items handy. Instead of searching and searching through my cluttered drawer.</li>
            <li> defientley helps me keep my make up organized.</li>
            <li> This had been on my wishlist for a while and someone got it for me for my birthday. I really love this! It takes up alot less room than my old makeup organizer. I can see everything easily and it&#x27;s all very accessible as well. It&#x27;s great for people who don&#x27;t have too much makeup. Hope this was helpful!</li>
            <li> While I do use this for most of my makeup, the compartments are not very big and I can&#x27;t fit any of my powder boxes/compacts/sets in here. I love it otherwise!</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected, not sure what would even fit in this thing.  Maybe beads? Not normal sized make up. I returned it and got something bigger.</li>
            <li> I really like the vanity organizer.  It does hold alot of items, but it really only holds 2 face powders (one in each drawer) or small lotion containor.  I took a star off because of this.  I was expecting it to hold more then a small/travel size and I was not even able to use the wings for eye shadow compartments.  I will give the star back since it really is not their fault for the small size in the wings.  Please just keep in mind that they do not hold even med. size loose powders.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a licensed cosmetologist and makeup artist--she loved it! It holds multiple brushes and saves counter space.  It is also very cute and looks good on my new makeup table.  It holds brushes and will allow compartmentalization of lip glosses, hair pins, eye shadows, pencils and mascaras.  It is ver versatile.</li>
            <li> I use it to hold makeup and brushes. It doesn&#x27;t hold EVERYTHING but a lot fits and it&#x27;s great to have an easily accessible place to store my makeup products</li>
            <li> Holds my eyeshadow, brushes, lipstick etc!  Its clear so you can easily find what your looking for! Its a pretty good size too!</li>
            <li> Quality was great. Given as a gift and she loved it. Many compartment and is easy to clean and wash out after ti starts to build up make up gunk. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Works well for me on my master bathroom countertop. I don&#x27;t have a lot of space, so this particular one fit the bill!!</li>
            <li> Very handy for organizing things. Has suprising a lot of space for things for being as small as it is. Do wish it was a little bigger though. But overall I&#x27;m very pleased! Worth the money</li>
            <li> This thing is perfect. I have a lot of make up and it could be small but it doesnt matter, I got rid of all of my old make up kept my favorites and plopped them in here. no more opening drawers and causing messes. I love it. I will deff get one for my mom and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great addition to organize. ..</li>
            <li> very happy with my purchase, recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this organizer! It works perfectly for me and along with another acrylic organizer has turned my  makeup chaos into order. It sits on my bathroom vanity and I wish I could show a picture of it.</li>
            <li> I received this organizer today, it is so nice it holds a lot more stuff then it looks.</li>
            <li> This looked like a great organizer online so I decided to try it.  It&#x27;s perfect, I can get it out and put it away, and most important, stay organized.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this to sit ontop of two InterDesign Clear Drawers. This happens to be the perfect width, and looks just right sitting ontop of the cubes! This thing holds a LOT of brushes and misc. items!</li>
            <li> nice organizer. Small yet holds a lot.</li>
            <li> Cleaned up my vanity. Have no drawers near sink, and top was always messy.  Hold my brushes and all the little things. I really was pleased.  Nice size., nice compartments. Good price.  and small enough to fit in a smaller size area, and easy to find everything.</li>
            <li> This is awesome, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it because the picture made it look so small, and even though I looked at the measurements I just couldn&#x27;t picture it.  The picture to me, also makes it look like there&#x27;s no slots around the backside of the organizer but there is! I have plenty of room for all of my make-up, I love it!</li>
            <li> This organizer is fantastic!  I hated having my daily things all over the bathroom counter and this has really solved it.  It looks great with any color bathroom and doesn&#x27;t look cheap, which I was afraid of.  I keep qtips and floss picks in the little side drawers and makeup in the rest and it works perfectly.  It keeps all those annoying little things off my counter but also away from getting mixed up and broken in the drawer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this for months now and it still looks brand new.  I use it daily to store my little bits and it hasn&#x27;t chipped or warped or even discolored.  To be honest, I haven&#x27;t even wiped it down when cleaning my bathroom, as it doesn&#x27;t need it!  This is an awesome little organizational tool for any bathroom!</li>
            <li> I love it. I do think that there is a spot on the back that had space to be a little drawer but that is okay. It keeps everything so organized, which I love. I highly recommend this item. It also got here in perfect shape and on time so I am quite pleased all around.</li>
            <li> Very helpfull. Is elegant and confortable. I put a lot of things in the bathroom. I use for cotton too.</li>
            <li> Perfectly fits my bare essentials make-up, hair clips, make-up brushes, mascara, eye-liners, hair product, and deodorant. All in a perfect size to fit on too if my dresser</li>
            <li> I needed a make up organizer, and got this one. I really like it keeps my stuff good, but I just don&#x27;t like how my brushes stick out a lot maybe if this organizer was a little taller my brushes wouldn&#x27;t be sliding left and right and sticking out too much. But overall does the trick for now at least. I like how it has two little boxes in the bottom that slide you can put scrunchies or bobby pins or eye shadows those come in handy as well. Not bad for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> The drawers seem a bit flimsy but overall good product!</li>
            <li> I just love this product!!! Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I imagined, but very useful. I just wish it was larger. I might need to order another one.</li>
            <li> This little item held more than a BIG one I&#x27;ve had for years!! I just love it. Now I have more room on my bathroom counter. I would have never believed that I could get all my brushes, pencils, powder, and makeup tubes in this one! Thank you, PJ</li>
            <li> So if you have a few brushes and few lip sticks and few shadows and blushes, it&#x27;s great. I just bought it but unfortunately I have already ran out of space bc I recently bought new items. There&#x27;s spots for brushes, eye shadows, lipsticks but not really any good space for my liquid foundations. I have to stick my foundation in the back (on a good day if they&#x27;ll fit), great thing it&#x27;s my base bc Id probably forget about it being back there. I use the drawers for my blushes, other than that they are sort of pointless. But it definitely made my counter space a lot better. I plan to check out some D.I.Y videos to see how I can creatively organize my items that didn&#x27;t fit (shadows, hd powder, primer). Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> First off lemme say this thing seems small but holds so many brushes, eyeliners, ect. I use it to put my fav things in that i use most often. Im glad to consolidate my makeup obsession. My boyfriend was fed up with my crap everywhere all the way past my sink n over into &amp;#34;his side&amp;#34; with his sink lol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a ton of makeup, or if they do, a place for just the daily stuff. You can fit a lot more brushes in the big middle space than in my pic,(I used a shot glass to hold my two fave brushes tighter) and with little beads(craft store) it will hold any brush, liner, etc securely in any of the different sized spaces.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.  ! actually purchased 2 in addition to the 3 drawer multi purpose storage containers that I bought 2 of also.  I have one of  the expandable cyclinder&#x27;s sitting on top of each of the 3 drawer storage containers.  I have them on each corner of my vanity &amp; I have a lot of storage for all of my makeup.  I highly recommend this item.  Very pleased!</li>
