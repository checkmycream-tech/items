            <li>This is hands down one of the best products I have used on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>It makes it smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll spray lightly and run my fingers through my hair to distribute.</li>
            <li>It helped smooth out my hair and keep it under control.</li>
            <li>Nice product for straight hair.</li>
            <li>The best part is, it last through the WHOLE day.</li>
            <li>then flat iron and my hair looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair that gets super frizzy in even the slightest amount of humidity.</li>
            <li>Thanks KMS :)</li>
            <li>Seller sent out immediately and was received quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have around for special occasions but impractical for daily use.</li>
            <li>Even after sleeping on my hair it is still totally smooth and pin straight.</li>
            <li>and my hair looked great everyday.  </li>
            <li>Then we wouldn&#x27;t care how much it rains!</li>
            <li>Love this product, it&#x27;s the only thing that works in the Florida humidity.  </li>
            <li>this is exactly what i wanted and exact description.  </li>
            <li>This product certainly helps to keep frizziness in check.</li>
            <li>This kept my hair from getting wavy when I wanted it straight.</li>
            <li>It lasted a whole summer night out in the Ft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple times and I can&#x27;t really tell if it does anything.  </li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing another bottle as I don&#x27;t see it doing much...</li>
            <li>If you spray too much on then it gives your hair a greasy look.</li>
            <li>This product really works well on my ethnic hair.  </li>
            <li>Part of it is wavy and part straight.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>this product worked okay, but wasnt what i expected.  </li>
            <li>thanks again</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work better than any other product I&#x27;ve used for sealing out humidity, but I have to use a TON of it.</li>
            <li>I have thin, but very abundant hair</li>
            <li>I live in a very tropical humid country.. and it doesnt help so much for the main purpose..</li>
            <li>I have never found anything that kept my hair soft &amp; shiny AND STRAIGHT in HUMID weather until now!  </li>
            <li>If I need a little more I&#x27;ll reapply.</li>
            <li>I styled my hair as normal and sprayed with this spray.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my only option left for smooth hair is a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and have naturally frizzy/curly hair and this product holds up for days.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair (</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>and I wear shoulder length and flat iron straight.  </li>
            <li>I live in the south where humidity is definitely a problem.</li>
            <li>Stays straight and shinny with absolutely no frizz!</li>
            <li>I am shocked and so happy I finally found something that will actually work the way I want it to.</li>
            <li>Because my hair requires so much of it, I think the amount that you get for the price is just not worth it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> South Louisiana has extreme humidity even in the spring. This kept my hair from getting wavy when I wanted it straight.</li>
            <li> This is hands down one of the best products I have used on my hair. I have naturally curly hair (3b/ a little 3a). Last night I straightened my hair, used this spray after and went to an outside bar on the beach in the humidity. I walked along the water, was dancing, sweating... it was grounds for a typical hair disaster. Even after sleeping on my hair it is still totally smooth and pin straight. I am shocked and so happy I finally found something that will actually work the way I want it to. Amazing and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product.. I live in a very tropical humid country.. and it doesnt help so much for the main purpose.. HUMIDITY.. it helps.. but not much.. though I love the smell.. and it gives a shiny end look. Love it for that but I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this spray.  It lasted a whole summer night out in the Ft. Lauderdale night scene.  My hair hardly frizzed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple times and I can&#x27;t really tell if it does anything.  Not too fond of the smell though.  I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing another bottle as I don&#x27;t see it doing much...</li>
            <li> great product and well worth what you pay !  I would order this again and recommend to others .  works great for humidy!</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t receive the Flat Out product... It was labeled Hair Stay so I&#x27;ll review that. This spray didn&#x27;t tame the humidity or frizz that comes with frolicking in the Florida climate. Oh how I wish it did. My hair is naturally wavy but I usually straighten it. I used an anti-frizz shampoo/conditioner combo, anti-frizz oil, and the KMS spray and STILL my hair went wavy and frizzy. Maybe I&#x27;m just destined to have crappy hair in humid conditions. Anyway, this product didn&#x27;t work for me, as you may have already surmised...</li>
            <li> The heat index on 114 in Charleston,SC can&#x27;t even dominate after you&#x27;ve used this product! I have thin, but very abundant hair and this is the only spray that prevents my hair from getting wavy and frizzy throughout the day. The best part is, it last through the WHOLE day. I will warn you to spray cautiously. If you spray too much on then it gives your hair a greasy look. This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and have naturally frizzy/curly hair and this product holds up for days. Stays straight and shinny with absolutely no frizz! By far best product that I have found. I put a lot on and have not found it to look greasy, but I have very dry hair. It makes it smooth and silky. I would recommend this product to everyone and it smells awesome as well.</li>
            <li> Going outside in humid 100+ degree weather, what better way to test out this product.  Now I&#x27;m in love KMS.  This product really works well on my ethnic hair.  Now I wont have to keep flat ironing my naturally frizzy hair every other day!  I also love the light fragrant smell that is used. Thanks KMS :)</li>
            <li> This spry is really good at finishing   But.... you have to remember to wait to take a breath after spraying. makes you choke a bit</li>
            <li> I love KMS products and this is a brilliant idea on their part...a spray to help seal out the humidity. I think everyone in Oregon should use this product! Then we wouldn&#x27;t care how much it rains!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair that gets super frizzy in even the slightest amount of humidity. Part of it is wavy and part straight. I feel like my only option left for smooth hair is a keratin treatment. This product helped a little, but nothing life-changing.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I spray it and then flat iron and my hair looks and feels great.  It holds up to humidity.  I went to Florida and then on a cruise and my hair looked great everyday.  On previous trips to Florida and on cruises, my hair became a curly mess in the humidity.  This product made my hair look great.  I had a lot of compliments on my hair. Thank you KMS</li>
            <li> I love this anti-humidity spray. I live in the south where humidity is definitely a problem. Since I already have wavy hair...if I blow it out it can tend to revert back if I&#x27;m outside. . But this stuff seals out the humidity.  Haven&#x27;t had this spray fail me once. It is a great product. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ll spray lightly and run my fingers through my hair to distribute. If I need a little more I&#x27;ll reapply. Otherwise it  could leave the hair feeling weighted down and later will get that greasy look. But if applied lightly it gives great hair and great shine. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product certainly helps to keep frizziness in check. Nothing I have tried is perfect, but this is so far the best.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and I wear shoulder length and flat iron straight.  In humid weather, it gets poofy and frizzy and I end up looking like a poodle.  I styled my hair as normal and sprayed with this spray.  THIS IS NOT A HAIRSPRAY !  But it did the most amazing job of keeping the humidity out of my hair.  I have never found anything that kept my hair soft &amp; shiny AND STRAIGHT in HUMID weather until now!  This truly does just what it says and I will never stop using it!!!  I purchased 3 cans and I will never be without it!.  A little goes a long way.  But this product is great.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s the only thing that works in the Florida humidity.  Seller sent out immediately and was received quickly.  Price was amazing!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Did not work as advertised.  It actually made my styled hair frizzy.  Hairspray usually has the opposite effect on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in this product. Did do a thing for me</li>
            <li> Really nice product. I used it after I was finsihed with styling my hair. It helped smooth out my hair and keep it under control.</li>
            <li> Nice product for straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have longish,thick wavy hair.I have to put a bit of product in it-especially in the summer-otherwise it gets out of control.A couple short sprays of this gets those frizzies down,and gives some hold too.I&#x27;ve used KMS/Goldwell products for years and haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of almost all of the KMS products I&#x27;ve tried. This product is no exception. I have wavy hair that frizzes at the slightest hint of humidity. This stuff really does work better than any other product I&#x27;ve used for sealing out humidity, but I have to use a TON of it. I started with just a small amount, because I had no idea how greasy it would get. Well, I had to keep spraying and spraying and spraying. Because my hair requires so much of it, I think the amount that you get for the price is just not worth it. It&#x27;s nice to have around for special occasions but impractical for daily use.</li>
            <li> this product worked okay, but wasnt what i expected.  didnt control the humidity like described.  i wouldnt recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i wanted and exact description.  great for humid hair days.  i love this product.  thanks again</li>
