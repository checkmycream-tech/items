            <li>This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>and I wanted my hair to be nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked for a popular beauty supply store and tried hundreds of products for hair.</li>
            <li>But I always come to my handy dandy trusted conditioner.</li>
            <li>and it is naturally kind of an orange/light brown/blonde colour.</li>
            <li>and honestly I&#x27;ve yet to find a product that conditions my hair the way this one does.</li>
            <li>THANKS LOREAL, GOOD JOB!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The sales girl laughed and said it was a top seller and they wouldnt stop making it,</li>
            <li>Nice smell.  </li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely one of the best conditioners I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Loving this conditioner.</li>
            <li>This Mega Moisture cream makes my hair feel very healthy :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful for dyed hair, leaves it soft, manageable and shiny!</li>
            <li>This conditioner was most popular with professionals that shopped in our store.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t make any difference even though I put it in my hair, wrapped in warm towel for more than 30 min.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it will be better effective to someone who&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>, my family and boyfriend always tell me how my hair smells so nice : )</li>
            <li>It smells delightful, and leaves my hair so soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>the product is the best I have ever tried so far.    </li>
            <li>but it is still a good price because it is a huge container</li>
            <li>And at the end of the day, as long as it looks good and isn&#x27;t breaking off, I&#x27;m a happy girl!</li>
            <li>as I had hoped&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, curly hair though.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and it leaves it well-conditioned without being oily.</li>
            <li>My hair is just longer than shoulder length, very fine</li>
            <li>but really, even if it weren&#x27;t, I&#x27;d still use it because it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li>I have damaged hair from coloring it platinum, and this stuff has made a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and shiny now!</li>
            <li>using this conditioner my hair looks healthier,it&#x27;s shiny, manageable and now has more volume because it holds up longer after styling.</li>
            <li>I lost so many hair</li>
            <li>I love using this thing on my hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is silky smooth and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>, thats why I ordered more,</li>
            <li>use this every time I wash my hair after using an organic vegan shampoo and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light too - my hair smells nice all day, but it is subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure is not</li>
            <li>and I may buy the shampoo :)</li>
            <li>There would be many occasions when I washed my hair</li>
            <li>I would have to switch the hairdryer off on many occasions just to separate my brush from the knotted hair that had magically appeared again.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stop touching it and running my hands through it....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great haha.    </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product</li>
            <li>and she said hers is doing much better.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it here.  </li>
            <li>I went through many shampoos, conditioners, oils, you name it.</li>
            <li>My hair was never horrible, but I am always looking for that miracle product.</li>
            <li>But, I can&#x27;t say that for sure.</li>
            <li>For me, the magic is in the consistency as I find that A.</li>
            <li>You will never find a better conditioner for your hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make it greasy and the ends look so much better.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to wash it out throughly.</li>
            <li>Even my professor in cosmetology school has commented on my surprisingly healthy hair despite my coloring and heat damage.</li>
            <li>AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT EVERYONE NOTICED HOW MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li>etc many diff times on many diff products.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because of the reviews and it more than lives up to them.</li>
            <li>This product (along with the others in the set) made my hair feel lovely and healthy again.</li>
            <li>My hair looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>and my hair feels softer and is so much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner and love the price.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and my hair felt better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gone out of my way to make sure I always have some on hand.  </li>
            <li>This is the best deep conditioner I have found.</li>
            <li>My hair is moist and lovely.</li>
            <li>Really makes your hair feel great.</li>
            <li>Then I recolored on top of that.</li>
            <li>and since I used to do hair, I should know better.</li>
            <li>I order many things for my friends.  </li>
            <li>, mostly type 3b curly hair, with 3c in the crown and 3a in the nape.  </li>
            <li>The results are FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t say for sure that it truly improves the health of your hair, but over continuous use will fulfill its promises.</li>
            <li>I got this based on all the great reviews and it absolutely delivers.  </li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>if you have these issue please try this you will love it.</li>
            <li>Really glad I read the reviews here and bought this product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair, it is so silky after just one use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel any better or have any improvement from using it.  </li>
            <li>I color my hair and this makes it so much more manageable.</li>
            <li>After trying way too many products to help with damaged hair ( I swim a lot), this has truly been a life-saver.......or hair-saver.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and use it once a week.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than a year.</li>
            <li>I contacted L&#x27;Oreal about a month ago and was sent a canned response asking for more information.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>If you have damaged hair from heat styling tools like I do, using this product alone won&#x27;t make your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for many years now.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have become a hair product junkie-searching for the perfect shampoo, conditioner, flat iron, etc.</li>
            <li>Hair looked  great , silky, lively.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I decided to buy this creme and It&#x27;s an excellent purchase to condition damage and dry hair...</li>
            <li>and this make my hair look strong and healthy</li>
            <li>I also suffer from chronically dry hair, so this stuff has ben great for it!</li>
            <li>It is a very moisturizing conditioner for those of us with color treated hair, and is excellent if you really need to repair some damage.  </li>
            <li>excellent product, I gave it to my wife and have been amazed, leaves her shiny, soft and manageable hair, thanks!</li>
            <li>My hair came out more shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was worth or effective</li>
            <li>The entire Nature&#x27;s Therapy line smells so good and works even better!</li>
            <li>So far I love this, but i wish there was something that worked quicker (and not be $$$) as I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to sit in shower for 10 minutes every time!!</li>
            <li>a rich conditioner should :)</li>
            <li>Makes your hair super silky and detangles easily!  </li>
            <li>When I ran a comb through it afterward I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was.</li>
            <li>You can easily run a COMB through your hair after using this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not always easy to find in retail stores</li>

            <li>Makes your hair so silky smooth , bouncy and full of life!</li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner for dry hair or when you go to Raging Waters, swimming in your pool, it removes the dryness!!!!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s fine though), and it is just below my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I highlight my hair and there is a fine balance between under-moisturizing and over-moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I typically use it once a week, and it&#x27;s the best conditioner for my hair that I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>

            <li>This is great to use following a clarifying wash.  </li>
            <li>but the second time was great.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky, shinny and totally smooth.</li>
            <li>Smells FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>I will never stop using this great product, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li>I apply a light anti-friz shine spray by treseme to make the ends look</li>
            <li>felt SO AMAZING, so STRONG and So SOFT!  </li>
            <li>Great for fine dry hair..</li>
            <li>Just recently I left it in all night and it worked amazingly!</li>

            <li>and eventhough it&#x27;s practically full</li>
            <li>and I love it so much.</li>
            <li>My curls were more defined, and much easier to work with.</li>
            <li>Leave it on your hair for at least 2-3 minutes for best results.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad per se, but I wouldn&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li>Before buying this conditioner, I read the other people&#x27;s reviews saying what a great product it was.</li>
            <li>, I thouhgt I am going to be bold</li>
            <li>i have super damaged hair from dying my hair and I use this after i shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many different conditioners - you name it, from salon to drugstore, I&#x27;ve tried most of them.</li>
            <li>I have been coloring it for many many years which could possibly have something to do with the lackluster condition</li>
            <li>Use adequately  </li>
            <li>hair was silky smooth after my first use.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it, I noticed a difference immediately in that my hair was much softer, shinier, and easy to get a brush through.      </li>
            <li>In spite of the cheap price comparatively with other hair masks, it does a lot more better job.</li>
            <li>got the set with the shampoo from the same line, and I agree with the reviewer who wrote that the first time she used it was good</li>
            <li>It is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found, even with my highlighted and going grey hair!  </li>
            <li>we could all successfully appeal to L&#x27;oreal to lay off the parabens and silicone and other chemicals</li>
            <li>haha I cant even remember some of the expensive brands in those beautiful bottles that looked so good on my shelf, not on my hair that I&#x27;ve tried because they never worked</li>
            <li>This arrived so fast!!</li>
            <li>But, I completely fell in love with it after the first time!  </li>
            <li>Today, after sleeping on my hair without a wrap for two nights, it was still soft and I was able to brush through it and braid it without having to struggle pulling a brush through it.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products so far.</li>
            <li>By far, this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I use once a week and it makes my hair so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have used every kind out there from expensive to inexpensive and this is by far THE best conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>I want to wash my hair right away so that I can use it again.</li>
            <li>right?    </li>
            <li>I ordered it right away, and it is everything they said it would be.</li>
            <li>well she was right,</li>
            <li>Whenever I don&#x27;t use it, my hair is very tangled, very frizzy, and breaks easily.</li>
            <li>My hair never feels weighed down, the conditioner rinses clean, no residue and has a nice, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>so I know even when my damaged ends are long gone, I will still use this amazing product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT conditioner, especially when used regularly.  </li>
            <li>My hair feel soft, easy to brush, and shiny afterwords.</li>
            <li>I have tried over 30 (Humectress, Macadameia, etc) different deep conditioners for my very dry/frizzy/poofy/damaged hair and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li>I love this product and regularly buy it, but this must be a defective jar...</li>
            <li>I really think this product , gift from God !</li>
            <li>After first time using Mega Mousture my hair stop to fall .My  </li>
            <li>Exactly as I ordered.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and free of tangles.</li>
            <li>The first time I was introduced to this product was when my hairstylist used it on me as a conditioning treatment in the salon</li>
            <li>more than store bought conditioner such as pantene or others.  </li>
            <li>It is a rinse out product...not optimal and very greassy!</li>
            <li>we both process are hair and this stuff really helps to restore the moisture !</li>
            <li>I use this first</li>
            <li>a 16oz will probably last 6 or more months.</li>
            <li>I finally found my product :)</li>
            <li>This conditioner left my hair feeling very healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>The first time I brought this was in the beginning of December 2011.</li>
            <li>I have highlights and this keeps my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and it works okay as a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>Probably one of my favorite deep conditioners.</li>
            <li>Leave it on for 5 minutes after you wash your hair in the shower...and when you get out your hair feels so rich and soft.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think that it&#x27;s a little bit better than   regular pharmacy conditioners.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty strongly fruity, but it&#x27;s probably one of the deep conditioners I keep returning to, because I know that it works.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the positive customer reviews.  </li>
            <li>And it arrived very very soon, only in 3 days and was free shipping.</li>
            <li>it deeply conditions my 3c hair type and makes it tangle-free after shower and really easy to style..</li>
            <li>I tried an organic shampoo and conditioner and they are leaving my hair more dry and wiry</li>
            <li>decided to learn more about moisture basics to see what were the biggest contributors to dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to my sister who seems to love it, but she has dry hair.</li>
            <li>Even after I let my hair air dry, it is much more softer and smoother, and it feels very moisturized.</li>
            <li>What I have found is that it works best if you use it to towel dry hair and keep it in for at least 10 minutes and then rinse it.</li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is wet before you use it, then gently massage it into your ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, didnt think products that could make such a drastic impact like this one actually existed.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really think it would help, but I was going to visit my boyfriend for the weekend</li>
            <li>Very disapointed</li>
            <li>you at the point that you absolutely can&#x27;t get a wide-tooth-comb through your hair after you shampoo it -- even with tons of conditioner still in your hair?</li>
            <li>is thinner or didn&#x27;t have much chemical processing.  </li>
            <li>This is a very moisturizing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My whole life, I&#x27;ve had tangly, curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Additional heat treatment, like a straighter really helps bring out the shine in the hair.</li>
            <li>and I like My natures way just as much.</li>
            <li>This really helps.</li>
            <li>I also really like the texture.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really innocuous too...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and it works very well.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t even use that much</li>
            <li>I have tried everything for frizzy hair, and this really works.</li>
            <li>They also added isopropyl alcohol to ingredients which is very drying to have.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t really repair damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>I have hair damaged from highlighting and it didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY curly, frizzy, shoulder length hair, with quite a bit of damage from all my straightening.</li>
            <li>streaks her hair was very brittle.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really like what it does in my hair.</li>
            <li>This product works well on my long, fine, straight hair as well as my daughters curls and</li>
            <li>I first bought this conditioner from a beauty supply house a few years ago and was glad to find it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, I use a small amount on the ends of my hair daily.  </li>
            <li>this works amazing in your hair especially for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair all different colors from time to time and put super strength relaxers on my hair to make it straight and have done so for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>I have full botle of WEN and don&#x27;t know what to do , because now I am going use only this Mega Mousture .</li>
            <li>When I color my hair from a box I CHERISH the deep conditioner that comes with it and try to make it last because it does such a good job.</li>
            <li>After using this conditioner for the first time, my hair feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li>and it keeps our hair shiny and healthy without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>After I use it, my hair is completely smooth and silky and not at all like I&#x27;ve been bleaching it for way too long!</li>
            <li>Slightly more than a quarter-sized dollop is plenty - I use a comb to get it all the way through and found I use less that way, without sacrificing results.</li>
            <li>After I blew my hair out, it was confirmed - my hair was dry and felt like straw.  </li>
            <li>Does a much better job than more expensive conditioners I have tried.  </li>
            <li>and so glad I eventually found something to nourish my hair properly without spending an enormous amount of money.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good deep conditioner that does not make my hair heavy.</li>
            <li>More ever on second day  after washing , my hair still looked great and LESS OIL than usual!</li>
            <li>Your hair will get very soft and shiny!    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I did not have high</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My hair was in shambles from some highly unrecommended Matrix shampoo/conditioner when I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for what it does for your hair and the value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products that are far more costly and ended up making my hair feel like straw</li>
            <li>Suggest trying something that costs a little bit more since this is inexpensive</li>
            <li>i ordered the conditioner after reading the review thinking it will make my hair little more conditioned and silky.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product to substitute Matrix biolage deep conditioner (which is another great deep condiotioner, just a little pricey).</li>
            <li>I shampooed, let the cream sit in my hair inside of a shower cap for about 5-10 minutes, and when I was done I had amazing, soft, springy curls instead of the mat of horrid tangles that usually results from washing my hair.</li>
            <li>If this sounds like your hair, skip this product and go straight to the L&#x27;Oreal Professional line.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend investing in the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Intense line rather than taking a gamble with this product.</li>
            <li>I was really amazed at how soft and shiny it made my hair.</li>
            <li>I used it as a normal conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using for a few weeks my hair has never felt so healthy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering how much cash I&#x27;ve dropped on high end products, I feel kind of dumb now.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s just slightly thicker from your regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and ordered this because I use Kerastase but simply can&#x27;t afford it right now.  </li>
            <li>( i have SUPER long hair too)</li>
            <li>This is the only product that gets her hair feeling SOFT again and clean with no trouble.</li>
            <li>Not that I don&#x27;t care about prices, but seriously, forget about the prices: this thing is better than Kerastase (I think it rinses out better - not leaving my hair feeling heavy or oily) and way better than other products I have tried.   </li>
            <li>I was on the hunt for a good deep conditioner that actually worked, after many failed attempts this product was recommended to me by someone at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I had damaged hair due to highlighs and this made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>, yes my shelf looks empty in the bathroom without a zillion bottles that don&#x27;t work but that just gives me moremoney to have fun with!</li>
            <li>This made a huge difference from the time I received it, to my next hair appointment two weeks later.</li>
            <li>Once you use it, you will actually look forward to washing your hair, because every time you use this amazing product your hair will seem to improve to another level of perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are few conditioners that I have used that can make this claim.</li>
            <li>I use this product instead of conditioner because it leaves my hair very soft and manageable .&lt;br</li>
            <li>does make my hair feel very soft when applying it</li>
            <li>(My 14-year old daughter uses it, too!)</li>
            <li>I applied Loreal Natures Therapy conditioner to my hair for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>It makes my mature longish colored hair feel and look like it did in my 20&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I will keep my eyes and ears open for the next big thing, but for now, this product is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Works great for my long, thick, wavy hair which I like to flat iron straight</li>
            <li>I usually mix it with olive oil or Agan oil and works better.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>My hair which usually is tangled and snarled this time of year was smooth!</li>
            <li>I have used the the Mega Moisture Nurturing Creme religiously since I first discovered it almost three years ago.</li>
            <li>OMG, my hair is soft, detangled and moisturized!</li>
            <li>I have zero frizz, no distressing straw-like texture, just pretty, silky red</li>
            <li>For a certain hair type: dry, easily tangled, especially if it is long, this conditioner is a godsend.</li>
            <li>She was ready to cut her long hair, but I found this highly rated product and voile!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve continued to use it and my hair is soft, silky, and holding up better to the abuse to which I subject it daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many deep conditioning masques, especially the very expensive salon ones and find nothing compares to good old Loreal.  </li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that my hair is fairly long (down to the middle of my back), extremely dry, unmanageable, tangles very easily and generally feels like straw most of the time.</li>
            <li>My hair was dry due to frequent blow drying and ironing, been using it for 5 mos  when my hairdresser sold one  to me and sure saw the difference</li>
            <li>Even while rinsing it out I could tell that the condition of my hair had improved considerably.</li>
            <li>When I had finished, it looked like I had just stepped out of a professional salon.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I have pretty long, healthy-looking hair.</li>
            <li>This product detangles and make my hair feel baby soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, detangles my knots, leaves my hair feeling soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>If you have permed hair or are transitioning from permed to natural you will want this in your hair care regimen.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair alive again.</li>
            <li>I have natural afro hair and this product</li>
            <li>Today was my second use and my hair is really lustrous and feels fully conditioned, as it does with Kerastase.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>I am 46 years old and twice I colored my hair, didn&#x27;t like it, then used a color remover to remove the color.</li>
            <li>SOFT</li>
            <li>When i used this my hair was unbelievably soft</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, and shinny after every use.</li>
            <li>My hair stays soft and untangled throughout</li>
            <li>I bought 4 of these on Amazon because I knew I want to continue to have soft silky hair again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got long, coarse, extremely thick hair that has been colored, blown dry, and straightened many, many times.  </li>
            <li>I do have to be careful not to put it right on my scalp</li>
            <li>Weighs down my fine hair and left it staticky...would not recommend.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weight down my fine hair but definitely helps with the frizz and damage from bleaching.  </li>
            <li>Within a week of switching back to this, my hair is softer, more moisturized and my frizz has calmed down immensely.</li>
            <li>My advise for even better result is to towel dry your hair before you apply it (my hairdresser told me that it helps with the flyaways - and it really does) and leave it for at least 5 min with a plastic cap.</li>
            <li>Its been a month of using it a little more than once a week and my hair is no longer dry and breaking off at the ends.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone looking for a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>My wet hair felt dry rather than the silky smooth texture you hope for after an intensive conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to get my long hair combed out after using this product.</li>
            <li>I had pretty much given up on anything changing my hair from its rough, dry, brittle state.</li>
            <li>It really does provide moisture for dry hair.</li>
            <li>Really helps my dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li>If you have really bleached, processed, dry hair like me, this stuff is for</li>
            <li>My hair is dry and this conditioner really makes the difference.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff for my poor dead hair,</li>
            <li>I like it, I use it as a regular hair conditioner and it leaves my hair amazingly soft!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and by its very nature it can tend toward being dry and coarse.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have spent hundreds of dollars buying this new line and that new line of hair products even ordering them off tv.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since my swim team days in high school a long time ago</li>
            <li>It was silky smooth, hardly a stray hair in sight.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY deep conditioner that I&#x27;ve noticed makes a marked difference in how soft and shiny my hair is.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel really soft and silky, and I only use it about once every week or 2.</li>
            <li>It provides instant softness to my naturally frizzy, wavy AA hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend doing a normal shampoo/conditioner routine, then leaving this on for 2-5 minutes like a regular conditioner, especially on the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li>Actually it was so brittle that it was starting to break off, and my normally glossly hair felt like a brillo pad.  </li>
            <li>The new formula is so bad, I loved the old formula with the yellow jar.</li>
            <li>Slightly heavy/oily to apply, but it rinses out easily and seems to help my extremely damaged hair hang in there for another month.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I wash (hard water too), blow dry and flat-iron every day - my hair takes a beating.</li>
            <li>I use a small amount of this every single day after shampooing and it always provides me with the same outstanding results.  </li>
            <li>I had to cut off half my hair, but of course the top parts of my hair were also dried out but weren&#x27;t breaking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products, really expensive ones and this surpases all of them by far!</li>
            <li>Another thing I found worked is to first wash hair with warm water, squeeze out th water, add this product(I only add it to the bottom half end of my hair since my ends are the most damaged), make my hair into a bunch and hold it with both of my hands to use the warmth of my hands to help it, leave like that for at least 4 minutes, then rise with COLD water.</li>
            <li>have average normal long straight hair,not dyed or processed</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use any other conditioner, it really keeps my hair conditioned.</li>
            <li>My hair also doesn&#x27;t sleep overnight and turn into a tangled rat nest as much as the other product used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a thick conditioner that is great for long, thick, or frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>After researching the ingredients, I decided to try a homemade deep conditioner instead with natural ingredients such as coconut oil or coconut milk, organic raw honey, fresh avocado or avocado oil and olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been moving toward more natural products lately and am trying to find something with less chemicals and no silicone (amodimethicone is a silicone)</li>
            <li>my hair does not dry out anymore.</li>
            <li>Thick, rich and works very well to tame wild hair.</li>
            <li>I use it in small quantity on the ends of my fine, frizzy hair and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down; it works equally well in larger quantity on my husband&#x27;s long, dry, super curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It is thick and is a little heavy, but it works great for repairing hair and restoring moisture.</li>
            <li>I have very course, very thick, and very curly hair naturally.  </li>
            <li>I tried this conditioner and really didn&#x27;t notice a difference from any other deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have bleached my hair to straw, killed my hair in heavily clorinated pools and hot tubs, damaged it with hot irons....</li>
            <li>It is not bad, but it is not amazing..</li>
            <li>I apply it from the ears down (so my roots stay clean longer and not greasy or weighed down)</li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair soft &amp; moist instead of dry.</li>
            <li>Leaves my dry chemically treated hair soft and supple.</li>
            <li>The 4-part series on YouTube regarding moisture basics by the author of \\&quot;The Science of Black Hair\\&quot; was very informative.</li>
            <li>It makes my dry, curly, color processed hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I usually use L&#x27;Oreal Professional Intense masque as a conditioner</li>
            <li>It smells a little bit too much like olive oil to me</li>
            <li>After a misguided attempt at going bleach blonde... then grey, light pink, dark brown and back to black, all in 14 days while processing my hair at home with no previous experience (oops)</li>

            <li> and I wanted my hair to be nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked for a popular beauty supply store and tried hundreds of products for hair.</li>
            <li> But I always come to my handy dandy trusted conditioner.</li>
            <li> and it is naturally kind of an orange/light brown/blonde colour.</li>
            <li> and honestly I&#x27;ve yet to find a product that conditions my hair the way this one does.</li>
            <li> THANKS LOREAL, GOOD JOB!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The sales girl laughed and said it was a top seller and they wouldnt stop making it,</li>
            <li> Nice smell.  </li>
            <li> so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely one of the best conditioners I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Loving this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This Mega Moisture cream makes my hair feel very healthy :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful for dyed hair, leaves it soft, manageable and shiny!</li>
            <li> This conditioner was most popular with professionals that shopped in our store.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t make any difference even though I put it in my hair, wrapped in warm towel for more than 30 min.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it will be better effective to someone who&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> , my family and boyfriend always tell me how my hair smells so nice : )</li>
            <li> It smells delightful, and leaves my hair so soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> the product is the best I have ever tried so far.    </li>
            <li> but it is still a good price because it is a huge container</li>
            <li> And at the end of the day, as long as it looks good and isn&#x27;t breaking off, I&#x27;m a happy girl!</li>
            <li> as I had hoped&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, curly hair though.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and it leaves it well-conditioned without being oily.</li>
            <li> My hair is just longer than shoulder length, very fine</li>
            <li> but really, even if it weren&#x27;t, I&#x27;d still use it because it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> I have damaged hair from coloring it platinum, and this stuff has made a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and shiny now!</li>
            <li> using this conditioner my hair looks healthier,it&#x27;s shiny, manageable and now has more volume because it holds up longer after styling.</li>
            <li> I lost so many hair</li>
            <li> I love using this thing on my hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is silky smooth and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> , thats why I ordered more,</li>
            <li> use this every time I wash my hair after using an organic vegan shampoo and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light too - my hair smells nice all day, but it is subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure is not</li>
            <li> and I may buy the shampoo :)</li>
            <li> There would be many occasions when I washed my hair</li>
            <li> I would have to switch the hairdryer off on many occasions just to separate my brush from the knotted hair that had magically appeared again.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t stop touching it and running my hands through it....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great haha.    </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product</li>
            <li> and she said hers is doing much better.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it here.  </li>
            <li> I went through many shampoos, conditioners, oils, you name it.</li>
            <li> My hair was never horrible, but I am always looking for that miracle product.</li>
            <li> But, I can&#x27;t say that for sure.</li>
            <li> For me, the magic is in the consistency as I find that A.</li>
            <li> You will never find a better conditioner for your hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make it greasy and the ends look so much better.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to wash it out throughly.</li>
            <li> Even my professor in cosmetology school has commented on my surprisingly healthy hair despite my coloring and heat damage.</li>
            <li> AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT EVERYONE NOTICED HOW MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li> etc many diff times on many diff products.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the reviews and it more than lives up to them.</li>
            <li> This product (along with the others in the set) made my hair feel lovely and healthy again.</li>
            <li> My hair looks fabulous!</li>
            <li> and my hair feels softer and is so much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and love the price.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and my hair felt better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gone out of my way to make sure I always have some on hand.  </li>
            <li> This is the best deep conditioner I have found.</li>
            <li> My hair is moist and lovely.</li>
            <li> Really makes your hair feel great.</li>
            <li> Then I recolored on top of that.</li>
            <li> and since I used to do hair, I should know better.</li>
            <li> I order many things for my friends.  </li>
            <li> , mostly type 3b curly hair, with 3c in the crown and 3a in the nape.  </li>
            <li> The results are FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t say for sure that it truly improves the health of your hair, but over continuous use will fulfill its promises.</li>
            <li> I got this based on all the great reviews and it absolutely delivers.  </li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> if you have these issue please try this you will love it.</li>
            <li> Really glad I read the reviews here and bought this product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair, it is so silky after just one use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel any better or have any improvement from using it.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair and this makes it so much more manageable.</li>
            <li> After trying way too many products to help with damaged hair ( I swim a lot), this has truly been a life-saver.......or hair-saver.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and use it once a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than a year.</li>
            <li> I contacted L&#x27;Oreal about a month ago and was sent a canned response asking for more information.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> If you have damaged hair from heat styling tools like I do, using this product alone won&#x27;t make your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for many years now.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have become a hair product junkie-searching for the perfect shampoo, conditioner, flat iron, etc.</li>
            <li> Hair looked  great , silky, lively.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to buy this creme and It&#x27;s an excellent purchase to condition damage and dry hair...</li>
            <li> and this make my hair look strong and healthy</li>
            <li> I also suffer from chronically dry hair, so this stuff has ben great for it!</li>
            <li> It is a very moisturizing conditioner for those of us with color treated hair, and is excellent if you really need to repair some damage.  </li>
            <li> excellent product, I gave it to my wife and have been amazed, leaves her shiny, soft and manageable hair, thanks!</li>
            <li> My hair came out more shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was worth or effective</li>
            <li> The entire Nature&#x27;s Therapy line smells so good and works even better!</li>
            <li> So far I love this, but i wish there was something that worked quicker (and not be $$$) as I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to sit in shower for 10 minutes every time!!</li>
            <li> a rich conditioner should :)</li>
            <li> Makes your hair super silky and detangles easily!  </li>
            <li> When I ran a comb through it afterward I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was.</li>
            <li> You can easily run a COMB through your hair after using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not always easy to find in retail stores</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow this treatment is just the best!, not only lives tour hair looking soft and great, but it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really done wonders in terms of making my hair more manageable, especially right after the shower for brushing.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair so silky smooth , bouncy and full of life!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner for dry hair or when you go to Raging Waters, swimming in your pool, it removes the dryness!!!!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s fine though), and it is just below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I highlight my hair and there is a fine balance between under-moisturizing and over-moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I typically use it once a week, and it&#x27;s the best conditioner for my hair that I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> My hair is always silky smooth and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> Ideal for dry, frizzy and color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever for super dry hair!</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky &amp; tangle free in the shower &amp; after I get out.  </li>
            <li> And your hair will never feel silkier, smoother, and tangle free.</li>
            <li> for the info, i color and magic straighten my hair, but rarely use tools.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is great to use following a clarifying wash.  </li>
            <li> but the second time was great.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky, shinny and totally smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> I will never stop using this great product, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> I apply a light anti-friz shine spray by treseme to make the ends look</li>
            <li> felt SO AMAZING, so STRONG and So SOFT!  </li>
            <li> Great for fine dry hair..</li>
            <li> Just recently I left it in all night and it worked amazingly!</li>
            <li> It was originally recommended to me by my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> I purchased this first as a recommendation from my hair dresser (and paid a lot more).</li>
            <li> My hair is much more visibly healthy and it&#x27;s sooo soft!</li>
            <li> Luckily, this scent fades and I&#x27;m fine.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a while but was excited to see I could order it online.</li>

            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this for my sister who was having dry, fly away hair</li>
            <li> it rinses clean but doesnt rinse out \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I love this product , I use it as a conditioner and my hair is soft and shiny , my 2 daughters used it and love it 2 ..</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your hair feeling really moisturized, and it smells nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love this product , I used it for many years already, is so hard to found it in stores but for a color process hair is the best moisturize cream ; is keep my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I used the corresponding shampoo, but it wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair super soft and silky and I love it!</li>
            <li> But what really made me wonder , its absolutly did not made my hair more oil.</li>
            <li> ok there is absolutely NOTHING like this conditioner...</li>
            <li> Good deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really love this product ,i will buying for ever ,makes my hair very shining and soft,and</li>
            <li> and eventhough it&#x27;s practically full</li>
            <li> and I love it so much.</li>
            <li> My curls were more defined, and much easier to work with.</li>
            <li> Leave it on your hair for at least 2-3 minutes for best results.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad per se, but I wouldn&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Before buying this conditioner, I read the other people&#x27;s reviews saying what a great product it was.</li>
            <li> , I thouhgt I am going to be bold</li>
            <li> i have super damaged hair from dying my hair and I use this after i shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many different conditioners - you name it, from salon to drugstore, I&#x27;ve tried most of them.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring it for many many years which could possibly have something to do with the lackluster condition</li>
            <li> Use adequately  </li>
            <li> hair was silky smooth after my first use.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used it, I noticed a difference immediately in that my hair was much softer, shinier, and easy to get a brush through.      </li>
            <li> In spite of the cheap price comparatively with other hair masks, it does a lot more better job.</li>
            <li> got the set with the shampoo from the same line, and I agree with the reviewer who wrote that the first time she used it was good</li>
            <li> It is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found, even with my highlighted and going grey hair!  </li>
            <li> we could all successfully appeal to L&#x27;oreal to lay off the parabens and silicone and other chemicals</li>
            <li> haha I cant even remember some of the expensive brands in those beautiful bottles that looked so good on my shelf, not on my hair that I&#x27;ve tried because they never worked</li>
            <li> This arrived so fast!!</li>
            <li> But, I completely fell in love with it after the first time!  </li>
            <li> Today, after sleeping on my hair without a wrap for two nights, it was still soft and I was able to brush through it and braid it without having to struggle pulling a brush through it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products so far.</li>
            <li> By far, this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I use once a week and it makes my hair so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have used every kind out there from expensive to inexpensive and this is by far THE best conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> I want to wash my hair right away so that I can use it again.</li>
            <li> right?    </li>
            <li> I ordered it right away, and it is everything they said it would be.</li>
            <li> well she was right,</li>
            <li> Whenever I don&#x27;t use it, my hair is very tangled, very frizzy, and breaks easily.</li>
            <li> My hair never feels weighed down, the conditioner rinses clean, no residue and has a nice, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> so I know even when my damaged ends are long gone, I will still use this amazing product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT conditioner, especially when used regularly.  </li>
            <li> My hair feel soft, easy to brush, and shiny afterwords.</li>
            <li> I have tried over 30 (Humectress, Macadameia, etc) different deep conditioners for my very dry/frizzy/poofy/damaged hair and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li> I love this product and regularly buy it, but this must be a defective jar...</li>
            <li> I really think this product , gift from God !</li>
            <li> After first time using Mega Mousture my hair stop to fall .My  </li>
            <li> Exactly as I ordered.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and free of tangles.</li>
            <li> The first time I was introduced to this product was when my hairstylist used it on me as a conditioning treatment in the salon</li>
            <li> more than store bought conditioner such as pantene or others.  </li>
            <li> It is a rinse out product...not optimal and very greassy!</li>
            <li> we both process are hair and this stuff really helps to restore the moisture !</li>
            <li> I use this first</li>
            <li> a 16oz will probably last 6 or more months.</li>
            <li> I finally found my product :)</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair feeling very healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> The first time I brought this was in the beginning of December 2011.</li>
            <li> I have highlights and this keeps my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and it works okay as a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> Probably one of my favorite deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> Leave it on for 5 minutes after you wash your hair in the shower...and when you get out your hair feels so rich and soft.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think that it&#x27;s a little bit better than   regular pharmacy conditioners.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty strongly fruity, but it&#x27;s probably one of the deep conditioners I keep returning to, because I know that it works.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the positive customer reviews.  </li>
            <li> And it arrived very very soon, only in 3 days and was free shipping.</li>
            <li> it deeply conditions my 3c hair type and makes it tangle-free after shower and really easy to style..</li>
            <li> I tried an organic shampoo and conditioner and they are leaving my hair more dry and wiry</li>
            <li> decided to learn more about moisture basics to see what were the biggest contributors to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I ended up giving it to my sister who seems to love it, but she has dry hair.</li>
            <li> Even after I let my hair air dry, it is much more softer and smoother, and it feels very moisturized.</li>
            <li> What I have found is that it works best if you use it to towel dry hair and keep it in for at least 10 minutes and then rinse it.</li>
            <li> Make sure your hair is wet before you use it, then gently massage it into your ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, didnt think products that could make such a drastic impact like this one actually existed.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really think it would help, but I was going to visit my boyfriend for the weekend</li>
            <li> Very disapointed</li>
            <li> you at the point that you absolutely can&#x27;t get a wide-tooth-comb through your hair after you shampoo it -- even with tons of conditioner still in your hair?</li>
            <li> is thinner or didn&#x27;t have much chemical processing.  </li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My whole life, I&#x27;ve had tangly, curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Additional heat treatment, like a straighter really helps bring out the shine in the hair.</li>
            <li> and I like My natures way just as much.</li>
            <li> This really helps.</li>
            <li> I also really like the texture.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really innocuous too...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and it works very well.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t even use that much</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for frizzy hair, and this really works.</li>
            <li> They also added isopropyl alcohol to ingredients which is very drying to have.</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t really repair damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I have hair damaged from highlighting and it didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY curly, frizzy, shoulder length hair, with quite a bit of damage from all my straightening.</li>
            <li> streaks her hair was very brittle.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really like what it does in my hair.</li>
            <li> This product works well on my long, fine, straight hair as well as my daughters curls and</li>
            <li> I first bought this conditioner from a beauty supply house a few years ago and was glad to find it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, I use a small amount on the ends of my hair daily.  </li>
            <li> this works amazing in your hair especially for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair all different colors from time to time and put super strength relaxers on my hair to make it straight and have done so for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I have full botle of WEN and don&#x27;t know what to do , because now I am going use only this Mega Mousture .</li>
            <li> When I color my hair from a box I CHERISH the deep conditioner that comes with it and try to make it last because it does such a good job.</li>
            <li> After using this conditioner for the first time, my hair feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li> and it keeps our hair shiny and healthy without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> After I use it, my hair is completely smooth and silky and not at all like I&#x27;ve been bleaching it for way too long!</li>
            <li> Slightly more than a quarter-sized dollop is plenty - I use a comb to get it all the way through and found I use less that way, without sacrificing results.</li>
            <li> After I blew my hair out, it was confirmed - my hair was dry and felt like straw.  </li>
            <li> Does a much better job than more expensive conditioners I have tried.  </li>
            <li> and so glad I eventually found something to nourish my hair properly without spending an enormous amount of money.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good deep conditioner that does not make my hair heavy.</li>
            <li> More ever on second day  after washing , my hair still looked great and LESS OIL than usual!</li>
            <li> Your hair will get very soft and shiny!    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I did not have high</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My hair was in shambles from some highly unrecommended Matrix shampoo/conditioner when I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for what it does for your hair and the value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that are far more costly and ended up making my hair feel like straw</li>
            <li> Suggest trying something that costs a little bit more since this is inexpensive</li>
            <li> i ordered the conditioner after reading the review thinking it will make my hair little more conditioned and silky.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product to substitute Matrix biolage deep conditioner (which is another great deep condiotioner, just a little pricey).</li>
            <li> I shampooed, let the cream sit in my hair inside of a shower cap for about 5-10 minutes, and when I was done I had amazing, soft, springy curls instead of the mat of horrid tangles that usually results from washing my hair.</li>
            <li> If this sounds like your hair, skip this product and go straight to the L&#x27;Oreal Professional line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend investing in the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Intense line rather than taking a gamble with this product.</li>
            <li> I was really amazed at how soft and shiny it made my hair.</li>
            <li> I used it as a normal conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using for a few weeks my hair has never felt so healthy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering how much cash I&#x27;ve dropped on high end products, I feel kind of dumb now.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s just slightly thicker from your regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and ordered this because I use Kerastase but simply can&#x27;t afford it right now.  </li>
            <li> ( i have SUPER long hair too)</li>
            <li> This is the only product that gets her hair feeling SOFT again and clean with no trouble.</li>
            <li> Not that I don&#x27;t care about prices, but seriously, forget about the prices: this thing is better than Kerastase (I think it rinses out better - not leaving my hair feeling heavy or oily) and way better than other products I have tried.   </li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a good deep conditioner that actually worked, after many failed attempts this product was recommended to me by someone at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I had damaged hair due to highlighs and this made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> , yes my shelf looks empty in the bathroom without a zillion bottles that don&#x27;t work but that just gives me moremoney to have fun with!</li>
            <li> This made a huge difference from the time I received it, to my next hair appointment two weeks later.</li>
            <li> Once you use it, you will actually look forward to washing your hair, because every time you use this amazing product your hair will seem to improve to another level of perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are few conditioners that I have used that can make this claim.</li>
            <li> I use this product instead of conditioner because it leaves my hair very soft and manageable .&lt;br</li>
            <li> does make my hair feel very soft when applying it</li>
            <li> (My 14-year old daughter uses it, too!)</li>
            <li> I applied Loreal Natures Therapy conditioner to my hair for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> It makes my mature longish colored hair feel and look like it did in my 20&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I will keep my eyes and ears open for the next big thing, but for now, this product is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Works great for my long, thick, wavy hair which I like to flat iron straight</li>
            <li> I usually mix it with olive oil or Agan oil and works better.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> My hair which usually is tangled and snarled this time of year was smooth!</li>
            <li> I have used the the Mega Moisture Nurturing Creme religiously since I first discovered it almost three years ago.</li>
            <li> OMG, my hair is soft, detangled and moisturized!</li>
            <li> I have zero frizz, no distressing straw-like texture, just pretty, silky red</li>
            <li> For a certain hair type: dry, easily tangled, especially if it is long, this conditioner is a godsend.</li>
            <li> She was ready to cut her long hair, but I found this highly rated product and voile!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve continued to use it and my hair is soft, silky, and holding up better to the abuse to which I subject it daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many deep conditioning masques, especially the very expensive salon ones and find nothing compares to good old Loreal.  </li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that my hair is fairly long (down to the middle of my back), extremely dry, unmanageable, tangles very easily and generally feels like straw most of the time.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry due to frequent blow drying and ironing, been using it for 5 mos  when my hairdresser sold one  to me and sure saw the difference</li>
            <li> Even while rinsing it out I could tell that the condition of my hair had improved considerably.</li>
            <li> When I had finished, it looked like I had just stepped out of a professional salon.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I have pretty long, healthy-looking hair.</li>
            <li> This product detangles and make my hair feel baby soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, detangles my knots, leaves my hair feeling soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> If you have permed hair or are transitioning from permed to natural you will want this in your hair care regimen.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair alive again.</li>
            <li> I have natural afro hair and this product</li>
            <li> Today was my second use and my hair is really lustrous and feels fully conditioned, as it does with Kerastase.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and twice I colored my hair, didn&#x27;t like it, then used a color remover to remove the color.</li>
            <li> SOFT</li>
            <li> When i used this my hair was unbelievably soft</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, and shinny after every use.</li>
            <li> My hair stays soft and untangled throughout</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these on Amazon because I knew I want to continue to have soft silky hair again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long, coarse, extremely thick hair that has been colored, blown dry, and straightened many, many times.  </li>
            <li> I do have to be careful not to put it right on my scalp</li>
            <li> Weighs down my fine hair and left it staticky...would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight down my fine hair but definitely helps with the frizz and damage from bleaching.  </li>
            <li> Within a week of switching back to this, my hair is softer, more moisturized and my frizz has calmed down immensely.</li>
            <li> My advise for even better result is to towel dry your hair before you apply it (my hairdresser told me that it helps with the flyaways - and it really does) and leave it for at least 5 min with a plastic cap.</li>
            <li> Its been a month of using it a little more than once a week and my hair is no longer dry and breaking off at the ends.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone looking for a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> My wet hair felt dry rather than the silky smooth texture you hope for after an intensive conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to get my long hair combed out after using this product.</li>
            <li> I had pretty much given up on anything changing my hair from its rough, dry, brittle state.</li>
            <li> It really does provide moisture for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Really helps my dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> If you have really bleached, processed, dry hair like me, this stuff is for</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and this conditioner really makes the difference.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff for my poor dead hair,</li>
            <li> I like it, I use it as a regular hair conditioner and it leaves my hair amazingly soft!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and by its very nature it can tend toward being dry and coarse.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have spent hundreds of dollars buying this new line and that new line of hair products even ordering them off tv.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since my swim team days in high school a long time ago</li>
            <li> It was silky smooth, hardly a stray hair in sight.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY deep conditioner that I&#x27;ve noticed makes a marked difference in how soft and shiny my hair is.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel really soft and silky, and I only use it about once every week or 2.</li>
            <li> It provides instant softness to my naturally frizzy, wavy AA hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend doing a normal shampoo/conditioner routine, then leaving this on for 2-5 minutes like a regular conditioner, especially on the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> Actually it was so brittle that it was starting to break off, and my normally glossly hair felt like a brillo pad.  </li>
            <li> The new formula is so bad, I loved the old formula with the yellow jar.</li>
            <li> Slightly heavy/oily to apply, but it rinses out easily and seems to help my extremely damaged hair hang in there for another month.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I wash (hard water too), blow dry and flat-iron every day - my hair takes a beating.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of this every single day after shampooing and it always provides me with the same outstanding results.  </li>
            <li> I had to cut off half my hair, but of course the top parts of my hair were also dried out but weren&#x27;t breaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products, really expensive ones and this surpases all of them by far!</li>
            <li> Another thing I found worked is to first wash hair with warm water, squeeze out th water, add this product(I only add it to the bottom half end of my hair since my ends are the most damaged), make my hair into a bunch and hold it with both of my hands to use the warmth of my hands to help it, leave like that for at least 4 minutes, then rise with COLD water.</li>
            <li> have average normal long straight hair,not dyed or processed</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other conditioner, it really keeps my hair conditioned.</li>
            <li> My hair also doesn&#x27;t sleep overnight and turn into a tangled rat nest as much as the other product used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a thick conditioner that is great for long, thick, or frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> After researching the ingredients, I decided to try a homemade deep conditioner instead with natural ingredients such as coconut oil or coconut milk, organic raw honey, fresh avocado or avocado oil and olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been moving toward more natural products lately and am trying to find something with less chemicals and no silicone (amodimethicone is a silicone)</li>
            <li> my hair does not dry out anymore.</li>
            <li> Thick, rich and works very well to tame wild hair.</li>
            <li> I use it in small quantity on the ends of my fine, frizzy hair and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down; it works equally well in larger quantity on my husband&#x27;s long, dry, super curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and is a little heavy, but it works great for repairing hair and restoring moisture.</li>
            <li> I have very course, very thick, and very curly hair naturally.  </li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner and really didn&#x27;t notice a difference from any other deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have bleached my hair to straw, killed my hair in heavily clorinated pools and hot tubs, damaged it with hot irons....</li>
            <li> It is not bad, but it is not amazing..</li>
            <li> I apply it from the ears down (so my roots stay clean longer and not greasy or weighed down)</li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair soft &amp; moist instead of dry.</li>
            <li> Leaves my dry chemically treated hair soft and supple.</li>
            <li> The 4-part series on YouTube regarding moisture basics by the author of \\&quot;The Science of Black Hair\\&quot; was very informative.</li>
            <li> It makes my dry, curly, color processed hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I usually use L&#x27;Oreal Professional Intense masque as a conditioner</li>
            <li> It smells a little bit too much like olive oil to me</li>
            <li> After a misguided attempt at going bleach blonde... then grey, light pink, dark brown and back to black, all in 14 days while processing my hair at home with no previous experience (oops)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t wash out ALL of the product, rinse your hair but leave a tiny bit in, enough to make it feel soft and slippery, but not weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li> Constantly looking for Holy Grail products, the trial &amp; error phase was becoming too expensive.  </li>
            <li> and then I mix in a new product to my regimen just to trick my hair a little before it gets too used to the same product.</li>
            <li> It smells very strongly of pears, artificial pears.  </li>
            <li> Bought it at Amazon for a few dollars cheaper is a big difference to me because I have highly damaged dry hair because I bleached my hair platinum blonde.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, when my hair feels really dry and gross, I put this in and heat it for 10 minutes with a hairdryer on low.</li>
            <li> Please excuse my unperfect English , but I could not hold myself .</li>
            <li> Especially for long hair.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use this as my daily conditioner, it gives my hair plenty of body even without leaving it in for long.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time since it&#x27;s a big jar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend using it once a week and letting it sit for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> After using this a few months, my hair feels almost at its normal state.</li>
            <li> I apply about a teaspoon at a time and it makes my hair soft and a lot less frizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 5 uses I&#x27;m starting to see the difference, it is helping, but I don&#x27;t use it alone, after I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li> That product left my hair so dry and horrid!</li>
            <li> If its very humid or I want a little extra smoothing, I just rub a little melted coconut oil between my palms and through the ends.  </li>
            <li> It may be a bit on the pricey side (at least for me), but I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s got overworked/overprocessed hair.</li>
            <li> People ask me what I do to make my hair so shiny and smooth, and this is the secret that I want to share!  </li>
            <li> The cream rinse itself is really a 5 star product but a person usually has wet hands when using cream rinse.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the numerous 5 star reviews and I expected miracle after using it.</li>
            <li> I remember picking this stuff up a long time ago when I was working at a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> I doubt I&#x27;ll ever switch conditioners for as long as I&#x27;m bleaching my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have long hair.  </li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It took me long time to grow my hair out to boob-length</li>
            <li> I also, have long hair almost to waist.</li>
            <li> My long  hair was in knots from not combing it for a long time, and while my husband worked on it for a couple of hours, I was reading a long hair care forum and this product was mentioned.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, I&#x27;m very grateful that tightening my belt doesn&#x27;t mean my hair has to look like shi*.</li>
            <li> I used it for years until I left that job and switched to some other products.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because I&#x27;m used to paying more than this price point for my hair products.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gone through every possible other product in the interim without ever finding anything like this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I had the same experience as other reviews.  </li>
            <li> You only need to put a little at the ends of your hair, that tub will last about 4 months.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I have very long colored and dry hair</li>
            <li> I have really dry, processed hair and</li>
            <li> It doesnt matter how dry your hair is.  </li>
            <li> I straighten/curl and/or blow dry my hair almost every day and this restores it to health.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to make it dry too.</li>
            <li> My roots are oily, yet my ends are totally dry.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair from getting too dry and helps to define the curl.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry to begin with</li>
            <li> friend who purchased the creme went to a known blow dry bar and her hair was burnt.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions say to towel dry hair then apply.  </li>
            <li> What I do is shampoo hair with L&#x27;Oreal Natures Therapy mega moisture shampoo towel dry and apply mega moisture conditioner; wrap hair in a plastic grocery bag and sit with my heat cap on or, sometime just go to bed with the conditioner in my hair wrap a towel on and in the morning</li>
            <li> I recommend it for all dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly, dry and unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have highlighted long hair and it was very dry at the ends.</li>
            <li> This one left my hair stiff and tangled after deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> but I had trouble tracking it down and thought I would try something new.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dark brown, then it was bleached, dyed red, then highlighted.  </li>
            <li> I have all-over color and partial highlights to cover the grey in my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way here and you will be left with silky hair after washing.</li>
            <li> When I eventually did manage to untangle it, it seemed to knot up straight away again so drying it was not a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount as a daily conditioner, or you can slather it on and leave for a while for deep conditioning.  </li>
            <li> Kidding aside, only negatives are that there is a slight residual feeling of &#x27;product&#x27; on the skin around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my hair was wet it would feel sticky...and when it was dry it would feel a bit waxy.</li>
            <li> When I got it out of box and saw \\&quot;for very dry chemically processed hair\\&quot; written on a jar I did not think it will work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Moisture Nurturing Creme for Very Dry, Chemically Processed Hair is a CURE beyond belief.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and brittle from 30 years of processing and heat products.</li>
            <li> if dried with head upside down, really straight if I use blow drier and round ceramic brush.</li>
            <li> All other conditioners leave my hair either too weighed down or not moisturized enough.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a leave-in, just mixed with a little bit of water, and I apply it to my hair in the shower from the roots to the ends.</li>
            <li> With any other product, I had dry, frizzy straw like hair.</li>
            <li> I HAVE DRY AND DAMAGED HAIR DUE TO THIS CALIFORNIA POLLUTED AIR AND STRAIGHTENING EVERY WEEK AND COLORING IT.</li>
            <li> After I used this product and blow dry, my hair feels smoother and looks shiny even when not using any other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had it hot-ironed while it was already fragile a few months ago, and ever since it&#x27;s been so ragged and tangled that I wanted to scream every time I looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li> so be careful</li>
            <li> The price is simular minus the shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this deep conditioner for a few years now.</li>
            <li> The container is slippery when wet and</li>
            <li> I wet my hair a bit and then lather in this &amp;#34;dressing.&amp;#34; I leave it about 5 minutes before I wash my hair with my violet shampoo and conditioner which does nothing for the dryness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not very fond of the scent.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a deep conditioner for your dried out, damaged hair, this is it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tame my hair, but this really works for me.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was pretty dry after that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I don&#x27;t have very dry or chemically processed hair, anymore!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for the ladies who have thin curly frizzy hair and for those who suffer from stubborn tangles and knots after shower.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely curly.</li>
            <li> Thank you to all of the other people who wrote a review before me.</li>
            <li> I believe that part of this is due to this product.    </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;There are other conditioners that I have.</li>
            <li> I HAVE LOOKED ENDLESSLY FOR SOMETHING TO MAKE MY HAIR HEALTHIER.</li>
            <li> I tried other conditioners and oils, but nothing worked until I found this.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AFTER A RECOMMENDATION FROM ANOTHER AMAZON REVIEWER WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHAT TO DO TO A EXTREMELY DAMAGED HAIR</li>
            <li> SAY IS DUE TO THIS PRODUCT ALONE.</li>
            <li> My advice is to probably switch between other moisturizers every so often so that your hair doesn&#x27;t become too accustomed to this one.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Not even a blow dryer unless it&#x27;s not hot air.</li>
            <li> ,just ends tend to get little dry</li>
            <li> And I notice this if I&#x27;m missing this product for a single wash.</li>
            <li> did I have a single knot in my hair at all!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously tried a lot of different store bought conditioners which I had very little or no success with.</li>
            <li> At one point I had done so much to it, it felt rubbery and very weak.  </li>
            <li> its still on the market today and its still the only conditioner I ever use and my hair has never felt dry, frizzy, weak, or even rubbery ever again since that day.   </li>
            <li> not fun to leave in your hair for the recommended amount of time</li>
            <li> So its not going to prevent your hair from breaking if its on the verge of breakage, but at least it help the stronger parts of your hair to restore back its dryness.</li>
            <li> Then I was at Sally&#x27;s buying more crap to put on my hair and</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and coarse, so I am always hunting for a thick conditioner treatment.</li>
            <li> The lid to the product was messily taped closed, giving it the appearance that it had been previously opened and resealed.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I would have to straighten afterward just to tame it, but there is really no need to now.</li>
            <li> No more dry and damaged hair for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slightly apprehensive because as I said, I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for almost a decade</li>
            <li> I use it 3 times per week and my ends are much less brittle.</li>
            <li> and I see less breakage of the damaged ends.</li>
            <li> I typically leave this in my hair for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> is that while I stopped using the product on vacation my hair temporarily returned to its previous state of dryness.</li>
            <li> I tried many expensive conditioners before this product, and they were mostly useless.</li>
            <li> My long hair feels like silk, my split ends seem to be gone, and I hardly need to comb it.</li>
            <li> I think if one used this everyday, it might weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li> As a result, a lot of it gets wasted down the drain when I&#x27;m trying to apply it.</li>
            <li> my daughter has tight curls, and this smooths it out so she can comb through it.  </li>
            <li> i had terribly dry frizzy hair that was hard to even comb.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a little too geassy for me.</li>
            <li> because I have so little breakage and split ends.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way - I&#x27;m just shy of two months into this container, and I still have about 10 days or so left.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it about half way down my hair, comb it through and let it sit for the duration of my shower ~ 5 minutes or so and then rinse well.  </li>
            <li> At the time, my hair was severely dry and damaged due to constant bleaching, dying, razor cutting, heat styling, etc.</li>
            <li> It does the same job as other less expensive Loreal conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I went back the next day and bought every jar they had on the shelf because I was so afraid they would quit makaing it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> And I straighten it a few times a week with a blow-dryer and iron.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as my conditioner for a few months now.</li>
            <li> When i bought it in December it was a few dollars cheaper</li>
            <li> Blow drying only made it worse.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended it who works in the beauty industry and let me tell you, I&#x27;ve bought it a few times since.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy on the hair either</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on a little longer than what the bottle directs (like 30 minutes to an hour) and my hair just soaks up this stuff.</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my hair(first time) and my hair felt mad dry when washing it out.</li>
            <li> I have thick black hair and with this product I can feel my hair softer.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for your positive reviews I would still be tearing my hair out and getting frustrated.    </li>
            <li> Needless to say, all of that left it in not-so-great shape, so I had been looking for a conditioner that would help my hair look and feel healthier.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly I would try to find what was on sale at the time which usually involved the cheaper brands, but even then you would think that maybe one of them would have worked at some point,</li>
            <li> I keep it on for a few minutes in the shower in a shower cap and it does wonder for my dyed hair!</li>
            <li> (I sometimes used to be too lazy to wash my hair every day after coming out of the pool</li>
            <li> I usually leave it in for around 20 minutes, on damp hair, and wrap my hair up in a bun</li>
            <li> I am one of those wild and crazy</li>
            <li> Anyway the past 2 times I have washed my hair</li>
            <li> I use just a small dab every morning when I shower and wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very heavy, so if you have oily hair I would not use it.</li>
            <li> Finally, the scent isn&#x27;t my favourite, but it&#x27;s not offensive--a little like artificial apple scent.</li>
            <li> I used to try every expensive salon conditioner that stylists would recommend in search of something that truly made a difference on my very long hair.  </li>
            <li> leaves hair dull and sticky</li>
            <li> I would honestly never need to use anything else</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen it in the stores lately and am worried that Loreal is taking it off the market.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too late to return.</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S RECOVERING SLOWLY.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on the ratings it received from everyone else, but still remained somewhat skeptical that this would also have the same dramatic effect on my hair.     </li>
            <li> I have wavy, curly, dry, crazy, red-brown hair.  </li>
            <li> I was not real impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that it would make my thin hair flat with no body to it, but that is not the case at all.</li>
            <li> Closer to thin hair than thick</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and dry like crazy</li>
            <li> The chemicals or artificial silicone will weigh down hair, and have tons of built in \\&quot;build up\\&quot; on hair.</li>
            <li> the cover is nearly impossible to get off if your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> I have badly damaged, dry and processed hair from a poorly done ombre -yet</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve found it very inconvenient of all the turning that I need to do to open and close the lid.    </li>
            <li> I would say I use it at the very least 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> so my hair is sort of unusual--the strands are thin</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used another conditioner in years and am addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I could see no effect.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, both the Nature&#x27;s Therapy shampoo and conditioning creme ended up in the garbage.  </li>
            <li> (Including alllll sorts of expensive salon brands.)</li>
            <li> but I was so wrong.  </li>
            <li> (honest).Also my hair is very thin and demanged by every 3 month lighting .</li>
            <li> When I rinse it out (with cold water, to seal the cuticle and lock in moisture), I have the hair of my dreams.</li>
            <li> so I was desperate to keep my length.</li>
            <li> The cold water helps the hair follicles close and reduces frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have done every bad thing you can do to your hair</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to repair my badly damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Bad idea</li>
            <li> It did nothing to improve my hair, and it slicks the tub so badly that I almost lost my footing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am hoping it was just one bad one out of the bunch and not someone trying to change the product or get away with making it cheaper and selling it on amazon!</li>
            <li> I was a month overdue for a trim when I ordered this in February, and my hair was in horrible shape.</li>
            <li> When I opened the container, I was horrified by the nasty chemical aroma.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The container was in a plastic envelop.  It was not sealed.  It seemed as if somebody transferred the material from a big container to this smaller one.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time!  Great for fine dry hair.. its the only thing that lets me comb thru my hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and shiny now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and was so happy I could begin getting it delivered by Amazon.  It is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found, even with my highlighted and going grey hair!  (My 14-year old daughter uses it, too!)</li>
            <li> I used it as a normal conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;mega moisturizing&amp;#34; as I had hoped&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, curly hair though.</li>
            <li> this product is AWESOME!  it has the same ingredients as kerastase; it&#x27;s just marketed in a different way to a different market.  check it out!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and regularly buy it, but this must be a defective jar... it doesn&#x27;t smell the same or work as well.</li>
            <li> Works well for my hair.</li>
            <li> When I got it out of box and saw \\&quot;for very dry chemically processed hair\\&quot; written on a jar I did not think it will work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should have examined product image closer because it was not mentioned in product description anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;So to start with I did not have high expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I used it three times now and this conditioner is great.&lt;br /&gt;I have average normal long straight hair,not dyed or processed,just ends tend to get little dry and I was looking for something to help with that.&lt;br /&gt;After using this conditioner my hair looks healthier,it&#x27;s shiny, manageable and now has more volume because it holds up longer after styling.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> I had pretty much given up on anything changing my hair from its rough, dry, brittle state. I&#x27;m biracial so my hair is sort of unusual--the strands are thin but I have tons of hair and it&#x27;s extremely curly. A recipe for disaster if it isn&#x27;t handled perfectly, which takes hours and hours of time. I had it hot-ironed while it was already fragile a few months ago, and ever since it&#x27;s been so ragged and tangled that I wanted to scream every time I looked in the mirror. I saw the reviews for this stuff online and I didn&#x27;t really think it would help, but I was going to visit my boyfriend for the weekend and I wanted my hair to be nice so I picked it up at a beauty supply store. I shampooed, let the cream sit in my hair inside of a shower cap for about 5-10 minutes, and when I was done I had amazing, soft, springy curls instead of the mat of horrid tangles that usually results from washing my hair. Today, after sleeping on my hair without a wrap for two nights, it was still soft and I was able to brush through it and braid it without having to struggle pulling a brush through it. Sisters, believe the rave reviews--this stuff is MIRACULOUS. I want to wash my hair right away so that I can use it again.</li>
            <li> Please excuse my unperfect English , but I could not hold myself . I want people know about this great product .&lt;br /&gt;Still can&#x27;t get how its happen, I bought this product accidently!Accually I thought I am buying Mega Mousture for SKIN !My fault and my good luck . When this product arrived , I thought \\&quot; OH! great , My oily hair just need it!\\&quot; Than , I decided to try , what else I can do!&lt;br /&gt;Now  I really think this product , gift from God !I had big problem with my hair last 2 month. I lost so many hair , I thouhgt I am going to be bold (honest).Also my hair is very thin and demanged by every 3 month lighting . After first time using Mega Mousture my hair stop to fall .My  Hair looked  great , silky, lively. But what really made me wonder , its absolutly did not made my hair more oil. More ever on second day  after washing , my hair still looked great and LESS OIL than usual! I used Wen , but WEN nothing compare with this item .  I have full botle of WEN and don&#x27;t know what to do , because now I am going use only this Mega Mousture .</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and dry like crazy so I bought this, it feels like a conditioner when you leave it on but it does give moisture to your hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I ordered. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Ever since I tried it a couple of years ago, NOTHING has measured up. I have tried Joico reconstructing conditioner, Matrix Conditioning Balm and it still beats it. Not to mention the price compared to salon products! AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I love using this thing on my hair. I don&#x27;t know why isn&#x27;t this out there but it is amazinnnng! i have super damaged hair from dying my hair and I use this after i shampoo my hair. I don&#x27;t even need to brush my hair after! ( i have SUPER long hair too) my hair is silky smooth and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is really great, made my hair shiny and healthy. My hair was dry due to frequent blow drying and ironing, been using it for 5 mos  when my hairdresser sold one  to me and sure saw the difference, thats why I ordered more, good I found it on line.</li>
            <li> my daughter has tight curls, and this smooths it out so she can comb through it.  we both love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for years, and before I discovered it I never bought the same type of conditioner twice.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every time I wash my hair after using an organic vegan shampoo and I LOVE it. Whenever I don&#x27;t use it, my hair is very tangled, very frizzy, and breaks easily. And I notice this if I&#x27;m missing this product for a single wash. This Mega Moisture cream makes my hair feel very healthy :)</li>
            <li> The product arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. I use this as a deep conditioner and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. After shampooing, I squeeze all the water out of my hair, then apply a generous amount of the conditioner, cover my head with a shower cap, and use a blow dryer to apply heat. After about five minutes, I rinse it out. It leaves my hair soft and free of tangles. Even after I let my hair air dry, it is much more softer and smoother, and it feels very moisturized. This is one of my favorite products so far. It really does provide moisture for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;oreal Natures Therapy Mega Moisture Nurturing Creme for over a month now and I have to say it is an excellent product..it deeply conditions my 3c hair type and makes it tangle-free after shower and really easy to style..I am going to try the shampoo from the same line..I highly recommend this product for the ladies who have thin curly frizzy hair and for those who suffer from stubborn tangles and knots after shower.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a ton of conditioners from drug stores &amp; salons.  By far, this is my favorite.  My hair feels silky &amp; tangle free in the shower &amp; after I get out.  It reduces frizz &amp; smells great.  Love this stuff.  Order two.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the numerous 5 star reviews and I expected miracle after using it. Unfortunately I could see no effect. Very disapointed</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It is thick and is a little heavy, but it works great for repairing hair and restoring moisture.</li>
            <li> For a certain hair type: dry, easily tangled, especially if it is long, this conditioner is a godsend. I haven&#x27;t used another conditioner in years and am addicted to this stuff. After shampooing, just massage it into your hair and leave it in for five minutes. Then rinse it out. And your hair will never feel silkier, smoother, and tangle free. Yes!</li>
            <li> Great product. Especially for long hair. I apply it from the ears down (so my roots stay clean longer and not greasy or weighed down)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner! I have all-over color and partial highlights to cover the grey in my hair. On top of that, I wash (hard water too), blow dry and flat-iron every day - my hair takes a beating. I was a month overdue for a trim when I ordered this in February, and my hair was in horrible shape. This made a huge difference from the time I received it, to my next hair appointment two weeks later. I&#x27;ve continued to use it and my hair is soft, silky, and holding up better to the abuse to which I subject it daily. My hair never feels weighed down, the conditioner rinses clean, no residue and has a nice, fresh scent. The scent is light too - my hair smells nice all day, but it is subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many different conditioners - you name it, from salon to drugstore, I&#x27;ve tried most of them. This is the best I&#x27;ve found, and I intend to stick with it. A little goes a very long way - I&#x27;m just shy of two months into this container, and I still have about 10 days or so left. I have a lot of hair (it&#x27;s fine though), and it is just below my shoulders. Slightly more than a quarter-sized dollop is plenty - I use a comb to get it all the way through and found I use less that way, without sacrificing results.</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff initially because I damaged my hair from coloring way to much recently. I had a conditioning treatment at a salon and that worked WONDERS, but I dont have the time to go to a salon (or the $$) but this conditioning treatment is definately a close second. Leave it on for 5 minutes after you wash your hair in the shower...and when you get out your hair feels so rich and soft. It repaired my hair just how I would expect a rich conditioner should :)</li>
            <li> My favorite! I have VERY blonde hair. I use &amp;#34;Sun-In&amp;#34;. This product keeps my hair soft &amp; moist instead of dry.</li>
            <li> Leaves my dry chemically treated hair soft and supple. Great product for the price. Does a much better job than more expensive conditioners I have tried.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to buy this creme and It&#x27;s an excellent purchase to condition damage and dry hair...but It&#x27;s not a \\&quot;miracle cream\\&quot; (I confess I was expecting my damage hair after using it to look like the hair form a Pantene&#x27;s ad but that didn&#x27;t happened) But It is softer and very easy to comb and It has been a great improvement for my hair. It smells a little bit too much like olive oil to me but it&#x27;s not bad (my super-picky husband haven&#x27;t say anything about it so I&#x27;m sure is not strong).&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ll keep using it and I may buy the shampoo :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long, coarse, extremely thick hair that has been colored, blown dry, and straightened many, many times.  Needless to say, all of that left it in not-so-great shape, so I had been looking for a conditioner that would help my hair look and feel healthier.  It took me quite awhile, but I eventually found this product, and I love it!  The very first time I used it, I noticed a difference immediately in that my hair was much softer, shinier, and easy to get a brush through.      It truly looks and feels healthier, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that has had that result.  It may be a bit on the pricey side (at least for me), but I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s got overworked/overprocessed hair.</li>
            <li> Before buying this conditioner, I read the other people&#x27;s reviews saying what a great product it was. I bought it based on the ratings it received from everyone else, but still remained somewhat skeptical that this would also have the same dramatic effect on my hair.     Let me start off by saying that my hair is fairly long (down to the middle of my back), extremely dry, unmanageable, tangles very easily and generally feels like straw most of the time. I have been coloring it for many many years which could possibly have something to do with the lackluster condition it&#x27;s in now. I&#x27;d previously tried a lot of different store bought conditioners which I had very little or no success with. Admittedly I would try to find what was on sale at the time which usually involved the cheaper brands, but even then you would think that maybe one of them would have worked at some point, right?    There would be many occasions when I washed my hair and I would be standing there for 5 minutes afterward trying to get a comb through it. When I eventually did manage to untangle it, it seemed to knot up straight away again so drying it was not a pleasant experience. I would have to switch the hairdryer off on many occasions just to separate my brush from the knotted hair that had magically appeared again. AAARRGH!!!    I applied Loreal Natures Therapy conditioner to my hair for the first time last night. I left it on for the entire duration of my shower (about 5 minutes). Even while rinsing it out I could tell that the condition of my hair had improved considerably. It felt like silk. When I ran a comb through it afterward I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was. While drying it with the hairdryer, not once did I have a single knot in my hair at all!!! I kept thinking at any moment that it was going to get tangled up, but no, not once. I was actually smiling while drying it and almost couldn&#x27;t wait to see the end results. When I had finished, it looked like I had just stepped out of a professional salon. It was silky smooth, hardly a stray hair in sight. Sometimes I would have to straighten afterward just to tame it, but there is really no need to now. It&#x27;s now the day after and I can&#x27;t stop touching it and running my hands through it....just because I can! It&#x27;s great haha.    I am extremely pleased with this product and so glad I eventually found something to nourish my hair properly without spending an enormous amount of money. I encourage anyone to buy this product to try it out. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed. Thank you to all of the other people who wrote a review before me. If it wasn&#x27;t for your positive reviews I would still be tearing my hair out and getting frustrated.    Don&#x27;t hesitate....buy this product now if you want salon hair every day!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It does a great job. I just purchased this for my sister who was having dry, fly away hair and she said hers is doing much better.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT conditioner, especially when used regularly.  I have very fine hair, and it leaves it well-conditioned without being oily.</li>
            <li> I used this years ago &amp; couldn&#x27;t find it.  So glad I found it here.  A little goes a long way so be careful or you&#x27;ll be rinsing forever!  It makes my mature longish colored hair feel and look like it did in my 20&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Weighs down my fine hair and left it staticky...would not recommend. Suggest trying something that costs a little bit more since this is inexpensive you are getting what you pay for</li>
            <li> The best conditioner I have tried! I&#x27;ve worked for a popular beauty supply store and tried hundreds of products for hair. I also come from a family of cosmetologists. This conditioner was most popular with professionals that shopped in our store. I used it for years until I left that job and switched to some other products. What a mistake. With any other product, I had dry, frizzy straw like hair. I went through many shampoos, conditioners, oils, you name it. Nothing could compare to this conditioner. Within a week of switching back to this, my hair is softer, more moisturized and my frizz has calmed down immensely. This product works well on my long, fine, straight hair as well as my daughters curls and my husbands coarse curly hair. A little goes a long way here and you will be left with silky hair after washing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now.  Honestly, I think that it&#x27;s a little bit better than   regular pharmacy conditioners. After using it, it does give a bit cremier and richier feeling.   But it hasn&#x27;t dramatically improved the condition of my hair.    Also, I&#x27;ve found it very inconvenient of all the turning that I need to do to open and close the lid.    It&#x27;d been a lot easier if it came in a pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> I have done every bad thing you can do to your hair: japanese blow out, highlights, lowlights,... name it, i&#x27;ve done it.  My hair was never horrible, but I am always looking for that miracle product. I used everything: Kerastase, Ojon, Wen, F. Fekay, ...  And THEN I tried Nature&#x27;s Therapy.   Not that I don&#x27;t care about prices, but seriously, forget about the prices: this thing is better than Kerastase (I think it rinses out better - not leaving my hair feeling heavy or oily) and way better than other products I have tried.   My advise for even better result is to towel dry your hair before you apply it (my hairdresser told me that it helps with the flyaways - and it really does) and leave it for at least 5 min with a plastic cap. DONE!   I will keep my eyes and ears open for the next big thing, but for now, this product is my favorite.  Well done, L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
            <li> The first time I was introduced to this product was when my hairstylist used it on me as a conditioning treatment in the salon and I have been using it ever since. I have really dry, processed hair and this stuff is like a miracle product leaving it softer than I ever thought possible. It smells great and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Have you colored, hilighted, lowlighted, permed or used a blow-dryer &#x27;till your do fried up crispy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you at the point that you absolutely can&#x27;t get a wide-tooth-comb through your hair after you shampoo it -- even with tons of conditioner still in your hair? (Not to mention that you put off washing it, because you know what a trial it has become?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOREAL Natures Therapy Mega Moisture Nurturing Creme for Very Dry, Chemically Processed Hair is a CURE beyond belief. Once you use it, you will actually look forward to washing your hair, because every time you use this amazing product your hair will seem to improve to another level of perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are few conditioners that I have used that can make this claim. The price and performance make this something you can&#x27;t afford not to try before you have to get that pixie haircut that seems like your only solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products, really expensive ones and this surpases all of them by far! once I started using it (about four years ago) I haven&#x27;t stop! It&#x27;s wonderful for dyed hair, leaves it soft, manageable and shiny!</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for about five years now--someone at the beauty supply store raved about it, saying that it has similar ingredients to the Kerastase line (made by Loreal).  She said that nothing else in the Naturals line was outstanding--just this conditioner.  I was a little skeptical because I&#x27;m used to paying more than this price point for my hair products.  But, I completely fell in love with it after the first time!  It is a very moisturizing conditioner for those of us with color treated hair, and is excellent if you really need to repair some damage.  I have color treated (blonde) my hair for years and my stylist always raves about the condition it is in.  I believe that part of this is due to this product.    With that said, I only was my hair about twice a week, using this conditioner.  I think if one used this everyday, it might weigh hair down.  But, I can&#x27;t say that for sure.</li>
            <li> i ordered the conditioner after reading the review thinking it will make my hair little more conditioned and silky.  it didn&#x27;t make any difference even though I put it in my hair, wrapped in warm towel for more than 30 min.  Maybe it will be better effective to someone who&#x27;s hair is thinner or didn&#x27;t have much chemical processing.  I don&#x27;t think it was worth or effective more than store bought conditioner such as pantene or others.  for the info, i color and magic straighten my hair, but rarely use tools.</li>
            <li> It is a rinse out product...not optimal and very greassy! coats my shower with grease or goose grease...&lt;br /&gt;There are other conditioners that I have. It does condition it&#x27;s just a little too geassy for me.</li>
            <li> I keep it on for a few minutes in the shower in a shower cap and it does wonder for my dyed hair! I use once a week and it makes my hair so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 10 years now. Yes, I said 10 years. Every now and then I mix in a new product to my regimen just to trick my hair a little before it gets too used to the same product. But I always come to my handy dandy trusted conditioner. My hair is and always has been curly. I don&#x27;t colour or process my hair and it is naturally kind of an orange/light brown/blonde colour. I&#x27;ve been using this product since my swim team days in high school a long time ago and honestly I&#x27;ve yet to find a product that conditions my hair the way this one does. (I sometimes used to be too lazy to wash my hair every day after coming out of the pool and I literally could just put this in there and it would recondition it like a dream.) I use it as a leave-in, just mixed with a little bit of water, and I apply it to my hair in the shower from the roots to the ends. Every day that I style my hair it is with this product only. I would say I use it at the very least 3 times a week. (To style my hair I wash it with water so it technically doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair forever.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been moving toward more natural products lately and am trying to find something with less chemicals and no silicone (amodimethicone is a silicone) that works and feels just like this does. I&#x27;m slightly apprehensive because as I said, I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for almost a decade and I&#x27;ve gone through every possible other product in the interim without ever finding anything like this. For me, the magic is in the consistency as I find that A. it doesn&#x27;t ever ever ever leave my hair feeling crunchy and B. the softness, condition, and detangling ability is truly unmatched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we could all successfully appeal to L&#x27;oreal to lay off the parabens and silicone and other chemicals I would honestly never need to use anything else again lol.</li>
            <li> ok there is absolutely NOTHING like this conditioner... It doesnt matter how dry your hair is.  When you put it on its like silk.. It makes your hair Creamy and slippery.. and yummy!!!  Then when you rinse it out.. it rinses clean but doesnt rinse out \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot;.  You know how your hair gets when its stripped.  You can easily run a COMB through your hair after using this product. You will never find a better conditioner for your hair.  I just wished you could find it in Wal Mart.  I think you can also buy this at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store.  The price is simular minus the shipping.</li>
            <li> Have purchased before and will continue to buy. My daughter is an ALL STAR cheerleader and uses lots of hairspray for her hair poof. This is the only product that gets her hair feeling SOFT again and clean with no trouble. LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> leaves hair dull and sticky</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle to me. My hair feels like silk and doesn&#x27;t tangle. My long  hair was in knots from not combing it for a long time, and while my husband worked on it for a couple of hours, I was reading a long hair care forum and this product was mentioned.  I ordered it right away, and it is everything they said it would be. My long hair feels like silk, my split ends seem to be gone, and I hardly need to comb it. I was afraid that it would make my thin hair flat with no body to it, but that is not the case at all. This is a truly remarkable product.</li>
            <li> This is a thick conditioner that is great for long, thick, or frizzy hair.  I use it about once a week as a &amp;#34;deep conditioner&amp;#34;.  It smells great and always leaves my hair smooth and detangled.</li>
            <li> Thick, rich and works very well to tame wild hair. Works great for my long, thick, wavy hair which I like to flat iron straight</li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t weight down my fine hair but definitely helps with the frizz and damage from bleaching.  Every time I use this I have a good hair day.  And the best part is, it is so inexpensive for a huge tub.  You can&#x27;t always rely on reviews here on Amazon but this one is legit!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for corse hair.  I use it 3 times per week and my ends are much less brittle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so fantastic. I have tried over 30 (Humectress, Macadameia, etc) different deep conditioners for my very dry/frizzy/poofy/damaged hair and this is by far the best. It doesn&#x27;t make it greasy and the ends look so much better. Just make sure to wash it out throughly. Also, the matching shampoo does improve the effectiveness of this deep conditioner. I straighten/curl and/or blow dry my hair almost every day and this restores it to health.  I recommend this to anyone and everyone. It was originally recommended to me by my hair stylist. My grandmother, mother and several of my friends use it now. My boyfriend now uses it on his hair as well!</li>
            <li> From the moment I rinsed out Nature&#x27;s Therapy conditioning creme, I could tell something felt off.  My wet hair felt dry rather than the silky smooth texture you hope for after an intensive conditioner.  After I blew my hair out, it was confirmed - my hair was dry and felt like straw.  I also tested out the Nature&#x27;s Therapy shampoo.  I highlight my hair and there is a fine balance between under-moisturizing and over-moisturizing.  If this sounds like your hair, skip this product and go straight to the L&#x27;Oreal Professional line.  It&#x27;s been the most consistently amazing for my hair and strikes the perfect balance for locking in moisture and silkiness.  I usually use L&#x27;Oreal Professional Intense masque as a conditioner but I had trouble tracking it down and thought I would try something new.  Nature&#x27;s Therapy was recommended to me as a lower-cost alternative offering similar results.  Unfortunately, both the Nature&#x27;s Therapy shampoo and conditioning creme ended up in the garbage.  I&#x27;d recommend investing in the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Intense line rather than taking a gamble with this product.</li>
            <li> Good deep conditioner. Really helps my dry damaged hair. Who knows if it&#x27;s actually treating it or it&#x27;s just coating it with products. Either way I like the way it feels after</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this deep conditioner for a few years now. I typically use it once a week, and it&#x27;s the best conditioner for my hair that I&#x27;ve ever found. (Including alllll sorts of expensive salon brands.) My whole life, I&#x27;ve had tangly, curly, frizzy hair. I also highlight it (bleach). And I straighten it a few times a week with a blow-dryer and iron. So you could say it&#x27;s had some damage done to it! Nonetheless, I have pretty long, healthy-looking hair. Even my professor in cosmetology school has commented on my surprisingly healthy hair despite my coloring and heat damage. And at the end of the day, as long as it looks good and isn&#x27;t breaking off, I&#x27;m a happy girl! This product detangles and make my hair feel baby soft. I usually leave it in for around 20 minutes, on damp hair, and wrap my hair up in a bun so the ends get thoroughly saturated. When I rinse it out (with cold water, to seal the cuticle and lock in moisture), I have the hair of my dreams. I should get a check from L&#x27;Oreal for this lol.</li>
            <li> I HAVE LOOKED ENDLESSLY FOR SOMETHING TO MAKE MY HAIR HEALTHIER. I HAVE DRY AND DAMAGED HAIR DUE TO THIS CALIFORNIA POLLUTED AIR AND STRAIGHTENING EVERY WEEK AND COLORING IT. AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT EVERYONE NOTICED HOW MUCH BETTER MY HAIR LOOKED, HOW SILKY IT FELT. THANKS LOREAL, GOOD JOB!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this as my conditioner for a few months now. What I have found is that it works best if you use it to towel dry hair and keep it in for at least 10 minutes and then rinse it. Additional heat treatment, like a straighter really helps bring out the shine in the hair. So far I love this, but i wish there was something that worked quicker (and not be $$$) as I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to sit in shower for 10 minutes every time!! But i guess you have to try it to see how it works for your hair.</li>
            <li> I only use L Oreal Natures Therapy Mega Moisture Nurturing Creme. It makes my hair shiny and silky. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> The cream rinse itself is really a 5 star product but a person usually has wet hands when using cream rinse. The container is slippery when wet and the cover is nearly impossible to get off if your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  All other conditioners leave my hair either too weighed down or not moisturized enough.  I use a small amount of this every single day after shampooing and it always provides me with the same outstanding results.  I haven&#x27;t seen it in the stores lately and am worried that Loreal is taking it off the market.  I am stocking up now!</li>
            <li> excellent product, I gave it to my wife and have been amazed, leaves her shiny, soft and manageable hair, thanks!</li>
            <li> this is simply a very nice conditioner comparable to the macadamia oil one. I have them both and I like My natures way just as much. Plus it smells so good; Its noticeable too, my family and boyfriend always tell me how my hair smells so nice : )</li>
            <li> I really love this product ,i will buying for ever ,makes my hair very shining and soft,and the smell is amazing .</li>
            <li> I love this product , I use it as a conditioner and my hair is soft and shiny , my 2 daughters used it and love it 2 ..</li>
            <li> I have very course, very thick, and very curly hair naturally.  I dye my hair all different colors from time to time and put super strength relaxers on my hair to make it straight and have done so for over 10 years. I have bleached my hair to straw, killed my hair in heavily clorinated pools and hot tubs, damaged it with hot irons....etc   At one point I had done so much to it, it felt rubbery and very weak.  I am one of those wild and crazy will try anything once with my hair kinda people.  Over the years I have spent hundreds of dollars buying this new line and that new line of hair products even ordering them off tv.  Anyone remember when CHER did LORI DAVIS hair products? haha I cant even remember some of the expensive brands in those beautiful bottles that looked so good on my shelf, not on my hair that I&#x27;ve tried because they never worked and they didnt last on the market.  I do remember going to walgreens and drug stores and spending 80 to 100 dollars for the shampoo, conditioner, mouse, frizz control serum...etc many diff times on many diff products.  Then I was at Sally&#x27;s buying more crap to put on my hair and the sales girl said your hair is so damaged here try this and sold me a dollar trial size of this conditioner about 5 years ago.....  I went home and dyed my hair, then used that conditioner, left it on 5 minutes and when I was done my hair felt SO AMAZING, so STRONG and So SOFT!  I went back the next day and bought every jar they had on the shelf because I was so afraid they would quit makaing it and I knew it was unlike anything else I ever tried. The sales girl laughed and said it was a top seller and they wouldnt stop making it, well she was right, its still on the market today and its still the only conditioner I ever use and my hair has never felt dry, frizzy, weak, or even rubbery ever again since that day.   NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS, yes my shelf looks empty in the bathroom without a zillion bottles that don&#x27;t work but that just gives me moremoney to have fun with!</li>
            <li> I like it, I use it as a regular hair conditioner and it leaves my hair amazingly soft!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It leaves my hair soft, detangles my knots, leaves my hair feeling soft and shinny. After trying this product, I am very satisfied with the results. From now on this will be the only conditioner I use on my hair.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner makes hair feel like silk.  Smells like Jolly Ranchers. This is great to use following a clarifying wash.  Restores hair to a managable condition.  Happy with the seller and delivery.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the reviews and it more than lives up to them. If you have permed hair or are transitioning from permed to natural you will want this in your hair care regimen.  It smells delightful, and leaves my hair so soft and moisturized.  This one is a keeper and the price is great too.</li>
            <li> I remember picking this stuff up a long time ago when I was working at a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. I was looking for something to repair my badly damaged hair. At the time, my hair was severely dry and damaged due to constant bleaching, dying, razor cutting, heat styling, etc. This product (along with the others in the set) made my hair feel lovely and healthy again. I was really amazed at how soft and shiny it made my hair. After all of this time, it&#x27;s still the best hair conditioning product that I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve just brushed out the dreadlocks I&#x27;ve had for almost a year and plan on using this to repair my coarse, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner and cheap! I had damaged hair due to highlighs and this made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> If you have really bleached, processed, dry hair like me, this stuff is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your hair feeling really moisturized, and it smells nice and fresh. I recommend doing a normal shampoo/conditioner routine, then leaving this on for 2-5 minutes like a regular conditioner, especially on the ends of your hair. Make sure your hair is wet before you use it, then gently massage it into your ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also- I bought a 16 oz and it lasted me about 4 months. You don&#x27;t need a ton of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this stuff works wonders. I&#x27;m getting another 16 oz now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. Now my daughter uses it also . Makes your hair so silky smooth , bouncy and full of life! we both process are hair and this stuff really helps to restore the moisture !</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for years.  I&#x27;ve tried many deep conditioning masques, especially the very expensive salon ones and find nothing compares to good old Loreal.  Great find.  I sometimes use this as my daily conditioner, it gives my hair plenty of body even without leaving it in for long.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and brittle from 30 years of processing and heat products. I have used this twice and my hair feels like silk. I wet my hair a bit and then lather in this &amp;#34;dressing.&amp;#34; I leave it about 5 minutes before I wash my hair with my violet shampoo and conditioner which does nothing for the dryness and it seems to make it dry too. Anyway the past 2 times I have washed my hair I use this first and I&#x27;ve never been happier with my hair</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!  I use a small amount as a daily conditioner, or you can slather it on and leave for a while for deep conditioning.  Nice smell.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this first as a recommendation from my hair dresser (and paid a lot more). Now i buy it from Amazon and use it every day. I can&#x27;t use any other conditioner, it really keeps my hair conditioned. Worth every penny. The tub lasts me about a year.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!!!! I have damaged hair from coloring it platinum, and this stuff has made a HUGE difference! My hair is much more visibly healthy and it&#x27;s sooo soft! This is a miracle hair repair treatment!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been getting highlights for years and any product that lightens hair will also damage hair. This really helps.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day as a conditioner.  I have highlighted long hair and it was very dry at the ends. I apply this whenever I wash my hair after the shampoo ( head and shoulders), and I swear I only need a tiny ammount of the product, something like a tea spoon.  My hair melts !! It dissolves knots instantly..   I only apply at the ends because I tend to have oil scalp.    My hair looks fabulous! You won´t regret buying this product!  a 16oz will probably last 6 or more months. the product is the best I have ever tried so far.    You will feel it immediately!! Your hair will get very soft and shiny!    No more dry and damaged hair for me folks! I finally found my product :)</li>
            <li> This arrived so fast!! I lighten my blonde hair and am often concerned with my damaged ends. This conditioner left my hair feeling very healthy and soft. I will be using this regularly now.</li>
            <li> My roots are oily, yet my ends are totally dry.  This conditioner I use only on my ends and only once a week as a treatment.  This conditioner helped soften my hair well for two days after use, but then faded.  I&#x27;m also not very fond of the scent.  It smells very strongly of pears, artificial pears.  Luckily, this scent fades and I&#x27;m fine.  I also really like the texture.  It&#x27;s very thick, rich and creamy.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is just about perfect for anyone with processed hair. After I use it, my hair is completely smooth and silky and not at all like I&#x27;ve been bleaching it for way too long! It lasts a long time since it&#x27;s a big jar and you don&#x27;t have to use very much. I don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s not in a squeeze bottle but I could see some people caring about that. The smell is really innocuous too...but really, even if it weren&#x27;t, I&#x27;d still use it because it&#x27;s that good! I doubt I&#x27;ll ever switch conditioners for as long as I&#x27;m bleaching my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long colored and dry hair and I use the hair dryer a lot. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and it works very well. It leaves my hair alive again. I usually mix it with olive oil or Agan oil and works better. I recommend it!   And it arrived very very soon, only in 3 days and was free shipping. Great!</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a good deep conditioner that actually worked, after many failed attempts this product was recommended to me by someone at Sally&#x27;s. This is the ONLY deep conditioner that I&#x27;ve noticed makes a marked difference in how soft and shiny my hair is. And it leaves your hair smelling amazing</li>
            <li> I purchased this a week ago and started using it the day after it arrived.  Wow!  My hair which usually is tangled and snarled this time of year was smooth! What a shock.  But a good shock.  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days now and my hair feels softer and is so much more manageable.  And it shines.  I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I have natural afro hair and this product THIS product makes it feel like baby hair. Even after a couple days my hair feel great and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use this product instead of conditioner because it leaves my hair very soft and manageable .&lt;br /&gt;It has helped in managing the frizz of my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and love the price.  It&#x27;s cheaper on amazon than at my local Sally&#x27;s.  My daughter and I both have long hair.  We spend a lot of time in the sun and the ocean.  My daughter also is on the swim team.  We both use it once or twice a week and it keeps our hair shiny and healthy without weighing it down.  I do have to be careful not to put it right on my scalp or I will be oily.  I usually apply it about half way down my hair, comb it through and let it sit for the duration of my shower ~ 5 minutes or so and then rinse well.  My hair is always silky smooth and easy to manage.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. This is the second time I am ordering this. The first time I brought this was in the beginning of December 2011. And I am just odering it again. So it lasted me about 4 months. I use this every week after I wash my hair and it is amazing. It replenished the lost moisture in my hair. I recently dyed my hair(first time) and my hair felt mad dry when washing it out. When I washed my hair with the shampoo and used the conditioner provided i used this and my hair felt better. This is a really good moisturizer and it is a really good price you&#x27;re getting it for. When i bought it in December it was a few dollars cheaper but it is still a good price because it is a huge container and you don&#x27;t even use that much and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good conditioner for the money.  Slightly heavy/oily to apply, but it rinses out easily and seems to help my extremely damaged hair hang in there for another month.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and ordered this because I use Kerastase but simply can&#x27;t afford it right now.  I tried an organic shampoo and conditioner and they are leaving my hair more dry and wiry, it&#x27;s terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the set with the shampoo from the same line, and I agree with the reviewer who wrote that the first time she used it was good but the second time was great.  Today was my second use and my hair is really lustrous and feels fully conditioned, as it does with Kerastase.  I think my hair texture was just so trashed from the crappy products I&#x27;ve been using that it took a couple uses to regain the textural integrity of the hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it smells like watermelon jolly rachers which makes me feel 14 again, and that doesn&#x27;t hurt either!  Kidding aside, only negatives are that there is a slight residual feeling of &#x27;product&#x27; on the skin around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I&#x27;m very grateful that tightening my belt doesn&#x27;t mean my hair has to look like shi*.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and by its very nature it can tend toward being dry and coarse. I have used the the Mega Moisture Nurturing Creme religiously since I first discovered it almost three years ago. It keeps my hair from getting too dry and helps to define the curl. And it smells great to boot! I&#x27;ve tried other products that are far more costly and ended up making my hair feel like straw so this has definitely become one of my HG products. It&#x27;s not always easy to find in retail stores so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing conditioner. I have tried everything for frizzy hair, and this really works. It is very heavy, so if you have oily hair I would not use it. Ideal for dry, frizzy and color treated hair.</li>
            <li> The new formula is so bad, I loved the old formula with the yellow jar. This one left my hair stiff and tangled after deep conditioning. They also added isopropyl alcohol to ingredients which is very drying to have. I have relaxed hair</li>
            <li> I first bought this conditioner from a beauty supply house a few years ago and was glad to find it on Amazon.com.  It&#x27;s the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve gone out of my way to make sure I always have some on hand.  I use just a small dab every morning when I shower and wash my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to be highly effective!</li>
            <li> After a misguided attempt at going bleach blonde... then grey, light pink, dark brown and back to black, all in 14 days while processing my hair at home with no previous experience (oops) I thought my hair was going to start falling out.  Actually it was so brittle that it was starting to break off, and my normally glossly hair felt like a brillo pad.  I went into Sallys looking for help and the salesperson directed me to this.  I didnt think anything could help but I was so wrong.  After using for a few weeks my hair has never felt so healthy.  This stuff is amazing, didnt think products that could make such a drastic impact like this one actually existed.  I was very pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> I love this product , I used it for many years already, is so hard to found it in stores but for a color process hair is the best moisturize cream ; is keep my hair shiny and soft. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is carotene treated, so I use this conditioner. It leaves my hair silky, shinny and totally smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the best deep conditioner I have found. It makes my hair feel really soft and silky, and I only use it about once every week or 2.</li>
            <li> this works amazing in your hair especially for dry hair. and it smells amazing wish they sold it in stores not just beauty supplies</li>
            <li> No lies here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was silky smooth after my first use. I got several trial sizes in an order from Sally&#x27;s Beauty and was instantly hooked. My hair is moist and lovely. Sometimes, when my hair feels really dry and gross, I put this in and heat it for 10 minutes with a hairdryer on low. After rinsing, I let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with Aphogee&#x27;s Keratin 2-minute treatment. Best products ever.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good deep conditioner that does not make my hair heavy. This works really well.</li>
            <li> Really makes your hair feel great. I have very long hair and this make my hair look strong and healthy</li>
            <li> This creme saved my hair. I am 46 years old and twice I colored my hair, didn&#x27;t like it, then used a color remover to remove the color. Which basically bleaches the color away. Then I recolored on top of that. Bad idea and since I used to do hair, I should know better. Anyway, my hair was left a fried, damaged, pile of straw. Blow drying only made it worse. I tried other conditioners and oils, but nothing worked until I found this. OMG, my hair is soft, detangled and moisturized! I use it every time I shampoo. I put it on at the beginning of my shower and put a plastic cap over it. About once a week, I leave it on for about 30 minutes as a deep conditioner. This has saved my hair. I can actually run my fingers through it and I see less breakage of the damaged ends. My hair is dry to begin with so I know even when my damaged ends are long gone, I will still use this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a deep conditioner for your dried out, damaged hair, this is it.</li>
            <li> I order many things for my friends.  this was recommended by a friend (stylist who sells specific product lines in her salon) for another friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend who purchased the creme went to a known blow dry bar and her hair was burnt.  I referred her to my stylist friend and this product was recommended to repair her burnt, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner but I have to get rid of it. It&#x27;s making my hair fall out! I didn&#x27;t realize it has sulfates in it and eventhough it&#x27;s practically full it&#x27;s too late to return.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely one of the best conditioners I have ever used. It provides instant softness to my naturally frizzy, wavy AA hair. Over the years, I have become a hair product junkie-searching for the perfect shampoo, conditioner, flat iron, etc. Well, I&#x27;ve finally found the conditioner. I used the corresponding shampoo, but it wasn&#x27;t anything special. However, this conditioner has worked wonders and does the job when even the most expensive products couldn&#x27;t. Glad I found this one!</li>
            <li> This is the second time to purchase this conditioner and I love it so much. Loreal conditioner is the best conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> good but doesn&#x27;t really repair damaged hair.  I have hair damaged from highlighting and it didn&#x27;t do much.  smells good though</li>
            <li> The product arrived in an acceptable timeframe. The lid to the product was messily taped closed, giving it the appearance that it had been previously opened and resealed. The product itself works pretty well but not the best hair treatment I have used. Prob will not buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair was in shambles from some highly unrecommended Matrix shampoo/conditioner when I started using this product. That product left my hair so dry and horrid! This one came to the rescue. It&#x27;s really done wonders in terms of making my hair more manageable, especially right after the shower for brushing. My hair also doesn&#x27;t sleep overnight and turn into a tangled rat nest as much as the other product used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a re-purchaser of this product and will likely continue doing so, except I&#x27;m now just testing out the L&#x27;Oreal Prof Absolut Repair conditioners after it was recommended to me. Since that product is 2x+ the price, it&#x27;ll have to knock this out of the park for me to switch for good. We&#x27;ll see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s keeping me from giving this the extra star? Packaging (I know it&#x27;s a masque, but since I use it as a conditioner, I wish it came in a bottle) and that the texture is on the runny side. As a result, a lot of it gets wasted down the drain when I&#x27;m trying to apply it. Finally, the scent isn&#x27;t my favourite, but it&#x27;s not offensive--a little like artificial apple scent.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, curly, dry, crazy, red-brown hair.  This conditioner comes closest to Kerastase 3 mask, and it&#x27;s a fraction of the price.  It&#x27;s hard to tame my hair, but this really works for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I had the same experience as other reviews.  It does the same job as other less expensive Loreal conditioners.  It is not bad, but it is not amazing..</li>
            <li> In spite of the cheap price comparatively with other hair masks, it does a lot more better job. My hair feel soft, easy to brush, and shiny afterwords. It also has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AFTER A RECOMMENDATION FROM ANOTHER AMAZON REVIEWER WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHAT TO DO TO A EXTREMELY DAMAGED HAIR LIKE MINE.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT FOR THE LAST 4 MONTHS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE JOYCO SHAMPOO, CONDITIONER AND TREATMENT, IT LEAVES MY HAIR SOFT AND IT&#x27;S RECOVERING SLOWLY., BUT I CAN&#x27;T SAY IS DUE TO THIS PRODUCT ALONE.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, I use a small amount on the ends of my hair daily.  My advice is to probably switch between other moisturizers every so often so that your hair doesn&#x27;t become too accustomed to this one.  You do get a lot of product for your money and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> Good conditioner, works well with color treated hair.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. But be cautious of over using it. The chemicals or artificial silicone will weigh down hair, and have tons of built in \\&quot;build up\\&quot; on hair. When i used this my hair was unbelievably soft i couldnt stop touching my hair! After three times of using is almost daily.....When my hair was wet it would feel sticky...and when it was dry it would feel a bit waxy. I stop using it and used a clarifying shampoo to remove this build up. Use adequately  once every 2 weeks should be good. I love this! I think i just got carried away. lol :]</li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner and really didn&#x27;t notice a difference from any other deep conditioner.  Constantly looking for Holy Grail products, the trial &amp; error phase was becoming too expensive.  I have &#x27;multiracial&#x27; hair, mostly type 3b curly hair, with 3c in the crown and 3a in the nape.  After researching the ingredients, I decided to try a homemade deep conditioner instead with natural ingredients such as coconut oil or coconut milk, organic raw honey, fresh avocado or avocado oil and olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also decided to learn more about moisture basics to see what were the biggest contributors to dry hair.  The 4-part series on YouTube regarding moisture basics by the author of \\&quot;The Science of Black Hair\\&quot; was very informative.</li>
            <li> Perfect masque for use once every one or two weeks. Smells FANTASTIC. I wish they made a body wash or lotion that smelled like this. The entire Nature&#x27;s Therapy line smells so good and works even better!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair look shinier and silkier. I have thick black hair and with this product I can feel my hair softer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. A hair stylist recommended it to me to help with frizz and it does. It keeps my hair in great condition and I go nuts when I run out of it because nothing else comes close to working as well</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and coarse, so I am always hunting for a thick conditioner treatment. After reading all the raving reviews about this product, I decided to give it go. Honestly, it&#x27;s just slightly thicker from your regular conditioner. It&#x27;s not bad per se, but I wouldn&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, and shinny after every use. I highly recommend it for what it does for your hair and the value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now. The results are FANTASTIC! I purchased this product to substitute Matrix biolage deep conditioner (which is another great deep condiotioner, just a little pricey). I have VERY curly, frizzy, shoulder length hair, with quite a bit of damage from all my straightening. I typically leave this in my hair for 10-15 minutes. Just recently I left it in all night and it worked amazingly! My hair came out more shiny and smooth. My curls were more defined, and much easier to work with. I&#x27;d recommend using it once a week and letting it sit for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I have badly damaged, dry and processed hair from a poorly done ombre -yet I refuse to cut my locks. It took me long time to grow my hair out to boob-length so I was desperate to keep my length. I am SO happy I found this product. I use it as just as directed. Its been a month of using it a little more than once a week and my hair is no longer dry and breaking off at the ends. My hair stays soft and untangled throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat I will point out is that while I stopped using the product on vacation my hair temporarily returned to its previous state of dryness. So I can&#x27;t say for sure that it truly improves the health of your hair, but over continuous use will fulfill its promises.</li>
            <li> I got this based on all the great reviews and it absolutely delivers.  My hair is just longer than shoulder length, very fine and the ends are quite damaged from bleaching. After I used this product and blow dry, my hair feels smoother and looks shiny even when not using any other products.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Great stuff for my poor dead hair, but I&#x27;m going to write in all caps just so people pay attention. DON&#x27;T USE THIS IN THE BATHTUB, IT MADE MINE FREAKISHLY SLIPPERY AND YOU COULD GET HURT. As I said, wonderful conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a while but was excited to see I could order it online. I have highlights and this keeps my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The scent is reasonably light and pleasant, and it does a great job preventing split ends.  I use it in small quantity on the ends of my fine, frizzy hair and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down; it works equally well in larger quantity on my husband&#x27;s long, dry, super curly hair.  Highly recommend for anyone looking for a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> i say with out any hesitation this is an amazing product. I died my hair twice with in two months and then decided to perm it .Horrible idea i dont recommend it . My nail tech instructor recommended this to me and i tryed it . Im hooked i love it i had terribly dry frizzy hair that was hard to even comb. if you have these issue please try this you will love it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, its the best I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> Really glad I read the reviews here and bought this product.  I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair, it is so silky after just one use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions say to towel dry hair then apply.  I just used it in the shower -- washed my hair, squeezed out the water, put this on, finished the shower and then rinsed off.  Easy to use and great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks everyone for the great reviews -- A great product at a good price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this conditioner!  I have used every kind out there from expensive to inexpensive and this is by far THE best conditioner.  However I recently ordered from Amazon and the smell has changed dramatically...I am hoping it was just one bad one out of the bunch and not someone trying to change the product or get away with making it cheaper and selling it on amazon!</li>
            <li> Great Product. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an additional conditioner. I leave this in all day instead of rinsing it out as directed. This makes my hair super soft and silky and I love it!</li>
            <li> BEST CONDITIONER EVER !!!!!!!!!! I use this every time I wash my hair (every 3-4 days, I do wash my butt). I also have an old-school electric heat cap I plug-in. What I do is shampoo hair with L&#x27;Oreal Natures Therapy mega moisture shampoo towel dry and apply mega moisture conditioner; wrap hair in a plastic grocery bag and sit with my heat cap on or, sometime just go to bed with the conditioner in my hair wrap a towel on and in the morning I rinse. Hair Bio: Hispanic heritage, wavy if dried with head upside down, really straight if I use blow drier and round ceramic brush. Closer to thin hair than thick but, lots of hair. I also, have long hair almost to waist. Hope this review helps you. BEST CONDITIONER EVER!!!!</li>
            <li> Loving this conditioner. My friend recommended it who works in the beauty industry and let me tell you, I&#x27;ve bought it a few times since. Works wonders.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a swimmer and between the chlorine and sun streaks her hair was very brittle. This works like a charm! We cannot go without!</li>
            <li> THis is totally repairing the damage and dryness of my hair... I can totally see the difference  and am planning on using this permanently! highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wow this treatment is just the best!, not only lives tour hair looking soft and great, but it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Really like what it does in my hair. Good smell.</li>
            <li> not fun to leave in your hair for the recommended amount of time and it works okay as a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING. Best conditioner yet.. I will never use another conditioner again. I&#x27;m sold on this for life..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought this product at Sally&#x27;s beauty for 16 dollars. Bought it at Amazon for a few dollars cheaper is a big difference to me because I have highly damaged dry hair because I bleached my hair platinum blonde. After using this a few months, my hair feels almost at its normal state. I had to cut off half my hair, but of course the top parts of my hair were also dried out but weren&#x27;t breaking. So its not going to prevent your hair from breaking if its on the verge of breakage, but at least it help the stronger parts of your hair to restore back its dryness. I bought 4 of these on Amazon because I knew I want to continue to have soft silky hair again.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel sooo good.  My hair is dry and this conditioner really makes the difference.  I recommend it for all dry hair.</li>
            <li> I was not real impressed with this product.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel any better or have any improvement from using it.  I ended up giving it to my sister who seems to love it, but she has dry hair.</li>
            <li> I swim probably 4 times a week and use this product in my hair every time I get out of the pool.  It&#x27;s done wonders...my hair does not dry out anymore.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my hair. I color my hair and this makes it so much more manageable. Leave it on your hair for at least 2-3 minutes for best results.</li>
            <li> Great for bleached hair!  A little goes a long way!  Helps to nourish, strengthen and soften damaged hair.  It&#x27;s so much easier to get my long hair combed out after using this product.</li>
            <li> When I color my hair from a box I CHERISH the deep conditioner that comes with it and try to make it last because it does such a good job. I have always thought: &amp;#34;I wish they would sell this as a conditioner in a bottle&amp;#34; as my million dollar idea but THIS IS IT!!! I am so excited and stocking up now.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner for dry hair or when you go to Raging Waters, swimming in your pool, it removes the dryness!!!!</li>
            <li> After trying way too many products to help with damaged hair ( I swim a lot), this has truly been a life-saver.......or hair-saver.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and use it once a week. I apply about a teaspoon at a time and it makes my hair soft and a lot less frizzy. I have been using it for more than a year.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the positive customer reviews.  I have curly, dry and unruly hair.  When I opened the container, I was horrified by the nasty chemical aroma.  It did nothing to improve my hair, and it slicks the tub so badly that I almost lost my footing.  I contacted L&#x27;Oreal about a month ago and was sent a canned response asking for more information.  No one ever responded to my list of concerns.</li>
            <li> My hair was dark brown, then it was bleached, dyed red, then highlighted.  Needless to say, it was pretty dry after that.  It&#x27;s always been coarse and frizzy but after the dye it was like straw.  I tried many expensive conditioners before this product, and they were mostly useless. After using this conditioner for the first time, my hair feels soft and silky. I have zero frizz, no distressing straw-like texture, just pretty, silky red hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering how much cash I&#x27;ve dropped on high end products, I feel kind of dumb now. I will never stop using this great product, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Thank you, L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
            <li> I LOVE This stuff! It makes my dry, curly, color processed hair so soft and manageable. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair super silky and detangles easily!  Not too heavy on the hair either and the smell is lovely too!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used! You only need to put a little at the ends of your hair, that tub will last about 4 months. Will never use another conditioner!</li>
            <li> She was ready to cut her long hair, but I found this highly rated product and voile!  Its wonderful stuff!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Am about to order my second jar.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Leaves your hair feeling great and shiny...and smells great.</li>
            <li> Probably one of my favorite deep conditioners. My hair feels moisturized after using it. I usually leave it on a little longer than what the bottle directs (like 30 minutes to an hour) and my hair just soaks up this stuff. It smells pretty strongly fruity, but it&#x27;s probably one of the deep conditioners I keep returning to, because I know that it works. I also suffer from chronically dry hair, so this stuff has ben great for it!</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s excellent. Very pleased!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but its not a miracle worker. If you have damaged hair from heat styling tools like I do, using this product alone won&#x27;t make your hair healthy. This HELPS, but it can&#x27;t do the job alone.&lt;br /&gt;It does make my hair feel very soft when applying it and when I&#x27;m washing it out. Just don&#x27;t wash out ALL of the product, rinse your hair but leave a tiny bit in, enough to make it feel soft and slippery, but not weigh down your hair. I found this worked for me best. Another thing I found worked is to first wash hair with warm water, squeeze out th water, add this product(I only add it to the bottom half end of my hair since my ends are the most damaged), make my hair into a bunch and hold it with both of my hands to use the warmth of my hands to help it, leave like that for at least 4 minutes, then rise with COLD water. The cold water helps the hair follicles close and reduces frizz.&lt;br /&gt;After 5 uses I&#x27;m starting to see the difference, it is helping, but I don&#x27;t use it alone, after I towel dry my hair I apply a light anti-friz shine spray by treseme to make the ends look healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more heat styling tools on your hair! Not even a blow dryer unless it&#x27;s not hot air.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I don&#x27;t have very dry or chemically processed hair, anymore!  I found this conditioner several years ago, and now I won&#x27;t use anything else.  I used to try every expensive salon conditioner that stylists would recommend in search of something that truly made a difference on my very long hair.  People ask me what I do to make my hair so shiny and smooth, and this is the secret that I want to share!  I literally only get my hair cut 3 or 4 times a year (and my stylist thinks that I cheat on her) because I have so little breakage and split ends.  If its very humid or I want a little extra smoothing, I just rub a little melted coconut oil between my palms and through the ends.  This will change your hair!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever for super dry hair! Love it. Have been using it for many years now.</li>
