            <li>AND YOU&#x27;RE DEFINITELY GOOD TO GO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I FEEL GOOD.  </li>
            <li>but it brought out this gorgeous beach wave in my hair</li>
            <li>It is so good that it has earned a rating in my world of products.  </li>

            <li>I like a good lather</li>
            <li>, it was good</li>

            <li>amazing product.</li>
            <li>nothing amazing for the price</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>Whether you leave it on for a minute or 30, my hair is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is an amazing product with the power to detangle like no ohter I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I liked the name of the company.</li>
            <li>This is a nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, came on time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- has a nice scent</li>
            <li>I suggest a heat protector of some kind if you need to heat-style your hair</li>
            <li>There is nothing more to say I loved everything about this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and get knotted very easily so it would be nice if this condish made it easier to detangle</li>
            <li>It provides super slip, smells great and leaves my hair fully detangled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Added bonus is that it smells of my Beloved fave perfume Calyx:):)</li>
            <li>it leaves his curls very shiny and like in perfect condition :)</li>
            <li>But it took a while for me to think; wow, what a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M GOOD TO GO AND ENJOY MYSELF TO NO END.</li>
            <li>it would be nice if it held more ounces for the price it is at...</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I have ever used</li>
            <li>My hair is perfectly conditioned and soft after every use.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, it&#x27;s more natural than most stuff I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li>and it feels very cheap</li>
            <li>She has fine, blond hair that dries out, it&#x27;s amazing what a quarter size amount can do without build up or looking greasy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad she did.</li>
            <li>, you figure more is better.</li>
            <li>They are both phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Jessie&#x27;s seems to work better.</li>
            <li>This is the product I love the most for wearing my hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suggestions: DO NOT touch your hair as it is drying (I love touching my hair</li>
            <li>and I have my hands in it all day without noticing, but touching it causes it to expand more as it dries).</li>
            <li>Save your cash and buy Pantene or a better brand of conditioner at the S*lly store.</li>
            <li>And it smells devine :)</li>
            <li>I looked everywhere to choose the best product that wasn&#x27;t too expensive but had excellent results and this product exceeds my expectations!</li>
            <li>its okay</li>
            <li>its okay</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I put a healthy amount of this in my hair and then brush it out, then rinse.</li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>For my 3C biracial (black/white) curls, this product is okay.  </li>
            <li>I like the moisture content, but it&#x27;s just okay</li>
            <li>I will love this product until the end of the world.</li>
            <li>its okay not</li>
            <li>actually, it felt the best it&#x27;s felt in a looong time!  </li>
            <li>This product is the perfect balance of additional conditioning without the extra weight!  </li>
            <li>My children and I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love using this on my son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used what feels like thousands of deep conditioners and this is GREAT!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably best for those who are mixed or have hair textures in the 3&#x27;s or up.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this for home use.</li>
            <li>glad</li>
            <li>But I would recommend it for anybody with type 3 and type 4 curls.  :-)</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It really works great on all types of hair, as it states.</li>
            <li>I will b buying this over &amp; over I love the way my hair feels</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure as to how I could rate this product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this</li>
            <li>I LOVE the leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>She has had many comments and compliments.</li>
            <li>more than once a week.</li>
            <li>gave me ok moisture</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and am hooked.</li>
            <li>So glad I discovered it a year ago while living in London, UK.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try more products in this line.  </li>
            <li>Best Deep Conditioner i ever used ..love it â™¡</li>
            <li>the product (had for some time but first used today) that BEAT this hair into a tangle/frizz-free submission!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, silky, and smells beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Great product left my hair feeling amazing,</li>
            <li>Her hair is soft with strong curls and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>Great mild scent, pretty moisturizing</li>
            <li>It smells great and it leaves your hair really soft.</li>
            <li>*mostly* sulfate free</li>
            <li>I bought this product looking for something that would really give me some good conditioning</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need much and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is good, but it doesn&#x27;t really lather.  </li>
            <li>And it is absolutely TRUE!</li>
            <li>I have tried many conditioners, over the counter and professional, and Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner is the best I have found and best of all my girls are not allergic to it..</li>
            <li>When I read that it makes your hair easy to comb through when you immediately put it on your hair</li>
            <li>Easy to comb through (I use denman brush 5 rows).</li>
            <li>My hair felt like silk afterwards and it was so easy to detangles.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t help de-tangling my hair as easy as I would like.</li>
            <li>Everytime I get out the shower I have the same beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>Very good for hair but has a tendency to dry it out.</li>
            <li>Quick Delivery!</li>
            <li>I started using this product line and saw a huge change.</li>
            <li>The huge tub of it costs $2.50 at wally world.</li>
            <li>BUT I WASH MY HAIR WITH A LIGHT SHAMPOO</li>
            <li>So, she is happy, and is obviously is moisturizing quite well.</li>
            <li>I always get it from Amazon.com because of the free shipping with Prime-</li>
            <li>and I can run my fingers through it comfortably.</li>
            <li>Honestly I wanna use the whole line now because I remember I got  a sample of the leave in at Rickys</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both so smooth I don&#x27;t have to use a leave in conditioner at all, and I no longer have to tug tangles out of the ends.</li>
            <li>This product is great especially for curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Now, I am at the point where I can run my hands through my hair AND it feels so flipping soft, i feel like this is must what it be like to have &#x27;good hair&#x27;</li>
            <li>You know how you love the way your hair looks when you first get out of the shower, with this product and the leave-in, I could have that look allday.</li>
            <li>cause I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking for the holy grail conditioner when I decided to try Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner, there are many wonderful conditioners that I&#x27;ve found that work well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner feels amazing on both my fine baby-straight hair and the wild unruly patches.  </li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best deep conditioner for my thirsty hair!</li>
            <li>There is no buildup and it feels clean and weightless.</li>
            <li>This by far is one of the best deep conditioners out.</li>
            <li>but it rinses clean vs doing a DIY oil treatment).  </li>
            <li>This stuff comes in a tiny charge but its powerful, works and smells great.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft and leaves it looking so healthy!</li>
            <li>And so far I love it!</li>
            <li>and I might even buy the full liter size since I love it that much.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and makes your hair feel ultra soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading tons of good reviews, not just from \\&quot;mixed\\&quot; chicks but from non mixed women of color.</li>
            <li>It is true.</li>
            <li>, it leaves her hair nice and soft</li>
            <li>her curls really do look and feels healthy.</li>
            <li>Make sure the section your working on is completely soaked so that gel can go on and easily get combed through with your Denman brush.</li>
            <li>Make sure the section your working on is completely soaked so that gel can go on and easily get combed through with your Denman brush.</li>
            <li>I have extremely curly hair that is in great shape.</li>
            <li>It works okay, but I like the Deep Conditioner better.  </li>
            <li>You can leave it on for a deeper conditioner or just rinse it quickly if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li>This deep conditioner really makes the hair feels great.</li>
            <li>This product is super drying - has anyone else noticed this?  </li>
            <li>think the key to successful use of this product is making sure your hair is thoroughly rinsed free of the product, especially since, if you&#x27;re anyting like me</li>
            <li>; I find that it&#x27;s not the right product for conditioning my own natural hair.</li>
            <li>This left my feeling good and smelled great but for the money, you could do just as good, if not better, with sticking with a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>But my hair felt strong (not thin &amp; stringy as I feared).</li>
            <li>I trhought this was a good product but would not be my first choice in deep conditioners.  </li>
            <li>and I love how my hair got so soft after using it!</li>
            <li>I allowed my hair to dry, and was most pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping all the good thimgs after all the reviews I read before purchasing this product, it leaves my hair very dry</li>
            <li>Buy this deep conditioner and when you are done, a good leave in with pure virgin olive oil and you are set for life.</li>
            <li>Now this is what really makes your hair soft and tangled free I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but so far i love it.  </li>
            <li>This made my hair so soft, healthy and bouncy.</li>
            <li>deep conditioner is a great product for curly hair and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to make your hair feel soft and  </li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend their sulfate-free shampoo to anyone who&#x27;s natural....</li>
            <li>MY 8 YEAR OLD LOVE HER HAIR</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>One day I picked this product up and thought to give it a try for my own hair (I&#x27;m white)</li>
            <li>Exactly how is this good for your hair in the long run?  </li>
            <li>but Im not crazy about it...</li>
            <li>I have used so many other conditioners on my hair over the years, but this one leaves my hair really feeling nice.</li>
            <li>We detangle right in the shower with this conditioner and do not rinse it all out.</li>
            <li>although I am also thankful for finding the right hairdresser duo...</li>
            <li>I think you have to have the right porosity and texture for this conditioner to work.  </li>
            <li>, tangles come right out after we use it.</li>
            <li>get it right</li>
            <li>My 4yr old has unruly locks that are beautiful when wet but frizzy</li>
            <li>previous reviewers for directing me to this magic goop :)</li>
            <li>Not only does it detangle, it smells so good and leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It definitely worked, it conditioned my hair really well and had an all around nice smell.</li>
            <li>a huge nor significant difference aftet using this product had used a better quality in the past.</li>
            <li>This product works well on my little ones hair but does take a fair amount to get the desired results.  </li>
            <li>I find it defines her ringlets pretty well</li>
            <li>I am willing to spend the money on something legit, but this is NOT</li>
            <li>I tried it more than once with the same results.</li>
            <li>People feel free to wear their natural hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>start with the first one you began with and rinse out the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Mixed Chicks products.</li>
            <li>I will likely purchase more products in this line for myself and my boys as they grow.</li>
            <li>Then my mom recommended this product and I thought it was a bit too pricey to get at first</li>
            <li>One of my favorite hobbies is trying various hair products.  </li>
            <li>When I used it again for the first time, I could immediately tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Well this is not the first time that I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li>Well, I should have listened to my instincts, so I only blame myself for going against better judgment.</li>
            <li>(Redacted my first review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/14/12</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have found for my daughter, who is 4 that really moisturizes her hair so we can comb it without tears!  </li>
            <li>I use the conditioner in the shower, and because this comes in a jar rather than a bottle of some kind, it&#x27;s just harder to use.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first,</li>
            <li>does not feel like a deep conditioner even after leaving on for 15 minutes of more</li>
            <li>next up are more alcohol and chemicals you cannot even pronounce, with preservatives and perfume.</li>
            <li>I get pretty descent results from doing this.</li>
            <li>I believe my Moroccanoil deep conditioner does a better job.</li>
            <li>The product came timely and well packed, but is not the magical elixer I am accustomed to with Mixed Chicks.  </li>
            <li>Most of the perm is out, so she is just trying to keep it moisturized until she can get all new growth and start enhancing her natural curls again.</li>
            <li>The smell and slip are great, but after substituting this in with my regular routine - I couldn&#x27;t believe how dry and Not moisturized my hair was.  </li>
            <li>Wash your hair right when you wake up so that it can be drying while you are in the house getting ready to go</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells nice, made my hair soft, however,  it wasn&#x27;t worth it because my hair  started falling out since I started falling out, I have stopped using it and and not I&#x27;m not losing as much hair as I was using this, I even noticed this product did the same thing to my mother in laws hair as well.  </li>
            <li>Overall still just as good if not better than the more pricey alternatives.</li>
            <li>now the best part Very little on your palm goes a long way on your hair.</li>
            <li>I have only used it as a regular detangling condish and for that it works and is good.</li>
            <li>My curls are beautiful, and I really could let it air dry like that, but what I do is air dry 80% then</li>
            <li>I saw all of the positive reviews for this product and a friend of mine even recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll keep ordering direct for full price.  </li>
            <li>I hesitated to purchase this product, because I am not mixed, but after reading reviews from other women who are not mixed and the awesome results they got, I was sold.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to pay alot just to try a new product, this was worth it.</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase another jar when I run out.</li>
            <li>Mixed Chicks works great and cut our styling time in half.</li>
            <li>I started using some of the conditioner from the various hotels that I visit and although they are fine....</li>
            <li>Will most certainly be purchasing again in the near future!</li>
            <li>had to pay for shipping which I am not a big fan of and it came in a huge box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough to use as a co-wash, light enough as a mixer in some water in a spray bottle to use as a conditioning mix, light enough to put into your home made hair creams.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY products (Pink, Motions, oil sheen spray, Pantene and others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is not a miracle worker by any means, and I still \\&quot;pull her hair\\&quot; some, but definately not as much.</li>
            <li>I expected a lot more from this product.</li>
            <li>Depending on how much hair you have I have to part the section I&#x27;m working with into 2 sections</li>
            <li>Combing the section after applying the gel with really DEFINE YOUR CURLS.</li>
            <li>Combing the section after applying the gel with really DEFINE YOUR CURLS.</li>
            <li>it just makes the process that much easier.</li>
            <li>He says his hair is so much easier to style</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel fresh and alive again.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like their leave  </li>
            <li>This product really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>We would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>, I have tried everything and really hope this helps.</li>
            <li>and I really like it .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be 100% honest, I initially wanted to avoid this product because it&#x27;s called MIXED CHICKS</li>
            <li>I have gotten wwaaaayyy better results from other products on the mainstream market.</li>
            <li>Right away there was a decent amount of slip but ultimately, this product only made my hair shrink up way more than It normally would.</li>
            <li>so I use the rinse out conditioner first, lightly rinse and that seems to help move the other through.</li>
            <li>I love the REAL Mixed Chicks deep conditioner, but this is not the real stuff.</li>
            <li>When your done switch back to the diffuser and blast your hair with cool air...</li>
            <li>When your done switch back to the diffuser and blast your hair with cool air...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m full Chinese</li>
            <li>Hmy hair is super soft especially when its mixed with Evoo ,I let mine sit for 30mins tho, I strongly recommend</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to strong smelling products and this just had a very light scent that only lasts a few minutes after rinsing.</li>
            <li>It is okay, but the Deep Conditioner definitely helps me comb her hair out while in the bathtub.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, I started using this particular conditioner about a month ago</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on reviews from hair care forums, ethnic hair care in particular.  </li>
            <li>I had better luck with Silky Sexy Hair which is also expensive, but I can pick that up at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>I just bought this last weekend at my local Target after reading the reviews here and OMG I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>apply a decent amount of your conditioner</li>
            <li>Both my brother and I have the same parents and our hair couldn&#x27;t be more different.</li>
            <li>but it was still decent.</li>
            <li>I only decided to try something that worked okay but never gave me the results I get from Mixed Chicks.</li>
            <li>i love this deep conditioner it brought life back to my hair.</li>
            <li>I but and love that is not because it is the only thing I have found for my hair that works as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Mixed Chics deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I am not a &amp;#34;mixed chick&amp;#34; but this product came highly referred from one of my friends.</li>
            <li>i had high expectations</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone going natural!!</li>
            <li>As far as its detangling properties, it provides lots of slip and spreads very evenly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal softness...</li>
            <li>Its nice &amp; thick</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this brand to anyone looking for a new conditioner and unsure about what to get.</li>
            <li>I assume it&#x27;s mainly due to the mix of silicones since it wasn&#x27;t oily at all (fine hair +</li>
            <li>so if you wash your hair once a week it would last a pretty long time until having to buy another jar so its worth the cost!</li>
            <li>This products definitely works for my hair and my curls have been coming back quickly!</li>
            <li>So yeah, you live and learn</li>
            <li>LOOSE this , it&#x27;s exactly what all the positive reviews say it is.  </li>
            <li>Im not crazy about this conditioner as Im in a journey testing different products for my naturally 3c hair.</li>
            <li>She has used it twice and her hair is VERY soft after using this....</li>
            <li>Although after blow-drying and straightening it is very soft.</li>
            <li>tHE RIGHT HAIR CUT (THAT YOU LIKE) AND A PERM TO LENGTHEN THE SPIRALLY CURLS THAT ARE NATURAL TO YOU AND \\&quot;MIXED</li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;A bit overrated but definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>Go around again, starting with the first section and rinse it out then apply Eco Styler Gel (Aragon Oil or Olive Oil) or</li>
            <li>so if you wash your hair once a week it would last a pretty long time until having to buy another jar so its worth</li>
            <li>I decided to take the chance because I needed a deep conditioner before the weather got really hot.</li>
            <li>This will definitely keep my hair in check during the hot, humid, summer months.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the only logical conclusion</li>
            <li>First ingredient is water (not conditioning), second is alcohol (drying),</li>
            <li>I treid this product for about two months, I think it&#x27;s because I have course african american hair, this product is truly for mixed chicks :}</li>
            <li>Leaves hair quite soft and full when dry!</li>
            <li>The end of a life long search for the right conditioner is here.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with the kinky twists because they were versatile enough that I could put them up in a bun for work and wear them down on the weekends.</li>
            <li>but the lady at the beauty store saw my huge tangled mess of curls and recommended this</li>
            <li>I am full African American and natural, and let me tell you this stuff is a miracle.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not terrible, but I get the same result from using Pantene&#x27;s For Women of Color conditioner for less than half the price and more than double the amount.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth, soft, and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many hair products especially hair products for black women</li>
            <li>Keep it up Mixed Chicks, you definitely have a loyal customer now because my hair loves you.</li>
            <li>Yours Hair Co Tea Tress Conditioner with Peppermint that my mother gave me cannot not find it on amazon though so it must be new) put it on top of the shampoo so that your hair is NOT left striped and feeling harsh from rinsing out shampoo.</li>
            <li>THE TIME,,PEOPLE WANT TO COME UP AND TOUCH IT BECAUSE IT LEAVES THE HAIR LIGHT AND SOFT NOT FULL OF STICKY</li>
            <li>You can just use water in a spray bottle or water with a little of your favorite oil/leave in conditioner mixed in.</li>
            <li>You can just use water in a spray bottle or water with a little of your favorite oil/leave in conditioner mixed in.</li>
            <li>I have natural straight hair but thought to give mixed chicks a try.</li>
            <li>hair feels so soft and silky</li>
            <li>I only add heat because my hair is stubborn and frizzy and will not soak up as much moisture unless I am under a hooded dryer).</li>
            <li>I was nearly bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am biracial (black/white) and I have natural hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products ranging from cheap stuff at Target to really expensive salon treatments.</li>
            <li>This product makes your hair silky soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural 3c headed girl.</li>
            <li>Thanks Mixed chicks.</li>
            <li>I like to rinse it completely out and use just a dime size amount after getting out the shower if I&#x27;m out of my leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>since I went natural.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I will leave it in all day and it just makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Conditioner\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve been natural 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After rinsing, those products leave my hair soft and defined.</li>
            <li>It makes body and the Hair is soft</li>
            <li>so soft b4</li>
            <li>I have two different textures wavy and straight.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair shiny and incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft, moisturized and detangles</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner I have been looking for the right one for my Daughter&#x27;s and little sister&#x27;s hair type for a while now</li>
            <li>At any rate, when I took them down the first time, I freaked out because there was so much shedding.</li>
            <li>not even the deep conditioners or hot oil treatments have left her hair this soft.</li>
            <li>I use it every few days for a moisture rich treatment.</li>
            <li>My hair just suddenly became very thirsty although I moisturize regularly and my new growth grew in crunchy.</li>
            <li>I love Mixed chicks products for my daughter - if you have any really bad tangles (from not brushing every day) use the deep conditioner &amp; comb it out in the shower - works AMAZINGLY.....</li>
            <li>highly recommend trying this out for anyone with frizz problem whether you&#x27;re mixed race or not.</li>
            <li>Deep Conditioner is highly moisturizing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pat your hair all over with a t-shirt lightly, yes gel will get on this shirt... looks like a big mess.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pat your hair all over with a t-shirt lightly, yes gel will get on this shirt... looks like a big mess.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not thick enough?</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t work any better than other products I have gotten for half the price.</li>
            <li>so I need a great deep conditioner to keep my hair from going crazy.</li>
            <li>and I wash my hair (which is frizzy, dry, curly and very dense)</li>
            <li>blow dry straight the rest of the way.  </li>
            <li>My wife who is white really loves Mixed Chick for our biracial child.</li>
            <li>I am white but have very coarse, very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It has been a while since I allowed my hair to dry naturally (without an applied heat treatment), so I chose the Mixed Chicks Conditioner to use for this experiment based on positive reviews by others.  </li>
            <li>My girls have medium brown, fine and kinky curly hair that is hard to detangle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long, thick, massively frizzy, and has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>As soon as you get in the shower, condition it and then clean the rest of your body and rinse the conditioner out, so it can sit for a small period.</li>
            <li>rated 4 stars because its some similar products that will do the same, pretty much for less the cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Interestingly enough, I usually use TRESemme Naturals Moisture conditioner or their Smooth and Silk conditioner to detangle and it&#x27;s $7-$10 cheaper than this.</li>
            <li>I am the mother of 4 year old bi-racial (African and German/Irish) twin girls who also have a lot of skin allergies.</li>
            <li>You might even need to wet it again while applying the gel and combing if your hair really eats up water like mine does.</li>
            <li>You might even need to wet it again while applying the gel and combing if your hair really eats up water like mine does.</li>
            <li>When I decided to go natural, I didn&#x27;t do the Big Chop.</li>
            <li>This kept my gel from getting crunchy and I had such soft curls that were still defined.</li>
            <li>I purchased the liter size and have no regrets.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is still soft the next day; it&#x27;s still soft a week later and if my head wrap falls off!</li>
            <li>Go to MixedChicks.net if you wanna just try the smaller bottles to see if you really like it, you won&#x27;t be sorry :)</li>
            <li>The smell is not too strong and its consistency is quite gelatinous, almost gooey and can be heavy going onto the hair, but a little of this product goes a long way; I bought my first tub on January 31 and did not finish it until May 25</li>
            <li>I am mixed race my hair tends to get very fizzy and dry after washing.</li>
            <li>half-eastern european and half mauritian contributes to my success of using this</li>
            <li>I used Mixed Chicks, not only did it calm the frizz down</li>
            <li>I use and love the mixed chicks kids line for my kids, who are mixed (half black,</li>
            <li>I have African American natural hair and this stuff did wonders for me.</li>
            <li>This deep conditioner has definitely helped to re-define my natural curls.</li>
            <li>I use the shampoo...which makes your hair moist and not dry at all.</li>
            <li>I was using Wen for a really long time which seemed to calm the frizz down a lot</li>
            <li>(Oh, did I say that I&#x27;m African American and my hair is very curly/wavy but very dry).</li>
            <li>I am multiracial, but identify as black with very disobedient, apparently 3C hair.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s over rated there is other product that do the same for much cheaper prices</li>
            <li>For everything in my hair, I use homemade natural and organic products, but Mixed chicks deep conditioner is the only thing</li>
            <li>problem with my natural hair is that I have to wash it and let it air dry every morning</li>
            <li>I use it and twist my hair up or just let it dry naturally</li>
            <li>and I have very thick Asian hair that dries out easily.</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> Whether you leave it on for a minute or 30, my hair is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is an amazing product with the power to detangle like no ohter I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I liked the name of the company.</li>
            <li> This is a nice conditioner.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, came on time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- has a nice scent</li>
            <li> I suggest a heat protector of some kind if you need to heat-style your hair</li>
            <li> There is nothing more to say I loved everything about this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and get knotted very easily so it would be nice if this condish made it easier to detangle</li>
            <li> It provides super slip, smells great and leaves my hair fully detangled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Added bonus is that it smells of my Beloved fave perfume Calyx:):)</li>
            <li> it leaves his curls very shiny and like in perfect condition :)</li>
            <li> But it took a while for me to think; wow, what a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M GOOD TO GO AND ENJOY MYSELF TO NO END.</li>
            <li> it would be nice if it held more ounces for the price it is at...</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have ever used</li>
            <li> My hair is perfectly conditioned and soft after every use.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, it&#x27;s more natural than most stuff I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li> and it feels very cheap</li>
            <li> She has fine, blond hair that dries out, it&#x27;s amazing what a quarter size amount can do without build up or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad she did.</li>
            <li> , you figure more is better.</li>
            <li> They are both phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Jessie&#x27;s seems to work better.</li>
            <li> This is the product I love the most for wearing my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suggestions: DO NOT touch your hair as it is drying (I love touching my hair</li>
            <li> and I have my hands in it all day without noticing, but touching it causes it to expand more as it dries).</li>
            <li> Save your cash and buy Pantene or a better brand of conditioner at the S*lly store.</li>
            <li> And it smells devine :)</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere to choose the best product that wasn&#x27;t too expensive but had excellent results and this product exceeds my expectations!</li>
            <li> its okay</li>
            <li> its okay</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I put a healthy amount of this in my hair and then brush it out, then rinse.</li>
            <li> and I love that.</li>
            <li> For my 3C biracial (black/white) curls, this product is okay.  </li>
            <li> I like the moisture content, but it&#x27;s just okay</li>
            <li> I will love this product until the end of the world.</li>
            <li> its okay not</li>
            <li> actually, it felt the best it&#x27;s felt in a looong time!  </li>
            <li> This product is the perfect balance of additional conditioning without the extra weight!  </li>
            <li> My children and I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love using this on my son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used what feels like thousands of deep conditioners and this is GREAT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably best for those who are mixed or have hair textures in the 3&#x27;s or up.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this for home use.</li>
            <li> glad</li>
            <li> But I would recommend it for anybody with type 3 and type 4 curls.  :-)</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It really works great on all types of hair, as it states.</li>
            <li> I will b buying this over &amp; over I love the way my hair feels</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure as to how I could rate this product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this</li>
            <li> I LOVE the leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> She has had many comments and compliments.</li>
            <li> more than once a week.</li>
            <li> gave me ok moisture</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and am hooked.</li>
            <li> So glad I discovered it a year ago while living in London, UK.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try more products in this line.  </li>
            <li> Best Deep Conditioner i ever used ..love it â™¡</li>
            <li> the product (had for some time but first used today) that BEAT this hair into a tangle/frizz-free submission!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, silky, and smells beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Great product left my hair feeling amazing,</li>
            <li> Her hair is soft with strong curls and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> Great mild scent, pretty moisturizing</li>
            <li> It smells great and it leaves your hair really soft.</li>
            <li> *mostly* sulfate free</li>
            <li> I bought this product looking for something that would really give me some good conditioning</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need much and it smells really good.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is good, but it doesn&#x27;t really lather.  </li>
            <li> And it is absolutely TRUE!</li>
            <li> I have tried many conditioners, over the counter and professional, and Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner is the best I have found and best of all my girls are not allergic to it..</li>
            <li> When I read that it makes your hair easy to comb through when you immediately put it on your hair</li>
            <li> Easy to comb through (I use denman brush 5 rows).</li>
            <li> My hair felt like silk afterwards and it was so easy to detangles.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t help de-tangling my hair as easy as I would like.</li>
            <li> Everytime I get out the shower I have the same beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> Very good for hair but has a tendency to dry it out.</li>
            <li> Quick Delivery!</li>
            <li> I started using this product line and saw a huge change.</li>
            <li> The huge tub of it costs $2.50 at wally world.</li>
            <li> BUT I WASH MY HAIR WITH A LIGHT SHAMPOO</li>
            <li> So, she is happy, and is obviously is moisturizing quite well.</li>
            <li> I always get it from Amazon.com because of the free shipping with Prime-</li>
            <li> and I can run my fingers through it comfortably.</li>
            <li> Honestly I wanna use the whole line now because I remember I got  a sample of the leave in at Rickys</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both so smooth I don&#x27;t have to use a leave in conditioner at all, and I no longer have to tug tangles out of the ends.</li>
            <li> This product is great especially for curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Now, I am at the point where I can run my hands through my hair AND it feels so flipping soft, i feel like this is must what it be like to have &#x27;good hair&#x27;</li>
            <li> You know how you love the way your hair looks when you first get out of the shower, with this product and the leave-in, I could have that look allday.</li>
            <li> cause I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for the holy grail conditioner when I decided to try Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner, there are many wonderful conditioners that I&#x27;ve found that work well on my hair.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner feels amazing on both my fine baby-straight hair and the wild unruly patches.  </li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best deep conditioner for my thirsty hair!</li>
            <li> There is no buildup and it feels clean and weightless.</li>
            <li> This by far is one of the best deep conditioners out.</li>
            <li> but it rinses clean vs doing a DIY oil treatment).  </li>
            <li> This stuff comes in a tiny charge but its powerful, works and smells great.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft and leaves it looking so healthy!</li>
            <li> And so far I love it!</li>
            <li> and I might even buy the full liter size since I love it that much.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and makes your hair feel ultra soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading tons of good reviews, not just from \\&quot;mixed\\&quot; chicks but from non mixed women of color.</li>
            <li> It is true.</li>
            <li> , it leaves her hair nice and soft</li>
            <li> her curls really do look and feels healthy.</li>
            <li> Make sure the section your working on is completely soaked so that gel can go on and easily get combed through with your Denman brush.</li>
            <li> Make sure the section your working on is completely soaked so that gel can go on and easily get combed through with your Denman brush.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair that is in great shape.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but I like the Deep Conditioner better.  </li>
            <li> You can leave it on for a deeper conditioner or just rinse it quickly if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner really makes the hair feels great.</li>
            <li> This product is super drying - has anyone else noticed this?  </li>
            <li> think the key to successful use of this product is making sure your hair is thoroughly rinsed free of the product, especially since, if you&#x27;re anyting like me</li>
            <li> ; I find that it&#x27;s not the right product for conditioning my own natural hair.</li>
            <li> This left my feeling good and smelled great but for the money, you could do just as good, if not better, with sticking with a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> But my hair felt strong (not thin &amp; stringy as I feared).</li>
            <li> I trhought this was a good product but would not be my first choice in deep conditioners.  </li>
            <li> and I love how my hair got so soft after using it!</li>
            <li> I allowed my hair to dry, and was most pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping all the good thimgs after all the reviews I read before purchasing this product, it leaves my hair very dry</li>
            <li> Buy this deep conditioner and when you are done, a good leave in with pure virgin olive oil and you are set for life.</li>
            <li> Now this is what really makes your hair soft and tangled free I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but so far i love it.  </li>
            <li> This made my hair so soft, healthy and bouncy.</li>
            <li> deep conditioner is a great product for curly hair and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to make your hair feel soft and  </li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend their sulfate-free shampoo to anyone who&#x27;s natural....</li>
            <li> MY 8 YEAR OLD LOVE HER HAIR</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> One day I picked this product up and thought to give it a try for my own hair (I&#x27;m white)</li>
            <li> Exactly how is this good for your hair in the long run?  </li>
            <li> but Im not crazy about it...</li>
            <li> I have used so many other conditioners on my hair over the years, but this one leaves my hair really feeling nice.</li>
            <li> We detangle right in the shower with this conditioner and do not rinse it all out.</li>
            <li> although I am also thankful for finding the right hairdresser duo...</li>
            <li> I think you have to have the right porosity and texture for this conditioner to work.  </li>
            <li> , tangles come right out after we use it.</li>
            <li> get it right</li>
            <li> My 4yr old has unruly locks that are beautiful when wet but frizzy</li>
            <li> previous reviewers for directing me to this magic goop :)</li>
            <li> Not only does it detangle, it smells so good and leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It definitely worked, it conditioned my hair really well and had an all around nice smell.</li>
            <li> a huge nor significant difference aftet using this product had used a better quality in the past.</li>
            <li> This product works well on my little ones hair but does take a fair amount to get the desired results.  </li>
            <li> I find it defines her ringlets pretty well</li>
            <li> I am willing to spend the money on something legit, but this is NOT</li>
            <li> I tried it more than once with the same results.</li>
            <li> People feel free to wear their natural hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> start with the first one you began with and rinse out the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Mixed Chicks products.</li>
            <li> I will likely purchase more products in this line for myself and my boys as they grow.</li>
            <li> Then my mom recommended this product and I thought it was a bit too pricey to get at first</li>
            <li> One of my favorite hobbies is trying various hair products.  </li>
            <li> When I used it again for the first time, I could immediately tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Well this is not the first time that I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li> Well, I should have listened to my instincts, so I only blame myself for going against better judgment.</li>
            <li> (Redacted my first review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/14/12</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have found for my daughter, who is 4 that really moisturizes her hair so we can comb it without tears!  </li>
            <li> I use the conditioner in the shower, and because this comes in a jar rather than a bottle of some kind, it&#x27;s just harder to use.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first,</li>
            <li> does not feel like a deep conditioner even after leaving on for 15 minutes of more</li>
            <li> next up are more alcohol and chemicals you cannot even pronounce, with preservatives and perfume.</li>
            <li> I get pretty descent results from doing this.</li>
            <li> I believe my Moroccanoil deep conditioner does a better job.</li>
            <li> The product came timely and well packed, but is not the magical elixer I am accustomed to with Mixed Chicks.  </li>
            <li> Most of the perm is out, so she is just trying to keep it moisturized until she can get all new growth and start enhancing her natural curls again.</li>
            <li> The smell and slip are great, but after substituting this in with my regular routine - I couldn&#x27;t believe how dry and Not moisturized my hair was.  </li>
            <li> Wash your hair right when you wake up so that it can be drying while you are in the house getting ready to go</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells nice, made my hair soft, however,  it wasn&#x27;t worth it because my hair  started falling out since I started falling out, I have stopped using it and and not I&#x27;m not losing as much hair as I was using this, I even noticed this product did the same thing to my mother in laws hair as well.  </li>
            <li> Overall still just as good if not better than the more pricey alternatives.</li>
            <li> now the best part Very little on your palm goes a long way on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have only used it as a regular detangling condish and for that it works and is good.</li>
            <li> My curls are beautiful, and I really could let it air dry like that, but what I do is air dry 80% then</li>
            <li> I saw all of the positive reviews for this product and a friend of mine even recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll keep ordering direct for full price.  </li>
            <li> I hesitated to purchase this product, because I am not mixed, but after reading reviews from other women who are not mixed and the awesome results they got, I was sold.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to pay alot just to try a new product, this was worth it.</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase another jar when I run out.</li>
            <li> Mixed Chicks works great and cut our styling time in half.</li>
            <li> I started using some of the conditioner from the various hotels that I visit and although they are fine....</li>
            <li> Will most certainly be purchasing again in the near future!</li>
            <li> had to pay for shipping which I am not a big fan of and it came in a huge box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough to use as a co-wash, light enough as a mixer in some water in a spray bottle to use as a conditioning mix, light enough to put into your home made hair creams.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY products (Pink, Motions, oil sheen spray, Pantene and others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle worker by any means, and I still \\&quot;pull her hair\\&quot; some, but definately not as much.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot more from this product.</li>
            <li> Depending on how much hair you have I have to part the section I&#x27;m working with into 2 sections</li>
            <li> Combing the section after applying the gel with really DEFINE YOUR CURLS.</li>
            <li> Combing the section after applying the gel with really DEFINE YOUR CURLS.</li>
            <li> it just makes the process that much easier.</li>
            <li> He says his hair is so much easier to style</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel fresh and alive again.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like their leave  </li>
            <li> This product really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> We would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> , I have tried everything and really hope this helps.</li>
            <li> and I really like it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be 100% honest, I initially wanted to avoid this product because it&#x27;s called MIXED CHICKS</li>
            <li> I have gotten wwaaaayyy better results from other products on the mainstream market.</li>
            <li> Right away there was a decent amount of slip but ultimately, this product only made my hair shrink up way more than It normally would.</li>
            <li> so I use the rinse out conditioner first, lightly rinse and that seems to help move the other through.</li>
            <li> I love the REAL Mixed Chicks deep conditioner, but this is not the real stuff.</li>
            <li> When your done switch back to the diffuser and blast your hair with cool air...</li>
            <li> When your done switch back to the diffuser and blast your hair with cool air...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m full Chinese</li>
            <li> Hmy hair is super soft especially when its mixed with Evoo ,I let mine sit for 30mins tho, I strongly recommend</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to strong smelling products and this just had a very light scent that only lasts a few minutes after rinsing.</li>
            <li> It is okay, but the Deep Conditioner definitely helps me comb her hair out while in the bathtub.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, I started using this particular conditioner about a month ago</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on reviews from hair care forums, ethnic hair care in particular.  </li>
            <li> I had better luck with Silky Sexy Hair which is also expensive, but I can pick that up at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I just bought this last weekend at my local Target after reading the reviews here and OMG I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> apply a decent amount of your conditioner</li>
            <li> Both my brother and I have the same parents and our hair couldn&#x27;t be more different.</li>
            <li> but it was still decent.</li>
            <li> I only decided to try something that worked okay but never gave me the results I get from Mixed Chicks.</li>
            <li> i love this deep conditioner it brought life back to my hair.</li>
            <li> I but and love that is not because it is the only thing I have found for my hair that works as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Mixed Chics deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I am not a &amp;#34;mixed chick&amp;#34; but this product came highly referred from one of my friends.</li>
            <li> i had high expectations</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone going natural!!</li>
            <li> As far as its detangling properties, it provides lots of slip and spreads very evenly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal softness...</li>
            <li> Its nice &amp; thick</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this brand to anyone looking for a new conditioner and unsure about what to get.</li>
            <li> I assume it&#x27;s mainly due to the mix of silicones since it wasn&#x27;t oily at all (fine hair +</li>
            <li> so if you wash your hair once a week it would last a pretty long time until having to buy another jar so its worth the cost!</li>
            <li> This products definitely works for my hair and my curls have been coming back quickly!</li>
            <li> So yeah, you live and learn</li>
            <li> LOOSE this , it&#x27;s exactly what all the positive reviews say it is.  </li>
            <li> Im not crazy about this conditioner as Im in a journey testing different products for my naturally 3c hair.</li>
            <li> She has used it twice and her hair is VERY soft after using this....</li>
            <li> Although after blow-drying and straightening it is very soft.</li>
            <li> tHE RIGHT HAIR CUT (THAT YOU LIKE) AND A PERM TO LENGTHEN THE SPIRALLY CURLS THAT ARE NATURAL TO YOU AND \\&quot;MIXED</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;A bit overrated but definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> Go around again, starting with the first section and rinse it out then apply Eco Styler Gel (Aragon Oil or Olive Oil) or</li>
            <li> so if you wash your hair once a week it would last a pretty long time until having to buy another jar so its worth</li>
            <li> I decided to take the chance because I needed a deep conditioner before the weather got really hot.</li>
            <li> This will definitely keep my hair in check during the hot, humid, summer months.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only logical conclusion</li>
            <li> First ingredient is water (not conditioning), second is alcohol (drying),</li>
            <li> I treid this product for about two months, I think it&#x27;s because I have course african american hair, this product is truly for mixed chicks :}</li>
            <li> Leaves hair quite soft and full when dry!</li>
            <li> The end of a life long search for the right conditioner is here.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with the kinky twists because they were versatile enough that I could put them up in a bun for work and wear them down on the weekends.</li>
            <li> but the lady at the beauty store saw my huge tangled mess of curls and recommended this</li>
            <li> I am full African American and natural, and let me tell you this stuff is a miracle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not terrible, but I get the same result from using Pantene&#x27;s For Women of Color conditioner for less than half the price and more than double the amount.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth, soft, and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many hair products especially hair products for black women</li>
            <li> Keep it up Mixed Chicks, you definitely have a loyal customer now because my hair loves you.</li>
            <li> Yours Hair Co Tea Tress Conditioner with Peppermint that my mother gave me cannot not find it on amazon though so it must be new) put it on top of the shampoo so that your hair is NOT left striped and feeling harsh from rinsing out shampoo.</li>
            <li> THE TIME,,PEOPLE WANT TO COME UP AND TOUCH IT BECAUSE IT LEAVES THE HAIR LIGHT AND SOFT NOT FULL OF STICKY</li>
            <li> You can just use water in a spray bottle or water with a little of your favorite oil/leave in conditioner mixed in.</li>
            <li> You can just use water in a spray bottle or water with a little of your favorite oil/leave in conditioner mixed in.</li>
            <li> I have natural straight hair but thought to give mixed chicks a try.</li>
            <li> hair feels so soft and silky</li>
            <li> I only add heat because my hair is stubborn and frizzy and will not soak up as much moisture unless I am under a hooded dryer).</li>
            <li> I was nearly bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am biracial (black/white) and I have natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products ranging from cheap stuff at Target to really expensive salon treatments.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair silky soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural 3c headed girl.</li>
            <li> Thanks Mixed chicks.</li>
            <li> I like to rinse it completely out and use just a dime size amount after getting out the shower if I&#x27;m out of my leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> since I went natural.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will leave it in all day and it just makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Conditioner\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve been natural 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After rinsing, those products leave my hair soft and defined.</li>
            <li> It makes body and the Hair is soft</li>
            <li> so soft b4</li>
            <li> I have two different textures wavy and straight.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair shiny and incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft, moisturized and detangles</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner I have been looking for the right one for my Daughter&#x27;s and little sister&#x27;s hair type for a while now</li>
            <li> At any rate, when I took them down the first time, I freaked out because there was so much shedding.</li>
            <li> not even the deep conditioners or hot oil treatments have left her hair this soft.</li>
            <li> I use it every few days for a moisture rich treatment.</li>
            <li> My hair just suddenly became very thirsty although I moisturize regularly and my new growth grew in crunchy.</li>
            <li> I love Mixed chicks products for my daughter - if you have any really bad tangles (from not brushing every day) use the deep conditioner &amp; comb it out in the shower - works AMAZINGLY.....</li>
            <li> highly recommend trying this out for anyone with frizz problem whether you&#x27;re mixed race or not.</li>
            <li> Deep Conditioner is highly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pat your hair all over with a t-shirt lightly, yes gel will get on this shirt... looks like a big mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pat your hair all over with a t-shirt lightly, yes gel will get on this shirt... looks like a big mess.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not thick enough?</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t work any better than other products I have gotten for half the price.</li>
            <li> so I need a great deep conditioner to keep my hair from going crazy.</li>
            <li> and I wash my hair (which is frizzy, dry, curly and very dense)</li>
            <li> blow dry straight the rest of the way.  </li>
            <li> My wife who is white really loves Mixed Chick for our biracial child.</li>
            <li> I am white but have very coarse, very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It has been a while since I allowed my hair to dry naturally (without an applied heat treatment), so I chose the Mixed Chicks Conditioner to use for this experiment based on positive reviews by others.  </li>
            <li> My girls have medium brown, fine and kinky curly hair that is hard to detangle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, thick, massively frizzy, and has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> As soon as you get in the shower, condition it and then clean the rest of your body and rinse the conditioner out, so it can sit for a small period.</li>
            <li> rated 4 stars because its some similar products that will do the same, pretty much for less the cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Interestingly enough, I usually use TRESemme Naturals Moisture conditioner or their Smooth and Silk conditioner to detangle and it&#x27;s $7-$10 cheaper than this.</li>
            <li> I am the mother of 4 year old bi-racial (African and German/Irish) twin girls who also have a lot of skin allergies.</li>
            <li> You might even need to wet it again while applying the gel and combing if your hair really eats up water like mine does.</li>
            <li> You might even need to wet it again while applying the gel and combing if your hair really eats up water like mine does.</li>
            <li> When I decided to go natural, I didn&#x27;t do the Big Chop.</li>
            <li> This kept my gel from getting crunchy and I had such soft curls that were still defined.</li>
            <li> I purchased the liter size and have no regrets.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is still soft the next day; it&#x27;s still soft a week later and if my head wrap falls off!</li>
            <li> Go to MixedChicks.net if you wanna just try the smaller bottles to see if you really like it, you won&#x27;t be sorry :)</li>
            <li> The smell is not too strong and its consistency is quite gelatinous, almost gooey and can be heavy going onto the hair, but a little of this product goes a long way; I bought my first tub on January 31 and did not finish it until May 25</li>
            <li> I am mixed race my hair tends to get very fizzy and dry after washing.</li>
            <li> half-eastern european and half mauritian contributes to my success of using this</li>
            <li> I used Mixed Chicks, not only did it calm the frizz down</li>
            <li> I use and love the mixed chicks kids line for my kids, who are mixed (half black,</li>
            <li> I have African American natural hair and this stuff did wonders for me.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner has definitely helped to re-define my natural curls.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo...which makes your hair moist and not dry at all.</li>
            <li> I was using Wen for a really long time which seemed to calm the frizz down a lot</li>
            <li> (Oh, did I say that I&#x27;m African American and my hair is very curly/wavy but very dry).</li>
            <li> I am multiracial, but identify as black with very disobedient, apparently 3C hair.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s over rated there is other product that do the same for much cheaper prices</li>
            <li> For everything in my hair, I use homemade natural and organic products, but Mixed chicks deep conditioner is the only thing</li>
            <li> problem with my natural hair is that I have to wash it and let it air dry every morning</li>
            <li> I use it and twist my hair up or just let it dry naturally</li>
            <li> and I have very thick Asian hair that dries out easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted, I do not wash my hair more than a couple times a week as I am one of those people who has been dying my hair for the past ten years a very pale blond; perhaps my ethic makeup</li>
            <li> I have been natural for almost two years and have tried other deep conditioners which did not quite work for me.</li>
            <li> At first the products seem a tad expensive but they really are not they last months!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who is bi-racial (white &amp; black), and who is trying to grow her hair back out natural.</li>
            <li> I am not a &amp;#34;mixed chick&amp;#34; but as an African American woman I can appreciate a product that will detangle my hair from a single deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> but now after ordering it and using it my hair, it made my curls feel so much softer and it laid them down alot!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how much it&#x27;s improving my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for anyone who wants to make their hair softer than usual.</li>
            <li> Follow up with using your diffuser on your blow dryer and if your have the flat attachment (don&#x27;t know what its called) use it to get the roots while pulling on your hair so that your hair does not shrink up like a mushroom.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t flat iron it</li>
            <li> and the next day when I wet her hair to comb it, that is when I use the Mixed Chicks leave-in condition.  </li>
            <li> I have done some stressful things to my hair and this is the revive system; dying pink, orange, red, blue, purple, etc.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of precious money and is frustrating with every use.  </li>
            <li> have other brands I use for different styles or treatments, but for my curly hair, this is the only product that tames my mane.</li>
            <li> It seems that Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner only coated my hair for a little while then just left it dry.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but it did leave my hair soft and manageable for a little while.</li>
            <li> If you regularly blow dry or use heat tools, you&#x27;ll notice some dryness (the silicones keep moisture out, so your blow dry is faster, but it also means the hairs get dehydrated).  </li>
            <li> BUT THEY ARE DARK BROWN AND THIN, WELL, FINE STRANDS.</li>
            <li> I have no chemicals in my hair and go from straight to curly at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> I WET MY HAIR AND PUT THE DEEP CONDITIONER IN AND AFTER THE BATH</li>
            <li> Nor did I have to use a lot of product and my hair reaches the center of my back;</li>
            <li> Touched my hair and it was so soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- does not completely detangle hair</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt and it wasn&#x27;t long process.</li>
            <li> I only partially rinse it out so that she keeps some of the moisture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry to report that although it does make my hair soft right after use, over time my hair became very dry using this.</li>
            <li> and I stay away from all products with cones since I have low porosity hair and live in an area that has hard water.</li>
            <li> But in this case, let me tell you, this product is amazing and my endless and very expensive trial and error to find something that works for my son&#x27;s hair is OVER!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply only a dime size to a quarter size of Mixed Chicks, a little bit truly goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;mixed ethnicity&amp;#34; but it is mixed texture due to some parts going grey and behaving badly (dry, kinky, brittle).  </li>
            <li> No matter what other products I buy I also go back to this one.</li>
            <li> It will if you do not blow dry your hair at all.</li>
            <li> It will if you do not blow dry your hair at all.</li>
            <li> in as it makes my hair feel stripped and dry.</li>
            <li> when dry.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair</li>
            <li> and I recommend to anyone suffering from dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has been shedding and really dry</li>
            <li> Dry scalp</li>
            <li> My hair is mostly straight and wavy mixed together which is so frustrating.</li>
            <li> possibly not a good choice for very fine thin tresses.</li>
            <li> I am also biracial, half black and half hispanic, with very kinky and curly hair</li>
            <li> some loose curls, some kinky</li>
            <li> so i have tried alot of products for tangling and dry hair!</li>
            <li> I am a year and a half from my big chop.....</li>
            <li> I had so much LESS shedding when I used the deep conditioner to comb out my hair!</li>
            <li> half white).</li>
            <li> I am biracial (black &amp; white)</li>
            <li> Black, brown, white whatever.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m black &amp; white)..</li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s a frizzy poofy tangled mess if I use regular walgreens-type conditioner.</li>
            <li> My son, on the other hand, he has curly hair (he is black, white, &amp; Hispanic and his hair isn&#x27;t anything like mine -</li>
            <li> can actually comb through his curls in the bath once this stuff sits for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I divide my hair in sections, apply, and detangle with a wide tooth shower comb.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints it.</li>
            <li> I have 3c hair when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> This was just a brand that I was curious about.  </li>
            <li> Not really moisturizing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I wet my hair, detangled my hair</li>
            <li> I like to braid it into my wet hair once a week and sleep with it on my satin pillow case (to prevent breakage).</li>
            <li> We used it in the tub, let it work while she was playing and used a wide comb.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> It was the only conditioner that would tame my daughters unruly curls.</li>
            <li> The deep conditioner was also terrific, thick and creamy and only a small amount needed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Mexican, half Irish/German.</li>
            <li> I have used this everyday so far for the past 3 weeks I bought the liter size</li>
            <li> And remember a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> And remember a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long ways</li>
            <li> It works as well as other conditioners in this price range, I prefer Aussie 3 minute conditioner.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get in the way when working with other sections of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The conditioner has earned this status due to the thickness of the product.  </li>
            <li> I will also look for other products sold by this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I mix it with some other conditioners, avocado, olive, and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> i usually purchase this item all the time, the feel and smell was different.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I will purchase the shampoo again but the two conditioners are definite must haves for me.</li>
            <li> I will not be using any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> and i really feel like i wasted my very hard earned</li>
            <li> I suggest trying the Hollywood Beauty Cholesterol in the semi transparent tub - its a green goop with an olive green screw on lid and has a basic, slightly sweet smell - nothing crazy.  </li>
            <li> I use IsoPlus tea tree and aloe hair conditioner while my hair is still wet because their mixed chick curl defining leave in leaves my hair feeling hard.</li>
            <li> I am half white and half black and it is so hard to find conditioner that can work on my mixed hair.</li>
            <li> I am biracial, and I have thick, coarse Hispanic hair that tangles at the drop of a hat.</li>
            <li> I thought as a women with what i would classify as \\&quot;normal\\&quot; black hair this might work for me in my effort to go from permed to natual hair.  </li>
            <li> I started using this about a year and a half ago when one of my friends suggested it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT BUILD-UP THROUGH THE WEEK</li>
            <li> It makes my nightmare hair less of a nightmare</li>
            <li> He started using it and his jet black hair is so shiny and silky now.</li>
            <li> but I read reviews from woman who say they&#x27;re black and</li>
            <li> I was so shocked how mixed Chicks made my hair feel it really does work.  </li>
            <li> I previously used alot of product in my hair to keep it together, and now I use just the leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> Some of it is tight ringlets, some of it is wavy,</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and really thick.</li>
            <li> if its a little damp in the end, let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if its a little damp in the end, let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when rinsing, my hair felt a little</li>
            <li> I lathered my hair in this, and applied a little heat, and it was on-and-popping.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re still a little iffy about it, I&#x27;d recommend it...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little challenge to work through hair</li>
            <li> If anything, this dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> and it looked dried out.</li>
            <li> (TO NO FABULOUS END!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel that was a waste.</li>
            <li> This was probably one of the worse products claiming to be a \\&quot;Deep</li>
            <li> I feel I wasted money for nothing.</li>
            <li> GET A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS ABOUT MY (SEEMINGLY) THICK, DARK BLACK CURLS</li>
            <li> But it is not same product as Mixed silk and it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> As a &#x27;mixed chick&#x27; I am wary of ethnic products because they tend to weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> moisturized so a small amount goes</li>
            <li> Usually, I do a rinse or a leave-in</li>
            <li> Im not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am not sure thatr I would reorder it.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo, it is thick and you need very little.  </li>

            <li> Not what I expected on my 4c natural hair</li>
            <li> hair feels so soft and silky</li>
            <li> Works just as description said it would, which is why I bought it. I would buy more of these products!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft and leaves it looking so healthy! Will most certainly be purchasing again in the near future!</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner for thin/fine super curly hair. It was the only conditioner that would tame my daughters unruly curls.</li>
            <li> My daughter is biracial and has beautiful ringlets.  Under the back of her neck tangles frequently, especially if we try a ponytail or something.  I have tried MANY products (Pink, Motions, oil sheen spray, Pantene and others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually also bought the Mixed Chicks leave-in conditioner.  It is okay, but the Deep Conditioner definitely helps me comb her hair out while in the bathtub.  It is not a miracle worker by any means, and I still \\&quot;pull her hair\\&quot; some, but definately not as much. I can feel the difference in the tangles; and I leave it in, I do not rinse it out.  I find it defines her ringlets pretty well and the next day when I wet her hair to comb it, that is when I use the Mixed Chicks leave-in condition.  It works okay, but I like the Deep Conditioner better.  [[ASIN:B0013JSK7M Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner - 8 oz]</li>
            <li> I love the REAL Mixed Chicks deep conditioner, but this is not the real stuff. I will not order this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading tons of good reviews, not just from \\&quot;mixed\\&quot; chicks but from non mixed women of color. I thought as a women with what i would classify as \\&quot;normal\\&quot; black hair this might work for me in my effort to go from permed to natual hair.  I was wrong, I noticed absolutely no difference to my hair, well except that it was a lot drier then usual.  I don&#x27;t want to go on and on, i just thought I put this out there for the next women like me looking for a product that will work for their hair. I am willing to spend the money on something legit, but this is NOT and i really feel like i wasted my very hard earned money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Disapointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not mixed, I&#x27;m just white but the lady at the beauty store saw my huge tangled mess of curls and recommended this and I&#x27;m so glad she did.My hair is dry and really thick. Some of it is tight ringlets, some of it is wavy, some loose curls, some kinky, so it&#x27;s a frizzy poofy tangled mess if I use regular walgreens-type conditioner. Mixed chicks relaxes my hair, leaving the curls and waves in individual locks instead of all over the place.</li>
            <li> I am the mother of 4 year old bi-racial (African and German/Irish) twin girls who also have a lot of skin allergies. I have tried many conditioners, over the counter and professional, and Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner is the best I have found and best of all my girls are not allergic to it.. My girls have medium brown, fine and kinky curly hair that is hard to detangle. We detangle right in the shower with this conditioner and do not rinse it all out. Their hair looks and smells great. I finish it off with some \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In Treatment\\&quot; spray (also sold on amazon.com). Works GREAT!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I liked the name of the company. I&#x27;m thankful the product exists. I am tired of there being products that exclusively cater to one ethnicity or another; and dont get me started on clueless hairdressers who don&#x27;t understand the concept of how one&#x27;s genetic makeup contributes to how to cut/dye hair. although I am also thankful for finding the right hairdresser duo... I kept walking into salons speaking to stylists until i ran into one that could envision what to do with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I moved and changed climates... Now I&#x27;m somewhere... where the population...isn&#x27;t particularity ethnically&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I started using this particular conditioner about a month ago and it is working beautifully. But it took a while for me to think; wow, what a wonderful product. Now, I am at the point where I can run my hands through my hair AND it feels so flipping soft, i feel like this is must what it be like to have &#x27;good hair&#x27; ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I do not wash my hair more than a couple times a week as I am one of those people who has been dying my hair for the past ten years a very pale blond; perhaps my ethic makeup half-eastern european and half mauritian contributes to my success of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the key to successful use of this product is making sure your hair is thoroughly rinsed free of the product, especially since, if you&#x27;re anyting like me, you figure more is better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on reviews from hair care forums, ethnic hair care in particular.  I was disappointed...it&#x27;s not terrible, but I get the same result from using Pantene&#x27;s For Women of Color conditioner for less than half the price and more than double the amount.  I think you have to have the right porosity and texture for this conditioner to work.  I had better luck with Silky Sexy Hair which is also expensive, but I can pick that up at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> This product works well on my little ones hair but does take a fair amount to get the desired results.  Overall still just as good if not better than the more pricey alternatives.</li>
            <li> This is a nice conditioner. But don&#x27;t believe the hype. It is NOT a miracle cream. It works as well as other conditioners in this price range, I prefer Aussie 3 minute conditioner. It works great for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I never take the time to write reviews.  But in this case, let me tell you, this product is amazing and my endless and very expensive trial and error to find something that works for my son&#x27;s hair is OVER!!&lt;br /&gt;I can actually comb through his curls in the bath once this stuff sits for a few minutes.  This used to be a tear filled and awful dilemma with me piling product after product on to try to alleviate the dryness that living in Vegas has done to his curls.  Bought this and the leave in conditioner.  They are both phenomenal. THANK YOU MIXED CHICKS!!</li>
            <li> Have only used it once but so far i love it.  My daughter is 2 and bi-racial so i have tried alot of products for tangling and dry hair!</li>
            <li> If anything, this dried out my hair. I tried it more than once with the same results. This nor the leave-in worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Jessie&#x27;s seems to work better. I am going to try Carol&#x27;s Daughter and Kinky Curly to see which is the best.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the bomb.  Not only does it detangle, it smells so good and leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I am multiracial, but identify as black with very disobedient, apparently 3C hair. I started using this about a year and a half ago when one of my friends suggested it. I have no chemicals in my hair and go from straight to curly at least twice a week. This is the product I love the most for wearing my hair curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with my natural hair is that I have to wash it and let it air dry every morning and it gets bigger as the day progresses. It is not a good thing and I could do nothing to keep it from being so big and it looked dried out. I started using this product line and saw a huge change. You know how you love the way your hair looks when you first get out of the shower, with this product and the leave-in, I could have that look allday. I don&#x27;t always use the leave-in, but I do always use this.&lt;br /&gt;I have other brands I use for different styles or treatments, but for my curly hair, this is the only product that tames my mane. I love it and have spread the word to all my friends and random acquaintances who have chemical-free hair regardless of their blend, age, or hair journey and everyone loves it. People feel free to wear their natural hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions: DO NOT touch your hair as it is drying (I love touching my hair and I have my hands in it all day without noticing, but touching it causes it to expand more as it dries). Only shampoo it once or twice a week, condition it often. As soon as you get in the shower, condition it and then clean the rest of your body and rinse the conditioner out, so it can sit for a small period. Wash your hair right when you wake up so that it can be drying while you are in the house getting ready to go (I noticed that I get the best results when my hair mostly dries indoors- no chance of wind tossing).</li>
            <li> I was told to co-condition my hair with this product meaning don&#x27;t shampoo hair just condition it and I saw a difference of thickness in one was...amazing product.</li>
            <li> I just bought this last weekend at my local Target after reading the reviews here and OMG I am so glad I did. I am half white and half black and it is so hard to find conditioner that can work on my mixed hair. Well this is it for me. I am a believer....My hair is mostly straight and wavy mixed together which is so frustrating. This made my hair so soft, healthy and bouncy. It looks amazing.....super happy.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best deep conditioner for my thirsty hair! I divide my hair in sections, apply, and detangle with a wide tooth shower comb. As far as its detangling properties, it provides lots of slip and spreads very evenly. Then I cover my hair with a plastic cap and sit under the hooded dryer for 30 minutes for extra moisturizing (you don&#x27;t have to use heat with this product. In fact, they advise you to leave it on for about five minutes, then rinse. I only add heat because my hair is stubborn and frizzy and will not soak up as much moisture unless I am under a hooded dryer). Though it does take a while for me to rinse out I have absolutely no complaints it. The smell is not too strong and its consistency is quite gelatinous, almost gooey and can be heavy going onto the hair, but a little of this product goes a long way; I bought my first tub on January 31 and did not finish it until May 25 and I wash my hair (which is frizzy, dry, curly and very dense) once a week! I always keep an extra tub in my bathroom as a back up and I might even buy the full liter size since I love it that much.</li>
            <li> None of the drugtore products ever worked for me so I decided to try a hair product designed for mixed texture.&lt;br /&gt;As I am mixed race my hair tends to get very fizzy and dry after washing. Mixed chicks deep conditioner is a great product for curly hair and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to make your hair feel soft and  moisturized so a small amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;A bit overrated but definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> I bought this product looking for something that would really give me some good conditioning and I got that. It isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but it did leave my hair soft and manageable for a little while.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot more from this product. I have extremely curly hair that is in great shape. This left my feeling good and smelled great but for the money, you could do just as good, if not better, with sticking with a regular conditioner. Save your cash and buy Pantene or a better brand of conditioner at the S*lly store.</li>
            <li> tHE RIGHT HAIR CUT (THAT YOU LIKE) AND A PERM TO LENGTHEN THE SPIRALLY CURLS THAT ARE NATURAL TO YOU AND \\&quot;MIXED CHICKS\\&quot; AND YOU&#x27;RE GOOD TO GO WITH JUST FINGERING YOUR HAIR.  PUT ON A SCARF, A PAIR OF EARRINGS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL MARVELOUS (NO MATTER THE COST) AND YOU&#x27;RE DEFINITELY GOOD TO GO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I GET A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS ABOUT MY (SEEMINGLY) THICK, DARK BLACK CURLS BUT THEY ARE DARK BROWN AND THIN, WELL, FINE STRANDS. I FEEL GOOD.  I WAS TEASED ABOUT MY HAIR ALL OF MY LIFE.  NOW I&#x27;M GOOD TO GO AND ENJOY MYSELF TO NO END. (TO NO FABULOUS END!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY ROUTINE...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHILE IN THE BATH I WET MY HAIR AND PUT THE DEEP CONDITIONER IN AND AFTER THE BATH I RINSE MY HAIR AND MIX A \\&quot;MOISTURIZING LOTION\\&quot; WITH YELLOW MIXED CHICKS LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER AND I GET THE EFFECT I WANT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT BUILD-UP THROUGH THE WEEK BUT I WASH MY HAIR WITH A LIGHT SHAMPOO EVERY SAT. OR SUNDAY AND START ALL OVER.  I CAN FINGER MY HAIR AT ALL TIMES.  THAT&#x27;S WHAT I LIKE.  I FINGER MY HAIR CONSTANTLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CELBEBRATE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;MARGARET</li>
            <li> Now this is what really makes your hair soft and tangled free I absolutely love this stuff. And it smells devine :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who is bi-racial (white &amp; black), and who is trying to grow her hair back out natural. Most of the perm is out, so she is just trying to keep it moisturized until she can get all new growth and start enhancing her natural curls again. She has used it twice and her hair is VERY soft after using this....not even the deep conditioners or hot oil treatments have left her hair this soft. So, she is happy, and is obviously is moisturizing quite well.</li>
            <li> WOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!!!!! I looked everywhere to choose the best product that wasn&#x27;t too expensive but had excellent results and this product exceeds my expectations! When I read that it makes your hair easy to comb through when you immediately put it on your hair I had to give it a try. And it is absolutely TRUE! Easy to comb through (I use denman brush 5 rows). The smell is amazing and makes your hair feel ultra soft. I am a year and a half from my big chop.....I was nearly bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I do for my hair routine that makes your hair look AMAZING:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part hair into 4 sections, securing each with jumbo clips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 1 section start by applying your shampoo (I use up whatever I have on hand which was Mizani) don&#x27;t rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then apply a decent amount of your conditioner (I used a product called It&#x27;s Yours Hair Co Tea Tress Conditioner with Peppermint that my mother gave me cannot not find it on amazon though so it must be new) put it on top of the shampoo so that your hair is NOT left striped and feeling harsh from rinsing out shampoo. Re-clip each section when done so it doesn&#x27;t get in the way when working with other sections of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do this to all sections and do not rinse out anything until all sections are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once on your last section do not rinse out...start with the first one you began with and rinse out the shampoo and conditioner. You are only rinsing out one section so that the conditioner can stay in a bit longer in each section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply only a dime size to a quarter size of Mixed Chicks, a little bit truly goes a LONG way. Depending on how much hair you have I have to part the section I&#x27;m working with into 2 sections so I can use my Denman brush to comb through it all. Once done Re-clip and continue to next section, repeating all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all sections are done DO NOT RINSE OUT Mixed Chicks. Go around again, starting with the first section and rinse it out then apply Eco Styler Gel (Aragon Oil or Olive Oil) or whatever you like to use as your wash n go. Make sure the section your working on is completely soaked so that gel can go on and easily get combed through with your Denman brush. Combing the section after applying the gel with really DEFINE YOUR CURLS. You might even need to wet it again while applying the gel and combing if your hair really eats up water like mine does. By the way all of this is in the shower since I need to continually rewet my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Repeat with all sections and you&#x27;re done with the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat your hair all over with a t-shirt lightly, yes gel will get on this shirt... looks like a big mess. Follow up with using your diffuser on your blow dryer and if your have the flat attachment (don&#x27;t know what its called) use it to get the roots while pulling on your hair so that your hair does not shrink up like a mushroom. It will if you do not blow dry your hair at all. I have the FHI Dryer which comes with all 3 attachments. When your done switch back to the diffuser and blast your hair with cool air...its okay if its a little damp in the end, let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spray on a leave in conditioner which you should do every morning. You can just use water in a spray bottle or water with a little of your favorite oil/leave in conditioner mixed in. And your done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you buy this product, you will not be disappointed! And remember a little goes a long way so if you wash your hair once a week it would last a pretty long time until having to buy another jar so its worth the cost!yler Gel (Aragon Oil or Olive Oil) or whatever you like to use as your wash n go.

            <li> When I decided to go natural, I didn&#x27;t do the Big Chop. I decided to transition and let the relaxer grow out with diefferent protective styles. I fell in love with the kinky twists because they were versatile enough that I could put them up in a bun for work and wear them down on the weekends. At any rate, when I took them down the first time, I freaked out because there was so much shedding. The second time, my hair stylist told me to use the Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner when I combed out my hair. Oh My Goodness.....talk about a total 180! I had so much LESS shedding when I used the deep conditioner to comb out my hair! I was so thankful, I told everyone about Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner and their product line. I love it and would recommend their sulfate-free shampoo to anyone who&#x27;s natural....it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product, works really good!</li>
            <li> It provided the moisture that I needed works great! I will order larger containers and leave in conditioner next time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Mixed Chicks products. It has been so difficult to find products to work on my curly hair. Being biracial means that my hair type is unlike anyone elses hair type. Both my brother and I have the same parents and our hair couldn&#x27;t be more different. But, Mixed chicks works for both of us. I always get it from Amazon.com because of the free shipping with Prime- it just makes the process that much easier. I totally recommend!</li>
            <li> The best combo out there. At first the products seem a tad expensive but they really are not they last months!</li>
            <li> I have natural straight hair but thought to give mixed chicks a try. Great product left my hair feeling amazing, def. would buy again!</li>
            <li> My Review: I just recieved the product and I like how the product helps when I untangle my hair, it also smells really great.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, however I only use it on my fake hair. Great for my ponytails: when the wind blows people always say &amp;#34;your hair smells great!&amp;#34; I find that it&#x27;s not the right product for conditioning my own natural hair. Maybe that&#x27;s b/c it&#x27;s not thick enough? Works for what I need it for, and the scent alone makes it a keeper.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype surrounding the &#x27;Mixed Chicks&#x27; product line. It definitely worked, it conditioned my hair really well and had an all around nice smell. But it didn&#x27;t work any better than other products I have gotten for half the price. It did what it was supposed to do and that&#x27;s it, it didn&#x27;t go above and beyond. Definitely only deserves three stars.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells great and it leaves your hair really soft. I probably will not repurchase because it has silicone in it and I stay away from all products with cones since I have low porosity hair and live in an area that has hard water.</li>
            <li> I love Mixed chicks products for my daughter - if you have any really bad tangles (from not brushing every day) use the deep conditioner &amp; comb it out in the shower - works AMAZINGLY.....</li>
            <li> I have used this 4 times. And so far I love it! It&#x27;s an expensive conditioner, at $14, but it does what I need it to do better than almost anything I have ever tried. I am biracial, and I have thick, coarse Hispanic hair that tangles at the drop of a hat. I put a healthy amount of this in my hair and then brush it out, then rinse. It makes my hair smooth, soft, and less frizzy. There is no buildup and it feels clean and weightless. It makes my nightmare hair less of a nightmare and I love that. Now if there was a curl enhancing product...</li>
            <li> This is my go to conditioner. No matter what other products I buy I also go back to this one.</li>
            <li> I am biracial (black/white) and I have natural hair. I have never permed it, I don&#x27;t flat iron it and I even try to stay away from the blow dryer. I have 3c hair when it&#x27;s wet but it straightens out a bit about 3 days after I&#x27;ve washed it to the point where it hardly tangles and I can run my fingers through it comfortably. I saw all of the positive reviews for this product and a friend of mine even recommended it to me. I decided to take the chance because I needed a deep conditioner before the weather got really hot. I used this after I washed my hair and let it sit for about 5 or so minutes and then rinsed. I noticed almost immediately the extra weight added to my hair. Right away there was a decent amount of slip but ultimately, this product only made my hair shrink up way more than It normally would. It&#x27;s been a week since I&#x27;ve used this product after I shampooed and ITS DRIER THAN I&#x27;VE EVER SEEN IT BEFORE. My hair is brittle and coarse now and I can&#x27;t run my fingers through it anymore. It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;ve gone from 3c to almost 4c. I have gotten wwaaaayyy better results from other products on the mainstream market. It seems that Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner only coated my hair for a little while then just left it dry. If you&#x27;re like me, go with Suave Naturals Macadamia and White Orchid Shampoo and Conditioner set. I should have never switched.</li>
            <li> I seen this on a youtube video and had to try it. love it great for price. Didn&#x27;t want to pay alot just to try a new product, this was worth it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! My hair is naturally a giant bush. It&#x27;s long, thick, massively frizzy, and has a mind of its own. I&#x27;m half Mexican, half Irish/German. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products ranging from cheap stuff at Target to really expensive salon treatments. I was using Wen for a really long time which seemed to calm the frizz down a lot but it just wasn&#x27;t quite what I wanted. Plus I had to use A LOT of it for it to work which was so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used Mixed Chicks, not only did it calm the frizz down but it brought out this gorgeous beach wave in my hair that I didn&#x27;t even know I had. It still has fullness and volume too! My boyfriend is also mixed race, Indian/Swiss. He started using it and his jet black hair is so shiny and silky now. He loves it too! He says his hair is so much easier to style now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this out for anyone with frizz problem whether you&#x27;re mixed race or not.</li>
            <li> This by far is one of the best deep conditioners out. I have African American natural hair and this stuff did wonders for me. My hair felt like silk afterwards and it was so easy to detangles. Mixed Chicks is that deal y&#x27;all!!!</li>
            <li> Hmy hair is super soft especially when its mixed with Evoo ,I let mine sit for 30mins tho, I strongly recommend</li>
            <li> For my 3C biracial (black/white) curls, this product is okay.  I like the moisture content, but it&#x27;s just okay at detangling my thin parched curls.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to purchase this product, because I am not mixed, but after reading reviews from other women who are not mixed and the awesome results they got, I was sold. This product makes your hair silky soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have used this everyday so far for the past 3 weeks I bought the liter size cause I love it so much! It pops all my curls even the really tiny stubborn ones! Everytime I get out the shower I have the same beautiful curls. And it also clumps my curls</li>
            <li> I HAVE TWO GIRLS THERE FATHER AND MY FATHER ARE BIRACIAL, THEY BOTH HAVE CURLY HAIR BUT DIFFERENT TYPES,,,THIS PRODUCT MADE MY 8 YEAR OLD LOVE HER HAIR&lt;br /&gt;THEY GET COMPLIMENTS  ALL THE TIME,,PEOPLE WANT TO COME UP AND TOUCH IT BECAUSE IT LEAVES THE HAIR LIGHT AND SOFT NOT FULL OF STICKY GEL,,,THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!  Will purchase again and again!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever for women with frizzy or coarser hair! This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> No deep conditioner ever worked on my hair. I&#x27;m a natural 3c headed girl. This conditioner is the best thing I have ever owned for my hair. It provides super slip, smells great and leaves my hair fully detangled. It makes my hair feel fresh and alive again. I will love this product until the end of the world. I really don&#x27;t like their leave  in as it makes my hair feel stripped and dry. Buy this deep conditioner and when you are done, a good leave in with pure virgin olive oil and you are set for life. Thanks Mixed chicks.</li>
            <li> After only using it once I saw a difference in my hair. I like to rinse it completely out and use just a dime size amount after getting out the shower if I&#x27;m out of my leave-in conditioner. This kept my gel from getting crunchy and I had such soft curls that were still defined. I am sensitive to strong smelling products and this just had a very light scent that only lasts a few minutes after rinsing. I am going silicone and *mostly* sulfate free so I need a great deep conditioner to keep my hair from going crazy. Will definitely be using this from now on!</li>
            <li> its okay not a huge nor significant difference aftet using this product had used a better quality in the past. possibly not a good choice for very fine thin tresses.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for use after my swimming workouts and it definitely did the trick!  My chlorine striped hair was restored to it&#x27;s normal softness...actually, it felt the best it&#x27;s felt in a looong time!  As a &#x27;mixed chick&#x27; I am wary of ethnic products because they tend to weigh my hair down.  This product is the perfect balance of additional conditioning without the extra weight!  I will likely purchase more products in this line for myself and my boys as they grow.</li>
            <li> nothing amazing for the price I think it&#x27;s over rated there is other product that do the same for much cheaper prices</li>
            <li> it would be nice if it held more ounces for the price it is at... but it was still decent.</li>
            <li> Not a mixed chick but this is a staple for my entire household.  My children and I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am also biracial, half black and half hispanic, with very kinky and curly hair and I&#x27;ve tried many hair products especially hair products for black women but nothing seemed to work. Then my mom recommended this product and I thought it was a bit too pricey to get at first but now after ordering it and using it my hair, it made my curls feel so much softer and it laid them down alot!! I not only use this as deep conditioner when I wash my hair but as well as a leave-in conditioner on the go.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite hobbies is trying various hair products.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for the holy grail conditioner when I decided to try Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner, there are many wonderful conditioners that I&#x27;ve found that work well on my hair.  This was just a brand that I was curious about.  I&#x27;ll get to the point by saying that my hair adored this conditioner.  It is so good that it has earned a rating in my world of products.  It&#x27;s #1 on my list of 5.  The conditioner has earned this status due to the thickness of the product.  My conditioner&#x27;s must be thick!  Its detangling capabiities bordered upon excellent.  I whipped through my hair in about 3 minutes! The smell is pleasant and once I rinsed it out, I didn&#x27;t need to add anything else.  Usually, I do a rinse or a leave-in but this wasn&#x27;t necessary after using this fab conditioner.  Nor did I have to use a lot of product and my hair reaches the center of my back; another plus.  This will definitely keep my hair in check during the hot, humid, summer months. I purchased the liter size and have no regrets.  I will continue to use this quality conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great for my sons hair</li>
            <li> I love using this on my son&#x27;s hair.  He has lots of curls and I was so tired of fighting when we tried to brush out all the knots.  We don&#x27;t even have to brush it out before washing now, tangles come right out after we use it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and loved it. I only decided to try something that worked okay but never gave me the results I get from Mixed Chicks. When I used it again for the first time, I could immediately tell the difference. This is by far the best product I have ever used and I will be a mixed Chicks customer from now on.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner has definitely helped to re-define my natural curls. I have been natural for almost two years and have tried other deep conditioners which did not quite work for me. This products definitely works for my hair and my curls have been coming back quickly! I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone going natural!!</li>
            <li> I did my moisture DV overnight and when rinsing, my hair felt a little shall we say...strengthened/stripped!!! Well Well Well incomes the product (had for some time but first used today) that BEAT this hair into a tangle/frizz-free submission!!! I elevate this to HOLY GRAIL/#1 product for my hair... Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus is that it smells of my Beloved fave perfume Calyx:):)</li>
            <li> My wife who is white really loves Mixed Chick for our biracial child.</li>
            <li> I was hoping all the good thimgs after all the reviews I read before purchasing this product, it leaves my hair very dry and it feels very cheap, mahbe is not for my hair type 2b.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use until I finish, maybe the results will change</li>
            <li> It has been a while since I allowed my hair to dry naturally (without an applied heat treatment), so I chose the Mixed Chicks Conditioner to use for this experiment based on positive reviews by others.  The results &#x3D; most impressive.  I applied the conditioner and rinsed as indicated and did not apply a leave-in conditioner (for which I admit I was a bit nervous).  But my hair felt strong (not thin &amp; stringy as I feared). I allowed my hair to dry, and was most pleased with the results.  I will certainly purchase another jar when I run out.</li>
            <li> I tried this product. it is good stuff. It did what it said it would do and therefore I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Not really moisturizing for my hair. Didn&#x27;t like at all. After application my hair did not feel deep condition.</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer for curly hair.  You can leave it on for a deeper conditioner or just rinse it quickly if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> GREAT!! I have used what feels like thousands of deep conditioners and this is GREAT! I have done some stressful things to my hair and this is the revive system; dying pink, orange, red, blue, purple, etc.  I use it and twist my hair up or just let it dry naturally and my hair is still soft the next day; it&#x27;s still soft a week later and if my head wrap falls off! I use IsoPlus tea tree and aloe hair conditioner while my hair is still wet because their mixed chick curl defining leave in leaves my hair feeling hard. The Isoplus works great with it so fair. My hair texture is curly but not spring curls.</li>
            <li> Well this is not the first time that I&#x27;ve used this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years...since I went natural. I am not a &amp;#34;mixed chick&amp;#34; but this product came highly referred from one of my friends. Her hair is always beautiful and I asked her what she used. I started using it. I use the shampoo...which makes your hair moist and not dry at all. It does not strip the hair. This conditioner and the Leave In Conditioner. The Leave conditioner will define your curls and keep them from getting frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Deep Conditioner is highly moisturizing. I started using some of the conditioner from the various hotels that I visit and although they are fine....it&#x27;s just not the same. This conditioner is very thick and almost like a mask. Sometimes I will leave it in all day and it just makes my hair so soft. (Oh, did I say that I&#x27;m African American and my hair is very curly/wavy but very dry). This conditioner is the best. It works immediately and you can feel a difference instantaneously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to pay for shipping which I am not a big fan of and it came in a huge box. I feel that was a waste. They could have charged me 1.50 and put it in a puffy envelope. But oh well...I had Amazon bucks or I would have purchased it at Target like always.</li>
            <li> My 4yr old has unruly locks that are beautiful when wet but frizzy when dry.  I&#x27;ve tried countless products on her that have taken a toll but this hair creme seems to be rejuivating her locks back to life and making them manageable without breaking her hair as I brush it.  Plus we like the way it feels and smells....so I would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> YASSSSSSS! Praise be to the hair gods!  This DC is EVERYTHING!  It&#x27;s thick, but it has slip.  I lathered my hair in this, and applied a little heat, and it was on-and-popping. I love it a lot!  It&#x27;s worth it.  If you use it once a week, your hair will thank you.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing! I wet my hair, detangled my hair then left it in for about 30 minutes. Washed it out. Touched my hair and it was so soft and fluffy. I&#x27;m smitten with this product and might change out my giovanni leave in conditioner for mixed chicks. Honestly I wanna use the whole line now because I remember I got  a sample of the leave in at Rickys and it was so poppin. Keep it up Mixed Chicks, you definitely have a loyal customer now because my hair loves you. Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS&lt;br /&gt;the only con that i have is the smell, didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall results&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this and I&#x27;ll purchase again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably best for those who are mixed or have hair textures in the 3&#x27;s or up. I don&#x27;t want to say I was mislead... but I read reviews from woman who say they&#x27;re black and and/or have 4a/b hair who used this product and stand by it claiming it&#x27;s great. My hair is 4a with 3c in the back. I used this product to detangle and after I rinsed it, it left my 4a curls, that are usually very defined, limp with almost no definition and my hair had a squeaky, not moisturized feel. My 3c hair in the back was lose, droopy and not as springy. This was probably one of the worse products claiming to be a \\&quot;Deep Conditioner\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve been natural 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly enough, I usually use TRESemme Naturals Moisture conditioner or their Smooth and Silk conditioner to detangle and it&#x27;s $7-$10 cheaper than this. After rinsing, those products leave my hair soft and defined. I&#x27;ll be 100% honest, I initially wanted to avoid this product because it&#x27;s called MIXED CHICKS and I&#x27;m not a mixed chick so I figured it&#x27;s not for me. Well, I should have listened to my instincts, so I only blame myself for going against better judgment. So yeah, you live and learn and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll bother with anything else from the Mixed Chicks line.</li>
            <li> This product really does what it says it will do. I am not a &amp;#34;mixed chick&amp;#34; but as an African American woman I can appreciate a product that will detangle my hair from a single deep conditioner. I recently started co-washing my hair in between my hair appointments with my beautician and I absolutely love this for home use. I got a tip from someone to try this and I do not regret it. I feel that this conditioner can be for any hair type. I may have been skeptical before because mixed chick label and the price at my local (Tarje&#x60; not target) store. But if you&#x27;re still a little iffy about it, I&#x27;d recommend it... And plus it smells great in my opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated 4 stars because its some similar products that will do the same, pretty much for less the cost.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a deep conditioner  for my hair that doesn&#x27;t use mineral oil or petrolatum. I&#x27;m African American with 4A texlaxed hair, so it&#x27;s curly and I don&#x27;t bother trying to straighten it.  Reading all of the great reviews and the ingredients list prompted me to buy this product. (Redacted my first review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/14/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry to report that although it does make my hair soft right after use, over time my hair became very dry using this. My hair just suddenly became very thirsty although I moisturize regularly and my new growth grew in crunchy. My hair also experienced tangling at the ends, something I never had before but I assumed it might be time for a trim; however, my stylist looked over my hair and I don&#x27;t need a trim. The only change to my routine was this product, so it&#x27;s the only logical conclusion I can draw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I figured it out now as opposed to several months later when my hair starts snapping off. So I will not be using this product again in the future; it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> Must be thoroughly rinsed out of your Hair. It makes body and the Hair is soft</li>
            <li> It is nice smell good but it had a lot tangle when  am using sometime.it make me mad so I stop using.what; I use kids condion which has not tangle.  It is true.</li>
            <li> I use and love the mixed chicks kids line for my kids, who are mixed (half black, half white). One day I picked this product up and thought to give it a try for my own hair (I&#x27;m white) and I love how my hair got so soft after using it!</li>
            <li> excellent product and I will continue to order this on a regular basis.  I will also look for other products sold by this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I have never used it as a deep conditioner so I can&#x27;t comment on that. I have only used it as a regular detangling condish and for that it works and is good. My hair is curly and get knotted very easily so it would be nice if this condish made it easier to detangle but again it it good just not my &amp;#34;soul mate&amp;#34;  or holy grail condish. But I would recommend it for anybody with type 3 and type 4 curls.  :-)</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this conditioner. I have used so many other conditioners on my hair over the years, but this one leaves my hair really feeling nice. It really works great on all types of hair, as it states. I was always having an issue with hair conditioners that over moisturize my hair and this one does not do that. My hair is perfectly conditioned and soft after every use. I highly suggest this brand to anyone looking for a new conditioner and unsure about what to get.</li>
            <li> Yes OMG I looove the deep conditioner. Its nice &amp; thick so u don&#x27;t need a lot and immediately u feel ur hair so soft b4 u rinse it out. I will b buying this over &amp; over I love the way my hair feels</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have found for my daughter, who is 4 that really moisturizes her hair so we can comb it without tears!  She has fine, blond hair that dries out, it&#x27;s amazing what a quarter size amount can do without build up or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I was using mixed silk deep conditioner for a while. I loved it. but I was told  and read reviews that  Mixed chicks is almost the same as Mixed silk and because of patent issues Mixed silk had to stop production.  But it is not same product as Mixed silk and it is very expensive. I feel I wasted money for nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good conditioner.  I&#x27;m not really sure how much it&#x27;s improving my hair yet but it feels good after I use it.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner really makes the hair feels great.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give this item 5 stars is because I hate the container it comes in. I use the conditioner in the shower, and because this comes in a jar rather than a bottle of some kind, it&#x27;s just harder to use.  Otherwise, I love it... Well, I DO keep ordering it after all!</li>
            <li> I am biracial (black &amp; white) I have very thick curly hair and I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing seemed to work I was constantly buying gel for my hair.  Then I came across Mixed Chicks I was hesitant at first, but then i just purchased the mixed Chicks trio where you get the shampoo, deep conditioner and the leave in conditioner it was AMAZING!  I was so shocked how mixed Chicks made my hair feel it really does work.  And a little goes a long ways so you don&#x27;t need much and it smells really good. Go to MixedChicks.net if you wanna just try the smaller bottles to see if you really like it, you won&#x27;t be sorry :)</li>
            <li> LOOSE this , it&#x27;s exactly what all the positive reviews say it is.  Thanks previous reviewers for directing me to this magic goop :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and it was nice and sealed!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, came on time.</li>
            <li> This works well for deep conditioning my 3B curly hair. I like to braid it into my wet hair once a week and sleep with it on my satin pillow case (to prevent breakage). It&#x27;s not oily at all.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- leaves hair soft&lt;br /&gt;- has a nice scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- does not completely detangle hair&lt;br /&gt;- does not feel like a deep conditioner even after leaving on for 15 minutes of more</li>
            <li> It works!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is bi-racial and has beautiful 3C hair. It was a struggle getting it untangled, let alone &amp;#34;styled&amp;#34;. Mixed Chicks works great and cut our styling time in half. We used it in the tub, let it work while she was playing and used a wide comb. It didn&#x27;t hurt and it wasn&#x27;t long process. Her hair is soft with strong curls and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> Very good for hair but has a tendency to dry it out.</li>
            <li> Great mild scent, pretty moisturizing but it&#x27;s a little challenge to work through hair so I use the rinse out conditioner first, lightly rinse and that seems to help move the other through. I then put a shower cap on my daughter&#x27;s head and finish her bath/shower. I only partially rinse it out so that she keeps some of the moisture.</li>
            <li> First ingredient is water (not conditioning), second is alcohol (drying), next up are more alcohol and chemicals you cannot even pronounce, with preservatives and perfume. Exactly how is this good for your hair in the long run?  gross, what are we doing to ourselves?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure as to how I could rate this product. The container is pretty small, in my opinion. For example his reason, I don&#x27;t use this solely. I mix it with some other conditioners, avocado, olive, and coconut oil. I get pretty descent results from doing this. This conditioner does smell great, though!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work out for my hair</li>
            <li> Love it!! Finally a product that works for my hair.</li>
            <li> Im not crazy about this conditioner as Im in a journey testing different products for my naturally 3c hair. It does the function but Im not crazy about it...I believe my Moroccanoil deep conditioner does a better job. Im not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I adore this conditioner and have purchased several times. I have extremely dry hair and this conditioner has solved that. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this and I recommend to anyone suffering from dry hair.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t seem like the real Mixed Chick deep conditioner.  i usually purchase this item all the time, the feel and smell was different.</li>
            <li> i love this deep conditioner it brought life back to my hair. I cannot wait to recommend it to all my friends</li>
            <li> I am white but have very coarse, very curly hair.  I bought and used together the shampoo, deep conditioning, and leave in conditioner.  I LOVE the leave in conditioner.  I previously used alot of product in my hair to keep it together, and now I use just the leave in conditioner and it&#x27;s amazing.  The shampoo is good, but it doesn&#x27;t really lather.  I like a good lather sometimes so would occasionally use my husband&#x27;s shampoo when I had that need.  The deep conditioner was also terrific, thick and creamy and only a small amount needed.  I am not sure I will purchase the shampoo again but the two conditioners are definite must haves for me.</li>
            <li> Product is as described.  We have found it to be the best product we have used for course ethnic hair.  We would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am biracial white/black. I have two different textures wavy and straight. My hair texture had changed for the worse considering hormone issues. My hair was so think as a child, I would pop rubber bands in trying to put one on. My mom put a relaxer in my hair and messed it up. My hair has been shedding and really dry, I have tried everything and really hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Dry/frizzy hair rescue! I use it every few days for a moisture rich treatment.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner I have been looking for the right one for my Daughter&#x27;s and little sister&#x27;s hair type for a while now and I think I found it, it leaves her hair nice and soft no frizz or dryness her curls really do look and feels healthy. She has had many comments and compliments. now the best part Very little on your palm goes a long way on your hair. This is almost a concentrated texture, it rinses out all impurities in her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;  Cleans Thoroughly without drying her hair out&lt;br /&gt;  Great Smell&lt;br /&gt;  Lathers Well&lt;br /&gt;  Adds Shine&lt;br /&gt;  Adds Volume&lt;br /&gt;  Gentle&lt;br /&gt;  Improves Hair Health&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Uses&lt;br /&gt;  Curly Hair (natural)&lt;br /&gt;  Oily Hair&lt;br /&gt;  Thicker Hair&lt;br /&gt;  Thinner Hair&lt;br /&gt;  Dry scalp</li>
            <li> This product is super drying - has anyone else noticed this?  The smell and slip are great, but after substituting this in with my regular routine - I couldn&#x27;t believe how dry and Not moisturized my hair was.  Nope, nope, nope.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of similar products in all price ranges and purchased this when my go to deep conditioned finished.  I&#x27;m going to get rid of this product and just bought another tub of my go to product this weekend.  Don&#x27;t kick it till you try it, and it will become your go-to as well, for some reason it moisturizes and adds shine like crazy (I think the second ingredient is castor oil but it rinses clean vs doing a DIY oil treatment).  The mixed chicks doesn&#x27;t add shine btw.  I suggest trying the Hollywood Beauty Cholesterol in the semi transparent tub - its a green goop with an olive green screw on lid and has a basic, slightly sweet smell - nothing crazy.  The huge tub of it costs $2.50 at wally world.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;mixed ethnicity&amp;#34; but it is mixed texture due to some parts going grey and behaving badly (dry, kinky, brittle).  This conditioner feels amazing on both my fine baby-straight hair and the wild unruly patches.  They&#x27;re both so smooth I don&#x27;t have to use a leave in conditioner at all, and I no longer have to tug tangles out of the ends. The chemical color damage spots are almost invisible now, too, instead of frizzy at the ends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one use I could tell my hair felt different. I assume it&#x27;s mainly due to the mix of silicones since it wasn&#x27;t oily at all (fine hair + oily &#x3D; stringy and stuck to your scalp).  If you regularly blow dry or use heat tools, you&#x27;ll notice some dryness (the silicones keep moisture out, so your blow dry is faster, but it also means the hairs get dehydrated).  I suggest a heat protector of some kind if you need to heat-style your hair more than once a week.</li>
            <li> This product is great especially for curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I trhought this was a good product but would not be my first choice in deep conditioners.  I am not sure thatr I would reorder it.</li>
            <li> I checked out a youtube.com video that talked about co-washing. They spoke of this conditioner. I tried it and I really like it . It keeps your hair moistened.</li>
            <li> i had high expectations but I guess it just didn&#x27;t work on my hair, it was good gave me ok moisture but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It&#x27;s a good product though.</li>
            <li> I use with the shampoo!  Like the shampoo, it is thick and you need very little.  Leaves hair quite soft and full when dry!</li>
            <li> For everything in my hair, I use homemade natural and organic products, but Mixed chicks deep conditioner is the only thing I but and love that is not because it is the only thing I have found for my hair that works as a deep conditioner. I love this stuff and am hooked. Best investment I can make for my hair at this price. So glad I discovered it a year ago while living in London, UK.</li>
            <li> I saw this on YouTube by my girl PhillyJamzPoet. I bought it. I will not be using any other conditioner. EVER. It&#x27;s that good. Now I&#x27;m not mixed. So, people, don&#x27;t get hung up on this &amp;#34;mixed chics&amp;#34; thing. It&#x27;s just a name. Anybody can use this. ANYBODY. Black, brown, white whatever. The lady who made it is mixed. That IS ALL IT MEANS. I am full African American and natural, and let me tell you this stuff is a miracle. I went through a ton of conditioners before I found this and I am so thankful. My hair is having an affair with this conditioner. It&#x27;s light enough to use as a co-wash, light enough as a mixer in some water in a spray bottle to use as a conditioning mix, light enough to put into your home made hair creams. Smells wonderful, it&#x27;s more natural than most stuff I&#x27;ve seen and it just WORKS. I&#x27;m a 4a 4b and I can&#x27;t say enough about this conditioner. Get it. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This conditioner melts tangles out, and softness and manageability into your hair. My curls are beautiful, and I really could let it air dry like that, but what I do is air dry 80% then blow dry straight the rest of the way.  My hair is soft, silky, and smells beautiful.  I love it.  Whether you leave it on for a minute or 30, my hair is amazing.  The end of a life long search for the right conditioner is here.  This Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner is IT!  I am going to try more products in this line.  But the conditioner ROCKS!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Mixed Chics deep conditioner.  It is an amazing product with the power to detangle like no ohter I&#x27;ve found.  Buying it from this vendor was very disappointing.  The product came timely and well packed, but is not the magical elixer I am accustomed to with Mixed Chicks.  It was a waste of precious money and is frustrating with every use.  It doesn&#x27;t do the job at all.  I think I&#x27;ll keep ordering direct for full price.  The Mixed Chicks website has a glorifying review from me for a reason.</li>
            <li> This product smells reeeally good! I have ethnic hair (I&#x27;m black &amp; white).. It just doesn&#x27;t help de-tangling my hair as easy as I would like. Although after blow-drying and straightening it is very soft. My son, on the other hand, he has curly hair (he is black, white, &amp; Hispanic and his hair isn&#x27;t anything like mine - it&#x27;s just curly) it leaves his curls very shiny and like in perfect condition :)</li>
            <li> I treid this product for about two months, I think it&#x27;s because I have course african american hair, this product is truly for mixed chicks :}</li>
            <li> The best product for my granddaughters hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m full Chinese and I have very thick Asian hair that dries out easily. I use this product about once a week and it leaves my hair shiny and incredibly soft. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve ever lived without this product. Great smell too.</li>
            <li> I was really not impressed with this product. It takes a lot for my hair I only got about 4 uses out of the jar.</li>
            <li> Quick Delivery! Works well too.</li>
            <li> This product is not stated for biracial when they say mixed chicks it&#x27;s chicks who&#x27;s mixed with different ethnicities get it right but it can be for people of all ethnicity that this product may work best for they&#x27;re hair not just for biracial if it was made for biracial it would of said so just wanted to clarified that ..and I think I might buy me this since it&#x27;s good ratings on it because I need something good for my hair as we&#x27;ll it&#x27;s breaking off</li>
            <li> There is nothing more to say I loved everything about this product. It makes my hair feel so soft, moisturized and detangles well.</li>
            <li> This stuff comes in a tiny charge but its powerful, works and smells great. What more could you ask for!</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells nice, made my hair soft, however,  it wasn&#x27;t worth it because my hair  started falling out since I started falling out, I have stopped using it and and not I&#x27;m not losing as much hair as I was using this, I even noticed this product did the same thing to my mother in laws hair as well.  I&#x27;m very disappointed and unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome, as always. I&#x27;ll never use any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is not just for biracial women.  It&#x27;s for anyone who wants to make their hair softer than usual.</li>
            <li> Best Deep Conditioner i ever used ..love it â™¡</li>
