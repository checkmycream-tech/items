            <li>For the price I feel like it&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li>The smell of the Lemon basil is really pleasant and leaves a nice scent afterwards (not the kind of treatment that just smells while it&#x27;s on your hair!).  </li>

            <li>My hair felt very light afterwards!</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try this intensive hair treatment as well as the detoxifying shampoo and conditioner (received product complimentary for testing purposes), and I&#x27;m SO happy I did!  </li>

            <li>Having said that, I really liked the way this has made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I am loving this Herbal Essences line.  </li>
            <li>While I was sent this product, this review is my own thoughts and opinion.  </li>
            <li>Conditions nicely when paired with the detoxifying shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li>Not so for me - I really liked the way my hair looked and felt after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It had a nice smell as well.</li>
            <li>I received the product as a free sample through Influenster and love it!!</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free from my Herbal Essence Voxbox from Influenster which was a great opportunity</li>
            <li>Not to mention it smells great and leaves hair very shiny also!!</li>
            <li>All my hair was soft, manageable and perfect.</li>
            <li>i loved it so much !!!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>and I simply love, love, love!  </li>
            <li>It feels like it helps strengthen your hair too, though it is not an ideal conditioner for detangling, which is what I appreciate most from a conditioner with my fine hair that would love to live in knots of its own making!</li>
            <li>What I loved most was the light fragrance.</li>
            <li>This product smells great, very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I am going to save so much money, and my hair smells beautiful, too.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner yielded great results the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell and think it is too strong, but I do love the effect this product has on my hair!  </li>
            <li>I was given this product to test and review from Influenster.com, and I am so happy to report my experience as a positive one.  </li>
            <li>The smell is like you are using straight lemons and oranges very refreshing!</li>
            <li>, I love how this made my hair feel even as I applied it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the citrusy scent of this intensive treatment product.</li>
            <li>And so smooth!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and love the feeling of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It has a lovely fragrance dominated by lemon with elements of ginger and basil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does something, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>and I just love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>The intensive treatment made my hair look great and really allowed it to detoxify from city life.</li>
            <li>I also love the lemony scent and do not feel that it smells at all like &amp;#34;cleaning products&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great scent, but more importantly, this leaves hair fresh and buoyant.  </li>
            <li>Love the overpowering smell which helps cover up baby spit smell.</li>
            <li>But I am in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the scent that they come with, but this intensive treatment that it comes with works WAY better the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li>- this makes my hair look effortlessly fantastic without all the work!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>interesting noises...)</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this in the mail, I have never used anything on my hair like this!</li>
            <li>but i like it better the way i use it.</li>
            <li>pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>i get so many compliments on how healthy it looks.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is my favorite product in this line.</li>
            <li>; thing comes off as a gimmick; this is just a conditioner, and it&#x27;s not going to magically remove whatever toxins</li>
            <li>the price point, it&#x27;s not a terrible option.</li>
            <li>And I love it.  </li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try this out for free!</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with the results from this product!</li>
            <li>I love this...</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and I also had to make sure it was used sparingly</li>
            <li>I was worried that I would experience oily hair afterwards, but it rinsed out clear and beautifully.</li>
            <li>I love it and strongly reccomend it</li>
            <li>And was so clean!</li>
            <li>Squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li>It also helps control the static in fine hair.</li>
            <li>And it also washed out clean and easily!</li>
            <li>much so I can&#x27;t compare this to others of its kind, but my hair liked it fine.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, my legs felt really well moisturized?  </li>
            <li>Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive hair conditioner is a great concept.  </li>
            <li>I smooth it from top to bottom, massaging it into my ends and let it sit for a minute or so.</li>
            <li>and I liked the way the two worked together, screw the conditioner that wasn&#x27;t worth it at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how it detoxifies, but it did leave my hair silky smooth and easy to brush after I used it.</li>
            <li>The scent of this Herbal Essence is fabulous, Lemony, fresh, gingery, I love the way this smells!</li>
            <li>This is the most incredible smelling product I have used and will definitely be going to purchase full size bottles of this product line.</li>
            <li>My hair which I was every other day, and by end of day 2 is rather oily on the scalp, is still rather perfect.</li>
            <li>I also color treat my hair, so it tends to break easily.</li>
            <li>I tend to change my hair products every couple of weeks to avoid my fine hair becoming overly greasy.  </li>
            <li>I like the easy to use tub</li>
            <li>It actually didn&#x27;t so I am happy to say that I love this product.</li>
            <li>An easy on the wallet buy.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did was check out the smell, which is amazing.</li>
            <li>I noticed that if you wait 3-5 minutes before rinsing out with COOL water, it tends to work better.</li>
            <li>Instead, I was left with a nice shine and a pleasant, clean scent of citrus.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is nice and thick and it smells very nice (not as strong as the shampoo, which smells beyond amazing)</li>
            <li>I have fine dyed hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have fine, oily hair that gets flaky looking when I don&#x27;t get all my hair products (hair spray) out in the shower.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>(I have fine hair)</li>
            <li>* scent ~ pleasant natural lemon and spice mixture</li>
            <li>The ends of my hair, which usually look scraggly for lack of a better work, look smooth and wonderful.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, Herbal Essences scent and it has a nice feel as you smooth it into wet hair in the shower or bath.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was very pleased!</li>
            <li>The only thing that I would have liked better would be the scent as it is very strong but not actually bad being lemon and basil.</li>
            <li>received this product free for testing purposes</li>
            <li>so frizz free</li>
            <li>I received this product free as part of the Influenster program.</li>
            <li>I received this product as a voxbox for free to test and review.</li>
            <li>I was sent this product for free to test and review.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product for free.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product along with the shampoo and conditioner for a few days and am thoroughly impressed!</li>
            <li>I got this product for free for testing and review purposed from Influenster</li>
            <li>I use this with the shampoo and conditioner I got free to test and review.  </li>
            <li>and as I stated prior, the smell is great.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample to review.</li>
            <li>I rec&#x27;d this free from influenster in my VoxBox to try</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this once my free product is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received free sample of the intensive treatment as well as the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I got this product free to test and review</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just finding that right amount to use on my hair that has had me stumped more than one morning while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend using the entire line of this particular product, the shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment, as I tried each one without the others and they seem to work best all together.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product I received free in a VoxBox since I had never even seen it before.</li>
            <li>I was impressed that it didn&#x27;t weight down my fine hair when using this on top of a normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly strong so probably not for everyone, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>None the less I really enjoyed using this and thought it was great to use 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li>I believe it will work on every type of hair and totally recommend for anyone to try this amazing product give this treatment a chance with the shampoo and conditioner for maximum results!</li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m excited to use this on the days</li>
            <li>I was excited.  </li>
            <li>The verdict: I have super fine hair</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>I could tell a significant difference in how my hair felt.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thick, curly hair and my hair looked great!</li>
            <li>I am inclined to seek out the other formulas in the wild naturals and see if I can tolerate them better because I am impressed with how my hair looks and feels after using just this one product.</li>
            <li>On my way out the door to work, I decided to use my new &amp;#34;lotion.&amp;#34; A nice layer all over my legs.  </li>
            <li>It rinsed cleanly away.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair super smooth and</li>
            <li>I used it with the Wild Naturals shampoo and conditioner and it left my hair feeling great!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>It left my hair very healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>Although I really enjoyed the scent, it didn&#x27;t stick around as long as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and leaves my hair unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li>The conditioner and intense repair was fantastic!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Influenster for the free product!</li>
            <li>It smells like lemon verbena, and it&#x27;s really quite lovely, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have dry, curly hair, so a good conditioner is important to me.</li>
            <li>Like my first impression of the conditioner, I thought it might not work since it seemed to wash off so easily.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would buy it and recommend it to someone who was looking for a good smelling deep conditioner that isn&#x27;t too pricey.</li>
            <li>I love the way it made my hair feel soft and light.</li>
            <li>A quick shower to rinse my legs off</li>
            <li>I get from super moisturizing products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from this brand to be honest</li>
            <li>you are too quick</li>
            <li>For $5.99 with free prime shipping it compares quite well to a much higher priced brand that I use.</li>
            <li>More so than normal.</li>
            <li>Salon quality in my opinion, imagine your hair is full of knots and tangles, using this product after shampooing and conditioning and you will be able to run a comb through it with complete ease!</li>
            <li>But the smell is stronger than I like, and I&#x27;m not sure that the conditioner does any more good for my hair than harm.</li>
            <li>This deep conditioner smells great and leaves my hair super soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>I usually do not use Herbal Essences&#x27; products, but I&#x27;m glad I did this time.  </li>
            <li>It may work better on someone who has more dry or course hair.</li>
            <li>I loved the clean, citrusy smell of the products and felt it left my hair clean and soft and gave it lightweight feeling.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it helped control the frizz of the little fly aways at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the main component in why my hair is softer than ever from root to tip.</li>
            <li>I received complimentary samples of this product to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, I try not to purchase products that contain parabens, so I was very excited to see that Herbal Essences Wild Naturals are paraben-free!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get over how amazing if left my hair feeling!</li>
            <li>This product line did an amazing job at cleaning my hair with only one wash and rinse.</li>
            <li>This left my hair feeling amazing with plenty of volume.  </li>
            <li>and I leave it in for a few minutes and my hair feels great afterwards.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of lemons in my beauty products, so this was a huge winner in fragrance for me.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment.  </li>
            <li>~ promotes a natural, healthy shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>

            <li>I recieved this complimentary from The Influenster team in my Vox box.  </li>
            <li>So fresh and invigorating.</li>
            <li>received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells good and worked as expected.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the try for frizz taming.</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li>I noticed far fewer knots in my hair and was able to run my fingers through it right after a shower (never happens).</li>
            <li>I am able to go with out using my flat iron which is a huge plus for me.  </li>
            <li>I have a full head of hair but my hair has always been fine and soft.</li>
            <li>I have thin fine curly hair and it gets greasy easily if I don&#x27;t use good products.</li>
            <li>This right here is the stuff dreams are made of.  </li>
            <li>The intensive treatment made my hair very soft and was easy to comb through after washing it.</li>
            <li>I had to be very certain to thoroughly rinse it though</li>
            <li>Out of all of the three Wild Naturals products, this one is BY FAR my favorite!</li>
            <li>It is nice that you don&#x27;t have to leave it on very long</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily hair, and this has really helped keep my hair feeling light and clean, even overnight (which never happens for me).  </li>
            <li>After towel drying my hair, however, the comb glided through my fine, thin, color-treated hair easily and honestly felt \\&quot;squeaky clean.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>After my hair dried, it had a nice shine and felt very soft, in better condition than before.  </li>
            <li>It was a little oily for me and not needed at all, the shampoo/conditioner combo is perfect not need to waste time with this one, however I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li>it leaves hair soft, manageable, moisturized, clean, and fresh.</li>
            <li>The product appeared an appropriate consistency to actually add some moisture and nourishment to my hair.</li>
            <li>I Received a free sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment from Influenster to try and review.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>but I thought of it more as a deep conditioner than a detoxifying treatment.</li>
            <li>and though I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a daily conditioner, I enjoy using it about once a week!</li>
            <li>I could feel the difference in my hair after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>but I was able to actually brush my hair and not have tangles.</li>
            <li>It has more of a floral/citrus smell that has actually helped me wake up in the mornings ^_^</li>
            <li>I received the set for the Wild Naturals Detoxifying treatment for free along with the matching shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would help more than just regular</li>
            <li>Used it without conditioning first</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and condition first though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love this and the shampoo and conditioner in a different scent.</li>
            <li>I find that this instantly takes out the tangles in my hair in the shower better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, I don’t get the same results if I use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li>and I feel this performed just as well as the higher end products.  </li>
            <li>I will use it occasionally, probably once or twice a month to keep my hair healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Thanks influenster!</li>
            <li>*).</li>
            <li>- not completely frizz free but significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>I was sent a sample of this line to try (shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner), and this is by far my favorite product of the three!</li>
            <li>Left hair soft and smells amazing</li>
            <li>I tested Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment for free thanks to Herbal Essence and Influenster.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who wants to use a more intensive conditioner once a week in additional to regular wash and conditioner treatments.</li>
            <li>The complimentary sample I got via Influenster will definitely have me coming back for more!</li>
            <li>This treatment creme has a very citrusy aroma which I like very  much.  </li>
            <li>From the first use I noticed a serious difference, and the more I use it, the better it gets.</li>
            <li>(in fact, the directions don&#x27;t specify a length of time; they just say &amp;#34;massage in and rinse out&amp;#34;), so it easy to use regularly in place of a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>The first thing that I have to say is that for me, the scent is too much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally purchase herbal essences, but received a free sample of this product along with the wild naturals shampoo and conditioner and was pretty</li>
            <li>So soft and full with no frizzes.</li>
            <li>First I shampoo&#x27;d and rinsed, then massaged in the Intensive treatment and let it site for about a minute before rinsing, then used the conditioner and rinsed, Not only does my hair feel super soft and in control now, but my hair color even seems to me more vibrant today.</li>
            <li>I really liked this these products were nourishing for my hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really enjoyed the treatment and will definitely consider purchasing-a great price for a much more expensive result.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no dramatic difference to my hair after using this, but again I do like the scent.</li>
            <li>I was a little less impressed with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>if you have drier hair I think you&#x27;d be just fine in using it on a daily basis!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a great texture, very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel soft (though know that my hair tends to be soft since it is fine and straight).</li>
            <li>me, this product works great to make my hair soft and manageable, but at the expense of leaving it dull.</li>
            <li>My hair is very prone to tangles</li>
            <li>I really like the floral, citrus scent of this leave in treatment because it isn’t overpowering.</li>
            <li>However, it still worked really well.</li>
            <li>I let it sit for a time and really soak in before rinsing it.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>While I won&#x27;t steer anyone away from this conditioner, I can&#x27;t really recommend it either.</li>
            <li>This product was sent to me for free, I would actually purchase it though, I used this instead of the conditioner that came with the shampoo</li>
            <li>I’m a real fan of this one.  </li>
            <li>I like it just as much as the pricier brands of conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I am VERY picky about what I use in my hair and on my body.</li>
            <li>lemony smell, left my hair absolutely smooth and transformed.</li>
            <li>that I put my hair through so much.</li>
            <li>I really need it.</li>
            <li>SAVED ME so much time.</li>
            <li>I noticed it wasn&#x27;t rubbing in very well.  </li>
            <li>yeah, i really like this product.</li>
            <li>The instructions indicate to wash and condition after using the product; however, I found that I only needed to wash my hair after using the product as my hair was silky smooth and was not in need of conditioner after using the detoxifying treatment.</li>
            <li>Is it a reasonable price?</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>personally really like the herb/citrus smell that this product has.  </li>
            <li>It works very well at combating frizziness.</li>
            <li>What makes this product stand out is how much healthier my hair looks when I use</li>
            <li>fighters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the scent.</li>
            <li>whole &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I have tried many different intenive treatments or leave in conditioners from a cheap price to very expensive products; for how affordable this product is, it works amazing!</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of the wild naturals line in the future.</li>
            <li>This was much more moisturizing than the regular conditioner in this line, but still didn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
            <li>My hair was untangled and so soft afterwards and it helped with my frizzyness which is a must with wavy/curly hair !!!</li>
            <li>I have very fine oily hair and this treatment when combined with the shampoo didn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use both the conditioner and the intensive conditioner together tho as it makes my hair kind of stiff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this is the best option for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I normally use a detangling product or leave in conditioner to comb my hair, but I did not need one after using this!</li>
            <li>but I do really love my other brand, too.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it still keeps my hair weightless unlike other intensive treatments.</li>
            <li>The ginger in the product definitely makes a difference and gives you a really clean feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>My mom, 58yo, long, color treated, fine hair.</li>
            <li>but my hair became very oily by the end of the day, which does not happen with my normal regimen.</li>
            <li>Love what that it didn&#x27;t weight my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I received this new product on behalf of influenster to review!</li>
            <li>It may be better for someone who needs less moisture.</li>
            <li>My hair was no longer dry and frazzled, but smooth shiny and sleek.</li>
            <li>I recently received a sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment for free</li>
            <li>I was able to go until my next shampoo without having to add anything extra to my hair and the frizz did not return.</li>
            <li>Actually, my girls have gotten compliments on how soft and smooth their hair feels.</li>
            <li>This product has left my hair incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got this because I will definitely be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li>This product left my hair feeling light and soft.</li>
            <li>A lot of hair masks, or deep conditioners make my hair super oily.  </li>
            <li>I really thought it would, but it actually looked better than it has in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for keeping frizz at bay.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair really soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this intensive treatment since I have dry and unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences Wild Naturals has much to like about it</li>
            <li>really well leaving your hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I love using this a few times a week to revamp my hair health.</li>
            <li>I have tried it a few more times</li>
            <li>I used the product for a week, replacing the products I would have normally used.</li>
            <li>I recently received this product complimentary to test and review.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and tends to get flyaways, and this did smooth things down pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and my hair feels healthier and looks shiny not dull.</li>
            <li>and this brings it right back to life!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use the treatment and would highly recommend it to anyone with natural or synthetic hair!</li>
            <li>The texture is thick but rinses cleanly and leaves my hair so soft, smooth, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft, shiny, and tangle free once dry!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight, fluffy hair that gets weighed down and greasy easily, I have been using this product daily for over a week now</li>
            <li>;  I live in Northern New York.  </li>
            <li>I am an older woman with sensitive skin and this product did not cause any irritation, whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I relieved this product complimentary but will be purchasing it for myself in the near future!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for use in combination with the Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo.</li>
            <li>(the old stand by mousse from my high school days...or gel...</li>
            <li>I only put it on my hair from my ears down because it is very fine and tends to look oily faster if I put it on my roots.</li>
            <li>I never buy deep conditioning treatments because I feel like they weigh my very fine hair down.</li>
            <li>As far as conditioning goes, it&#x27;s not bad, but it did leave my fine, frizz-prone hair feeling rather flat and heavy.</li>
            <li>so it was exciting to try something out that keeps my long locks from looking like a rat&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li>First of all, I can&#x27;t get enough of the scent.</li>
            <li>SO INCREDIBLY SOFT!</li>
            <li>Well, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot from this product, but I was interested enough to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Silky shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>oh so soft!  </li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and does not leave your hair weighted down.</li>
            <li>I have tried several products from Herbal Essences in the past and this is by far my favorite product to date!  </li>
            <li>My ends are so soft and lively.</li>
            <li>If you have dry hair, Clairol Herbal Essences also has the Hydralicious conditioner, which I use regularly and works just fine.</li>
            <li>BUT only if I used the right amount of conditioner which is what caused me a major dilemma.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the three products every couple days for a week, and my hair is as soft as my young daughter&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li>It feels soft, but not too soft!</li>
            <li>If your hair is fine, it feels a bit too heavy.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, not stiff...</li>
            <li>Very fresh, slightly floral but not as intensely floral as the old Herbal Essences used to be (think back to the era when they had the commercials with the ladies washing their hair and making...</li>
            <li>It tamed all my frizz and left my hair very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>* thickness ~ retains the natural body in your hair</li>
            <li>I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with</li>
            <li>at the end while I&#x27;m busy shaving to give it time to sink in to my hair.</li>
            <li>I would not view this as a daily conditioner, but rather once a week to really cleanse and revive my hair.</li>
            <li>I am the mom of a four month old.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have professionally color-treated hair (about every six weeks)</li>
            <li>She thought it would be oily or greasy but it was just soft and felt nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wife even commented on how soft my hair felt</li>
            <li>I found that it made my hair soft</li>
            <li>This Herbal Essences Wild Naturals product does not do that</li>
            <li>and I was surprised by the amount of shine and manageability of my hair after one treatment.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair look and feel soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I also used the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait time with this product.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily hair</li>
            <li>It left my hair very silky.  </li>
            <li>It helped strengthen my hair and allowed a curl to last the whole day.</li>
            <li>The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment is a post conditioner that you use after you wash and condition your hair.</li>
            <li>It helps make my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>think it is too much for daily use unless you have severely damaged hair (which I do not.)  </li>
            <li>After using the wild naturals shampoo and conditioner, I applied this intensive.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soo soft &amp; les tangled</li>
            <li>I have used Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Treatment, which is a product I received free to test and review, for a few weeks with the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>It made my hair super soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>If I used too much my hair was soft as silk but way too flat and almost oily.  </li>
            <li>cousin, 28 with long natural thick hair used it after conditioning and said she really liked how it made her hair feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly heavy and rinses out clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt clean, but was limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li>i like it as a small dot after the shower in my damp hair to keep it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a conditioning treatment once or twice a week, and this is my current favorite.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair</li>
            <li>Because of this, I would only use it once a week, maybe twice at most, while using my regular shampoo and conditioner everyday.</li>
            <li>I have very thick but very fine natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I let sit on m hair for ten minutes and after washing out and blow dry I cloud feel the difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>My hair has been on the dry, frizzy side lately, and I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth and silky my hair feels today after just one use!</li>
            <li>Even after a night of tossing and turning in bed, my hair stayed more or less frizz-free and soft as it was when I stepped out of the shower and towel dried it.</li>
            <li>It smells lemony, but kind of sweet too – not a strong fake lemon smell.</li>
            <li>My husband actually thought I&#x27;d recently gone to the salon (and the fact that he noticed my hair, well, that&#x27;s new)!  </li>
            <li>This makes it tough to style which is why I use products with more hold.</li>
            <li>You will still experience a little fly-away, though the static tends to go down despite sliding on sweaters or wearing wool.</li>
            <li>This gave new life to my thin &amp; fine hair.  </li>
            <li>what left my hair feeling so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It does help with the frizz left from over-dry indoor winter weather, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair completely frizzless.</li>
            <li>I have an almost two year old whose current mantra is that &amp;#34;sleep is for the weak.&amp;#34; When I opened my Influenster Vox Box which contained this product, shampoo, and conditioner</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrances and this is one that is causing me some discomfort such as a scratchy voice.</li>
            <li>It has left my hair feeling remarkably soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as giving that deep conditioning</li>
            <li>It feels slightly oily in that dry oil way but rinses away cleanly leaving no trace of residue to weight my hair</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this hair mask from VOXBOX and at first i was skeptical because i thought the conditioner was enough but the mask worked wonders for me !!</li>
            <li>I was ready to throw out my hair piece due to the ends</li>
            <li>but since I am not a fan of the Wild Naturals Detoxifying conditioner I have been using this as a regular conditioner from the middle of my hair to the tips after using the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of washing and conditioning my hair upside down the first and last time I will ever use this product.  </li>
            <li>IF I used too little, then I continued with having frizzy hair which prompted me to review this item in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cut my hair pretty short half way through the bottle</li>
            <li>My hair is over-stylized, with heavy usage of the blow dryer and hot curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tired many more expensive products from Sephora,Ulta, etc....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different types of &amp;#34;intensive conditioners&amp;#34; before and, with the exceptions of those put on my hair in a salon, those types of products usually just weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take much to weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I think I may try using as an overnight conditioning treatment as it seems to weight my hair down a bit if I use too much in the morning.</li>
            <li>My hair is rather fine and starting to grey and can often look dull and flyaway.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like this half of the conditioning process was really</li>
            <li>I waited a week and a half to review so that I could really have time with the product.</li>
            <li>I either let my hair dry naturally OR use a hair-dryer with a diffuser (specifically made for curls)...</li>
            <li>This product is hands down amazing for thin, frizzy hair like mine.</li>

            <li> For the price I feel like it&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li> The smell of the Lemon basil is really pleasant and leaves a nice scent afterwards (not the kind of treatment that just smells while it&#x27;s on your hair!).  </li>

            <li> Very satisfied</li>

            <li> I received the product for free from Influenster to test, and am really happy that I got the opportunity to try it out.  </li>
            <li> Plus - the scent is AMAZING and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had an amazing experience with this treatment</li>
            <li> I used this on it a couple of times and now it looks amazing.</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>

            <li> really liked this as a leave in conditioner.</li>

            <li> Having said that, I really liked the way this has made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I am loving this Herbal Essences line.  </li>
            <li> While I was sent this product, this review is my own thoughts and opinion.  </li>
            <li> Conditions nicely when paired with the detoxifying shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li> Not so for me - I really liked the way my hair looked and felt after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It had a nice smell as well.</li>
            <li> I received the product as a free sample through Influenster and love it!!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free from my Herbal Essence Voxbox from Influenster which was a great opportunity</li>
            <li> Not to mention it smells great and leaves hair very shiny also!!</li>
            <li> All my hair was soft, manageable and perfect.</li>
            <li> i loved it so much !!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> and I simply love, love, love!  </li>
            <li> It feels like it helps strengthen your hair too, though it is not an ideal conditioner for detangling, which is what I appreciate most from a conditioner with my fine hair that would love to live in knots of its own making!</li>
            <li> What I loved most was the light fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I am going to save so much money, and my hair smells beautiful, too.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner yielded great results the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell and think it is too strong, but I do love the effect this product has on my hair!  </li>
            <li> I was given this product to test and review from Influenster.com, and I am so happy to report my experience as a positive one.  </li>
            <li> The smell is like you are using straight lemons and oranges very refreshing!</li>
            <li> , I love how this made my hair feel even as I applied it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the citrusy scent of this intensive treatment product.</li>
            <li> And so smooth!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and love the feeling of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It has a lovely fragrance dominated by lemon with elements of ginger and basil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does something, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> and I just love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> The intensive treatment made my hair look great and really allowed it to detoxify from city life.</li>
            <li> I also love the lemony scent and do not feel that it smells at all like &amp;#34;cleaning products&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great scent, but more importantly, this leaves hair fresh and buoyant.  </li>
            <li> Love the overpowering smell which helps cover up baby spit smell.</li>
            <li> But I am in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent that they come with, but this intensive treatment that it comes with works WAY better the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li> - this makes my hair look effortlessly fantastic without all the work!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> interesting noises...)</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this in the mail, I have never used anything on my hair like this!</li>
            <li> but i like it better the way i use it.</li>
            <li> pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> i get so many compliments on how healthy it looks.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is my favorite product in this line.</li>
            <li> ; thing comes off as a gimmick; this is just a conditioner, and it&#x27;s not going to magically remove whatever toxins</li>
            <li> the price point, it&#x27;s not a terrible option.</li>
            <li> And I love it.  </li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this out for free!</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with the results from this product!</li>
            <li> I love this...</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> and I also had to make sure it was used sparingly</li>
            <li> I was worried that I would experience oily hair afterwards, but it rinsed out clear and beautifully.</li>
            <li> I love it and strongly reccomend it</li>
            <li> And was so clean!</li>
            <li> Squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li> It also helps control the static in fine hair.</li>
            <li> And it also washed out clean and easily!</li>
            <li> much so I can&#x27;t compare this to others of its kind, but my hair liked it fine.</li>
            <li> On the bright side, my legs felt really well moisturized?  </li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive hair conditioner is a great concept.  </li>
            <li> I smooth it from top to bottom, massaging it into my ends and let it sit for a minute or so.</li>
            <li> and I liked the way the two worked together, screw the conditioner that wasn&#x27;t worth it at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how it detoxifies, but it did leave my hair silky smooth and easy to brush after I used it.</li>
            <li> The scent of this Herbal Essence is fabulous, Lemony, fresh, gingery, I love the way this smells!</li>
            <li> This is the most incredible smelling product I have used and will definitely be going to purchase full size bottles of this product line.</li>
            <li> My hair which I was every other day, and by end of day 2 is rather oily on the scalp, is still rather perfect.</li>
            <li> I also color treat my hair, so it tends to break easily.</li>
            <li> I tend to change my hair products every couple of weeks to avoid my fine hair becoming overly greasy.  </li>
            <li> I like the easy to use tub</li>
            <li> It actually didn&#x27;t so I am happy to say that I love this product.</li>
            <li> An easy on the wallet buy.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did was check out the smell, which is amazing.</li>
            <li> I noticed that if you wait 3-5 minutes before rinsing out with COOL water, it tends to work better.</li>
            <li> Instead, I was left with a nice shine and a pleasant, clean scent of citrus.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is nice and thick and it smells very nice (not as strong as the shampoo, which smells beyond amazing)</li>
            <li> I have fine dyed hair</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I have fine, oily hair that gets flaky looking when I don&#x27;t get all my hair products (hair spray) out in the shower.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine</li>
            <li> (I have fine hair)</li>
            <li> * scent ~ pleasant natural lemon and spice mixture</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair, which usually look scraggly for lack of a better work, look smooth and wonderful.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, Herbal Essences scent and it has a nice feel as you smooth it into wet hair in the shower or bath.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very pleased!</li>
            <li> The only thing that I would have liked better would be the scent as it is very strong but not actually bad being lemon and basil.</li>
            <li> received this product free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> so frizz free</li>
            <li> I received this product free as part of the Influenster program.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a voxbox for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for free.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product along with the shampoo and conditioner for a few days and am thoroughly impressed!</li>

            <li> I use this with the shampoo and conditioner I got free to test and review.  </li>
            <li> and as I stated prior, the smell is great.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample to review.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d this free from influenster in my VoxBox to try</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this once my free product is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received free sample of the intensive treatment as well as the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got this product free to test and review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just finding that right amount to use on my hair that has had me stumped more than one morning while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend using the entire line of this particular product, the shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment, as I tried each one without the others and they seem to work best all together.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product I received free in a VoxBox since I had never even seen it before.</li>
            <li> I was impressed that it didn&#x27;t weight down my fine hair when using this on top of a normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly strong so probably not for everyone, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> None the less I really enjoyed using this and thought it was great to use 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I believe it will work on every type of hair and totally recommend for anyone to try this amazing product give this treatment a chance with the shampoo and conditioner for maximum results!</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;m excited to use this on the days</li>
            <li> I was excited.  </li>
            <li> The verdict: I have super fine hair</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> I could tell a significant difference in how my hair felt.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thick, curly hair and my hair looked great!</li>
            <li> I am inclined to seek out the other formulas in the wild naturals and see if I can tolerate them better because I am impressed with how my hair looks and feels after using just this one product.</li>
            <li> On my way out the door to work, I decided to use my new &amp;#34;lotion.&amp;#34; A nice layer all over my legs.  </li>
            <li> It rinsed cleanly away.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair super smooth and</li>
            <li> I used it with the Wild Naturals shampoo and conditioner and it left my hair feeling great!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> It left my hair very healthy and strong.</li>
            <li> Although I really enjoyed the scent, it didn&#x27;t stick around as long as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, and leaves my hair unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li> The conditioner and intense repair was fantastic!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster for the free product!</li>
            <li> It smells like lemon verbena, and it&#x27;s really quite lovely, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly hair, so a good conditioner is important to me.</li>
            <li> Like my first impression of the conditioner, I thought it might not work since it seemed to wash off so easily.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would buy it and recommend it to someone who was looking for a good smelling deep conditioner that isn&#x27;t too pricey.</li>
            <li> I love the way it made my hair feel soft and light.</li>
            <li> A quick shower to rinse my legs off</li>
            <li> I get from super moisturizing products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from this brand to be honest</li>
            <li> you are too quick</li>
            <li> For $5.99 with free prime shipping it compares quite well to a much higher priced brand that I use.</li>
            <li> More so than normal.</li>
            <li> Salon quality in my opinion, imagine your hair is full of knots and tangles, using this product after shampooing and conditioning and you will be able to run a comb through it with complete ease!</li>
            <li> But the smell is stronger than I like, and I&#x27;m not sure that the conditioner does any more good for my hair than harm.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner smells great and leaves my hair super soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I usually do not use Herbal Essences&#x27; products, but I&#x27;m glad I did this time.  </li>
            <li> It may work better on someone who has more dry or course hair.</li>
            <li> I loved the clean, citrusy smell of the products and felt it left my hair clean and soft and gave it lightweight feeling.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it helped control the frizz of the little fly aways at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the main component in why my hair is softer than ever from root to tip.</li>
            <li> I received complimentary samples of this product to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, I try not to purchase products that contain parabens, so I was very excited to see that Herbal Essences Wild Naturals are paraben-free!  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get over how amazing if left my hair feeling!</li>
            <li> This product line did an amazing job at cleaning my hair with only one wash and rinse.</li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling amazing with plenty of volume.  </li>
            <li> and I leave it in for a few minutes and my hair feels great afterwards.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of lemons in my beauty products, so this was a huge winner in fragrance for me.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment.  </li>

            <li> &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My teens have loved it so much I keep having to steal it back from their bathroom (stinkers!).</li>
            <li> received this complimentary as a set in order to rate and review.</li>
            <li> which was pretty sweet.</li>

            <li> recieved these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I recieved this complimentary from The Influenster team in my Vox box.  </li>
            <li> So fresh and invigorating.</li>
            <li> received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells good and worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the try for frizz taming.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li> I noticed far fewer knots in my hair and was able to run my fingers through it right after a shower (never happens).</li>
            <li> I am able to go with out using my flat iron which is a huge plus for me.  </li>
            <li> I have a full head of hair but my hair has always been fine and soft.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine curly hair and it gets greasy easily if I don&#x27;t use good products.</li>
            <li> This right here is the stuff dreams are made of.  </li>
            <li> The intensive treatment made my hair very soft and was easy to comb through after washing it.</li>
            <li> I had to be very certain to thoroughly rinse it though</li>
            <li> Out of all of the three Wild Naturals products, this one is BY FAR my favorite!</li>
            <li> It is nice that you don&#x27;t have to leave it on very long</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily hair, and this has really helped keep my hair feeling light and clean, even overnight (which never happens for me).  </li>
            <li> After towel drying my hair, however, the comb glided through my fine, thin, color-treated hair easily and honestly felt \\&quot;squeaky clean.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> After my hair dried, it had a nice shine and felt very soft, in better condition than before.  </li>
            <li> It was a little oily for me and not needed at all, the shampoo/conditioner combo is perfect not need to waste time with this one, however I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li> it leaves hair soft, manageable, moisturized, clean, and fresh.</li>
            <li> The product appeared an appropriate consistency to actually add some moisture and nourishment to my hair.</li>
            <li> I Received a free sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment from Influenster to try and review.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> but I thought of it more as a deep conditioner than a detoxifying treatment.</li>
            <li> and though I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a daily conditioner, I enjoy using it about once a week!</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference in my hair after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> but I was able to actually brush my hair and not have tangles.</li>
            <li> It has more of a floral/citrus smell that has actually helped me wake up in the mornings ^_^</li>
            <li> I received the set for the Wild Naturals Detoxifying treatment for free along with the matching shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help more than just regular</li>
            <li> Used it without conditioning first</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and condition first though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love this and the shampoo and conditioner in a different scent.</li>
            <li> I find that this instantly takes out the tangles in my hair in the shower better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, I don’t get the same results if I use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li> and I feel this performed just as well as the higher end products.  </li>
            <li> I will use it occasionally, probably once or twice a month to keep my hair healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Thanks influenster!</li>
            <li> *).</li>
            <li> - not completely frizz free but significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this line to try (shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner), and this is by far my favorite product of the three!</li>
            <li> Left hair soft and smells amazing</li>
            <li> I tested Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment for free thanks to Herbal Essence and Influenster.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who wants to use a more intensive conditioner once a week in additional to regular wash and conditioner treatments.</li>
            <li> The complimentary sample I got via Influenster will definitely have me coming back for more!</li>
            <li> This treatment creme has a very citrusy aroma which I like very  much.  </li>
            <li> From the first use I noticed a serious difference, and the more I use it, the better it gets.</li>
            <li> (in fact, the directions don&#x27;t specify a length of time; they just say &amp;#34;massage in and rinse out&amp;#34;), so it easy to use regularly in place of a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> The first thing that I have to say is that for me, the scent is too much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally purchase herbal essences, but received a free sample of this product along with the wild naturals shampoo and conditioner and was pretty</li>
            <li> So soft and full with no frizzes.</li>
            <li> First I shampoo&#x27;d and rinsed, then massaged in the Intensive treatment and let it site for about a minute before rinsing, then used the conditioner and rinsed, Not only does my hair feel super soft and in control now, but my hair color even seems to me more vibrant today.</li>
            <li> I really liked this these products were nourishing for my hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really enjoyed the treatment and will definitely consider purchasing-a great price for a much more expensive result.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no dramatic difference to my hair after using this, but again I do like the scent.</li>
            <li> I was a little less impressed with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> if you have drier hair I think you&#x27;d be just fine in using it on a daily basis!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a great texture, very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel soft (though know that my hair tends to be soft since it is fine and straight).</li>
            <li> me, this product works great to make my hair soft and manageable, but at the expense of leaving it dull.</li>
            <li> My hair is very prone to tangles</li>
            <li> I really like the floral, citrus scent of this leave in treatment because it isn’t overpowering.</li>
            <li> However, it still worked really well.</li>
            <li> I let it sit for a time and really soak in before rinsing it.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> While I won&#x27;t steer anyone away from this conditioner, I can&#x27;t really recommend it either.</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me for free, I would actually purchase it though, I used this instead of the conditioner that came with the shampoo</li>
            <li> I’m a real fan of this one.  </li>
            <li> I like it just as much as the pricier brands of conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY picky about what I use in my hair and on my body.</li>
            <li> lemony smell, left my hair absolutely smooth and transformed.</li>
            <li> that I put my hair through so much.</li>
            <li> I really need it.</li>
            <li> SAVED ME so much time.</li>
            <li> I noticed it wasn&#x27;t rubbing in very well.  </li>
            <li> yeah, i really like this product.</li>
            <li> The instructions indicate to wash and condition after using the product; however, I found that I only needed to wash my hair after using the product as my hair was silky smooth and was not in need of conditioner after using the detoxifying treatment.</li>
            <li> Is it a reasonable price?</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> personally really like the herb/citrus smell that this product has.  </li>
            <li> It works very well at combating frizziness.</li>
            <li> What makes this product stand out is how much healthier my hair looks when I use</li>
            <li> fighters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the scent.</li>
            <li> whole &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have tried many different intenive treatments or leave in conditioners from a cheap price to very expensive products; for how affordable this product is, it works amazing!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of the wild naturals line in the future.</li>
            <li> This was much more moisturizing than the regular conditioner in this line, but still didn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
            <li> My hair was untangled and so soft afterwards and it helped with my frizzyness which is a must with wavy/curly hair !!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine oily hair and this treatment when combined with the shampoo didn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use both the conditioner and the intensive conditioner together tho as it makes my hair kind of stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the best option for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I normally use a detangling product or leave in conditioner to comb my hair, but I did not need one after using this!</li>
            <li> but I do really love my other brand, too.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it still keeps my hair weightless unlike other intensive treatments.</li>
            <li> The ginger in the product definitely makes a difference and gives you a really clean feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> My mom, 58yo, long, color treated, fine hair.</li>
            <li> but my hair became very oily by the end of the day, which does not happen with my normal regimen.</li>
            <li> Love what that it didn&#x27;t weight my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I received this new product on behalf of influenster to review!</li>
            <li> It may be better for someone who needs less moisture.</li>
            <li> My hair was no longer dry and frazzled, but smooth shiny and sleek.</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment for free</li>
            <li> I was able to go until my next shampoo without having to add anything extra to my hair and the frizz did not return.</li>
            <li> Actually, my girls have gotten compliments on how soft and smooth their hair feels.</li>
            <li> This product has left my hair incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got this because I will definitely be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling light and soft.</li>
            <li> A lot of hair masks, or deep conditioners make my hair super oily.  </li>
            <li> I really thought it would, but it actually looked better than it has in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for keeping frizz at bay.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair really soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this intensive treatment since I have dry and unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals has much to like about it</li>
            <li> really well leaving your hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I love using this a few times a week to revamp my hair health.</li>
            <li> I have tried it a few more times</li>
            <li> I used the product for a week, replacing the products I would have normally used.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product complimentary to test and review.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and tends to get flyaways, and this did smooth things down pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and my hair feels healthier and looks shiny not dull.</li>
            <li> and this brings it right back to life!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the treatment and would highly recommend it to anyone with natural or synthetic hair!</li>
            <li> The texture is thick but rinses cleanly and leaves my hair so soft, smooth, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> My hair was soft, shiny, and tangle free once dry!  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight, fluffy hair that gets weighed down and greasy easily, I have been using this product daily for over a week now</li>
            <li> ;  I live in Northern New York.  </li>
            <li> I am an older woman with sensitive skin and this product did not cause any irritation, whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I relieved this product complimentary but will be purchasing it for myself in the near future!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for use in combination with the Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo.</li>
            <li> (the old stand by mousse from my high school days...or gel...</li>
            <li> I only put it on my hair from my ears down because it is very fine and tends to look oily faster if I put it on my roots.</li>
            <li> I never buy deep conditioning treatments because I feel like they weigh my very fine hair down.</li>
            <li> As far as conditioning goes, it&#x27;s not bad, but it did leave my fine, frizz-prone hair feeling rather flat and heavy.</li>
            <li> so it was exciting to try something out that keeps my long locks from looking like a rat&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li> First of all, I can&#x27;t get enough of the scent.</li>
            <li> SO INCREDIBLY SOFT!</li>
            <li> Well, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot from this product, but I was interested enough to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Silky shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> oh so soft!  </li>
            <li> It applies smoothly and does not leave your hair weighted down.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products from Herbal Essences in the past and this is by far my favorite product to date!  </li>
            <li> My ends are so soft and lively.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, Clairol Herbal Essences also has the Hydralicious conditioner, which I use regularly and works just fine.</li>
            <li> BUT only if I used the right amount of conditioner which is what caused me a major dilemma.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the three products every couple days for a week, and my hair is as soft as my young daughter&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li> It feels soft, but not too soft!</li>
            <li> If your hair is fine, it feels a bit too heavy.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, not stiff...</li>
            <li> Very fresh, slightly floral but not as intensely floral as the old Herbal Essences used to be (think back to the era when they had the commercials with the ladies washing their hair and making...</li>
            <li> It tamed all my frizz and left my hair very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> * thickness ~ retains the natural body in your hair</li>
            <li> I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with</li>
            <li> at the end while I&#x27;m busy shaving to give it time to sink in to my hair.</li>
            <li> I would not view this as a daily conditioner, but rather once a week to really cleanse and revive my hair.</li>
            <li> I am the mom of a four month old.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have professionally color-treated hair (about every six weeks)</li>
            <li> She thought it would be oily or greasy but it was just soft and felt nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wife even commented on how soft my hair felt</li>
            <li> I found that it made my hair soft</li>
            <li> This Herbal Essences Wild Naturals product does not do that</li>
            <li> and I was surprised by the amount of shine and manageability of my hair after one treatment.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair look and feel soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I also used the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait time with this product.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily hair</li>
            <li> It left my hair very silky.  </li>
            <li> It helped strengthen my hair and allowed a curl to last the whole day.</li>
            <li> The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment is a post conditioner that you use after you wash and condition your hair.</li>
            <li> It helps make my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> think it is too much for daily use unless you have severely damaged hair (which I do not.)  </li>
            <li> After using the wild naturals shampoo and conditioner, I applied this intensive.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soo soft &amp; les tangled</li>
            <li> I have used Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Treatment, which is a product I received free to test and review, for a few weeks with the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> It made my hair super soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> If I used too much my hair was soft as silk but way too flat and almost oily.  </li>
            <li> cousin, 28 with long natural thick hair used it after conditioning and said she really liked how it made her hair feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly heavy and rinses out clean.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt clean, but was limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> i like it as a small dot after the shower in my damp hair to keep it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a conditioning treatment once or twice a week, and this is my current favorite.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair</li>
            <li> Because of this, I would only use it once a week, maybe twice at most, while using my regular shampoo and conditioner everyday.</li>
            <li> I have very thick but very fine natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I let sit on m hair for ten minutes and after washing out and blow dry I cloud feel the difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> My hair has been on the dry, frizzy side lately, and I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth and silky my hair feels today after just one use!</li>
            <li> Even after a night of tossing and turning in bed, my hair stayed more or less frizz-free and soft as it was when I stepped out of the shower and towel dried it.</li>
            <li> It smells lemony, but kind of sweet too – not a strong fake lemon smell.</li>
            <li> My husband actually thought I&#x27;d recently gone to the salon (and the fact that he noticed my hair, well, that&#x27;s new)!  </li>
            <li> This makes it tough to style which is why I use products with more hold.</li>
            <li> You will still experience a little fly-away, though the static tends to go down despite sliding on sweaters or wearing wool.</li>
            <li> This gave new life to my thin &amp; fine hair.  </li>
            <li> what left my hair feeling so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It does help with the frizz left from over-dry indoor winter weather, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair completely frizzless.</li>
            <li> I have an almost two year old whose current mantra is that &amp;#34;sleep is for the weak.&amp;#34; When I opened my Influenster Vox Box which contained this product, shampoo, and conditioner</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to fragrances and this is one that is causing me some discomfort such as a scratchy voice.</li>
            <li> It has left my hair feeling remarkably soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as giving that deep conditioning</li>
            <li> It feels slightly oily in that dry oil way but rinses away cleanly leaving no trace of residue to weight my hair</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this hair mask from VOXBOX and at first i was skeptical because i thought the conditioner was enough but the mask worked wonders for me !!</li>
            <li> I was ready to throw out my hair piece due to the ends</li>
            <li> but since I am not a fan of the Wild Naturals Detoxifying conditioner I have been using this as a regular conditioner from the middle of my hair to the tips after using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of washing and conditioning my hair upside down the first and last time I will ever use this product.  </li>
            <li> IF I used too little, then I continued with having frizzy hair which prompted me to review this item in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cut my hair pretty short half way through the bottle</li>
            <li> My hair is over-stylized, with heavy usage of the blow dryer and hot curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired many more expensive products from Sephora,Ulta, etc....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different types of &amp;#34;intensive conditioners&amp;#34; before and, with the exceptions of those put on my hair in a salon, those types of products usually just weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take much to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I think I may try using as an overnight conditioning treatment as it seems to weight my hair down a bit if I use too much in the morning.</li>
            <li> My hair is rather fine and starting to grey and can often look dull and flyaway.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like this half of the conditioning process was really</li>
            <li> I waited a week and a half to review so that I could really have time with the product.</li>
            <li> I either let my hair dry naturally OR use a hair-dryer with a diffuser (specifically made for curls)...</li>
            <li> This product is hands down amazing for thin, frizzy hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I also have a lot of trouble with conditioners weighing down my hair and causing it to be super oily.</li>
            <li> My recent hair dye job dried out my hair and after two applications of this hair conditioner, it was back to its normal condition.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling very thick and full of body.</li>
            <li> When I washed my hair tonight I finished everything with the intensive treatment with the intention of flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually spend a fortune on deep conditioning treatments for my hair and this product really surprised me on how well it compaired to the big dollar products.</li>
            <li> I noticed when my hair was dry that it was not as frizzy as it usually is, it was very soft in fact!!</li>
            <li> I just blew my hair dry slightly and then let it dry naturally and brushed it.  </li>
            <li> so it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going natural for awhile or straightening it because I won&#x27;t use any products that make it stiff or greasy</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a pretty small tube, although a little spreads out a lot</li>
            <li> My hair has been extra frizzy due to the dry air this winter and after just one use</li>
            <li> decided to try it out because some of the hair products I use for styling leave my hair feeling dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Without it my hair feels dry and brittle if I&#x27;ve used product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you are having issues with dry or brittle hair</li>
            <li> My hair remains frizzy and dry feeling after applying this and drying it.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly long and wavy hair that becomes very dry in winter months.  </li>
            <li> Dimethicone bonds to the shaft of the hair and doesn&#x27;t rinse off; it will eventually be worn off over time with rubbing and abrasion but it&#x27;s pretty tough.  </li>
            <li> This one is definitely required for using after the regular conditioner since the conditioner that comes with it is not strong.</li>
            <li> I have thin, stick-straight hair that gets pretty oily if I don&#x27;t wash it every day.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s thin and fine, usually wavy and combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but on dry days here in the desert, some moisturizer is needed, and this keeps my hair from going crazy.  </li>
            <li> This has actually given my hair the moisture it typically lacks during the winter.</li>
            <li> personally prefer the scent of these products vs a typical herbal essence scent (hope that makes sense).  </li>
            <li> This definitely cured my bad hair day blues but when used on a normal day not so much as my hair can tend to be on the oily side, so even when using this product just on the ends of my hair</li>
            <li> If I have any product or build up lingering on my hair, it weighs it down and becomes flat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a minimalist when it comes to hair and wNt to do as little as possible</li>
            <li> When I received this in the mail for free to review, I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> Half way through the day my hair had gone flat and was in my face.</li>
            <li> Not much is needed to rub into the scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has a fake generic fruit/mango scent that is ok but not great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of the smell, but that&#x27;s just my personal preference.</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight weak hair and this product really helped to strengthen my hair after a few treatments.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and that’s always a plus.</li>
            <li> also let 2 other people use it to see what their reactions would be.</li>
            <li> Seems to control flyaway hair without the weight of oils or other leave in&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s based on a dimethicone formula, which is the reason that you don&#x27;t need to leave it in like other conditioning products.  </li>
            <li> It was sharp and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> left my hair feeking heavy and a little on the greasy side.</li>
            <li> I was very careful to rinse my hair thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I have combination oily and dry hair (depending on the weather - cold &#x3D; dry and frizzy, hot &#x3D; an oily mess).</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is such a small tube, that you&#x27;ll need to really stretch it to get a lot out of it.  </li>
            <li> It has never weighed down my hair or left behind residue at the same time</li>
            <li> so products like this usually weigh my hair down and make it very flat.  </li>
            <li> It’s meant to be used as a secondary conditioner, but even used as the only conditioner, this works just as described.  </li>
            <li> The only negative was that I did not notice anything in the directions instructing me when to use this product..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to find products that really work well in my hair to tamper the frizz.</li>
            <li> This smoothes the frizzies but doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down like a lot of intensive treatments do.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel like it weighed my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it for thick, frizzy hair that could use a little extra weight to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> My hair seems less frizzy as well</li>
            <li> and It was softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> This winter has been very dry and although I don&#x27;t usually have problems with frizzy hair, this year I do.</li>
            <li> otherwise it was too heavy and would leave my hair dull, flat, and oily.</li>
            <li> I noticed that while wet, my hair was extremely slick.</li>
            <li> so I thought this intensive treatment might be too heavy and weigh it down.</li>
            <li> so maybe someone with extremely dry thick hair would like it.&lt;br /&gt;*i</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I was a little hesitant because I despise the smell of lemon</li>
            <li> It just felt a little gunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have thin, long wavy hair and due to the thinness of my hair, I wear a synthetic hair piece as well.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling either heavy or greasy/</li>
            <li> It made it a lot easier to comb my hair and style it after I washed and dried my hair.</li>
            <li> It did not sit heavy on my hair and feel sticky.  </li>
            <li> It feels fluffy instead of wiry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t carry one of those heavy &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; smells.</li>
            <li> and she complained that it made her hair harder to comb.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to massage in and rinse, but I leave it in for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the conditioner as directed but waited a few minutes before rinsing it out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the intensive moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is for sure a must try and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I used this intensive treatment on a really bad hair day and it cured it fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really shocked by the way my hair has responded to this whole line of products.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure that I like what it does.</li>
            <li> I usually tend to leave in the treatment for about 10 to 15 min.</li>
            <li> I used a small amount on the ends of my hair to avoid getting a greasy look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a snob about hair products - if it&#x27;s not sold in the salon, it&#x27;s not for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past week as leave in conditioner (about a nickel size...</li>
            <li> I pick a day of the week (usually Saturday) to do my once a week routines and added this to my list of things to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike some intensive conditioners, this one isn&#x27;t impossible to completely rinse from hair, and hair doesn&#x27;t have a greasy after-feel either.</li>
            <li> My hair was really looking horrible and dry.</li>
            <li> My hair has not been cut or trimmed in at least six months.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately those products are a lot harder on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The lack if direction on when in the process to use this product made it a bit confusing, but I&#x27;ve been using it post-</li>
            <li> I mean, it still conditions and fights frizz, but</li>
            <li> I would have given this product five stars but the second ingredient in it, after water, is stearyl alcohol, which hair stylists have always told me is bad for hair.</li>
            <li> I usually hate this drugstore stuff,, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Due to the wind and blast of cold weather</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that tends to be drier.</li>
            <li> and I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but it helps to control the blowing strands.  </li>
            <li> so I was a bit skeptical of a drug store brand product.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend it over any of the expensive brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say that it is cold</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this product has a runny consistency.</li>
            <li> but oh my gosh I was wrong!!!  </li>
            <li> The chemical smell was terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really enjoyed using Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment.  The smell of the Lemon basil is really pleasant and leaves a nice scent afterwards (not the kind of treatment that just smells while it&#x27;s on your hair!).  I received the product for free from Influenster to test, and am really happy that I got the opportunity to try it out.  The ginger in the product definitely makes a difference and gives you a really clean feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I received this new product on behalf of influenster to review! I usually spend a fortune on deep conditioning treatments for my hair and this product really surprised me on how well it compaired to the big dollar products.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals has much to like about it including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* softness ~ leaves hair feeling soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* scent ~ pleasant natural lemon and spice mixture scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* non-frizzy - defrizzes and detangles hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* thickness ~ retains the natural body in your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* shine ~ promotes a natural, healthy shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You put it on after you shampoo and condition your hair, although I&#x27;ve used it without a conditioner and it works as one, too.  I just blew my hair dry slightly and then let it dry naturally and brushed it.  Looks great.  Definitely like this product.</li>
            <li> Good smell, and keeps the flyaway hair under control. I don&#x27;t use these kinds of products much so I can&#x27;t compare this to others of its kind, but my hair liked it fine.</li>
            <li> *I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes*&lt;br /&gt;First off, I love how this made my hair feel even as I applied it in the shower. The product appeared an appropriate consistency to actually add some moisture and nourishment to my hair. I used this product in conjunction with the Detoxifying Conditoner and I feel like this half of the conditioning process was really what left my hair feeling so soft and manageable. My hair is very prone to tangles so it was exciting to try something out that keeps my long locks from looking like a rat&#x27;s nest. Even after a night of tossing and turning in bed, my hair stayed more or less frizz-free and soft as it was when I stepped out of the shower and towel dried it.</li>
            <li> I have fine dyed hair and this brings it right back to life! I love using this a few times a week to revamp my hair health. Would def reccommend this product to anyone with dyed damaged hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the intensive moisturizer. It was a little oily for me and not needed at all, the shampoo/conditioner combo is perfect not need to waste time with this one, however I have baby fine hair so maybe someone with extremely dry thick hair would like it.&lt;br /&gt;*i received this product free for testing purposes*</li>
            <li> I Received a free sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment from Influenster to try and review.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with how well I liked this product.  I have very fine hair so products like this usually weigh my hair down and make it very flat.  This one did not.  It tamed all my frizz and left my hair very shiny and soft. It actually left my hair so frizz free I am able to go with out using my flat iron which is a huge plus for me.  Thank you Influenster!</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment for free so I could test and review it. I have thin, stick-straight hair that gets pretty oily if I don&#x27;t wash it every day. I also color treat my hair, so it tends to break easily. This product smells great, very clean and fresh. It has a great texture, very thick and creamy. My hair felt refreshed after I used it. I normally use a detangling product or leave in conditioner to comb my hair, but I did not need one after using this! My hair feels so soft and smooth after using it. Although I really enjoyed the scent, it didn&#x27;t stick around as long as I would&#x27;ve liked. Overall, I really enjoyed the treatment and will definitely consider purchasing-a great price for a much more expensive result.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! I noticed when my hair was dry that it was not as frizzy as it usually is, it was very soft in fact!! Not to mention it smells great and leaves hair very shiny also!!</li>
            <li> I liked this but I thought of it more as a deep conditioner than a detoxifying treatment. That being said it probably depends on your hair type. I have thin hair that tends to be drier. None the less I really enjoyed using this and thought it was great to use 1-2 times a week. It also smells really nice, which is great!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say honestly I love the smell! I received this as a sample In the mail. I would say at its best it&#x27;s just a conditioner. I can&#x27;t say that there is anything apeciak about it. I used it with the shampoo and conditioner and I just felt like using all three together left my hair feeking heavy and a little on the greasy side. I didn&#x27;t think it helped control the frizz of the little fly aways at all.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this product to test from influenster. I absolutely love the citrusy scent of this intensive treatment product. My hair smelled amazing all day! And was so clean! The intensive treatment made my hair very soft and was easy to comb through after washing it. My hair felt very light afterwards! And so smooth!</li>
            <li> I really like the floral, citrus scent of this leave in treatment because it isn’t overpowering. I was disappointed that this product has a runny consistency. However, it still worked really well. I have fine, thick, curly hair and my hair looked great! I used this product for about a week. I would consider purchasing this product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;** I was given a complimentary sample to test and review. **</li>
            <li> I received complimentary samples of this product to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, I try not to purchase products that contain parabens, so I was very excited to see that Herbal Essences Wild Naturals are paraben-free!  I used the intensive treatment in conjunction with the detoxifying shampoo and conditioner.  The product line has a pleasant fragrance that is not overpowering.  I have very thick but very fine natural blonde hair. I really liked this these products were nourishing for my hair without weighing it down.  I will be purchasing more of the wild naturals line in the future.</li>
            <li> Even though it smells like the shampoo and I&#x27;m not a big fan of it. This stuff is great!! It left my hair very healthy and strong. I used it along with the shampoo and conditioner and it worked great! It also helped with the frizzes!! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I received this product free as part of the Influenster program. I have very fine, straight, fluffy hair that gets weighed down and greasy easily, I have been using this product daily for over a week now and it is excellent. I know this is supposed to just be an after-conditioner treatment but since I am not a fan of the Wild Naturals Detoxifying conditioner I have been using this as a regular conditioner from the middle of my hair to the tips after using the shampoo. It has never weighed down my hair or left behind residue at the same time it leaves hair soft, manageable, moisturized, clean, and fresh. I highly recommend this product for use in combination with the Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I tested Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment for free thanks to Herbal Essence and Influenster. I love the way it made my hair feel soft and light. My hair has been extra frizzy due to the dry air this winter and after just one use the frizz was gone. I was able to go until my next shampoo without having to add anything extra to my hair and the frizz did not return. I highly recommend this product for keeping frizz at bay. The only thing that I would have liked better would be the scent as it is very strong but not actually bad being lemon and basil. I will definitely be using this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> This product was just not for me, I think my hair is too oily to need an intensive treatment product. I was able to try this product for free from my Herbal Essence Voxbox from Influenster which was a great opportunity but everyone&#x27;s hair is different. It may work better on someone who has more dry or course hair.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary product via Influenster for review and used it in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner. This product is hands down amazing for thin, frizzy hair like mine. From the first use I noticed a serious difference, and the more I use it, the better it gets. It smells really nice and lemony fragrance, and is a nice, thick masque from the bottle. It applies smoothly and does not leave your hair weighted down. I would recommend using the entire line of this particular product, the shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment, as I tried each one without the others and they seem to work best all together. Do yourself a favor and pick this up if you fight the frizzies!</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary to try from Influenster and I used it daily! I couldn&#x27;t get over how amazing if left my hair feeling! It is for sure a must try and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed! If frizz free hair is what you want this will be your best friend! &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a very nice conditioner. It has a pleasant, Herbal Essences scent and it has a nice feel as you smooth it into wet hair in the shower or bath. I let it sit for a time and really soak in before rinsing it. Unlike some intensive conditioners, this one isn&#x27;t impossible to completely rinse from hair, and hair doesn&#x27;t have a greasy after-feel either. I really like it and though I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a daily conditioner, I enjoy using it about once a week! It feels like it helps strengthen your hair too, though it is not an ideal conditioner for detangling, which is what I appreciate most from a conditioner with my fine hair that would love to live in knots of its own making!</li>
            <li> I received the product as a free sample through Influenster and love it!! Love what that it didn&#x27;t weight my hair down.  I have fine hair so i&#x27;m so leary on using deep conditioners.  Love the smell and love the feeling of my hair.  So soft and full with no frizzes.</li>
            <li> This hair treatment does a good job conditioning and softening the hair and reducing frizz.  It has a lovely fragrance dominated by lemon with elements of ginger and basil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is supposed to be used after shampooing and conditioning, but also could be used instead of occasional conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  water, stearyl alcohol, bis-aminopropyl dimethicone, behentrimonium chloride, cetyl alcohol, Ocimum basilicum (basil) leaf extract, Citrus limon (lemon) fruit extract, Zingiber officinale (ginger) root extract, cassia hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, peg-2M, disodium EDTA, polysorbate 20, methylchloroisothiazolinone, methylisothiazolinone, citral, limonene, citronellol, geraniol, linalool, blue 1, red 33, yellow 5.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a voxbox for free to test and review. When I opened the package I was a little hesitant because I despise the smell of lemon but oh my gosh I was wrong!!!  This is the most incredible smelling product I have used and will definitely be going to purchase full size bottles of this product line. I have fine, oily hair that gets flaky looking when I don&#x27;t get all my hair products (hair spray) out in the shower. This product line did an amazing job at cleaning my hair with only one wash and rinse. I also have a lot of trouble with conditioners weighing down my hair and causing it to be super oily. The conditioner and intense repair was fantastic! I will be recommending this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad conditioner. But the smell is stronger than I like, and I&#x27;m not sure that the conditioner does any more good for my hair than harm. It does something, that&#x27;s for sure. But I&#x27;m not sure that I like what it does. While I won&#x27;t steer anyone away from this conditioner, I can&#x27;t really recommend it either.</li>
            <li> I have tried it a few more times and I was wrong. It does condition well. It made my hair feel soft (though know that my hair tends to be soft since it is fine and straight). I need to try this with the shampoo that goes with it. It smells great. You oughta try it.</li>
            <li> The herbal scent is pleasing to the senses. My teens have loved it so much I keep having to steal it back from their bathroom (stinkers!). It does help with the frizz left from over-dry indoor winter weather, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair completely frizzless. Actually, my girls have gotten compliments on how soft and smooth their hair feels. You will still experience a little fly-away, though the static tends to go down despite sliding on sweaters or wearing wool. I noticed that if you wait 3-5 minutes before rinsing out with COOL water, it tends to work better. For $5.99 with free prime shipping it compares quite well to a much higher priced brand that I use. I&#x27;m debating making the switch but I do really love my other brand, too. Did I mention that it smells awesome? And it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling either heavy or greasy/oily like some products do.</li>
            <li> This product has left my hair incredibly soft and smooth. I was impressed that it didn&#x27;t weight down my fine hair when using this on top of a normal conditioner. I don&#x27;t love the smell and think it is too strong, but I do love the effect this product has on my hair!  *Disclaimer- I was sent this product for free to test and review.*</li>
            <li> This right here is the stuff dreams are made of.  This gave new life to my thin &amp; fine hair.  This smoothes the frizzies but doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down like a lot of intensive treatments do.  This left my hair feeling amazing with plenty of volume.  Plus - the scent is AMAZING and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary as a set in order to rate and review. I am glad I got this because I will definitely be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li> I have used Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Treatment, which is a product I received free to test and review, for a few weeks with the shampoo and conditioner and I just love the way it makes my hair feel. I usually tend to leave in the treatment for about 10 to 15 min. at the end while I&#x27;m busy shaving to give it time to sink in to my hair. I had an amazing experience with this treatment and I will definitely continue to purchase it once I run out! I believe it will work on every type of hair and totally recommend for anyone to try this amazing product give this treatment a chance with the shampoo and conditioner for maximum results!</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me for free, I would actually purchase it though, I used this instead of the conditioner that came with the shampoo and I liked the way the two worked together, screw the conditioner that wasn&#x27;t worth it at all.  I have very fine oily hair and this treatment when combined with the shampoo didn&#x27;t weigh it down.  I really thought it would, but it actually looked better than it has in a long time.  I usually hate this drugstore stuff,, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product I received free in a VoxBox since I had never even seen it before. My hair is colored so it needs extra care and this product did just that! My hair felt softer and appeared stronger after a week! I only put it on my hair from my ears down because it is very fine and tends to look oily faster if I put it on my roots. Overall, I was very pleased!</li>
            <li> The intensive treatment made my hair look great and really allowed it to detoxify from city life. The complimentary sample I got via Influenster will definitely have me coming back for more!</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a voxbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this as a leave in conditioner. Didn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel greasy. Will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for free. All opinions are my own and are my honest thoughts on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ADORE this product. I could feel the difference in my hair after the first time I used it. I noticed that while wet, my hair was extremely slick. I was worried that I would experience oily hair afterwards, but it rinsed out clear and beautifully. I noticed far fewer knots in my hair and was able to run my fingers through it right after a shower (never happens). I feel that it paired well with the detoxifying shampoo. Definitely a product that I will buy over and over. I would not view this as a daily conditioner, but rather once a week to really cleanse and revive my hair. I also love the lemony scent and do not feel that it smells at all like &amp;#34;cleaning products&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The feeling on your hair with this product is great.  Unfortunately, this is such a small tube, that you&#x27;ll need to really stretch it to get a lot out of it.  There&#x27;s only enough for 4-5 washes with this.  Not something I&#x27;ll buy often.</li>
            <li> This treatment creme has a very citrusy aroma which I like very  much.  Not much is needed to rub into the scalp. My hair is fine but on dry days here in the desert, some moisturizer is needed, and this keeps my hair from going crazy.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but it helps to control the blowing strands.  It&#x27;s a bit pricy for what you get.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this hair conditioner of damaged hair. My recent hair dye job dried out my hair and after two applications of this hair conditioner, it was back to its normal condition. It has a very pleasant and refreshing scent. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to use this conditioner on a daily basis. If you have dry hair, Clairol Herbal Essences also has the Hydralicious conditioner, which I use regularly and works just fine. But if you are planning to have any chemical work on your hair, I would suggest pre-treating it with this conditioner, as well as after.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey at $6 for a tube so save it for those occasions.</li>
            <li> Great scent, but more importantly, this leaves hair fresh and buoyant.  I have naturally oily hair, and this has really helped keep my hair feeling light and clean, even overnight (which never happens for me).  I’m a real fan of this one.  It’s meant to be used as a secondary conditioner, but even used as the only conditioner, this works just as described.  A little goes a long way, and that’s always a plus.</li>
            <li> I am the mom of a four month old. My hair has not been cut or trimmed in at least six months. Recently my hair started getting dreaded because I was not brushing it enough after a shower. This product saved my hair. Yes I still need a trim but I was able to actually brush my hair and not have tangles. Love the overpowering smell which helps cover up baby spit smell.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner that smells really good if you like lemons.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and  conditions really well leaving your hair soft and manageable.  I like it just as much as the pricier brands of conditioners.  I would say it does a great job for the price.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this intensive treatment since I have dry and unmanageable hair. I used a small amount on the ends of my hair to avoid getting a greasy look. It made it a lot easier to comb my hair and style it after I washed and dried my hair. I don&#x27;t think this is something to use every hair wash. But I am in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> Squeaky clean!  That is the best word for me to describe my experience with this product.  I was given this product to test and review from Influenster.com, and I am so happy to report my experience as a positive one.  I used it along with the detoxifying shampoo and conditioner.  Simple to use, you just apply and then rinse.  Like my first impression of the conditioner, I thought it might not work since it seemed to wash off so easily.  After towel drying my hair, however, the comb glided through my fine, thin, color-treated hair easily and honestly felt \\&quot;squeaky clean.\\&quot;  That is why I like the product.  It did not sit heavy on my hair and feel sticky.  Instead, I was left with a nice shine and a pleasant, clean scent of citrus.  After my hair dried, it had a nice shine and felt very soft, in better condition than before.  I am an older woman with sensitive skin and this product did not cause any irritation, whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this line to try (shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner), and this is by far my favorite product of the three! First of all, I can&#x27;t get enough of the scent. It smells amazing, and leaves my hair unbelievably soft. The ends of my hair, which usually look scraggly for lack of a better work, look smooth and wonderful. I plan to continue using this once or twice a week as a deep conditioning treatment. I was very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I am VERY picky about what I use in my hair and on my body. When I received this in the mail for free to review, I was a little skeptical. I have combination oily and dry hair (depending on the weather - cold &#x3D; dry and frizzy, hot &#x3D; an oily mess). I also deal with what I have nicknamed my birds nest in the mornings. I have been using this product along with the shampoo and conditioner for a few days and am thoroughly impressed! This has actually given my hair the moisture it typically lacks during the winter. It feels fluffy instead of wiry. Another perk is that it smells SO good! It has more of a floral/citrus smell that has actually helped me wake up in the mornings ^_^</li>
            <li> What a Refreshing product! I always struggle with products making my hair feel greasy. My hair is fine so it doesn&#x27;t take much to weigh it down. This product left my hair feeling light and soft. What I loved most was the light fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t carry one of those heavy &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; smells. Can&#x27;t wait to keep using it!</li>
            <li> I received the set for the Wild Naturals Detoxifying treatment for free along with the matching shampoo/conditioner. I don&#x27;t like the scent that they come with, but this intensive treatment that it comes with works WAY better the matching conditioner. This one is definitely required for using after the regular conditioner since the conditioner that comes with it is not strong. And after looking at the price of it, I think it&#x27;s a good purchase and affordable.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a result of an Influenster review box. I used the product for a week, replacing the products I would have normally used. For reference, I have professionally color-treated hair (about every six weeks) that&#x27;s thin and fine, usually wavy and combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice lemony smell, left my hair absolutely smooth and transformed. I&#x27;m really shocked by the way my hair has responded to this whole line of products. After using the shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment for three days I noticed my hair looked shiny. I thought I was just going to have to deal with a duller look now that I put my hair through so much. I&#x27;m a minimalist when it comes to hair and wNt to do as little as possible - this makes my hair look effortlessly fantastic without all the work!</li>
            <li> I used this intensive treatment on a really bad hair day and it cured it fast. Due to the wind and blast of cold weather my hair was on the frizz again. This definitely cured my bad hair day blues but when used on a normal day not so much as my hair can tend to be on the oily side, so even when using this product just on the ends of my hair I still had some oil control problems. But i&#x27;m excited to use this on the days I really need it. I got this product for free for testing and review purposed from Influenster</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this hair mask from VOXBOX and at first i was skeptical because i thought the conditioner was enough but the mask worked wonders for me !! My hair was untangled and so soft afterwards and it helped with my frizzyness which is a must with wavy/curly hair !!! SAVED ME so much time.</li>
            <li> I have an almost two year old whose current mantra is that &amp;#34;sleep is for the weak.&amp;#34; When I opened my Influenster Vox Box which contained this product, shampoo, and conditioner I was excited.  I tend to change my hair products every couple of weeks to avoid my fine hair becoming overly greasy.  In my sleep deprived state, I thought &amp;#34;score!  Shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.  Fabulous.&amp;#34;  I live in Northern New York.  Suffice it to say that it is cold her and I am pasty and ashy.  On my way out the door to work, I decided to use my new &amp;#34;lotion.&amp;#34; A nice layer all over my legs.  I noticed it wasn&#x27;t rubbing in very well.  I checked the front of the packaging.  It just said intensive treatment on the front - my legs definitely needed intensive treatment.  I turned the tube over and realized it was a wash out conditioner for hair.  Oops.  A quick shower to rinse my legs off and I was out the door.  On the bright side, my legs felt really well moisturized?  Score: sleep 1 reading comprehension 0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying out the conditioner for its intended treatment, I have to say that it works well for my hair type.  It&#x27;s not overly heavy and rinses out clean.  My hair looks great after using it.</li>
            <li> Seriously so impressed with Influenster sending me this product for review. I love it. My hair smells great and is incredibly managable without that greasy feeling I get from super moisturizing products. I have thin fine curly hair and it gets greasy easily if I don&#x27;t use good products. I have used this for two weeks and am really impressed</li>
            <li> I gave this product about a month before i reviewed it.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it out because some of the hair products I use for styling leave my hair feeling dry and brittle. I was hoping this would help more than just regular conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;First of all it took me awhile to figure out that this is supposed to be a supplement to conditioning. Meaning you wash and condition and then treat.&lt;br /&gt;While some may already know this, I had no idea. Wish it had included some brief usage tips on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also let 2 other people use it to see what their reactions would be. My mom, 58yo, long, color treated, fine hair. Used it without conditioning first and she complained that it made her hair harder to comb.&lt;br /&gt;My cousin, 28 with long natural thick hair used it after conditioning and said she really liked how it made her hair feel. She thought it would be oily or greasy but it was just soft and felt nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a man, 39yo with medium length hair. I have a full head of hair but my hair has always been fine and soft. This makes it tough to style which is why I use products with more hold. Unfortunately those products are a lot harder on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;For me this stuff works great. I use it after I condition and I leave it in for a few minutes and my hair feels great afterwards. Without it my hair feels dry and brittle if I&#x27;ve used product.&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair pretty short half way through the bottle but I&#x27;ve continued to use it and it continues to make my hair feel awesome.&lt;br /&gt;My wife even commented on how soft my hair felt and I got a head massage out of it... which was pretty sweet. ;)&lt;br /&gt;I also like the smell, but i like all the fragrances from Herbal Essences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from this brand to be honest but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, i really like this product. If you are having issues with dry or brittle hair I would definitely give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Wash and condition first though.</li>
            <li> I use this with the shampoo and conditioner I got free to test and review.  It works well when using with them. My hair needs some extra attention. I&#x27;d love this and the shampoo and conditioner in a different scent. I&#x27;m not a fan on the lemon scent. It reminds me of cleaning house. Overall I like this product.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I have to say is that for me, the scent is too much. I am sensitive to fragrances and this is one that is causing me some discomfort such as a scratchy voice. Having said that, I really liked the way this has made my hair feel. When I washed my hair tonight I finished everything with the intensive treatment with the intention of flat ironing my hair. It has left my hair feeling remarkably soft and silky feeling. More so than normal. I am inclined to seek out the other formulas in the wild naturals and see if I can tolerate them better because I am impressed with how my hair looks and feels after using just this one product. I recently received this product complimentary to test and review.</li>
            <li> I love this! It smells amazing and leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> I received this in an influenster vox box. I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with it. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and my hair feels healthier and looks shiny not dull. I just use it on the ends of my hair after I shampoo. I will buy this product for myself and definitely recommend it. (I have fine hair)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a snob about hair products - if it&#x27;s not sold in the salon, it&#x27;s not for me.  I had the opportunity to try this intensive hair treatment as well as the detoxifying shampoo and conditioner (received product complimentary for testing purposes), and I&#x27;m SO happy I did!  I&#x27;ve used the three products every couple days for a week, and my hair is as soft as my young daughter&#x27;s!  My husband actually thought I&#x27;d recently gone to the salon (and the fact that he noticed my hair, well, that&#x27;s new)!  I am going to save so much money, and my hair smells beautiful, too.  YES!</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary. The first thing I did was check out the smell, which is amazing. Very fresh, slightly floral but not as intensely floral as the old Herbal Essences used to be (think back to the era when they had the commercials with the ladies washing their hair and making...interesting noises...) I waited a week and a half to review so that I could really have time with the product. The verdict: I have super fine hair and I have found that this makes my hair weightless which is what I need. If I have any product or build up lingering on my hair, it weighs it down and becomes flat. I love this product because it still keeps my hair weightless unlike other intensive treatments. And it also washed out clean and easily!</li>
            <li> Out of all of the three Wild Naturals products, this one is BY FAR my favorite! IT MADE MY HAIR SO INCREDIBLY SOFT! Buy it! Thanks to Influenster for the free product!</li>
            <li> Amazing product I am in love! I received a free sample of this in the mail, I have never used anything on my hair like this! Salon quality in my opinion, imagine your hair is full of knots and tangles, using this product after shampooing and conditioning and you will be able to run a comb through it with complete ease! The smell is like you are using straight lemons and oranges very refreshing!</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight weak hair and this product really helped to strengthen my hair after a few treatments. I liked the fresh lemon scent of the product and was quite impressed with how it helped my damaged hair. The instructions indicate to wash and condition after using the product; however, I found that I only needed to wash my hair after using the product as my hair was silky smooth and was not in need of conditioner after using the detoxifying treatment. For an inexpensive, at-home treatment, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive hair conditioner is a great concept.  I like the easy to use tub and I like the smell.  I found that it made my hair soft BUT only if I used the right amount of conditioner which is what caused me a major dilemma.  If I used too much my hair was soft as silk but way too flat and almost oily.  IF I used too little, then I continued with having frizzy hair which prompted me to review this item in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ingredients in the conditioner and as I stated prior, the smell is great.  It&#x27;s just finding that right amount to use on my hair that has had me stumped more than one morning while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should you try it? definitely.  Is it a reasonable price? Yep.  Will you like it? I think so.  I say GO FOR IT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie S, for Amazon Vine</li>
            <li> Works very well i like it as a small dot after the shower in my damp hair to keep it smooth and soft. Seems to control flyaway hair without the weight of oils or other leave in&#x27;s. directions have this being a rinse in the shower type of treatment but i like it better the way i use it. a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I usually do not use Herbal Essences&#x27; products, but I&#x27;m glad I did this time.  My hair is over-stylized, with heavy usage of the blow dryer and hot curling iron.  When I use this product, my hair simply looks healthier.</li>
            <li> Over all at the price point, the functionality of this product can&#x27;t be beat.  It&#x27;s based on a dimethicone formula, which is the reason that you don&#x27;t need to leave it in like other conditioning products.  Dimethicone bonds to the shaft of the hair and doesn&#x27;t rinse off; it will eventually be worn off over time with rubbing and abrasion but it&#x27;s pretty tough.  It will definitely seal the follicle and give you a shiny, lustrous finish.  Keep in mind that it may cause a &amp;#34;flattening&amp;#34; effect on the upper area of your hair, so it might be safer to stick to conditioning the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally really like the herb/citrus smell that this product has.  It&#x27;s fairly strong so probably not for everyone, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Well, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot from this product, but I was interested enough to give it a try.  My hair is rather fine and starting to grey and can often look dull and flyaway.  I&#x27;ve used many different types of &amp;#34;intensive conditioners&amp;#34; before and, with the exceptions of those put on my hair in a salon, those types of products usually just weigh my hair down.  This Herbal Essences Wild Naturals product does not do that and I was surprised by the amount of shine and manageability of my hair after one treatment.  It is nice that you don&#x27;t have to leave it on very long (in fact, the directions don&#x27;t specify a length of time; they just say &amp;#34;massage in and rinse out&amp;#34;), so it easy to use regularly in place of a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I find that this instantly takes out the tangles in my hair in the shower better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  It feels slightly oily in that dry oil way but rinses away cleanly leaving no trace of residue to weight my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as giving that deep conditioning I am after, it remains elusive.  My hair remains frizzy and dry feeling after applying this and drying it.  I keep this for the incredible detangling effect but also put on some Morroccan oil before blowing out my hair to give it some shine and smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a fake generic fruit/mango scent that is ok but not great. Also, it&#x27;s a pretty small tube, although a little spreads out a lot so it goes a long way.  My search for that holy grail conditioner will continue.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan or Herbal Essence. Their products are superior at a fraction of the cost. My hair was really looking horrible and dry. I used this on it a couple of times and now it looks amazing. i get so many compliments on how healthy it looks.</li>
            <li> I am loving this Herbal Essences line.  The products smell great, work great, and are easy on my pocketbook.  I change my hair color a lot, so having affordable products to protect my hair is really wonderful.</li>
            <li> The scent of this Herbal Essence is fabulous, Lemony, fresh, gingery, I love the way this smells! You use this after conditioner, and it takes awhile to rinse and rinse, and rinse. However, I like the way my hair feels slippery and shiny after I use the intensive treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the scent and feeling of my hair I intend to buy the shampoo and regular conditioner to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of deep conditioning treatments and never see any results so I was a bit skeptical of a drug store brand product. I received the treatment complimentary from influester along with the shampoo and conditioner. The product is to be used after the conditoner. I let sit on m hair for ten minutes and after washing out and blow dry I cloud feel the difference after the first use. Silky shiny and soft! Plus the smell is awesome awesome!</li>
            <li> I’m very pleased with this conditioner. My hair is medium-length, color-treated, and wavy. It tends to get frizzy, especially in the rainy Pacific Northwest weather. I have to use moisturizing shampoos and conditioners and also use a deep conditioning treatment once or twice a week to fight the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to massage in and rinse, but I leave it in for a few minutes. This conditioner makes my hair look and feel soft and shiny. It works very well at combating frizziness. What makes this product stand out is how much healthier my hair looks when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a conditioning treatment once or twice a week, and this is my current favorite. For some reason, I don’t get the same results if I use it more than once a week. I mean, it still conditions and fights frizz, but I don’t get the same level of softness and shine. It’s not a miracle product, but it’s an excellent budget-friendly addition to my cache of frizz fighters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the scent. It smells lemony, but kind of sweet too – not a strong fake lemon smell.</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly hair, so a good conditioner is important to me. I left this treatment on my hair for about 3-4 minutes after washing and conditioning with the same line of products. This was much more moisturizing than the regular conditioner in this line, but still didn&#x27;t wow me. I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of the smell, but that&#x27;s just my personal preference. I may consider using again if I have a coupon, but it isn&#x27;t the best conditioning treatment I&#x27;ve used. It may be better for someone who needs less moisture. The shampoo is my favorite product in this line. Note: I received a free sample of this product.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this product to try and used it this morning. My hair has been on the dry, frizzy side lately, and I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth and silky my hair feels today after just one use! I also used the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo and conditioner. First I shampoo&#x27;d and rinsed, then massaged in the Intensive treatment and let it site for about a minute before rinsing, then used the conditioner and rinsed, Not only does my hair feel super soft and in control now, but my hair color even seems to me more vibrant today. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a great intensive treatment!  My hair is color treated.  I get oily at my roots and drier on the ends.  A lot of hair masks, or deep conditioners make my hair super oily.  This did not.  I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait time with this product.  Just lather it in and rinse.  I did wait maybe 30 seconds before rinsing.  It rinsed cleanly away.  My hair was soft, shiny, and tangle free once dry!  I&#x27;ve tired many more expensive products from Sephora,Ulta, etc....and I feel this performed just as well as the higher end products.  I plan on using this weekly but if you have drier hair I think you&#x27;d be just fine in using it on a daily basis!&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a sample of this product from Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes.  While I was sent this product, this review is my own thoughts and opinion.  I will be purchasing this product on my own as soon as my sample runs out!</li>
            <li> I used this intensive treatment product after shampooing and conditioning my hair and I was really impressed with it. I felt like it brought back a lot of the moisture that the shampoo has stripped out. For the price I feel like it&#x27;s a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product. I never buy deep conditioning treatments because I feel like they weigh my very fine hair down. However, I was very pleased with this product. It made my hair super soft and shiny without weighing it down. I will likely use once per week or so or whenever my hair is feeling blah.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment. I have oily hair so I thought this intensive treatment might be too heavy and weigh it down. It actually didn&#x27;t so I am happy to say that I love this product. I will use it occasionally, probably once or twice a month to keep my hair healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the best option for thin, fine hair. My hair felt clean, but was limp and lifeless. Half way through the day my hair had gone flat and was in my face.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this conditioner is that it smells great. It smells like lemon verbena, and it&#x27;s really quite lovely, not overpowering at all. As far as conditioning goes, it&#x27;s not bad, but it did leave my fine, frizz-prone hair feeling rather flat and heavy. My hair is naturally curly and tends to get flyaways, and this did smooth things down pretty well. It just felt a little gunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; thing comes off as a gimmick; this is just a conditioner, and it&#x27;s not going to magically remove whatever toxins Herbal Essences want you to think are in your hair. It doesn&#x27;t cleanse at all, just condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price point, it&#x27;s not a terrible option. I&#x27;d recommend it for thick, frizzy hair that could use a little extra weight to keep it under control. If your hair is fine, it feels a bit too heavy.</li>
            <li> I recieved this complimentary from The Influenster team in my Vox box.  And I love it.  I have naturally oily hair but this stuff is Amazing. It made my hair super smooth and oh so soft!  I can&#x27;t use both the conditioner and the intensive conditioner together tho as it makes my hair kind of stiff. Other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I plan to continue using.  It used it before using the corresponding shampoo and conditioner.  It left my hair very silky.  The only negative was that I did not notice anything in the directions instructing me when to use this product.. do I use it after I wash and condition my hair, before, etc?  I recommend the product.  I received a free sample to review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally purchase herbal essences, but received a free sample of this product along with the wild naturals shampoo and conditioner and was pretty pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally prefer the scent of these products vs a typical herbal essence scent (hope that makes sense).  The lack if direction on when in the process to use this product made it a bit confusing, but I&#x27;ve been using it post- conditioner. There&#x27;s no dramatic difference to my hair after using this, but again I do like the scent. I think I may try using as an overnight conditioning treatment as it seems to weight my hair down a bit if I use too much in the morning.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! So fresh and invigorating. Conditions nicely when paired with the detoxifying shampoo and condition. Didn&#x27;t feel like it weighed my hair down at all. It helped strengthen my hair and allowed a curl to last the whole day. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment is a post conditioner that you use after you wash and condition your hair. The scent is pleasant, with a refreshing lemon and herb smell that lingers until I rinse it off. As a treatment conditioner, I leave it in my hair for 2-3 minutes before rinsing it off.  It helps make my hair feel soft and manageable. My hair seems less frizzy as well - not completely frizz free but significantly reduced. One thing I don&#x27;t like is that it seems to make my hair look a bit dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product works great to make my hair soft and manageable, but at the expense of leaving it dull. Because of this, I would only use it once a week, maybe twice at most, while using my regular shampoo and conditioner everyday.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d this free from influenster in my VoxBox to try and I simply love, love, love!  The smell is great and not to overpowering.  The texture is thick but rinses cleanly and leaves my hair so soft, smooth, and shiny.  I have tried several products from Herbal Essences in the past and this is by far my favorite product to date!  Thanks influenster!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the main component in why my hair is softer than ever from root to tip. The consistency is nice and thick and it smells very nice (not as strong as the shampoo, which smells beyond amazing) I use this following shampoo on my scalp and condiotioner on my ends. I smooth it from top to bottom, massaging it into my ends and let it sit for a minute or so. My hair which I was every other day, and by end of day 2 is rather oily on the scalp, is still rather perfect. My ends are so soft and lively. I will continue to purchase this once my free product is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> Works great on frizzy hair. It also helps control the static in fine hair. Product compliments the corresponding shampoo and conditioner. Leaves hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of washing and conditioning my hair upside down the first and last time I will ever use this product.  The chemical smell was terrible.  It was sharp and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I couldn’t rinse the smell out.  Then I had the smell on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I saw how beautiful my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, no.</li>
            <li> I received free sample of the intensive treatment as well as the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo smells good and worked as expected. I was a little less impressed with the conditioner. This intensive treatment however, is amazing! I have thin, long wavy hair and due to the thinness of my hair, I wear a synthetic hair piece as well. I was ready to throw out my hair piece due to the ends felt like straw. I used the intensive treatment on my hair and my hair piece. All my hair was soft, manageable and perfect. I will continue to use the treatment and would highly recommend it to anyone with natural or synthetic hair!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this out for free! I used it in combination with the shampoo and conditioner. I loved the clean, citrusy smell of the products and felt it left my hair clean and soft and gave it lightweight feeling. Overall I am happy with the results from this product!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with this conditioner. This winter has been very dry and although I don&#x27;t usually have problems with frizzy hair, this year I do. The conditioner yielded great results the first time I used it. My hair was no longer dry and frazzled, but smooth shiny and sleek. I would have given this product five stars but the second ingredient in it, after water, is stearyl alcohol, which hair stylists have always told me is bad for hair.</li>
            <li> I love this...I have curly hair and it&#x27;s difficult to find products that really work well in my hair to tamper the frizz. I&#x27;ve been going natural for awhile or straightening it because I won&#x27;t use any products that make it stiff or greasy (the old stand by mousse from my high school days...or gel...*groan*). I&#x27;ve been using this for the past week as leave in conditioner (about a nickel size...I have longer hair) and I love it. I either let my hair dry naturally OR use a hair-dryer with a diffuser (specifically made for curls)...and it&#x27;s amazing. Not greasy, not stiff...silky curls. An easy on the wallet buy. Definitely worth the try for frizz taming.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of lemons in my beauty products, so this was a huge winner in fragrance for me.  I have fairly long and wavy hair that becomes very dry in winter months.  I like to use an intensive conditioner once a week during those periods.  I pick a day of the week (usually Saturday) to do my once a week routines and added this to my list of things to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the conditioner as directed but waited a few minutes before rinsing it out.  That is what I have always done with intensive conditioners so it made sense to me to do it with those product, too.  I was very careful to rinse my hair thoroughly.  I find that it takes a bit of extra rinse time with this type of conditioner and it you are too quick, you can end up with a film to your hair.  Not so for me - I really liked the way my hair looked and felt after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is too much for daily use unless you have severely damaged hair (which I do not.)  I recommend it to anyone who wants to use a more intensive conditioner once a week in additional to regular wash and conditioner treatments.</li>
            <li> I got this product free to test and review and I am very pleased! This deep conditioner smells great and leaves my hair super soft and manageable! I&#x27;m not quite sure how it detoxifies, but it did leave my hair silky smooth and easy to brush after I used it. Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would buy it and recommend it to someone who was looking for a good smelling deep conditioner that isn&#x27;t too pricey. I used it with the Wild Naturals shampoo and conditioner and it left my hair feeling great!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different intenive treatments or leave in conditioners from a cheap price to very expensive products; for how affordable this product is, it works amazing! I would reccomend it over any of the expensive brands I have tried. I have long, thin hair. It made my hair more&lt;br /&gt;Manageable with getting the knots out without making it greasy. It feels soft, but not too soft! I love it and strongly reccomend it, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> After using the wild naturals shampoo and conditioner, I applied this intensive. treatment conditioner. I could tell a significant difference in how my hair felt. I have long straight hair and It was softer and less frizzy. I relieved this product complimentary but will be purchasing it for myself in the near future!</li>
            <li> This was amazing ! It made my hair soo soft &amp; les tangled i loved it so much !!!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair really soft and shiny!! Love it</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  I gave it three stars; very nice product for the price point.  Left hair soft and smells amazing but my hair became very oily by the end of the day, which does not happen with my normal regimen.</li>
            <li> Used sparingly, this is a wonderful intensive treatment. It left my hair feeling very thick and full of body. I had to be very certain to thoroughly rinse it though and I also had to make sure it was used sparingly otherwise it was too heavy and would leave my hair dull, flat, and oily. It had a nice smell as well.</li>
