            <li> Got here on time. Smells great.</li>
            <li> As the new fragrances hit the scene my favorites seem to be getting cheaper and cheaper.....and I LOVE IT! you simply can&#x27;t beat the price. this is a steal. you&#x27;re getting a nice size bottle of lotion and not to mention it&#x27;s Ed Hardy I love his fragrances, and although Love and Luck is my favorite I will continue to buy this one as well. At this price, I can stock up. Delivery was fast. My lotion was packed with care and everything was in tact.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent made by Ed Hardy,  When I saw they had the scent in a lotion that sparkled, I was all about it.  Love it</li>
            <li> Wrong kind....look the same but different scent.  When I use it I realize the smell was different and I was disappointed.  Wrong name and the color was darker pink instead of lighter pink.</li>
            <li> It goes so great before spraying the perfume. Leaves your skin with a very smooth feeling and you sparkle. lol</li>
            <li> this shimmering body lotion is so sensual to me, my boyfriend love sit and told me when next I am buying to get the whole range of it.&lt;br /&gt; I would definitely RECOMMEND this to My FRIENDS</li>
            <li> It smells fabulous &amp; is a luxurious lotion. I&#x27;m giving it to my niece along with other items for her 18th birthday which is Valentines Day, she&#x27;ll love it!</li>

            <li> i have been wearing &amp;#34;born wild&amp;#34; for months now so i already know that i like the smell and when i saw the value of this lotion, i had to have it.</li>

            <li> My sister gave me this for my birthday. Oh I love the smell. It&#x27;s gorgeous. So girly and light. My hands were pretty dry so eveyt morning when I woke up I would apply some of this on them. Every morning for about three weeks this went on. My hands blew up and turned bright red. They started pealing and they were at least twice there normal sive. It was horrible. I finally realized it was this product. You have to wash it off after you put it on according to the back of the bottle. Learn from my mistake but I didnt think I needed to learn how to put on some lotion.</li>
