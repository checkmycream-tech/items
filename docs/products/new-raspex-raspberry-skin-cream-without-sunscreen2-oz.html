            <li>(works great on face too)</li>
            <li>I read all the great reviews</li>
            <li>Great cream.....</li>
            <li>Great product,Joe and Diane Cooper</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great on sunburns and burns.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>All gone... just great.</li>
            <li>The owner is very nice and helpful regarding all of his products.</li>
            <li>The Raspex cream appears to be doing a good job of clearing-up my skin.</li>
            <li>and I thought it might be good for my skin.</li>
            <li>I plan to continue using this, it is as good as any face cream I have ever bought&lt;br /&gt;regardless of price.</li>
            <li>we all have fair skin and are prone to skin cancer, pre-cancer spots and brown spots.  </li>
            <li>I used this product on my face because I read it was good for skin cancer</li>
            <li>I recommended it to a friend who also is very pleased with the results she is getting.</li>
            <li>I have heard many great things about this face cream.....</li>
            <li>cream is so economical and the best product ever!  </li>
            <li>They ship for free!!  </li>
            <li>The cream itself is smooth and a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Has a good consistency but will need use longer to be sure of its benefits.  </li>
            <li>I like the kind with the sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li>My husband has found this cream especially useful in helping his skin cancer.  </li>
            <li>NIce product as far as having a wonderful smell and feel to it.</li>
            <li>This skin cream is fine, but probably not as good as Murad.</li>
            <li>The more you apply, the faster the cancer will disappear.  </li>
            <li>Sure beats having the dermatologist \\&quot;shave\\</li>
            <li>Works ok but if I order any more</li>
            <li>One of my favorite lotions.</li>
            <li>and I would also apply it on the top of my hands before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>The texture is lovely.</li>
            <li>However it doesn&#x27;t go on skin easily</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and tight after application, the perfect foundation for my mineral make-up.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased to highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>can really only give this 3 stars, as I did not have any issues with it, but I did not see any great results from it, either.</li>
            <li>Just got it and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>but I will surely buy some more very</li>
            <li>I find this amazing and highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I have seen any significant improvement, but will use for another month or two and see what happens.</li>
            <li>My wife had a small cancerous spot on her nose removed and now she is applying this to the spot and it seems to be working real good.</li>
            <li>However, I am impressed over the first few days use.</li>
            <li>Second jar for  me and good results.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle formula and can be used on most problem skin areas.</li>
            <li>I have rated this before and am continuing to enjoy it on my chest which has seen way too much sun!</li>
            <li>I can say from my own personal experience; it can and it does!</li>
            <li>so I was very happy when after a few weeks of using Raspex at night my sun spots had started to fade, and unexpected bonus</li>
            <li>but right now nothing to report.</li>
            <li>Time will tell , so far , after 2 weeks , nothing has faded yet or disappeared but the lotion smells good and has a lovely feel as it goes onto the face and hands, hopefully sun spot and brown spots will be a thing of the past.</li>
            <li>She isn&#x27;t anywhere near finished with the first pot, but I just bought a second because I want to make sure she has it available.</li>
            <li>I could feel my skin tighten with constant use and love the feel of my face.</li>
            <li>but I feel the price went up since I first purchased the creams.</li>
            <li>But  it seems to be working,I will purchase some more a litter later.</li>
            <li>and she may still need surgery, but it seems Raspex is playing a positive role.</li>
            <li>That was five days ago and the sore is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>Might be a little early (1st container of the product) to clearly indicate the effectiveness but so far I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I noticed results quickly such as fine line reduction,faded sun spots and my pores seemed to tighten or decrease in size.</li>
            <li>I had very high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>We are very prone to basal skin cancer in my family and this product has saved us from a lot of pain, discomfort and radiation treatments.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the way it goes on and feels on my face.</li>
            <li>but it seems to work real well.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well</li>
            <li>, I think it exfoliated my face too much when I put it on with coconut oil</li>
            <li>young skin, takes age spots off, my skin look fresh.</li>
            <li>This gel really does work.</li>
            <li>but it does work very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Product was as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Really did not notice any difference</li>
            <li>It was soothing and gentle, but we did not think it seemed to help dimish it, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IM CONVINCED now that it does work very well and pretty quickly after SEVERAL WEEKS OF USE.....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still young but I will say that my hands look refreshed and soft after the first night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it got better, hardly dry now as even I do not use it regularly because I forget, but</li>
            <li>I just purchased some of the powder capsules and a new jar of cream to use.  </li>
            <li>and I hope this helps with prevention while it&#x27;s making my skin so soft, would be an added bonus!</li>
            <li>When I bought the first pot of this cream I didn&#x27;t have a specific purpose in mind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Am perfectly willing to revise my review, even to the point of changing it to a 5-star review, if I see any reason to in the future.</li>
            <li>It works bit by bit, forming a clear scab over the affected area.  </li>
            <li>Apply at least three times a day or more if you possibily can.  </li>
            <li>I would contact the company direct if you are doubting this products worthiness.</li>
            <li>Well, my patches disappeared completely.</li>
            <li>but since I have sensitive skin I had burned marks all over my face.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks so much softer than with any other moisturizer I have used.</li>
            <li>I had a lesion form on my neck, I applied this product on it, toward the end of my second jar, the lesion began to disappear; at the beginning of the third jar, it had all but completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>I have been advised by the company that it&#x27;s considerably less than most products that contain parabens, like 1/50,0000th of the usual amount.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while, but after consistent use, the spots have lightened and a few have disappeared altogether.</li>
            <li>I was diagnose with CTCL and was not sure if this is the right one for it.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but not sensational either.</li>

            <li> I was diagnose with CTCL and was not sure if this is the right one for it.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but not sensational either.</li>
            <li> I started using this again on some precancerous spots and some  brown spots and moles on neck and found that it did make the precancerous ones worse before they got better and are healing to a softer pink skin rather than sore red and scabby spots...</li>
            <li> As far as the pre cancerous spot on the other ear, it did nothing.  </li>
            <li> SMDI.org is very focused on the active ingredient (raspberry seed flour, and I have also purchased capsules of just the active ingredient from them.</li>
            <li> it would at least decrease my very noticeable sun spot on the side of my face</li>
            <li> She applied the cream multiple times a day and says there is just a little redness left.</li>
            <li> same as fpor the other product.</li>
            <li> Had a red spot on one ear lobe that almost completely disappeared with the use of the cream at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> but I had a brown spot on my white skin which looked to be the beginning signs of skin cancer and wanted to take care of it before it got worse as I got older</li>
            <li> , it was a very dry patch of skin and every time I use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Raspex products for the past couple of years now and no other product out there can compete with the laundry list of benefits.</li>
            <li> My next order will be for my legs as I have little brown spots that are raised</li>
            <li> I also noticed  some keratosis on my neck hands and trunk lightened after only a few applications.  </li>
            <li> The bump totally disappeared after using cream for a few months.  </li>
            <li> so far I used 2 jars and it seemed to be fading slowly</li>
            <li> I like this product and will continue to use it due to some precancerous spots I have.  </li>
            <li> and I do believe it has helped some with my AK and other sun spots.</li>
            <li> I will shop around for other products to try as well.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as other raspberry products I have used ...</li>
            <li> One patch on my arm is gone the other areas are almost gone.</li>
            <li> what looked like a lot of skin started coming off as I was rubbing, leaving my face dry for a few days,</li>
            <li> Helps with age spots and dark spots.</li>
            <li> lighten up dark circles under eyes.</li>
            <li> My skin healed and the dark over pigmentation was gone.</li>
            <li> $ is a lot less than what it would cost to have it removed by a doctor.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE FIRMER.</li>
            <li> It is a little costly for me</li>
            <li> Regardless, I&#x27;m a firm believer and cheerleader for Raspex and will be using it exclusively for my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> The scarring is going away everyday.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few jars and started using it as suggested.  </li>
            <li> found it dried out my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale and don&#x27;t deal well with the sun</li>
            <li> The surgeon was shocked at the improvement of the affected area and determined that it may \\&quot;self-correct\\&quot; given the improvement over the course of the first week.</li>
            <li> Use very little for one application, my skin is looking</li>
            <li> Do not stop applications until there is no more scabbing.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how it helped with the cancer of some .</li>
            <li> I had two small patches of pre cancer under my lip and two patches on my arm.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Raspex cream appears to be doing a good job of clearing-up my skin. Might be a little early (1st container of the product) to clearly indicate the effectiveness but so far I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I was hoping after reading the reviews on this product to get some favorable results on my sunspots. I did nothing for them at all!!!&lt;br /&gt;To bad as I had high hopes because I don&#x27;t want to use the &amp;#34;radical&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;harse&amp;#34; treatments the dermatologist are recommending...&lt;br /&gt;I will keep searching!!!</li>
            <li> We are very prone to basal skin cancer in my family and this product has saved us from a lot of pain, discomfort and radiation treatments.  It works bit by bit, forming a clear scab over the affected area.  Apply at least three times a day or more if you possibily can.  The more you apply, the faster the cancer will disappear.  Do not stop applications until there is no more scabbing.  You will have beautiful skin underneath.</li>
            <li> IM CONVINCED now that it does work very well and pretty quickly after SEVERAL WEEKS OF USE.....I started using this again on some precancerous spots and some  brown spots and moles on neck and found that it did make the precancerous ones worse before they got better and are healing to a softer pink skin rather than sore red and scabby spots...I also noticed  some keratosis on my neck hands and trunk lightened after only a few applications.  I just purchased some of the powder capsules and a new jar of cream to use.  I can hardly wait to see the results!! I would contact the company direct if you are doubting this products worthiness. They ship for free!!  The owner is very nice and helpful regarding all of his products.</li>
            <li> I like this product and will continue to use it due to some precancerous spots I have.  However it doesn&#x27;t go on skin easily and it is a little difficult to get out of jar as it is slippery. I do wish they used a pump bottle. I can&#x27;t say I have seen any significant improvement, but will use for another month or two and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Just got it and so far so good.  Has a good consistency but will need use longer to be sure of its benefits.  However, I am impressed over the first few days use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Raspex products for the past couple of years now and no other product out there can compete with the laundry list of benefits. I noticed results quickly such as fine line reduction,faded sun spots and my pores seemed to tighten or decrease in size. I NEVER write reviews, but after my experience using the cream on my mom&#x27;s skin cancer spot, I decided a review was the least I could do. My mom had a mole removed that was cancerous. The doctor wanted her to come in for surgery as soon as possible given the details in the pathology report. She was visiting me from out of town and the earliest she could get back in for surgery would have been one week after the mole was removed. I applied the cream during her visit to the area where the mole was removed and when she went in for her surgery a week later, they decided to cancel surgery and reevaluate in 2 weeks. The surgeon was shocked at the improvement of the affected area and determined that it may \\&quot;self-correct\\&quot; given the improvement over the course of the first week. I don&#x27;t know if I should credit this miracle to God, Raspex or both! 2 weeks have yet to pass and she may still need surgery, but it seems Raspex is playing a positive role. Regardless, I&#x27;m a firm believer and cheerleader for Raspex and will be using it exclusively for my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I would have rated this a 5 based on performance, but I am not thrilled with the fact that it contains parabens.  I have been advised by the company that it&#x27;s considerably less than most products that contain parabens, like 1/50,0000th of the usual amount.  It is literally THE only skin cream in my 37 years of life that does not cause acne for me.  I have tried everything.  My skin is smooth and tight after application, the perfect foundation for my mineral make-up.  I don&#x27;t have any cancerous spots on my face, so I can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s ability to treat skin cancer.  There is skin cancer in the family though and I hope this helps with prevention while it&#x27;s making my skin so soft, would be an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Others have said that this product can help your body to heal from cancerous lesions. I can say from my own personal experience; it can and it does! I had a lesion form on my neck, I applied this product on it, toward the end of my second jar, the lesion began to disappear; at the beginning of the third jar, it had all but completely disappeared. To say that I am very pleased and thankful is almost an understatement! I am very pleased to highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. Apply it at least once a day to that annoying \\&quot;thing\\&quot; on your face, hand or wherever, and watch it shrink day by day until it&#x27;s gone. Sure beats having the dermatologist \\&quot;shave\\&quot; it or burn it off with what looks like a soldering iron. SMDI.org is very focused on the active ingredient (raspberry seed flour, and I have also purchased capsules of just the active ingredient from them. Great product and great company.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream for skin tags and itchy bumps.  The reason for the 4 star rating is that you have to reapply several times per day.</li>
            <li> I had a cancer growth on my arm, put this on it 3 times a day for two months. It looked worse for awhile but kept it up and after 2 months it fell off. 25$ is a lot less than what it would cost to have it removed by a doctor.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my face but also started using on my hands where I had a red bump for several years that dermatologist said she could remove surgically but was not necessary.  The bump totally disappeared after using cream for a few months.  I find this amazing and highly recommend this cream.  (works great on face too)</li>
            <li> When I bought the first pot of this cream I didn&#x27;t have a specific purpose in mind. I read all the great reviews and I thought it might be good for my skin. I&#x27;m pale and don&#x27;t deal well with the sun so I was very happy when after a few weeks of using Raspex at night my sun spots had started to fade, and unexpected bonus,my pores looked smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Then I was talking to my mom and she mentioned a sore on her face that she had had for a year. My mom has rosacea so I hadn&#x27;t even noticed it. I looked at it and it was aprox. 1/4\\&quot; by 1\\&quot;. I told her she needed to use this cream I had. That was five days ago and the sore is pretty much gone. She applied the cream multiple times a day and says there is just a little redness left. She isn&#x27;t anywhere near finished with the first pot, but I just bought a second because I want to make sure she has it available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar (which is almost gone) and I&#x27;m just not noticing any change yet.  I use it 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this product but it failed as it caused lots of acne and oil on my face</li>
            <li> I STARTED USING THE CREAM ABOUT 3 WEEKS AGO THE ONLY CHANGE IN MY SKIN MY FRECKLES HAVE BECOME LIGHTER. MY SKIN A LITTLE FIRMER.</li>
            <li> Works ok but if I order any more I like the kind with the sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> This skin cream is fine, but probably not as good as Murad.</li>
            <li> Great cream.....I have rated this before and am continuing to enjoy it on my chest which has seen way too much sun!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! My skin feels and looks so much softer than with any other moisturizer I have used. I recommended it to a friend who also is very pleased with the results she is getting. She has recommended it to several others.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about one month and I really like the way it goes on and feels on my face. Use very little for one application, my skin is looking&lt;br /&gt;healthier and I do believe it has helped some with my AK and other sun spots. I plan to continue using this, it is as good as any face cream I have ever bought&lt;br /&gt;regardless of price.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lotions. Helps with age spots and dark spots. Smells Amazon too.</li>
            <li> We just started using this but it seems to work real well.My wife had a small cancerous spot on her nose removed and now she is applying this to the spot and it seems to be working real good.The scarring is going away everyday.Great product,Joe and Diane Cooper</li>
            <li> I have heard many great things about this face cream.....so i purchased it in hopes.that it would at least decrease my very noticeable sun spot on the side of my face......i have been using.it how for a month and have seen no results!  i am continuing to use it in hopes of a change!</li>
            <li> I read reviews and expected dramatic results as some customers indicated.  I have lipomas on my ankles.  The cream and the pills did not change the size of them at all.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well, I think it exfoliated my face too much when I put it on with coconut oil what looked like a lot of skin started coming off as I was rubbing, leaving my face dry for a few days, but I had a brown spot on my white skin which looked to be the beginning signs of skin cancer and wanted to take care of it before it got worse as I got older, it was a very dry patch of skin and every time I use it it got better, hardly dry now as even I do not use it regularly because I forget, but even though I believe it is working, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful and for the price, too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;soft young skin, takes age spots off, my skin look fresh. softens lines under eyes.&lt;br /&gt;and lighten up dark circles under eyes.</li>
            <li> Did not notice a difference yet after a month of using it. Not sure how it helped with the cancer of some . Will continue to use it till it&#x27;s gone but right now nothing to report.</li>
            <li> Second jar for  me and good results. Have applied to carcinoma and operation not necessary.. Will continue to use as needed.</li>
            <li> Raspex raspberry skin cream is awesome.  People have asked me what I am using on my face.  You can see the difference.</li>
            <li> My husband has found this cream especially useful in helping his skin cancer.  It is a gentle formula and can be used on most problem skin areas.</li>
            <li> This is a newer version than I have been using,I use the Raspex skin gel with spf 30 sunscreen.I work outdoors for a living and skin cancer is almost unavoidable for me.This gel really does work.It has removed pre-cancerous and even cancerous spots for me.The key is that you have to use it ALOT..like 3-4 times a day if possible and everyday,it takes about 6-8 wks for it to do its job.&lt;br /&gt;It has worked for me plus it&#x27;s great on sunburns and burns.I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My sister had basal cell cancer on her face and used Raspex Cream.  It removed the cancer completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my family we all have fair skin and are prone to skin cancer, pre-cancer spots and brown spots.  I had pre-cancerous areas on my forehead and my doctor recommended seeing a Dermatologist.  It was a two month wait and my sister suggested Raspex cream.  I ordered a few jars and started using it as suggested.  Well, my patches disappeared completely. I could feel my skin tighten with constant use and love the feel of my face. Now, it doesn&#x27;t happen over night but it does work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that brown spots and freckles faded on my face.  My next order will be for my legs as I have little brown spots that are raised and I want to try it on those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is so economical and the best product ever!  You won&#x27;t regret your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April</li>
            <li> The Product was as described, fast shipping. Will have to write in a month about product its self on how it works. Thank you, looking forward to results.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of this skin cream and it heals your skin even if you don&#x27;t have skin cancer. I was using this as a regular skin moisturizer. One time I had gotten my face waxed but since I have sensitive skin I had burned marks all over my face. I had to let 2 days go by to let my skin rest then after I started applying the cream. My skin healed and the dark over pigmentation was gone. Also, this cream did not break me out at all and I would also apply it on the top of my hands before I go to bed. I&#x27;m still young but I will say that my hands look refreshed and soft after the first night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that(I could be wrong) but I feel the price went up since I first purchased the creams. I&#x27;d say about 5 months ago. I&#x27;m going to see if I can find another product that works as well.</li>
            <li> Time will tell , so far , after 2 weeks , nothing has faded yet or disappeared but the lotion smells good and has a lovely feel as it goes onto the face and hands, hopefully sun spot and brown spots will be a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> This cream is perfect for brown spots.  It takes a while, but after consistent use, the spots have lightened and a few have disappeared altogether.</li>
            <li> NIce product as far as having a wonderful smell and feel to it. I do believe it tones skin and has benefits we might not see, however, as for an anti-cancer product I think it&#x27;s a bit overated. Not a bad product, but not sensational either. I may try it again, but at a later date. I will shop around for other products to try as well.</li>
            <li> Had a red spot on one ear lobe that almost completely disappeared with the use of the cream at least twice a day.  As far as the pre cancerous spot on the other ear, it did nothing.  That is now under treatment.  The cream itself is smooth and a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The only face cream I will use.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my brother-in-law.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as other raspberry products I have used ...the odor is why I stopped using and w expensive !</li>
            <li> same as fpor the other product.</li>
            <li> Really did not notice any difference</li>
            <li> It smells great, and goes on smoothly. The texture is lovely. That being said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can really only give this 3 stars, as I did not have any issues with it, but I did not see any great results from it, either. I purchased it to help a place on my husband&#x27;s head - some type of growth that he had. It was soothing and gentle, but we did not think it seemed to help dimish it, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am perfectly willing to revise my review, even to the point of changing it to a 5-star review, if I see any reason to in the future.</li>
            <li> I have a skin cancer on my nose and it is slowly healing, this product works as advertised. Thank You</li>
            <li> I used this product on my face because I read it was good for skin cancer so far I used 2 jars and it seemed to be fading slowly I was diagnose with CTCL and was not sure if this is the right one for it. But  it seems to be working,I will purchase some more a litter later. It is a little costly for me but I will surely buy some more very soon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about a month.  I had two small patches of pre cancer under my lip and two patches on my arm. One patch on my arm is gone the other areas are almost gone. I have to go back to the derm on june 1st  cant wait to see what she says.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for lines and wrinkles. All gone... just great.</li>
            <li> found it dried out my skin</li>
