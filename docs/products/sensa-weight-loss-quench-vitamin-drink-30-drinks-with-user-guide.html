    <ol>
            <li> I love it and price is right</li>
            <li> This product is very very affective. . It works wonders if you want something to curb your appetite</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. I prefer the Berry flavor.</li>
            <li> Packets did not come in original, unopened box. They came loose, repackaged in a shipping box without original packaging. Individual packets seem to be authentic, though.</li>
            <li> Another nasty drink by Sensa</li>
            <li> I do not believe this is the real product. Packets come in a ziploc freezer bag. The do not taste the same as when they were available in the store or directly through Amazon. There is no original packaging. No expiration dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews before I purchased and I did see the other customers mention the packaging issue. I thought maybe it would be ok though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use Sensa for weight loss or appetite suppression. I use it for insomnia. It is the only product that ever helped me. Of course, the FDA made Sensa stop making their products because they were a scam and did not have any weight loss properties at all. I do not care about the weight loss aspect, so I was hoping to find some sellers who had product left since it cannot be bought in a legitimate store anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff worked miracles for me for insomnia. All of the vitamins in it regulated something in my body and I could finally sleep, after years and years of not being able to. This is why I decided to go ahead and order from this company (loseweightnow) despite the reviews about the packaging issues. Basically, I was desperate and hoping to stock up for a while so I can continue to sleep well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a mistake because these do not seem like the real Sensa at all. The way they mix with the water, the flavor, and most of all, the bonafide way I can tell is that my insomnia is back when I drink them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend buying them even if you&#x27;re desperate like I was. Unfortunately, I bought 4 packs. A waste.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, especially when you are working out and begin to feel depleted and dehydrated.</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with my weight and this has helped me to control my hunger and it gives me the energy I need to get my workouts done. I honestly love this and have told all my friends and family about it .</li>
            <li> Like the flavor and convenience. Don&#x27;t quite believe the weight loss claims or the price.</li>
            <li> Always comes thru for me when I&#x27;m almost out, use all the time especially when I&#x27;m flying to keep my going since I&#x27;m a flight attendant and need energy. Arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these for any kind of weight loss, I just use it to flavor water as I don&#x27;t like straight water. They do the job, taste fine.</li>
            <li> Great Product and great service when I bought it from Loseweightnow.</li>
            <li> Lumpy in packets, not sure if it was old and that&#x27;s why &amp; there was no user guide even though it&#x27;s advertised that way.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> The product is lumpy and does not stir well, it stays in clumps.</li>
            <li> i use half a tube at lunch time...and i think i feel refreshed when i get back to work.&lt;br /&gt;and i like the flavor, too.</li>
            <li> great product and great pricing.  It was shipped quickly.  very happy with transaction</li>
            <li> Love the taste of these.  Not sure they really give me energy and do not help with weight loss but the taste is great!</li>
            <li> I guess if it had been any other flavor besides orange,it would have been good&lt;br /&gt;3 stars</li>
