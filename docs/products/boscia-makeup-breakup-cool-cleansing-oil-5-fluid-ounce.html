            <li>This is the best make up remover I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>one of the things I love best about this is that it is the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It did a great job of getting rid of my waterproof makeup, but it just clung to my skin like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly the best face wash</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly one of the best cleansing products I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m amazed at how well it cleans eye makeup.</li>
            <li>It worked surprisingly well</li>
            <li>and I LOVED it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for awhile and find that I tend to return to it (a good sign).</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I checked the price at Sephora, it&#x27;s $26 there, so save your money!</li>
            <li>I had tried making my own cleansing oil at home for a while</li>
            <li>Nice for eye make up removal because it is so oily.</li>
            <li>The scent is kind of minty</li>
            <li>If you wear a full face of makeup every day, this is a great product to dissolve it all away at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>and it worked okay,</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE</li>
            <li>the scent was OK</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>but so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I have to massage the oil for 30 seconds more when trying to remove eye makeup compared to the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>The thing I like most about this product is it doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>but when I do, I make sure I use this to take it off.</li>
            <li>product is gentle on my acne prone skin and very effective at removing all traces of makeup/dirt on my face.</li>
            <li>Of course I wish I didn&#x27;t have a two-step cleansing routine - but so far, this process works the best to clean everything off of my face before I go to sleep.  </li>
            <li>Using it twice gets you very clean, but witchhazel as a toner is cheaper.</li>
            <li>It removes make up and grime easily without causing any dryness.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use just a pea sized amount</li>
            <li>I bought this cleansing oil since Shu Uemura is no longer available in the US.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t really enjoy the product because the pumper was not working</li>
            <li>it will leave your face clean and oil free without being drying.</li>
            <li>I like it very much and will order more.</li>
            <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve use eye makeup removers from Sonia Kashuk, Mary Kay, Neutrogena, and Lancome, and this is hands-down the best for removing stubborn eye products.  </li>
            <li>oil is super light.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really clean my waterproof makeups in one time.</li>
            <li>The eucalyptus oil and menthol really just leave a very light tingle, and they don&#x27;t burn or sting your skin or eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this tingled in a refreshing way.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling good, very neutral, not dry, not oily.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean and soft after I cleanse and wash my face.</li>
            <li>But when I&#x27;m done cleansing, it washes right off the skin leaving no residue.  </li>
            <li>cleans really well and rinse off clean.</li>
            <li>The ingredients were clean and I have super sensitive skin, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on your skin and keeps you from tugging and scrubbing to remove makeup.</li>
            <li>Overall fantastic product!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m halfway through my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>This Boscia oil had received stellar reviews here and on the Sephora website, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I then rinse it off, and use a second cleanser, just to be sure that everything is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so needless to say this is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any water at first.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It cuts right through my waterproof makeup so gently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dry skin too because even though it doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all, I also don&#x27;t end up with that super tight feeling when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was really good at getting the BULK off long lasting foundation, eye make-up, everything.</li>
            <li>It is very greasy.</li>
            <li>Boscia Make-Up oil is really gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>It removes the toughest eyemakeup gently and doesn&#x27;t require vigorous rubbing and scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>It glides gently over your skin and leaves you with the lightest layer of moisture after you wash it off.  </li>
            <li>I put a few pumps into my hand and then massage my face then rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>Amazon, I love you - but you can find this product elsewhere for substantially less money.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had a little bit of acne fighter in it, but I just apply a little afterwards and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this at night, and my normal cleanser in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and reactive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have sensitive skin that reacts easily to new products, I had been worried about the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; aspect of this product.  </li>
            <li>Wow, was I surprised!</li>
            <li>If you have dry or oily, sensitive, problem skin its worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually gotten this yet, I&#x27;m about to order because I hear it&#x27;s really good at getting off makeup without irritating sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for some odd reason, the price on this is really high right now on Amazon, so I bought mine</li>
            <li>I use this product first, then follow up with a second traditional cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin sometimes on the dry side.</li>
            <li>For the last three years, I&#x27;ve been using DHC cleansing oil, but when I started getting low on my last bottle, I thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li>Did not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m taking off all my makeup, I just use this all over my face, but if I only need to take off my eye makeup, I use a half pump on my fingertips, and then massage it gently over my eye areas and either rinse or remove the makeup with a cotton pad.  </li>

            <li> and this helps to soothe it after a long day being covered by make up.  </li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin</li>
            <li> You use this on dry skin, and massage it into your face and eyes, where it breaks up all your makeup.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the DGC oil, which, when used on my eyes left me unable to see and with greasy eyelashes, this removes all your makeup and washes right off, with no leftover oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Especially if you wear makeup everyday.</li>
            <li> Look at makeup/beauty storefront places that sell a wide variety of brands.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try some other products from this line.</li>
            <li> Other products need a lot of scrubbing.</li>
            <li> and I can smell the slight eucalyptus scent too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant</li>
            <li> but it was so heavy.  </li>
            <li> and it became visibly lighter after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how it seemed to melt away my heavy duty makeup.</li>
            <li> No more scrubbing on my eyes to get mascara off.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always been lazy about removing makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe it can foam up without water, but it does.  </li>
            <li> and I got sick of buying cream cleansers only to find out that they were loaded with menthol and didn&#x27;t do anything to remove my waterproof makeup.  </li>
            <li> It works so well to remove mascara, which is usually so difficult.  </li>
            <li> I brought the package set and was skeptical about using an oil to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it, since it had oil in the title</li>
            <li> I used the Bobbi Brown cleansing oil for quite some time and it worked well but was stinging my eyes like crazy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got a recommendation for this from Sephora and have been using it ever since.  It works so well to remove mascara, which is usually so difficult.  It&#x27;s hard to believe it can foam up without water, but it does.  I plan on continuing to use this.  Very gentle.</li>
            <li> I brought the package set and was skeptical about using an oil to cleanse my face. I have normal skin sometimes on the dry side. Wow, was I surprised! The oil definitely breaks up the makeup. It worked surprisingly well and I did not have to rub my face, just massage the oil around my face and rinse with water. As well as this product works I still want to cleanse my face since I use an oil sometimes as a moisturizer at night. Overall fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin and I got sick of buying cream cleansers only to find out that they were loaded with menthol and didn&#x27;t do anything to remove my waterproof makeup.  I had tried making my own cleansing oil at home for a while and it worked okay, but it was so heavy.  It did a great job of getting rid of my waterproof makeup, but it just clung to my skin like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit I tried the Boscia product just because it was the cheapest of the pre packaged oil based cleansers I could find.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for a little over a month and I&#x27;m halfway through my first bottle.  I use this product daily.  I absolutely LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is super light.  It cuts right through my waterproof makeup so gently. No more scrubbing on my eyes to get mascara off.  It just dissolves with this stuff.  But when I&#x27;m done cleansing, it washes right off the skin leaving no residue.  It&#x27;s great for dry skin too because even though it doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all, I also don&#x27;t end up with that super tight feeling when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleansing oil since Shu Uemura is no longer available in the US. The ingredients were clean and I have super sensitive skin, so I gave it a try. I like this product a lot and am already on my 2nd bottle. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> For the last three years, I&#x27;ve been using DHC cleansing oil, but when I started getting low on my last bottle, I thought I&#x27;d try something new. This Boscia oil had received stellar reviews here and on the Sephora website, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It&#x27;s honestly the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleansing oils are usually meant to be used as the first step in a double-washing process, and that&#x27;s how I use them.  You use this on dry skin, and massage it into your face and eyes, where it breaks up all your makeup.  I then rinse it off, and use a second cleanser, just to be sure that everything is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have sensitive skin that reacts easily to new products, I had been worried about the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; aspect of this product.  The eucalyptus oil and menthol really just leave a very light tingle, and they don&#x27;t burn or sting your skin or eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, one of the things I love best about this is that it is the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used.  In the past, I&#x27;ve use eye makeup removers from Sonia Kashuk, Mary Kay, Neutrogena, and Lancome, and this is hands-down the best for removing stubborn eye products.  Unlike the DGC oil, which, when used on my eyes left me unable to see and with greasy eyelashes, this removes all your makeup and washes right off, with no leftover oily feeling.  If I&#x27;m taking off all my makeup, I just use this all over my face, but if I only need to take off my eye makeup, I use a half pump on my fingertips, and then massage it gently over my eye areas and either rinse or remove the makeup with a cotton pad.  Since I bought this, I feel like I won&#x27;t need to purchase separate eye makeup removers any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for some odd reason, the price on this is really high right now on Amazon, so I bought mine elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this ten stars if I could!  It&#x27;s honestly one of the best cleansing products I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m amazed at how well it cleans eye makeup.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t really enjoy the product because the pumper was not working so i have to open the cap to use it.  the scent was OK but it didn&#x27;t really clean my waterproof makeups in one time.</li>
            <li> love this product. cleans really well and rinse off clean.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift last Christmas.  I was afraid to use it, since it had oil in the title and I break out often.  When I was out of cleanser I finally decided to give it a try.  It removes make up and grime easily without causing any dryness.  And to my suprise, my skin started clearing up within 2 days of using it.  I&#x27;ve been using this at night, and my normal cleanser in the morning.  I can&#x27;t wait to try some other products from this line.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve always been lazy about removing makeup so I wanted to find a product that can cleanse and remove makeup at the same time. I stumbled upon this product when I visited Sephora Singapore and one of the sales agent suggested the said product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use just a pea sized amount and then rub it all over your face and then cleanse it with water. I thought this product would leave my pores clogged cause its a cleansing oil but it does wonders to the skin. My mom has sun spots on her cheeks and it became visibly lighter after a few weeks of use. Plus it does thoroughly removes the makeup even some of the waterproof eye makeup and liners.</li>
            <li> Nice for eye make up removal because it is so oily. But for the price I could use baby oil. It is very greasy.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it. Especially if you wear makeup everyday. It is very gentle on your skin and keeps you from tugging and scrubbing to remove makeup. Also works as a regular face wash.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin.  I used to use vaseline to remove my make up.  Well never again.  This is the best make up remover I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin or my allergies.  I was a little reluctant but so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> im a dedicated boscia user. so needless to say this is wonderful! it will leave your face clean and oil free without being drying.</li>
            <li> Boscia Make-Up oil is really gentle on my skin. A little bit goes a long way. I like it very much and will order more.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely helps remove my makeup. It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. I wish it had a little bit of acne fighter in it, but I just apply a little afterwards and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> I use this product every night.  It removes the toughest eyemakeup gently and doesn&#x27;t require vigorous rubbing and scrubbing.  It glides gently over your skin and leaves you with the lightest layer of moisture after you wash it off.  I have very sensitive and reactive skin and this helps to soothe it after a long day being covered by make up.  I have yet to meet a Boscia product I do not like!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to face cleanser. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I&#x27;ve used it every night for years and it removes all traces of makeup, sunscreen, everything.</li>
            <li> I used the Bobbi Brown cleansing oil for quite some time and it worked well but was stinging my eyes like crazy. So I was on a hunt for a different cleansing oil. I read the reviews on the Boscia cleansing oil and decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is gentle on my acne prone skin and very effective at removing all traces of makeup/dirt on my face. I have to massage the oil for 30 seconds more when trying to remove eye makeup compared to the rest of my face. My skin feels very clean and soft after I cleanse and wash my face. The scent is kind of minty and I can smell the slight eucalyptus scent too. The thing I like most about this product is it doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my eyes. I would definitely repurchase this product and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have problem skin and don&#x27;t wear makeup often but when I do, I make sure I use this to take it off. I don&#x27;t use any water at first. I put a few pumps into my hand and then massage my face then rinse with warm water. Wala! Makeup has disappeared!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually gotten this yet, I&#x27;m about to order because I hear it&#x27;s really good at getting off makeup without irritating sensitive skin. I am SO glad I checked the price at Sephora, it&#x27;s $26 there, so save your money! Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s almost double here!!    Edit. Had time to use this and I LOVED it. It was really good at getting the BULK off long lasting foundation, eye make-up, everything. I have very sensitive skin and this tingled in a refreshing way. Still had to use at minimum a toner to get any remaining residue from makeup, but this saved a lot of time. Using it twice gets you very clean, but witchhazel as a toner is cheaper. Did not dry my skin. I was amazed at how it seemed to melt away my heavy duty makeup. Other products need a lot of scrubbing. If you have dry or oily, sensitive, problem skin its worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for awhile and find that I tend to return to it (a good sign). It&#x27;s reliable, thoroughly cleansing, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts (for me). Leaves skin feeling good, very neutral, not dry, not oily.</li>
            <li> If you wear a full face of makeup every day, this is a great product to dissolve it all away at the end of the day.  I use this product first, then follow up with a second traditional cleanser.  Of course I wish I didn&#x27;t have a two-step cleansing routine - but so far, this process works the best to clean everything off of my face before I go to sleep.  (PS: Amazon, I love you - but you can find this product elsewhere for substantially less money.  Look at makeup/beauty storefront places that sell a wide variety of brands.  I won&#x27;t name drop, but the one I&#x27;m thinking of is in basically every mall in America.)</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about 5 years now. Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Doesn&#x27;t break me out at all.</li>
