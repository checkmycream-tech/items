            <li>Wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Freeman products are awesome.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product!</li>
            <li>And the hydration lasts, which is the best part.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST night-mask.</li>
            <li>My skin is happy and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>Great for some people, but not for me.</li>
            <li>It smells so good</li>
            <li>However, it smells great and is super moisturizing at a great price point, so I&#x27;ll continue to happily use it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>LOVE this mask!</li>
            <li>Lovely stuff!</li>
            <li>Freeman products are amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing sort of amazing.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery and Very Good Product!</li>
            <li>Also, it made me break out terribly, so it&#x27;s not even good lotion.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Very light fragrance, perfect, not heavy.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this mask.</li>
            <li>Refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love Freeman products.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this mask.</li>
            <li>It goes on creamy and is easily distributed over the skin so you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li>I simultaneously really like this lotion and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s amazing as others are stating.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>My skin, is always smooth, and hydrated when I wake in the morning.</li>
            <li>Feels smooth on the skin and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This mask though, it&#x27;s something special.</li>
            <li>The smell is a light, fresh, honeydew scent but is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I also hoped it would help to calm my redness/rosacea.</li>
            <li>How exactly are you supposed to wash off something that has absorbed into your skin?  </li>
            <li>I only rated 3 stars because had higher expectations for a more youthful, even complexion in the morning.</li>
            <li>Amazing mask, I use a benzoyl peroxide acne wash at night that really dries my skin out when i started using this mask and it has helped so much to counter the dry skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that the active ingredients are all at the top of the list, not just added as minor ingredients so the company can make xyz claims on the label.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more as long as they keep selling them.</li>
            <li>This would be a great product for people suffering from dry skin or patches of dry skin.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily the next morning</li>
            <li>Very calming.</li>
            <li>It really hydrates and soothes.</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing</li>
            <li>and it really hydrates my skin while I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li>My skin has been disconsolate this winter, and this has been very helpful.</li>
            <li>It absolutely moisturizes the skin and doesn&#x27;t make the oily patches breakout.</li>
            <li>Although the vitamin C heavy toner, serum, and moisturizer I use are great for my skin tone and wrinkles, my skin does get dry.</li>
            <li>and oh my gosh does the skin feel soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and it has done nothing but moisturize and soften my already soft and fairly normal skin.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive way to keep my skin feeling young.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a lotion; I have no idea how they can claim this to be a &amp;#34;masque.&amp;#34; It also stings my sensitive eyes if I get it anywhere near them.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft in the morning.</li>

            <li> Inexpensive way to keep my skin feeling young.</li>
            <li> Freeman products are amazing. No doubt about that. This mask though, it&#x27;s something special. I have really dry skin and it&#x27;s been impossible to find anything that makes my skin feel hydrated. I stumbled upon this and had to try it considering I&#x27;ve tried everything else. This product is nothing sort of amazing. I wash my face as usual and then put this on. Sleep, wake up, and wash it off. My skin is happy and hydrated. It smells so yummy too. Very calming. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more as long as they keep selling them. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery and Very Good Product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have really dry skin and this mask helps moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> The directions say, &amp;#34;Apply generously and let it absorb into your skin before going to bed.  Wash off in the morning.&amp;#34;  How exactly are you supposed to wash off something that has absorbed into your skin?  That makes absolutely no sense.  It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; at all, it&#x27;s just lotion and should be advertised as such.  Also, it made me break out terribly, so it&#x27;s not even good lotion.  All of the people down-voting my review probably work for Freeman.</li>
            <li> I simultaneously really like this lotion and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s amazing as others are stating. Yes, it&#x27;s a lotion; I have no idea how they can claim this to be a &amp;#34;masque.&amp;#34; It also stings my sensitive eyes if I get it anywhere near them. However, it smells great and is super moisturizing at a great price point, so I&#x27;ll continue to happily use it.</li>
            <li> Amazing mask, I use a benzoyl peroxide acne wash at night that really dries my skin out when i started using this mask and it has helped so much to counter the dry skin!</li>
            <li> Beso thing I could have bought</li>
            <li> Love this mask. Leaves my skin soft and supple. I have very dry skin and it&#x27;s hard for me to even wear makeup because it flakes off. It helps, can&#x27;t use it every day but still helps on the days I don&#x27;t get to use it.</li>
            <li> Refreshing. I love Freeman products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It really hydrates and soothes. Freeman products are awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells so good and I put it on before bed and sleep all night with it on. My face feels so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this mask. It is very relaxing and it really hydrates my skin while I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Great stuff I use it every night.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mask! Although the vitamin C heavy toner, serum, and moisturizer I use are great for my skin tone and wrinkles, my skin does get dry. This stuff is fantastic. The smell is a light, fresh, honeydew scent but is not overpowering. It goes on creamy and is easily distributed over the skin so you don&#x27;t need a lot. It does take a little while to completely absorb and it tingles slightly as it dries, but once dry you don&#x27;t even know you have it on. It washes off easily the next morning and oh my gosh does the skin feel soft! And the hydration lasts, which is the best part. I will only need to use this once or maybe twice a week.</li>
            <li> Feels smooth on the skin and absorbs quickly. Very light fragrance, perfect, not heavy. I have sensitive, moody skin, and appreciate that this doesn&#x27;t make mine angry. It&#x27;s also nice that the active ingredients are all at the top of the list, not just added as minor ingredients so the company can make xyz claims on the label. My skin has been disconsolate this winter, and this has been very helpful. Lovely stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST night-mask. My skin, is always smooth, and hydrated when I wake in the morning. I suggest you use Burts Bees Radiance serum before you start your morning routine. Also, 2x a week, used a clay mask on your face/body/Hair. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> It smells great and absorbs quickly. It absolutely moisturizes the skin and doesn&#x27;t make the oily patches breakout. This would be a great product for people suffering from dry skin or patches of dry skin. I only rated 3 stars because had higher expectations for a more youthful, even complexion in the morning. I also hoped it would help to calm my redness/rosacea. I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and it has done nothing but moisturize and soften my already soft and fairly normal skin. Great for some people, but not for me. I notice no difference in my overall complexion and I will not purchase the mask again.</li>
