            <li>You get plenty if it&#x27;s for yourself, and they&#x27;re handy if you clip them to a pocket in your bag or have them around your room at your convenience.</li>
            <li>I got these for summer I will need my hair out of my eyes at the beach, etc, so I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they will&amp;#34;fit the bill&amp;#34; nicely.</li>

            <li>I love these clips.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic!</li>
            <li>These work great, are very affordable.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy and great quality.</li>
            <li>Shipping was prompt and I love these for blowouts, sectioning, holding rollers in place, pin curling as I style hair, and even more.</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>I will order more when needed.</li>
            <li>The top and bottom &amp;#34;bills&amp;#34; don&#x27;t align when you close them and have to be adjusted every time.</li>
            <li>These clips are great and hold it up very well.</li>
            <li>Nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t love these clips for 5 bucks?  </li>
            <li>Better to use these clips instead of bands.</li>
            <li>I would probably use them more often if I had time to fuss.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I like that they have holes along the top</li>
            <li>Pleased with my purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The are nicely arched, making them comfortable against the scalp.</li>
            <li>I recommend using these :)</li>
            <li>The set is perfect for the rollers I ordered at the same time.</li>
            <li>Okay, they&#x27;re duck clips.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for holding hair back and pinning it out of the way.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Stronger and more well built than others I&#x27;ve used but</li>
            <li>These clips are just okay; maybe it is the way they are shaped but they seem to want to get stuck in my hair and aren&#x27;t quite as easy as I thought they would be to use.</li>
            <li>I wish it would fit more snug at the top.</li>
            <li>Great price, just as good as any other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I am happy with these so far.  </li>
            <li>Make sure they go in smoothly</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Either keep the box to store them or give them a special place because they will disappear!</li>
            <li>The seller was fantastic as well, I got these very quickly. :)</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Not glitz and glamor, but easy to sanitize and throw away and replace as needed.</li>
            <li>Easy to use clips .</li>
            <li>They also rust easily.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to take off without pulling hair out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, especially the price :-).</li>
            <li>but they are strong and well made.</li>
            <li>These are strong and sturdy and get the job done.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those who are finding good hair clips</li>
            <li>Good grip high quality for an inexpensive product.</li>
            <li>I LIKED THEM,  my first purchase revealed quality.  </li>
            <li>These work fine for the purpose intended - to hold parts of my hair as I blow-dry.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just fine.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased and shipping was decently quick.</li>
            <li>Every girl needs these type of clips, they&#x27;re very useful and easy to use for adults as well as when doing kids hair.</li>
            <li>I also like that they are nice and large.</li>
            <li>your duck bill clips \\&quot;fit</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great to section short hair too.</li>
            <li>These clips are useful for so many things.  </li>
            <li>These work great to hold hair back and out of way or to hold curls, etc, in place.  </li>
            <li>They work great for smaller sections of hair.</li>
            <li>However, overall a great product.</li>
            <li>hair stays in place which is great especially when you&#x27;re blowing out or ironing your hair!</li>
            <li>Great purchase and definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li>These duck bill clips fit the bill (no pun intended) to a T...</li>
            <li>They are very useful for pinning hair up when you blowdry or style, but they aren&#x27;t resistant to rusting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so gentle and non-creasing as well, and super cheap to boot!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very cheaply made and snag your hairs, which is exactly the thing you want to avoid when clipping your hair up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they made them available at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these because they are super cheap and they work very well.</li>
            <li>I (Auggies owner) enjoy wearing flowers in my hair and have been looking for a reseptical that allows me to hot glue them onto - for quick comfortable insertion and</li>
            <li>I would suggest ones with better gripping for holding larger sections of hair.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and just as described.</li>
            <li>If I had only bought these to pin my hair back, they would probably be perfect, but I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I grab one when I get home and shove them right into my bangs to hold them out of the way while I clean for a bit before I make dinner.</li>
            <li>I have really long hair, and these clip it back perfectly so that I can style my hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I use the butterfly clips more, but these come in handy when my hairs straight or dry</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant on these clips but because of the great reviews I bought them.</li>
            <li>Considering my hair is smooth and straight, it wasn&#x27;t like my hair was all over the place and got caught in a freak</li>
            <li>These clips were amazing, I only need a couple to put up my hair for an at home blowout!</li>
            <li>(keep this in mind if you have a sensitive scalp), but overall great duck bill clips.</li>
            <li>I paid $3.24 shipped for the duck bills, and they were well worth the price.</li>
            <li>every other kind of clip or hair tie does, so that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li>but they all right out sheet 2 minutes or</li>
            <li>These clips are wonderful, i am natural 4c and have really thick hair I sooo need to put it into sections to work with</li>
            <li>These clips attache very nicely to the hat bases and clip hair very firmly.</li>
            <li>well when I just need to get my hair out of the way, they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>These work great and were the least inexpensive I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>Overall I am glad I bought them and would buy again.</li>
            <li>Dose exactly what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was looking for to section off my hair during styling.</li>
            <li>These clips do exactly what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li>it holds the hair very well!</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li>No more, no less.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know what else to say, but 5 more words were required to submit my rating.  :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for YEARS, I used to use elastics to section my hair but using these makes life so much easier!</li>
            <li>First time ever that any clip could&lt;br /&gt;Hold</li>
            <li>These clips are exactly what you&#x27;d expect them to be.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty curly</li>
            <li>Unfortunately no matter how I tried to angle it, the clip wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair.</li>
            <li>NOW I see a significant price increase without anything more on their part to warrant such an action.  </li>
            <li>They are the right size and are made very well.  </li>
            <li>It makes hair drying go so much faster and curling so much easier!  </li>
            <li>But clips are curved and seem pretty gentle on hair.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t snag or get caught like pretty much</li>
            <li>These are okay, don&#x27;t start in my hair very long.</li>
            <li>The clips slide out easily and have gotten stuck and tangled in my hair several times.</li>
            <li>I bought them to use it with velcro rollers, but may find better use sectioning out my hair for blowing it dry.</li>
            <li>Large velcor-type hair rollers kept falling out of my hair before I was done setting it.</li>
            <li>The Duck Bill Hair Clips are great, they hold a decent amount of hair (I have very 26inches of straight thick hair) ...</li>
            <li>They are strong and big and really hold my hair.</li>
            <li>These clips are amazing at holding your hair back (or up for straightening purposes) and are so simple to use.  </li>
            <li>Cheap enough to not hassle a return.</li>
            <li>I just needed these to hold my curls in place until I was finished curling my whole head.</li>
            <li>I was all ready to go on &amp; on</li>
            <li>And I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>and I find them to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li>I never had them just though it was time to buy them and much cheaper online</li>
            <li>I need to section my hair for styling, these make a fast job of it.</li>
            <li>They seem very sturdy..</li>
            <li>They hold the hair very well - remind me of ones used in the salon.</li>
            <li>so I was very worried they wouldn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
            <li>Once my hair has cooled, I remove the clips and my curls stay in much longer than if I hadn&#x27;t pinned them up.</li>
            <li>I have allot hair so these dont hold as much hair as i thought,  </li>
            <li>These clips work very well.  </li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>They hold really well and release the hair without snags.</li>
            <li>Good value for the purchase, though I&#x27;m not thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li>I use these on a regular basis and find them to be very useful when I am doing my hair.  </li>
            <li>Very normal quality clips.</li>
            <li>These did the job, but seemed to pull out my hair more than other ones that I have used.  </li>
            <li>Decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only package that I&#x27;ve seen that you get so many clips for such a decent price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, there are million ways you can use these hair accessories.</li>
            <li>I have super thick fine hair and one clip can hold</li>
            <li>I bought them because several reviews mentioned they would be useful with velcro rollers.  </li>
            <li>The other 11 have been fine.</li>
            <li>They keep it sectioned in the right places for styling different parts of my hair</li>
            <li>People with fine hair or short hair should look for the smaller version.</li>
            <li>I have thin curly hair that goes everywhere, so these are perfect to keep it out of my face while I&#x27;m straightening or curling my hair while also allowing me to get to all those tricky little strands.</li>
            <li>i live in california.</li>
            <li>Product was new and performed the way it was meant to.</li>
            <li>When I need to part and quickly blow dry my hair, these duck bill clips hold until you take them out.  </li>
            <li>Works well on my thick, thick hair :D</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve almost completely replaced my claw clips!</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because the first clip I used snapped out the spring as soon as I opened it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be surprised!</li>
            <li>Duckbills for holing hot curls up, pinning hair back etc.</li>
            <li>Strong grip tangles my hair a little though.</li>
            <li>I like the hair clips they were a little on the light side</li>
            <li>The clips are a little soft and bendable, but work well to secure velcro rollers.</li>
            <li>They work really well, although for my purpose I probably should have ordered the smaller clips (alligator clips I think).</li>
            <li>When you have gone to all the trouble to get that smooth look in a humid locale, these clips hold the style in place overnight or when bathing</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t any different than the clips you buy 3 or 4 in a pack, for much, much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could in theory have fixed it, but what a pain.</li>
            <li>The cheapest I&#x27;ve found these clips by far.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good quality, I have pretty thick hair that&#x27;s past my shoulders</li>
            <li>The first time I opened these, I immediately found one that wasn&#x27;t completely closed.</li>
            <li>you have really long thick hair, you may consider buy something bigger than this , but overall it is good for the price.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair, which my hairdresser describes as thick with a fine texture.</li>
            <li>Holds thick hair easily.</li>
            <li>I have thick and silky hair and these held my curls just fine as I did my hair</li>
            <li>when wet it adds volume to the usually flat top where the curls weigh it down.</li>
            <li>From tying small strands of hair to high bun, they hold pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have extra thick, fine, curly hair</li>
            <li>which means its going to get worse over time making this a product that probably wont last long.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the rust factor... very handy little clips!</li>
            <li>A little bit smaller than I expected, but OK to use for short length hair ( I have shoulder above ) and</li>
            <li>These clips are not good for fine hair; they just fall out.  </li>
            <li>so it often takes quite a few of them to secure it, but that&#x27;s not much of an issue since there are 12 in the box.</li>
            <li>Great price, but disappointed in its sharpness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this item a very short time (barely 3 months).</li>
            <li>It really helps get those pesky bangs out of the way when you&#x27;re working on something that makes you look down a lot</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t particularly high quality - the metal is lighter, edges are rough in some place -  but because I only keep them in for a minute or two, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>These particular clips have several sharp snag points on them, and I am going to replace them to keep from breaking my hair.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much to say about this product other than it does exactly what its supposed to.</li>

            <li> You get plenty if it&#x27;s for yourself, and they&#x27;re handy if you clip them to a pocket in your bag or have them around your room at your convenience.</li>
            <li> I got these for summer I will need my hair out of my eyes at the beach, etc, so I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they will&amp;#34;fit the bill&amp;#34; nicely.</li>

            <li> These are fantastic!</li>
            <li> These work great, are very affordable.</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy and great quality.</li>
            <li> Shipping was prompt and I love these for blowouts, sectioning, holding rollers in place, pin curling as I style hair, and even more.</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> I will order more when needed.</li>
            <li> The top and bottom &amp;#34;bills&amp;#34; don&#x27;t align when you close them and have to be adjusted every time.</li>
            <li> These clips are great and hold it up very well.</li>
            <li> Nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t love these clips for 5 bucks?  </li>
            <li> Better to use these clips instead of bands.</li>
            <li> I would probably use them more often if I had time to fuss.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I like that they have holes along the top</li>
            <li> Pleased with my purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li> so I was glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The are nicely arched, making them comfortable against the scalp.</li>
            <li> I recommend using these :)</li>
            <li> The set is perfect for the rollers I ordered at the same time.</li>
            <li> Okay, they&#x27;re duck clips.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for holding hair back and pinning it out of the way.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Stronger and more well built than others I&#x27;ve used but</li>
            <li> These clips are just okay; maybe it is the way they are shaped but they seem to want to get stuck in my hair and aren&#x27;t quite as easy as I thought they would be to use.</li>
            <li> I wish it would fit more snug at the top.</li>
            <li> Great price, just as good as any other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I am happy with these so far.  </li>
            <li> Make sure they go in smoothly</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Either keep the box to store them or give them a special place because they will disappear!</li>
            <li> The seller was fantastic as well, I got these very quickly. :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not glitz and glamor, but easy to sanitize and throw away and replace as needed.</li>
            <li> Easy to use clips .</li>
            <li> They also rust easily.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to take off without pulling hair out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, especially the price :-).</li>
            <li> but they are strong and well made.</li>
            <li> These are strong and sturdy and get the job done.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those who are finding good hair clips</li>
            <li> Good grip high quality for an inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> I LIKED THEM,  my first purchase revealed quality.  </li>
            <li> These work fine for the purpose intended - to hold parts of my hair as I blow-dry.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just fine.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased and shipping was decently quick.</li>
            <li> Every girl needs these type of clips, they&#x27;re very useful and easy to use for adults as well as when doing kids hair.</li>
            <li> I also like that they are nice and large.</li>
            <li> your duck bill clips \\&quot;fit</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great to section short hair too.</li>
            <li> These clips are useful for so many things.  </li>
            <li> These work great to hold hair back and out of way or to hold curls, etc, in place.  </li>
            <li> They work great for smaller sections of hair.</li>
            <li> However, overall a great product.</li>
            <li> hair stays in place which is great especially when you&#x27;re blowing out or ironing your hair!</li>
            <li> Great purchase and definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> These duck bill clips fit the bill (no pun intended) to a T...</li>
            <li> They are very useful for pinning hair up when you blowdry or style, but they aren&#x27;t resistant to rusting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so gentle and non-creasing as well, and super cheap to boot!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very cheaply made and snag your hairs, which is exactly the thing you want to avoid when clipping your hair up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they made them available at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these because they are super cheap and they work very well.</li>
            <li> I (Auggies owner) enjoy wearing flowers in my hair and have been looking for a reseptical that allows me to hot glue them onto - for quick comfortable insertion and</li>
            <li> I would suggest ones with better gripping for holding larger sections of hair.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and just as described.</li>
            <li> If I had only bought these to pin my hair back, they would probably be perfect, but I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I grab one when I get home and shove them right into my bangs to hold them out of the way while I clean for a bit before I make dinner.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, and these clip it back perfectly so that I can style my hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I use the butterfly clips more, but these come in handy when my hairs straight or dry</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant on these clips but because of the great reviews I bought them.</li>
            <li> Considering my hair is smooth and straight, it wasn&#x27;t like my hair was all over the place and got caught in a freak</li>
            <li> These clips were amazing, I only need a couple to put up my hair for an at home blowout!</li>
            <li> (keep this in mind if you have a sensitive scalp), but overall great duck bill clips.</li>
            <li> I paid $3.24 shipped for the duck bills, and they were well worth the price.</li>
            <li> every other kind of clip or hair tie does, so that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li> but they all right out sheet 2 minutes or</li>
            <li> These clips are wonderful, i am natural 4c and have really thick hair I sooo need to put it into sections to work with</li>
            <li> These clips attache very nicely to the hat bases and clip hair very firmly.</li>
            <li> well when I just need to get my hair out of the way, they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These work great and were the least inexpensive I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Overall I am glad I bought them and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Dose exactly what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for to section off my hair during styling.</li>
            <li> These clips do exactly what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> it holds the hair very well!</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> No more, no less.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know what else to say, but 5 more words were required to submit my rating.  :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for YEARS, I used to use elastics to section my hair but using these makes life so much easier!</li>
            <li> First time ever that any clip could&lt;br /&gt;Hold</li>
            <li> These clips are exactly what you&#x27;d expect them to be.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty curly</li>
            <li> Unfortunately no matter how I tried to angle it, the clip wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair.</li>
            <li> NOW I see a significant price increase without anything more on their part to warrant such an action.  </li>
            <li> They are the right size and are made very well.  </li>
            <li> It makes hair drying go so much faster and curling so much easier!  </li>
            <li> But clips are curved and seem pretty gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t snag or get caught like pretty much</li>
            <li> These are okay, don&#x27;t start in my hair very long.</li>
            <li> The clips slide out easily and have gotten stuck and tangled in my hair several times.</li>
            <li> I bought them to use it with velcro rollers, but may find better use sectioning out my hair for blowing it dry.</li>
            <li> Large velcor-type hair rollers kept falling out of my hair before I was done setting it.</li>
            <li> The Duck Bill Hair Clips are great, they hold a decent amount of hair (I have very 26inches of straight thick hair) ...</li>
            <li> They are strong and big and really hold my hair.</li>
            <li> These clips are amazing at holding your hair back (or up for straightening purposes) and are so simple to use.  </li>
            <li> Cheap enough to not hassle a return.</li>
            <li> I just needed these to hold my curls in place until I was finished curling my whole head.</li>
            <li> I was all ready to go on &amp; on</li>
            <li> And I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I find them to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li> I never had them just though it was time to buy them and much cheaper online</li>
            <li> I need to section my hair for styling, these make a fast job of it.</li>
            <li> They seem very sturdy..</li>
            <li> They hold the hair very well - remind me of ones used in the salon.</li>
            <li> so I was very worried they wouldn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
            <li> Once my hair has cooled, I remove the clips and my curls stay in much longer than if I hadn&#x27;t pinned them up.</li>
            <li> I have allot hair so these dont hold as much hair as i thought,  </li>
            <li> These clips work very well.  </li>
            <li> Work very well.</li>
            <li> They hold really well and release the hair without snags.</li>
            <li> Good value for the purchase, though I&#x27;m not thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> I use these on a regular basis and find them to be very useful when I am doing my hair.  </li>
            <li> Very normal quality clips.</li>
            <li> These did the job, but seemed to pull out my hair more than other ones that I have used.  </li>
            <li> Decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only package that I&#x27;ve seen that you get so many clips for such a decent price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, there are million ways you can use these hair accessories.</li>
            <li> I have super thick fine hair and one clip can hold</li>
            <li> I bought them because several reviews mentioned they would be useful with velcro rollers.  </li>
            <li> The other 11 have been fine.</li>
            <li> They keep it sectioned in the right places for styling different parts of my hair</li>
            <li> People with fine hair or short hair should look for the smaller version.</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair that goes everywhere, so these are perfect to keep it out of my face while I&#x27;m straightening or curling my hair while also allowing me to get to all those tricky little strands.</li>
            <li> i live in california.</li>
            <li> Product was new and performed the way it was meant to.</li>
            <li> When I need to part and quickly blow dry my hair, these duck bill clips hold until you take them out.  </li>
            <li> Works well on my thick, thick hair :D</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve almost completely replaced my claw clips!</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because the first clip I used snapped out the spring as soon as I opened it.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be surprised!</li>
            <li> Duckbills for holing hot curls up, pinning hair back etc.</li>
            <li> Strong grip tangles my hair a little though.</li>
            <li> I like the hair clips they were a little on the light side</li>
            <li> The clips are a little soft and bendable, but work well to secure velcro rollers.</li>
            <li> They work really well, although for my purpose I probably should have ordered the smaller clips (alligator clips I think).</li>
            <li> When you have gone to all the trouble to get that smooth look in a humid locale, these clips hold the style in place overnight or when bathing</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t any different than the clips you buy 3 or 4 in a pack, for much, much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could in theory have fixed it, but what a pain.</li>
            <li> The cheapest I&#x27;ve found these clips by far.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good quality, I have pretty thick hair that&#x27;s past my shoulders</li>
            <li> The first time I opened these, I immediately found one that wasn&#x27;t completely closed.</li>
            <li> you have really long thick hair, you may consider buy something bigger than this , but overall it is good for the price.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair, which my hairdresser describes as thick with a fine texture.</li>
            <li> Holds thick hair easily.</li>
            <li> I have thick and silky hair and these held my curls just fine as I did my hair</li>
            <li> when wet it adds volume to the usually flat top where the curls weigh it down.</li>
            <li> From tying small strands of hair to high bun, they hold pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have extra thick, fine, curly hair</li>
            <li> which means its going to get worse over time making this a product that probably wont last long.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the rust factor... very handy little clips!</li>
            <li> A little bit smaller than I expected, but OK to use for short length hair ( I have shoulder above ) and</li>
            <li> These clips are not good for fine hair; they just fall out.  </li>
            <li> so it often takes quite a few of them to secure it, but that&#x27;s not much of an issue since there are 12 in the box.</li>
            <li> Great price, but disappointed in its sharpness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this item a very short time (barely 3 months).</li>
            <li> It really helps get those pesky bangs out of the way when you&#x27;re working on something that makes you look down a lot</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t particularly high quality - the metal is lighter, edges are rough in some place -  but because I only keep them in for a minute or two, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> These particular clips have several sharp snag points on them, and I am going to replace them to keep from breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this product other than it does exactly what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> Fun for trying different vintage hairstyles, or keeping my thick hair back while styling.</li>
            <li> It still holds large amounts of hair, but small amounts slip out of it.</li>
            <li> They are not too large and not too small.</li>
            <li> The edges are smooth so your hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in any rough areas and the tension is firm but not overly tight.  </li>
            <li> These work on small sections of hair but don&#x27;t really hold on even medium sections when styling.</li>
            <li> A must have if you flat iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;just use it for holding hair and when flat ironing and curling</li>
            <li> Use these to section my hair when I flat iron.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find locally and I really like them.  </li>
            <li> She uses larger versions of clips like these to hold all her hair back and found little use for these tiny ones.</li>
            <li> I thought they&#x27;d be bigger and was surprised at how small they were.</li>
            <li> Too long for my hair.</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I use them almost daily, with wet hair and when straightening.</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t waited to long to purchase these.</li>
            <li> She occasionally uses them to hold back a little bunch of hair, but the box has been lying untouched in her drawer for months now.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long?!  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair and bought these clips to pin up my curls after using a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> For the great price I was afraid they may be too thin and flimsy.</li>
            <li> As they are metal you have to ensure that they are dry before storage otherwise they may rust.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use these kinds of clips because my hair is so thick that it falls out of them, or I have to use at least 10 clips to hold up half my hair while drying.</li>
            <li> Nor does it slide off or refuse to actually pin it down.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it was previously returned or for whatever reason just packaged 2 clips short.</li>
            <li> Too bad they aren&#x27;t a little more fashionable!</li>
            <li> This review was long due.</li>
            <li> When my hair is still a little damp, I lift the hair up and place these next to the scalp, When hair dries I remove and I have some height to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have different lengths of bangs and little bobby pins just don&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since they hold, and I already have them, I will try to use them carefully.</li>
            <li> These work as expected.</li>
            <li> It looks like another&#x27;s getting the gap after a few uses, but overall they do the job they were meant to do!</li>
            <li> It does the job, holds up thick hair well, and I have no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> Unlike other flimsier types that are always sliding out while you&#x27;re working another section.</li>
            <li> these clips are extremely durable.</li>
            <li> sharp edges.</li>
            <li> It is not too big, nor small...</li>
            <li> I have extremely think hair</li>
            <li> These little clips are a staple for every single girl who fixes their hair.</li>
            <li> keep them in the bathroom, and pin my wet hair up with them and have noticed that they are getting slightly rusty....</li>
            <li> Oooh la la no more flat roots!  </li>
            <li> No serious complaints except the few broken ones</li>
            <li> I especially like that the clips come in a small box because otherwise they&#x27;d be scattered at the bottom of a drawer!</li>
            <li> I got them to use for styling and hoped that it could hold up half my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> Pulls the hair a little when taking them out</li>
            <li> Some days I need a little lift.</li>
            <li> I am using mine to give me a little height on the hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because one of the clips came broken.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> These are impossible to find in stores, but were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I received a very small box, I&#x27;m talking like half a cigarette carton small and almost couldn&#x27;t believe there were 12 in there.</li>
            <li> I was looking for small clips just to hold my hair while straightening it</li>
            <li> I was never able to find clips like these in the stores I checked.</li>
            <li> I had been on \\&quot;The Small Things</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t make crazy patterns in your hair because curly hair dries as it&#x27;s styled when wet, and of course don&#x27;t mess with them to avoid the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> I have to use them on smaller portions of my hair (which stinks considering the box</li>
            <li> and you get plenty to use for hair cutting or coloring or even to do different hairstyles.</li>
            <li> And I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick course hair and put my hair in rollers often.</li>
            <li> They work well even for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t a fan with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> A few arrived broken</li>
            <li> even just a small part of my hair let alone all of it!</li>
            <li> But you know, when you&#x27;re styling and reaching around awkward parts of your head, you can&#x27;t always be careful.</li>
            <li> No good.  </li>
            <li> because it is too late to cancel this order!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and use Velcro rolls to give my hair volume and the &amp;#34;blow out&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> my hair is very thick, it work well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little afraid to use them.</li>
            <li> The quality is not great either.</li>
            <li> None of them are broken or rusted.</li>
            <li> These clips are so poorly made that they break apart in your hand.</li>
            <li> A lot of other clips hook onto the hair, making it painful to remove.</li>
            <li> Was not worth returning, but definitely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have a set of plastic clips that are totally useless on my hair and don&#x27;t hold it at all.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to find in drugstores</li>
            <li> A little annoying, but can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I also found a use for them to seperate hair for styling and cutting.</li>
            <li> I like them for holding my hair out of the way when I am setting it and cutting it.  </li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>
            <li> I use to have a terrible time with that, but since using these clips,</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great price, but disappointed in its sharpness. I got it for my daughter and everyone she says it scratched her. It also snags on a couple strands and yanks it out along removal. I will go with plastic to replace these. Cheap enough to not hassle a return. She will probably use it on her toys lol</li>
            <li> Slips off my hair and doesn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li> These pins are just what i had been looking for. I have very thick hair and use Velcro rolls to give my hair volume and the &amp;#34;blow out&amp;#34; look. Before I used bobby pins which worked but tended to be a pain to pull out when I was trying to style my hair. These pins make everything much more effortless and I use them&lt;br /&gt;As well when I just need to get my hair out of the way, they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and these are great for pinning my curls while they set. Great to have in the beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> These work fine for the purpose intended - to hold parts of my hair as I blow-dry. They aren&#x27;t particularly high quality - the metal is lighter, edges are rough in some place -  but because I only keep them in for a minute or two, it doesn&#x27;t bother me. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li> I love these clips. I have curly hair, about 2c-3a, and I ordered these to add lift at my roots while my hair dries. They work really well, although for my purpose I probably should have ordered the smaller clips (alligator clips I think). I do keep losing them, but that is my fault. Either keep the box to store them or give them a special place because they will disappear!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for the project I was working on. The product was made from good materials however.</li>
            <li> Great for styling hair.  Pulls the hair a little when taking them out (keep this in mind if you have a sensitive scalp), but overall great duck bill clips.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! They hold everything in place, and I don&#x27;t get any hairs pulled out by the spring mechanism.</li>
            <li> Great clips for coloring hair, hold nicely, easy to use.</li>
            <li> These do the job but I think smaller ones would have been easier to work with. People with fine hair or short hair should look for the smaller version.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need these for self-grip rollers.  Good quality at good price.</li>
            <li> When you have gone to all the trouble to get that smooth look in a humid locale, these clips hold the style in place overnight or when bathing--I believe the technique is called \\&quot;dubi dubi\\&quot; when you wrap the hair around your head and clip it at intervals--no need to wash/restyle, so saves lots of time.</li>
            <li> The Duck Bill Hair Clips are great, they hold a decent amount of hair (I have very 26inches of straight thick hair) ... product is as described! Glad I purchased these!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I (Auggies owner) enjoy wearing flowers in my hair and have been looking for a reseptical that allows me to hot glue them onto - for quick comfortable insertion and your duck bill clips \\&quot;fit the bill\\&quot;. Beauty supply houses didn&#x27;t have what I needed. I intend to reorder them soon.</li>
            <li> Estos clips son muy resistentes, usualmente los uso cuando seco mi cabello con la secadora, me ahorra mucho tiempo en las mananas.</li>
            <li> I just needed these to hold my curls in place until I was finished curling my whole head. These work great, are very affordable. I am pleased and shipping was decently quick.</li>
            <li> Was hoping they would have a larger end and be easier to open.  They do grab well, however.  Good for hand-rolled curls.</li>
            <li> These work great and were the least inexpensive I&#x27;ve seen. Great value. I use them to separate my hair into sections when curling it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these clips to use while curling and styling my hair. They grip the hair well and do the job, that I need them to!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to help me style my hair in the old-fashion waves.  I wish it would fit more snug at the top.</li>
            <li> I use these to keep hair out of the way as I use an iron on one section at a time. They work well for me.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Holds my silky, slippery hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The hinge part pulled out my hair when I removed a clip. I don&#x27;t want to lose any hairs! I&#x27;m a little afraid to use them. Considering my hair is smooth and straight, it wasn&#x27;t like my hair was all over the place and got caught in a freak accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;Since they hold, and I already have them, I will try to use them carefully. But you know, when you&#x27;re styling and reaching around awkward parts of your head, you can&#x27;t always be careful. I&#x27;d rate these as second best choice, seeing as the hold is good. (Try to find best choice!)</li>
            <li> I paid $3.24 shipped for the duck bills, and they were well worth the price. This is the cheapest I have found the clips, whether online or in-stores. They are very sturdy and great quality. Very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> When I need to part and quickly blow dry my hair, these duck bill clips hold until you take them out.  Unlike other flimsier types that are always sliding out while you&#x27;re working another section.</li>
            <li> I am happy with these so far.  It does the job, holds up thick hair well, and I have no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> These clips make keeping my curls in possible!! I highly recommend this product, there are million ways you can use these hair accessories.</li>
            <li> These work on small sections of hair but don&#x27;t really hold on even medium sections when styling.</li>
            <li> I have started to embrace my curls. Some days I need a little lift. I am using mine to give me a little height on the hair. When my hair is still a little damp, I lift the hair up and place these next to the scalp, When hair dries I remove and I have some height to my hair.They are a very good price and the product is made well.</li>
            <li> I was all ready to go on &amp; on about HOW GREAT these 12 hair clips are...  I LIKED THEM,  my first purchase revealed quality.  NOW I see a significant price increase without anything more on their part to warrant such an action.  So my review has dimmed one of the stars (to just 4).  I will NOW focus on where I SHOULD HAVE SHOPPED.... because it is too late to cancel this order!</li>
            <li> I was looking for small clips just to hold my hair while straightening it and these were perfect. I have thick hair, so obviously I need a few to pin up all my hair, but since they come in a box of 12, I have more than enough. Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These work well, they hold a good chunk of hair and are great for styling, blowdrying, dying and all that.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed when trying to section off my hair for straightening. Doesn&#x27;t leave marks or crimp hair. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, just as explained. Shipping was prompt and I love these for blowouts, sectioning, holding rollers in place, pin curling as I style hair, and even more. They&#x27;re great to section short hair too. Love love love</li>
            <li> Affordable. Not glitz and glamor, but easy to sanitize and throw away and replace as needed. A must have if you flat iron.</li>
            <li> These are okay, don&#x27;t start in my hair very long. Tried using them for styling but they all right out sheet 2 minutes or any shifting around. Very annoying. And I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> these clips are extremely durable. they don&#x27;t hold a lot of hair so you have to use a ton of clips and I have very fine hair- but they do what I want them to do.</li>
            <li> These clips are useful for so many things.  They are the right size and are made very well.  The edges are smooth so your hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in any rough areas and the tension is firm but not overly tight.  Simple, well made product.</li>
            <li> Works as they are supposed to.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because one of the clips came broken.  Overall I am glad I bought them and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Just clips. Dose exactly what they are supposed to do. Keeps hair in place nicely! I will order more when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use these kinds of clips because my hair is so thick that it falls out of them, or I have to use at least 10 clips to hold up half my hair while drying. These clips were amazing, I only need a couple to put up my hair for an at home blowout! I use them constantly, when doing house work, when I&#x27;m cooking &amp; need hair out of my face, when I&#x27;m washing my face. They&#x27;ve almost completely replaced my claw clips! These are definitely a steal!</li>
            <li> I use these on a regular basis and find them to be very useful when I am doing my hair.  They are longer then the ones I have came across locally and I find them to be very helpful.  Price was good so I have no complaints.  They do what I intended them for.</li>
            <li> These work great to hold hair back and out of way or to hold curls, etc, in place.  They have a good hand feel and grip the hair well.</li>
            <li> Great I use it to  pin my curls to my head after I use a curling iron.  Strong grip tangles my hair a little though.</li>
            <li> These little clips are a staple for every single girl who fixes their hair. I especially love to use them to separate my hair while doing a blow out. Or to clip my hair back while putting on make up. Must have.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does what it should.  Hold hair in place, out of place, and everywhere in between.  I sometimes even use them to keep my hair up during the day, not just when I am styling hair.  Too bad they aren&#x27;t a little more fashionable! ;)</li>
            <li> your basic hair clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair does not get caught (unless you try to get it stuck; don&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;quick shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ordered it, and bam it came. i live in california.</li>
            <li> Easy to use clips . I never had them just though it was time to buy them and much cheaper online</li>
            <li> Has really good grip and i use it when i wash my face or when i&#x27;m curling my hair.  works well for anything and everything!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price, nice and sturdy clips.</li>
            <li> They work great for smaller sections of hair. If you want to hold larger sections, these will slip off. I would suggest ones with better gripping for holding larger sections of hair.</li>
            <li> They do what they&#x27;re meant to do, hold my hair out of my face while I&#x27;m attempting to style it so I no longer look like a frizzy haired yeti. I have thin curly hair that goes everywhere, so these are perfect to keep it out of my face while I&#x27;m straightening or curling my hair while also allowing me to get to all those tricky little strands.</li>
            <li> Received box with only 10 clips. Don&#x27;t know if it was previously returned or for whatever reason just packaged 2 clips short. The quality is not great either. They do hold in my hair well, but none of the clips close properly. The top and bottom &amp;#34;bills&amp;#34; don&#x27;t align when you close them and have to be adjusted every time. They also rust easily. I have only used them once while straightening my hair and the clips are already rusting. Was not worth returning, but definitely disappointed. Will go with another brand next time.</li>
            <li> These work as expected. The clips are a little soft and bendable, but work well to secure velcro rollers.</li>
            <li> Pulls pulls your hairs out.  They&#x27;re very cheaply made and snag your hairs, which is exactly the thing you want to avoid when clipping your hair up.  They&#x27;re hinged instead of all one piece so that your hair gets stuck in the hinge and pulled out every time.  No good.  Try another company.</li>
            <li> These clips are wonderful, i am natural 4c and have really thick hair I sooo need to put it into sections to work with and this does it perfectly!!</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair, which my hairdresser describes as thick with a fine texture. I have a set of plastic clips that are totally useless on my hair and don&#x27;t hold it at all. These clips are great and hold it up very well. I was never able to find clips like these in the stores I checked.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. Nothing more to say. As described.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant on these clips but because of the great reviews I bought them. I am so happy I did. For the great price I was afraid they may be too thin and flimsy. These feel like salon type that are much more expensive. I need to section my hair for styling, these make a fast job of it. They hold well, can be used to part your hair, and I have no doubt they will last forever. Great product at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> I have different lengths of bangs and little bobby pins just don&#x27;t cut it for me. You get plenty if it&#x27;s for yourself, and they&#x27;re handy if you clip them to a pocket in your bag or have them around your room at your convenience. It really helps get those pesky bangs out of the way when you&#x27;re working on something that makes you look down a lot (ie: Drawing) I also found a use for them to seperate hair for styling and cutting.</li>
            <li> I thought these were a great deal. I had them sitting in my cart for a while (waiting to spend 25$) and finally got them. I have really long hair, and these clip it back perfectly so that I can style my hair. They are a great size/weight/material.</li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t love these clips for 5 bucks?  I wish I could wear them out of the house.  They are strong and big and really hold my hair.</li>
            <li> I use these for clipping curlers, holding hair out of my way when I&#x27; rolling it to bookmarks.  They seem very sturdy..</li>
            <li> fairly sturdy.  Would order again</li>
            <li> Great design, I used them to make dinosaur hair clips for the girls at my sons party.</li>
            <li> Every girl needs these type of clips, they&#x27;re very useful and easy to use for adults as well as when doing kids hair.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wanted these for her. So I bought them. But she said they were WAY smaller than what she was expecting. She uses larger versions of clips like these to hold all her hair back and found little use for these tiny ones. She occasionally uses them to hold back a little bunch of hair, but the box has been lying untouched in her drawer for months now.</li>
            <li> Great price, just as good as any other ones I&#x27;ve tried. Fun for trying different vintage hairstyles, or keeping my thick hair back while styling.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this product other than it does exactly what its supposed to. Can&#x27;t complain at all.</li>
            <li> These work great! They hold the hair very well - remind me of ones used in the salon. Also, a great price!</li>
            <li> Perfect to wrap my hair.</li>
            <li> Too long for my hair.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for to section off my hair during styling. I was worried that they would not be made well but they are strong and well made. I have fine hair so I was very worried they wouldn&#x27;t hold well. However, even with the smallest section the clips hold well. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Great to use when straightening hair. Keeps the straightened hair out of the way of the untouched hair. Better to use these clips instead of bands.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find locally and I really like them.  Use them every morning to pin up my hair before I shower.  Great item!</li>
            <li> I use this to make 20s waves on people and it works great. Holds hair and secures it in place. The only reason why it does not get 5 stars is that it leaves marks on the hair when you take it off. However, overall a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.....hair stays in place which is great especially when you&#x27;re blowing out or ironing your hair!</li>
            <li> These duck bill hair clips have made styling/curling my hair a lot easier. Same as the ones my hairdresser uses.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t any different than the clips you buy 3 or 4 in a pack, for much, much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I feel I paid what I would expect to pay for such a clip - YAY!!  I&#x27;m glad they made them available at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe your stylist uses them, or maybe you have a stray one here or there, these are the same ones!</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because the first clip I used snapped out the spring as soon as I opened it. I could in theory have fixed it, but what a pain. The other 11 have been fine.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and bought these clips to pin up my curls after using a curling iron.  Once my hair has cooled, I remove the clips and my curls stay in much longer than if I hadn&#x27;t pinned them up. I especially like that the clips come in a small box because otherwise they&#x27;d be scattered at the bottom of a drawer!</li>
            <li> I had been on \\&quot;The Small Things Blog\\&quot; and watching her do her hair and I NEEDED SOME DUCK BILL CLIPS! Well, guess what?! THESE ARE PERFECT!!!!!!! I grab one when I get home and shove them right into my bangs to hold them out of the way while I clean for a bit before I make dinner. Great purchase and definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected. sharp edges.</li>
            <li> I have allot hair so these dont hold as much hair as i thought,  I have to use them on smaller portions of my hair (which stinks considering the box said 12 and I only got 11) and they also get tangled up in my hair a lil bit when I use them while blow drying my hair,</li>
            <li> I like the hair clips they were a little on the light side however they met my needs will order again</li>
            <li> These did the job, but seemed to pull out my hair more than other ones that I have used.  Probably wont buy again.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I use these to hold up my hair when I&#x27;m in the pool.</li>
            <li> The cheapest I&#x27;ve found these clips by far.  I lost my last ones in a recent move and these are a MUST HAVE for curly haired girls.  When clipped in sideways (so the fat part is standing up) at the roots of the hair when wet it adds volume to the usually flat top where the curls weigh it down. I use to have a terrible time with that, but since using these clips, Oooh la la no more flat roots!  Make sure they go in smoothly so they don&#x27;t make crazy patterns in your hair because curly hair dries as it&#x27;s styled when wet, and of course don&#x27;t mess with them to avoid the frizzies.  Give it a try you&#x27;ll be surprised!</li>
            <li> This review was long due. I purchased this hair clips a year back and they turned out to be great for the price. None of them are broken or rusted. I use them almost daily, with wet hair and when straightening. From tying small strands of hair to high bun, they hold pretty well. They are lightweight and do not pinch my hair when pulling off. Recommended!!</li>
            <li> These clips do exactly what they are supposed to do. They are a great value for the money. I use the clips to separate sections of my hair while I do a blow-out.They do their job! I like that it has 12 clips.</li>
            <li> I had only two of the duck bill hair clips.  I like them for holding my hair out of the way when I am setting it and cutting it.  The clips are nice and strong.</li>
            <li> These are just as advertised.  I use the butterfly clips more, but these come in handy when my hairs straight or dry and I need to section off while working on my hair.</li>
            <li> These are strong and sturdy and get the job done. They haven&#x27;t rusted at all or become discolored when I dye my hair.  They&#x27;re just fine.  I don&#x27;t know what else to say LOL</li>
            <li> Work well for holding curlers or holding your hair up while styling. Works well on my thick, thick hair :D</li>
            <li> These clips appear to be durable.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair clips I&#x27;ve ever bought! It is not too big, nor small... it holds the hair very well! I would buy it again! Just loved it!</li>
            <li> I would probably use them more often if I had time to fuss.  These clips work very well.  And I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Work very well. I have thick and silky hair and these held my curls just fine as I did my hair</li>
            <li> Good value for the purchase, though I&#x27;m not thrilled with the product. The clips slide out easily and have gotten stuck and tangled in my hair several times. You have to use pretty small sections of hair for them to work well. I still use them, but if I had the choice, I wouldn&#x27;t go back to purchase again. :/</li>
            <li> Large velcor-type hair rollers kept falling out of my hair before I was done setting it. These duck bill clips fit the bill (no pun intended) to a T... Definitely a good buy at the price reflected!</li>
            <li> Good strong clips. Good size clips. Good buy. 5 boxes at an awesome price. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. I&#x27;d definaty buy it again.</li>
            <li> These work great and you get plenty to use for hair cutting or coloring or even to do different hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and just as described. I like that they have holes along the top so I can sew buttons and beads to them. I also like that they are nice and large.</li>
            <li> Love these clips - hold well in place!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this item a very short time (barely 3 months). Additionally, I use them infrequently. To date, I have six clips remaining. These clips are so poorly made that they break apart in your hand. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I got these for summer I will need my hair out of my eyes at the beach, etc, so I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they will&amp;#34;fit the bill&amp;#34; nicely.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they are supposed to do. Decent quality for the price. I would definitely recommend these hair clips.</li>
            <li> I have extra thick, fine, curly hair so you can understand my surprise in finding a clip that does not &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; my hair. Nor does it slide off or refuse to actually pin it down. I am happy with the purchase and it looks like they aren&#x27;t going to rust in my bathroom anytime soon, which is always a problem for these types hair items.</li>
            <li> These are impossible to find in stores, but were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> do the job thats needed but one was bent&lt;br /&gt;just use it for holding hair and when flat ironing and curling</li>
            <li> Dose hair nice no tangles</li>
            <li> Good, sturdy product. Great value. Pleased with my purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this style of clip regularly.  They are difficult to find in drugstores so I was glad to find them on Amazon. These hold well and are well made.  I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, work perfectly, arrived in two days with Prime shipping. What else can be said?</li>
            <li> I purchased these based on the reviews and am so happy with them. I have thick course hair and put my hair in rollers often. These keep everything in place without having to readjust them.</li>
            <li> I like these duck-bill hair clips. The are nicely arched, making them comfortable against the scalp. They hold really well and release the hair without snags. No problems.</li>
            <li> These work well when holding hair during styling. As they are metal you have to ensure that they are dry before storage otherwise they may rust.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clip.  It does what it is supposed to do.  No more, no less.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know what else to say, but 5 more words were required to submit my rating.  :-)</li>
            <li> These clips are just okay; maybe it is the way they are shaped but they seem to want to get stuck in my hair and aren&#x27;t quite as easy as I thought they would be to use.</li>
            <li> These clips are perfect for styling my hair. They keep it sectioned in the right places for styling different parts of my hair</li>
            <li> Very normal quality clips. I thought they&#x27;d be bigger and was surprised at how small they were. I received a very small box, I&#x27;m talking like half a cigarette carton small and almost couldn&#x27;t believe there were 12 in there. They get the job done though.</li>
            <li> I have extremely think hair and I still find using hair ties are easier to use when straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> I used it to separate my hair into sections while curling/straightening it. It holds the sections well and it doesn&#x27;t pinch the hair when pulling out. A lot of other clips hook onto the hair, making it painful to remove. No problem with these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for YEARS, I used to use elastics to section my hair but using these makes life so much easier! They&#x27;re good quality, I have pretty thick hair that&#x27;s past my shoulders and I got away with using just 1 to hold up everything in a neat bun. Awesome. Wish I hadn&#x27;t waited to long to purchase these. The seller was fantastic as well, I got these very quickly. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought the clips that my hairdresser uses when cutting my hair were nice, but I&#x27;ve never tried getting them for myself until recently.  Why did I wait so long?!  These clips are amazing at holding your hair back (or up for straightening purposes) and are so simple to use.  I use these clips whenever i need my hair out of the way.  I can&#x27;t recommend these clips enough.  Buy them now!</li>
            <li> Great price and product!</li>
            <li> They work well even for my thick hair. 12 of them are certainly enough for what I need to do on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> Bought with Conair Mega Self Holding Rollers and they work great!</li>
            <li> Use these to section my hair when I flat iron. Great hold, haven&#x27;t had one break on me yet and never tangles in my hair.</li>
            <li> These clips are not good for fine hair; they just fall out.  I don&#x27;t know if they work on thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for clips to attach to fascinator hats that I adapt and for ones I make myself.  These clips attache very nicely to the hat bases and clip hair very firmly.</li>
            <li> I love these because they are super cheap and they work very well. Great quality. I recommend using these :)</li>
            <li> This is probably the cheapest hair clips on the market. However, its quality is superior. There are 12 of them but I only need to use 3. Highly recommended for those who are finding good hair clips</li>
            <li> I love using these when blowdrying or styling my hair in the morning to speed up the process!! It makes hair drying go so much faster and curling so much easier!  It prevents tangles, too.  They&#x27;re so gentle and non-creasing as well, and super cheap to boot!! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t a fan with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I chose these clips over bobby pins for ease of use.  The set is perfect for the rollers I ordered at the same time.</li>
            <li> Good grip high quality for an inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> Good product. Holds thick hair easily. I bought them to use it with velcro rollers, but may find better use sectioning out my hair for blowing it dry.</li>
            <li> I have super thick fine hair and one clip can hold&lt;br /&gt;All my hair up! First time ever that any clip could&lt;br /&gt;Hold even just a small part of my hair let alone all of it!</li>
            <li> They are very useful for pinning hair up when you blowdry or style, but they aren&#x27;t resistant to rusting.&lt;br /&gt;I keep them in the bathroom, and pin my wet hair up with them and have noticed that they are getting slightly rusty.... which means its going to get worse over time making this a product that probably wont last long.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the rust factor... very handy little clips!</li>
            <li> I thought the clips would have some sort of cushioning around the inside of the clip to protect the hair. It doesn&#x27;t. But clips are curved and seem pretty gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I opened these, I immediately found one that wasn&#x27;t completely closed. There was a big gap, and it&#x27;s only gotten bigger. It still holds large amounts of hair, but small amounts slip out of it. It looks like another&#x27;s getting the gap after a few uses, but overall they do the job they were meant to do!</li>
            <li> Very fast service and great product.  It grips onto the hair great and it&#x27;s easy to take off without pulling hair out.</li>
            <li> Okay, they&#x27;re duck clips. They work perfectly for what they are designed for. I&#x27;ve no problems with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Good product. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for holding hair back and pinning it out of the way. It&#x27;s the only package that I&#x27;ve seen that you get so many clips for such a decent price. Clips are made of a sturdy material and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with snagging hair.</li>
            <li> If I had only bought these to pin my hair back, they would probably be perfect, but I didn&#x27;t.  I bought them because several reviews mentioned they would be useful with velcro rollers.  These particular clips have several sharp snag points on them, and I am going to replace them to keep from breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> Product was new and performed the way it was meant to. They hold in place well. This is a durable item.</li>
            <li> These are really perfect for using with velcro rollers. They are not too large and not too small. they dont crimp your hair either.  I am really pleased with them.</li>
            <li> They are duck clips. They work well for there intended use. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, especially the price :-).</li>
            <li> Great price for many clips.</li>
            <li> These clips are exactly what you&#x27;d expect them to be. Duckbills for holing hot curls up, pinning hair back etc. good quality, easy to use.</li>
            <li> A few arrived broken but they do what they are designed to do.  No serious complaints except the few broken ones</li>
            <li> I used it when styling the hair. Works great after you curl and want to keep them protected before leaving the house</li>
            <li> I like these clips. My hair is pretty curly so it often takes quite a few of them to secure it, but that&#x27;s not much of an issue since there are 12 in the box. They don&#x27;t snag or get caught like pretty much every other kind of clip or hair tie does, so that&#x27;s a huge plus. This is a good product for a fine price, I think it works just as it should.</li>
            <li> i do my own hair cuts and since after using these to dvide then trim my hair, ive been getting more compliments saying I look like cristiano ronaldo. and im not talking about the soccer player, i am talking about our local guy who is a bum</li>
            <li> The clips are well-made and work well on smaller sections of hair. I got them to use for styling and hoped that it could hold up half my hair. Unfortunately no matter how I tried to angle it, the clip wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair. My hair is not too long--about two inches below shoulder-length. They work well with smaller sections, though, so I just split my hair into quarters and do that. A little annoying, but can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> A little bit smaller than I expected, but OK to use for short length hair ( I have shoulder above ) and my hair is very thick, it work well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have really long thick hair, you may consider buy something bigger than this , but overall it is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Stronger and more well built than others I&#x27;ve used but the packaging is way different and the clips are BIGGER than they look online and bigger when comparing to the packaging clip. But they do what I need them to so no complaints</li>
    </ol>
