            <li>Wonderful product.  </li>

            <li>I do wish the cream had an SPF...that would make it perfect!  </li>
            <li>Vivo Per Lei the best products for all skin.</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>

            <li>good quality I recommend!</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I quit buying any of the fancy products because this is so great.</li>
            <li>I will say Amazon was great and refunded part of my payment.  </li>
            <li>Fab price, great product.</li>
            <li>The company ships in plastic wrap over the cases which are very nice.  </li>
            <li>I love these, they are amazing and really a great price!</li>
            <li>Love these products!</li>
            <li>I love Vivo products!</li>
            <li>The cream is nice..</li>
            <li>I love this product and was very pleased with the price.</li>
            <li>While I do believe that good quality skin care is out there that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune, it isn&#x27;t always easy to find.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and makes my skin look good and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful cream that helps hide the little age lines and feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love all the Vivo products.</li>
            <li>so my liquid foundation goes on smoothly, without unwanted &amp;#34;texture.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Lightly scented and feels light and moisturizing on the skin.</li>
            <li>I first bought them while on vacation in Cancun Mexico , which I paid more there.</li>
            <li>are full</li>
            <li>;  When a brand I like is on a great sale, I try to stock up, but sometimes the budget is too tight.  </li>
            <li>Exactly same as the set I bought from Puyallup Fair, but the price here is 2 times lower than what I paid for ($60 for a Moisturizing Day Cream, 1.7-Fluid Ounce and acial Peeling, 1.7-Fluid Ounce), it&#x27;s new and full container.</li>
            <li>I had been using the same department store brad moisturizer for years and decided I needed more moisture as my skin in getting older.  </li>
            <li>it is much cheaper than what I had been paying.</li>
            <li>I love this product but the jars are 1/2 empty</li>
            <li>It works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend using them at any age.</li>
            <li>I love using the facial peel once a month to remove dead cells.</li>
            <li>so i sent theirs back the lady I normally get from hers</li>
            <li>I really like how my skin feels with both the day and night cream, plus the day cream goes down in an even layer</li>

            <li> Satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> I had been using the same department store brad moisturizer for years and decided I needed more moisture as my skin in getting older.  I am so happy with this stuff.  Not only does it provide plenty of moisture it is much cheaper than what I had been paying.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh. Perfect weight to this cream. It goes on smooth and makes my skin look good and not greasy.  Ordered both the day and night creams and like and will reorder both. My skin tends to be medium-dry.</li>
            <li> I quit buying any of the fancy products because this is so great. I hope amazon always have this.</li>
            <li> i only got two of the creams not four</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Friends are commenting on my &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful item, price and great shipping. Mahalo Nui Loa.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service!!</li>
            <li> I love these, they are amazing and really a great price!</li>
            <li> Love these products! I first bought them while on vacation in Cancun Mexico , which I paid more there. I would highly recommend using them at any age. I love using the facial peel once a month to remove dead cells. My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I love Vivo products! Excellent buy!</li>
            <li> The cream is nice..but, my order came minus one of the night cream jars.  I will say Amazon was great and refunded part of my payment.  I do wish the cream had an SPF...that would make it perfect!  I will order it again!</li>
            <li> Exactly same as the set I bought from Puyallup Fair, but the price here is 2 times lower than what I paid for ($60 for a Moisturizing Day Cream, 1.7-Fluid Ounce and acial Peeling, 1.7-Fluid Ounce), it&#x27;s new and full container. I will definitely buy it from Amazon again!</li>
            <li> I love this product and was very pleased with the price. Will order again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I decided to try this.  While I do believe that good quality skin care is out there that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune, it isn&#x27;t always easy to find.  A few months ago, I decided to try a house brand at a local beauty supply store, and I was completely underwhelmed with the results.  That experience did prove that sometimes you do &amp;#34;get what you pay for.&amp;#34;  When a brand I like is on a great sale, I try to stock up, but sometimes the budget is too tight.  That was the case when I decided to try this.  I really like how my skin feels with both the day and night cream, plus the day cream goes down in an even layer so my liquid foundation goes on smoothly, without unwanted &amp;#34;texture.&amp;#34;  This is definitely a brand that I will keep in my rotation of skin care items.</li>
            <li> Vivo Per Lei the best products for all skin.</li>
            <li> got this for my wife as a gift. she loves it</li>
            <li> Great product!  Lightly scented and feels light and moisturizing on the skin. My face looks and feels younger. My daughter noticed and said my face looks brighter.</li>
            <li> good quality I recommend!</li>
            <li> I only received the night crean, the day cream did not arrive.</li>
            <li> Been using these products for over 2 years.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It works for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the jars are 1/2 empty so i sent theirs back the lady I normally get from hers are full</li>
            <li> I use this cream every day.  It works very well for me.  The company ships in plastic wrap over the cases which are very nice.  I love all the Vivo products.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream that helps hide the little age lines and feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li> Fab price, great product.</li>
