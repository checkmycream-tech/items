            <li>for someone like me that has mild Asthma, it&#x27;s perfect!!</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it at a reduced price on this site!  </li>
            <li>very fresh, slightly sweet and stays forever smell that landed me a title of best smelling guy in my company (in a good way)</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>, she wanted it on HER body; she loved the scent and really enjoyed</li>
            <li>Even I liked it, as a guy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice perfume ,</li>
            <li>I thought it was a girl scent to be honest...</li>
            <li>Issey Miyake is my all time favorite and there&#x27;s good reason...</li>
            <li>I got this for my brother and he really liked it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size and great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I think Issey is slightly better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;HOWEVER, most women like this, and I do too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love when my husband wears it :).  </li>
            <li>And I just love it.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne.  </li>
            <li>Love this for men...not to strong...</li>
            <li>I did like the fact that it shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Not too strong at all.</li>
            <li>It was too strong of a floral smelt too flowery for me.</li>
            <li>So this told me that she liked the scent so much</li>
            <li>I ordered this in the middle of the night as a rush birthday present, but overall, it wasn&#x27;t a GREAT value, just a GOOD one.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>Our comptroller was German woman, very fashionable, friendly and cute.  </li>
            <li>A German woman liked this men&#x27;s cologne, so much that she used it.  </li>
            <li>Thx so much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;European women are much more open about using men&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>Was what I thought when I first sprayed this.</li>
            <li>I guess it was just that first spray.</li>
            <li>I never fail to get a complement when I wear it.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast, came in secure packaging, and for those wondering, the bottle stands about 6 inches tall with the lid on, and is about 2 1/2 inches wide.  </li>
            <li>That fact isn&#x27;t easily seen in the product description (although careful review of the text in the product pictures reveals it).  </li>
            <li>The scent is not real musky or strong.</li>
            <li>and yes it&#x27;s masculine!!</li>
            <li>Arrived early, the box it came in was questionable, bottle was scuffed but &amp;#34;the smell good potion&amp;#34; does exactly what it was supposed to do!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> This is a great scent for men! Both my husband and I liove it!  He&#x27;s been using it for 16 yrs exclusively!  I was so glad to find it at a reduced price on this site!  Thx so much!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a knock off.  The smell was pretty clisr, but not authentic and did not last long.</li>
            <li> Im sorry to inform yall but this was a waste of money.....it dont even smell... Its poor quality. Idvnever buy it online again. Rip off.</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to say about this classic scent,  I have Aqua Di Gio and I think Issey is slightly better.</li>
            <li> Hundreds of wonderful reviews that I don&#x27;t want to duplicate.  Also, it&#x27;s difficult to describe verbally what a scent smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ll just describe how I discovered this scent that I have used for well over ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an American and was working in the U.S.  Our comptroller was German woman, very fashionable, friendly and cute.  This was a high-tech computer company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She smelled great and so I politely asked one day what fragrance she was wearing:  THIS.  And she added without embarrassment:  &amp;#34;pour homme&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;European women are much more open about using men&#x27;s products.  So this told me that she liked the scent so much, she wanted it on HER body; she loved the scent and really enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the bells went off for me:  A German woman liked this men&#x27;s cologne, so much that she used it.  Even I liked it, as a guy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a panty dropper fragrance.  (Oh, did I write that?  So sorry...  delete that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, story of my life - no panty dropper - never found one - women are so f#@%^&amp;g complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, most women like this, and I do too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!  Best, Dan</li>
            <li> they got good excellent</li>
            <li> Good stuff!!! Arrived early, the box it came in was questionable, bottle was scuffed but &amp;#34;the smell good potion&amp;#34; does exactly what it was supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I ordered this in the middle of the night as a rush birthday present, but overall, it wasn&#x27;t a GREAT value, just a GOOD one. One I paid the shipping and handling, I could have just driven to my local Kmart, and saved a few dollars. I did like the fact that it shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> JUST AWSOME!!!!!!  Just ask your partner He or She  will agree</li>
            <li> Not sure if this stuff is fake or just a cheap diluted version of the same cologne at DIllards...etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my bottle dosent last. The two sprays of Eau De Toilette I tried at Dillards lasted all day. This last about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy cologne from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing.  I love when my husband wears it :).  Not too strong at all.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Nice packaging, smells great.</li>
            <li> Nice perfume , and I got it the next day. Pretty cool.  Lol</li>
            <li> nothing from another world...</li>
            <li> very fresh, slightly sweet and stays forever smell that landed me a title of best smelling guy in my company (in a good way) can&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
            <li> Terrible! Was what I thought when I first sprayed this. It was too strong of a floral smelt too flowery for me. I thought it was a girl scent to be honest... but was I ever wrong on that. I guess it was just that first spray. Then scent changed. And I just love it. Its still a floral don&#x27;t get me wrong. But its a great one.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne.  Ive been wearing it since 1996 and haven&#x27;t ever thought about changing.  I get compliments almost every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> Great parfum, Shiped on time. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Issey Miyake is my all time favorite and there&#x27;s good reason...I never fail to get a complement when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Love this for men...not to strong...for someone like me that has mild Asthma, it&#x27;s perfect!! I could smell it all day on my bf!! :~)</li>
            <li> I tried and tried to figure out what actual size this bottle was before ordering but could not seem to get bottle dimensions....just the oz, which told me very little.  So I risked it and ordered it anyway because the seller was the cheapest of everyone on the internet.  It shipped fast, came in secure packaging, and for those wondering, the bottle stands about 6 inches tall with the lid on, and is about 2 1/2 inches wide.  It&#x27;s a nice size and great price, fast shipping. The scent is not real musky or strong. Very nice for a man and yes it&#x27;s masculine!!</li>
            <li> This product is eau de toilette. That fact isn&#x27;t easily seen in the product description (although careful review of the text in the product pictures reveals it).  Note that it is not returnable, if puchased in error, even if not opened.</li>
            <li> I got this for my brother and he really liked it. I do not use perfumes but heard from him that its one of the best perfumes he has ever used..</li>
