            <li>Anybody who knows me knows that I love massages.</li>
            <li>I preferred it on the mattress better because the gel lasted longer.</li>
            <li>Better to use Glycerin or lubricant.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Amazon is wonderful for being a one-stop shop for out-of-the-way items like Nurux Standard Concentration Nuru Massage Gel.</li>
            <li>If you do so, the lubricating property will stay indefinitely and you&#x27;ll get the most satisfying sex / masturbation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a massage therapist, I&#x27;ve used many types of oils and creams In my work.</li>
            <li>its ok</li>
            <li>This stuff is wonderful for super-slippery massages although you occasionally have to add a bit of water to keep it from drying out.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it,</li>
            <li>he&#x27;ll/she&#x27;ll love it so just go for it.</li>
            <li>Nuru jell is very clean and plesent to work with.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome, stays slippery for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I used a warm wash cloth on the part I was going to massage first then added the Nuru.  </li>
            <li>The amazing thing about this Fantastic gel is that it is Very slippery!</li>
            <li>The gel was fine, but the massage was just alright.</li>
            <li>It was fine</li>
            <li>Thanks for the brilliant minds who researched and developed this</li>
            <li>but sure fun to use for \\&quot;massage\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and it is fantastic).  </li>
            <li>but I think it would have been a lot more fun, if we had the air matress.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve heard my gay friends rant about KY or astroglide but never was very impressed, and found them no better than ID.  </li>
            <li>On top of everything, their customer service is top notch and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s the best you can buy; great feel, super slick feel stays for a long time.  </li>
            <li>but we found full nuru massage directions on the nuru slide website.</li>
            <li>wish that these hotels in the us had bigger bathrooms to be able to use the Nuru more comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.....</li>
            <li>It worked great - super slippery and without the sticky residue that I&#x27;ve found with other gels.</li>
            <li>Even though you would think you will run through it quickly</li>
            <li>Product Nuru Gel is indeed slimy but dries rather quickly.</li>
            <li>This product exceeded our expectations and for that, we will continue to be loyal buyers.</li>
            <li>Will not buy again, dries quickly</li>
            <li>it was COOL and fun.</li>
            <li>The limited ingredients list is ideal for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It dries quickly though, it is recommended to use a spray bottle with warm water to maintain the moisture by sprinkling water at regular intervals.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>The product is great, the seller did nice packing and shipping as promissed, my one came few hours earlier by USPS delivery man.</li>
            <li>Fun stuff</li>
            <li>For now, it&#x27;s only a special treat. :)</li>
            <li>The gel arrived super fast</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It also has greater sensitivity, which for me as a circumcised man, this product brought my sex enjoyment back up to speed.</li>
            <li>Maybe the higher quality product of the same name produces better results but for $20.00 go buy Walmarts personal lubricant for $1.87 and get better results.  </li>
            <li>I warmed it in the microwave first (30 secs) and then started the massage.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Shipping from Amazon was fast and the price is right.</li>
            <li>It dries clean and clear, is not sticky and your skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this product is worth trying!</li>
            <li>Breaks down much more quickly than the Platinum, too.</li>
            <li>Your significant other will enjoy it at times ;-)</li>
            <li>Luckily there&#x27;s a lot of gel in the bottle, so that my girl can practice her art a little more, cuz she needs it.</li>
            <li>Or maybe not so pure.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly buy it again...</li>
            <li>I was laughing the whole time while using it because I was sliding everywhere.</li>
            <li>The massage oil drys extremely fast.</li>
            <li>but we really didn&#x27;t have a air mattress or rubber floater....</li>
            <li>and you need to keep reapplying fast.  </li>
            <li>It is all natural and it is refreshing in a way that makes me feel 10 years younger!</li>
            <li>This is one of the few products of its kind that we can use without an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>Unlike oils, it comes off easily, though for the first few minutes of your bath or shower, the slippery qualities of the gel come back, which can make for an interesting experience.</li>
            <li>The gel does not dry quickly and lasts.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for a romantic and fun evening with your boo ; )</li>
            <li>Unlike oils, it has no fragrance or taste (if you do happen to get some into your mouth, it tastes mostly like water with a slight hint of grass).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is superior to the world favourite KY Gel which claims to be the &#x27;closest thing to human natural lubrication&#x27; but Nuru is different, it is more &#x27;gooey&#x27; and stringy as thick saliva, which truly simulates natural genital lubrication.</li>
            <li>Made for a fun and romantic Valentine&#x27;s Day!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking to add spice to their normal routine.</li>
            <li>It is all natural, I am allergic to oils, this seaweed does not harm, it is none sticky after dry out and leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It went dry quickly when applied liberally to the hands and rubbed.  </li>
            <li>Way better than all other personal lubricants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This formulation is too watery, so you have to use 3 times as much to get the same effect.  </li>
            <li>The content is clear condensed gel, mixing with little warm water gives long lasting moisterizer for all body and intimacy.</li>
            <li>the trick is to squeeze a little amount onto your hand, &#x27;cut&#x27; the excess with your fingers and weave it around your hand until the goo clears from the bottle - that&#x27;s how consistent it is!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality, lasts a long time, and the bottle is a value at the price it&#x27;s offered at.</li>
            <li>and I surprised my boyfriend with it last night.</li>
            <li>Very slimy not what I expected.</li>
            <li>Nurux seems almost like real body fluid (it&#x27;s slimy and even a bit stringy), and does eventually dry without stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I recommend this item for wet slippery fun, be careful you dont slide into something you dont want to.</li>
            <li>I tried Nuru not long ago</li>
            <li>One other plus - we have very sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> We haven&#x27;t yet pulled out the air mattress and done the whole slip and slide (but I&#x27;ve done that in the past</li>
            <li> it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It can be a little tricky when you squeeze a small portion straight to your hand as the tub or bottle (depending on the container size) can suck it back in -</li>
            <li> Leaves a feeling like baby powder when completly dry which happens faster than we would have wanted.</li>

            <li> The amazing thing about this Fantastic gel is that it is Very slippery! Not only that, but it also stays wet for a long time without drying! And listen to this: it leaves no residue when it drys! I think that this is THE Perfect massage gel for any massage. It is all natural and it is refreshing in a way that makes me feel 10 years younger!</li>
            <li> Anybody who knows me knows that I love massages. Usually I get Swedish massages and Deep Tissue massages (after tough workouts) from my local spa. When I was talking to the girl who gives me my massages, I was talking about massage techniques and stuff like that. She recommended that I try a Nuru massage for a different experience. She told me I would need Nuru gel for the massage, so I purchased this Nuru gel and had my husband apply it based on the directions on the website ([...]). Best massage I ever had. If I could get my husband to give me a massage using this gel every day, I would be so happy. For now, it&#x27;s only a special treat. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered some nuru gel after hearing about it on another website. The gel arrived super fast and I surprised my boyfriend with it last night. It worked great - super slippery and without the sticky residue that I&#x27;ve found with other gels. We tried it both in the shower and on an air mattress. I preferred it on the mattress better because the gel lasted longer. There aren&#x27;t instructions on the bottle but we found full nuru massage directions on the nuru slide website.</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle after hearing about Nuru Gel on sirius. It turned out to be a lot of fun. I was laughing the whole time while using it because I was sliding everywhere. I will definitely be getting another bottle soon.</li>
            <li> Very slimy not what I expected.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I absolutely love the Nuru Slide Gel and will soon be buying more! There is no scent or taste to it.  There is also no greasy or oily film leftover.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My girl is taking classes to become a massage therapist. In class they go over different types of massages and massage techniques. She learned about Nuru massage and wanted to try it out on me, so I bought this gel for it. The gel was fine, but the massage was just alright. Luckily there&#x27;s a lot of gel in the bottle, so that my girl can practice her art a little more, cuz she needs it. LOL.</li>
            <li> Holy moly!!! This is a must try... atleast once!!! You will never forget it ! It is AMAZING!!!! I AM HOOKED!</li>
            <li> great stuff, I would used it on my girlfriend and she loved it....wish that these hotels in the us had bigger bathrooms to be able to use the Nuru more comfortable.</li>
            <li> After watching many nuru videos I decided to surprise my boyfriend with his own nuru massage...complete with shower...jacuzzi...and plastic covered mattress...this gel is the absolute best lubricant, massage gel there is...there is no taste what so ever and no odor...I have already repurchased!!! Highly recommended for a romantic and fun evening with your boo ; )</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  For years I&#x27;ve heard my gay friends rant about KY or astroglide but never was very impressed, and found them no better than ID.  Our friend that runs a fetish store got us to try a bottle of Jo, which was definitely better than KY or astroglide, but I still found the preservatives in it irritating, and it had that annoying sticky-ness afterward.  Nurux seems almost like real body fluid (it&#x27;s slimy and even a bit stringy), and does eventually dry without stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it&#x27;s hard to get this out of the bottle with one hand because it&#x27;s stringy meaning you&#x27;ll likely make a mess if you reach for it with one hand as you support your self with your other-hand over your partner.</li>
            <li> The product is great, the seller did nice packing and shipping as promissed, my one came few hours earlier by USPS delivery man. The content is clear condensed gel, mixing with little warm water gives long lasting moisterizer for all body and intimacy. It is all natural, I am allergic to oils, this seaweed does not harm, it is none sticky after dry out and leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly as intended. Even though you would think you will run through it quickly it lasts for a long time. Strongly recommend to get this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product cause I was referred to it and we only use it during intimacy and its awesum.</li>
            <li> This is it!  Slippery!  Not the best for massage but sure fun to use for \\&quot;massage\\&quot;. Leaves a feeling like baby powder when completly dry which happens faster than we would have wanted. Fun stuff but oil lasts longer.  Also when you take a shower the next day it \\&quot;reactivates\\&quot; and your slick again!    Try it. Your significant other will enjoy it at times ;-)</li>
            <li> Product Nuru Gel is indeed slimy but dries rather quickly. 1 bottle is not sufficient for one massage as you need to keep reapplying. When mixed with a little water like instructions say to do, it becomes very thin and dries even faster. Too expensive for what it is. Better to use Glycerin or lubricant.</li>
            <li> All I can say is try it, you wont be disappointed. If you are, then I bet nothing satisfies you. ;)</li>
            <li> This stuff is just as advertised.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s the best you can buy; great feel, super slick feel stays for a long time.  On top of everything, their customer service is top notch and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> The massage oil drys extremely fast. You have to use a lot to get a good layer on the skin. It&#x27;s not bad..... But, it&#x27;s not good.&lt;br /&gt;You could give it a shot, I mean...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not to expensive.</li>
            <li> Or maybe not so pure.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t yet pulled out the air mattress and done the whole slip and slide (but I&#x27;ve done that in the past and it is fantastic).  But my GF and I have used this in the shower, bathtub and after a bath just fooling around and really, really liked it!</li>
            <li> Total waste of money, slippy for 2 minutes then dries up, and leaves skin tacky, and irritated</li>
            <li> Amazon is wonderful for being a one-stop shop for out-of-the-way items like Nurux Standard Concentration Nuru Massage Gel. Additionally the price is competitive.</li>
            <li> I tried Nuru not long ago and I can tell you, by far, it is the best sex lubricant ever. It is superior to the world favourite KY Gel which claims to be the &#x27;closest thing to human natural lubrication&#x27; but Nuru is different, it is more &#x27;gooey&#x27; and stringy as thick saliva, which truly simulates natural genital lubrication. It can be a little tricky when you squeeze a small portion straight to your hand as the tub or bottle (depending on the container size) can suck it back in - the trick is to squeeze a little amount onto your hand, &#x27;cut&#x27; the excess with your fingers and weave it around your hand until the goo clears from the bottle - that&#x27;s how consistent it is!  It dries quickly though, it is recommended to use a spray bottle with warm water to maintain the moisture by sprinkling water at regular intervals. If you do so, the lubricating property will stay indefinitely and you&#x27;ll get the most satisfying sex / masturbation. It also has greater sensitivity, which for me as a circumcised man, this product brought my sex enjoyment back up to speed. Thanks for the brilliant minds who researched and developed this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peterpetros</li>
            <li> Great service and product</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, stays slippery for a long time.  I recommend this item for wet slippery fun, be careful you dont slide into something you dont want to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist, I&#x27;ve used many types of oils and creams In my work. Nuru jell is very clean and plesent to work with.</li>
            <li> This product does not do what you would expect.....which is stay slippery for a message.  It went dry quickly when applied liberally to the hands and rubbed.  Maybe the higher quality product of the same name produces better results but for $20.00 go buy Walmarts personal lubricant for $1.87 and get better results.  Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> Hummm crazy stuff its ok you would have use a lot of this to make it so it does not dry out quick!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this to give the wife a massage.  I warmed it in the microwave first (30 secs) and then started the massage.  I used a warm wash cloth on the part I was going to massage first then added the Nuru.  It is very good massages, I recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product....I love it!</li>
            <li> iv looked everywhere for something nsimilar, but NOTHING compares! You have to try this once in a life time product!</li>
            <li> I have not used this item yet, but the expiration date is only 2 1/2 months away!  Disappointed, thought I could use this longer than that.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful for super-slippery massages although you occasionally have to add a bit of water to keep it from drying out. It is completely odorless and tasteless so it makes a great lube for, uh, all kinds of things. Way better than all other personal lubricants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> This massage liquid is truly odorless, tasteless, and water soluble.  A small amount goes a long way and remains slippery.</li>
            <li> Wow! This is the very best lubricant my wife and I have found for partner or solo sex. It stays slippery, but you can add a bit of water if needed and it &amp;#34;renews&amp;#34; itself. We have used it for about two years and will continue to order it over and over. It dries clean and clear, is not sticky and your skin feels soft and smooth. Shipping from Amazon was fast and the price is right. Try it...you&#x27;ll not be disappointed</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about this, don&#x27;t wait, just do it. It&#x27;s a great massage gel. Unlike oils, it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain. Unlike oils, it has no fragrance or taste (if you do happen to get some into your mouth, it tastes mostly like water with a slight hint of grass). Unlike oils, it comes off easily, though for the first few minutes of your bath or shower, the slippery qualities of the gel come back, which can make for an interesting experience. ;) Also, unlike most oils, Nuru gel isn&#x27;t just good for enhancing massages... ;) Seriously, this stuff is amazing. You&#x27;ll love it, he&#x27;ll/she&#x27;ll love it so just go for it.</li>
            <li> We LOVE this product and are repeat buyers! It&#x27;s high quality, lasts a long time, and the bottle is a value at the price it&#x27;s offered at. The gel does not dry quickly and lasts. This product exceeded our expectations and for that, we will continue to be loyal buyers. One other plus - we have very sensitive skin. This is one of the few products of its kind that we can use without an allergic reaction. If you have sensitive skin, this product is worth trying! The limited ingredients list is ideal for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Made for a fun and romantic Valentine&#x27;s Day! I would recommend this to anyone looking to add spice to their normal routine.</li>
            <li> This was great stuff....but we really didn&#x27;t have a air mattress or rubber floater....so used plastic table clothes on the floor. It was fine but I think it would have been a lot more fun, if we had the air matress. I would certainly buy it again...it was COOL and fun. Didn&#x27;t leave a odor or stain on our bodies or anywhere else....made for EASY cleanup!</li>
            <li> All the Fun of a Nuru massage without the sticky mess that other nuru gels on the market  tend to have. My girlfriend and I loved it</li>
            <li> Spend the extra bucks for the Platinum version.  This formulation is too watery, so you have to use 3 times as much to get the same effect.  Breaks down much more quickly than the Platinum, too.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  Will not buy again, dries quickly and you need to keep reapplying fast.  Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This device came broken in the packaging that i received it it, horrible box and the product&#x27;s contained was cracked and had to throw away, just horrible</li>
            <li> This product was not what we expected at all. It became too tacky in a short amount of time. Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
