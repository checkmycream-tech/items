            <li>I love it when i can stand the smell</li>
            <li>I have even purchased the entire line of products as a show of support for this awesome company.</li>
            <li>I really love the smell of this toner.</li>
            <li>I was just experimenting but fell instantly in love.</li>
            <li>I love the coconut water toner.  </li>
            <li>Love my coco toner.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love this coconut water face toner and my husband is hooked on it too.</li>
            <li>During the summer I keep it in the refrigerator for a nice cool spritz.</li>
            <li>Provides a super refreshing blast of moisture to my skin after I shower.</li>
            <li>I have really come to love the Alaffia products!</li>
            <li>I have very dry very fair skin</li>
            <li>The sprayer sprays such a nice fine mist that is so refreshing.</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin clean and moist.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and the large size is a plus.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use the whole line.  </li>
            <li>It really freshen things ups and smells phenomenal.</li>
            <li>It has a mild coconut smell.  </li>
            <li>We are making our household more chemical free and natural.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but I love this product so much that I was compelled to write one.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing (and only for a moment) and drys quickly.  </li>
            <li>I also have one of the everyday shea body washes which is also great.</li>
            <li>Very affordable for a huge bottle.</li>
            <li>This company offers such a great variety of things.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff too, though some find it too &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; - to me it has a light sweet scent, not very coconut-y</li>
            <li>If you are into essential oils, this is great to use with oils for added skin nourishment because it is so basic.  </li>
            <li>I let it sit for a second after sprayed and lightly pat it into my skin with clean fingertips.</li>
            <li>I use this daily after I cleanse my face and before my moisturizer which helps my skin absorb the moisturizer even better.</li>
            <li>The nozzle on this bottle gives a nice wide coverage.</li>
            <li>I have had this product a few times, but the last time I bought it, its smelled incredibly rotten, and i think this depends on the amount or strength of neem in the product, which seems to change bottle to bottle.  </li>
            <li>Just received this product the other day so far so good.  </li>
            <li>My skin is tighter without feeling dry and more supple without being oily.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice moisturizing without feeling heavy, and a very generous amount for the price!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You can find this product much cheaper on Vitacost or even Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>have much to wash off anyways.</li>
            <li>A friend I just met who is an older actress recommended this to me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I just bought this face toner, among other products for my face and skin, and I love them so far.</li>
            <li>I love Everyday Coconut Face night cream, cleanser, toner, and eye cream.  </li>
            <li>The only time it did was when I over exfoliated with a sponge, but other than that it feels great, smells good, and as far as I can tell using it in conjunction with the face creams and wash has helped keep my face cleaner and when I break out it&#x27;s not as bad as before and is instead much improved.</li>
            <li>New favorites.</li>
            <li>but smell is tiny bit funny</li>
            <li>The main reasons I love this product are that I have acne-prone skin, and I use this stuff at least 10x a day for a quick refresh, both under and over make-up, and it helps to control my oil as well as prevent breakouts due to the neem in this.</li>
            <li>I have also sprayed directly onto my face and rubbed in with my fingers, but I like the cotton ball technique as it keeps my fingers off my face.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>I am now completely reliant on this product.  </li>
            <li>All natural, non-irritating, no heavy perfume scents.</li>
            <li>As the parent of two children I can say with certainty that this stuff smells like a two day old pee-pee diaper.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin that is also acne prone</li>
    </ol>

            <li> When the balance is off and the neem is too strong, watch out, you will feel like you stuck your head in a garbage truck for an hour or so, its really too bad neem smells that way!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve only ever received compliments on the smell, which goes away after just a few seconds, but if I spray myself at the office, people always say &amp;#34;Mmm</li>
            <li> other toners have when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Part of my everyday regiment.</li>
            <li> and I usually have breakouts every month, so its quite the challenge to find something that helps.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely hated the smell.</li>
            <li> Disgusting smell.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27; care for it, very strong artificial scent.</li>
            <li> like it but smell is tiny bit funny</li>
            <li> Provides a super refreshing blast of moisture to my skin after I shower. I spritz a cotton ball with a 4-5 sprays, and rub it all over my face to apply. I have also sprayed directly onto my face and rubbed in with my fingers, but I like the cotton ball technique as it keeps my fingers off my face.</li>
            <li> This is a Wonderful face Toner!  Keeps your skin clean and moist.  It has a mild coconut smell.  Love it!</li>

            <li> Love the way this smells!&lt;br /&gt;lightly moisturizes skin! perfect for combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;works great after face wash as a toner.</li>
            <li> The best toner.  I have never been a fan of toner until I tried this one.  My skin has never felt softer or has smelled so good!  I have tried everything from expensive department store brands to cheap Target brands.  I love Everyday Coconut Face night cream, cleanser, toner, and eye cream.  I am obsessed.  And it is just an amazing company.  I am in love and a customer/advocate for life.</li>

I love it when i can stand the smell, my face is really at its best and I usually have breakouts every month, so its quite the challenge to find something that helps.

            <li> I bought this after a glowing review from ToneItUp.com thinking - I&#x27;ll try it.  I am now completely reliant on this product.  It has dramatically changed my skin which vasilates from oily to dry.  It smells amazing (and only for a moment) and drys quickly.  My skin is tighter without feeling dry and more supple without being oily.  I highly recommend this!  I even use it over my make-up to take away an oily sheen at the end of a day!  I have even purchased the entire line of products as a show of support for this awesome company.</li>
            <li> works easily and has a pleasant smell</li>
            <li> Great and refreshing product!</li>
            <li> A friend I just met who is an older actress recommended this to me. She looks GREAT!! I have been using it for two weeks and can already see a difference. Your skin just drinks it up. Non drying!! I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product and use the whole line.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just received this product the other day so far so good.  Smells great!</li>
            <li> Alaffia makes great products and this one is no exception. All natural, non-irritating, no heavy perfume scents. My skin loves this! Will order again.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this toner. I actually use it as a room and linen spray too. It really freshen things ups and smells phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I bought this toner along with the everyday coconut daily face lotion spf 15 recently at whole foods. I was just experimenting but fell instantly in love. New favorites. I also have one of the everyday shea body washes which is also great.</li>
            <li> I have really come to love the Alaffia products! We are making our household more chemical free and natural. I love coconut and how great it is for your skin and hair. This company offers such a great variety of things. I just bought this face toner, among other products for my face and skin, and I love them so far. They absorb nicely into the skin and there is no greasy residue! My skin feels great! I would recommend these for sure!</li>
            <li> Disgusting smell. As the parent of two children I can say with certainty that this stuff smells like a two day old pee-pee diaper. It smells so gross that I cannot use it outside the house.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use it. I absolutely hated the smell. Can&#x27;t review if it is an actually good toner. But the smell is horrendous</li>
            <li> I love the coconut water toner.  When I had my last facial I was told to use coconut water products.  This toner feels great when I use it.</li>
            <li> Whenever I mist this toner on my face, I feel like I&#x27;m in heaven. It smells so good and feels light on my skin. It&#x27;s refreshing and the large size is a plus. Love my coco toner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 2 weeks now.  After cleansing your face - spray this on.  It feels so good.  It doesn&#x27;t have a coconut smell - I personally don&#x27;t like coconuts.  My skin does feel softer.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I love this product so much that I was compelled to write one. This stuff is amazing! So lightweight and it smells great. The sprayer sprays such a nice fine mist that is so refreshing. I love the smell of this stuff too, though some find it too &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; - to me it has a light sweet scent, not very coconut-y though if you are hoping for that. But I&#x27;ve only ever received compliments on the smell, which goes away after just a few seconds, but if I spray myself at the office, people always say &amp;#34;Mmm what is that?&amp;#34;. The main reasons I love this product are that I have acne-prone skin, and I use this stuff at least 10x a day for a quick refresh, both under and over make-up, and it helps to control my oil as well as prevent breakouts due to the neem in this. It also just feels great on the skin. I keep a bottle at work on my desk and a bottle at home in the fridge at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find this product much cheaper on Vitacost or even Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Love this. Very affordable for a huge bottle. I have pretty dry skin that is also acne prone and this is moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t break me out. It feels good on the skin, not sticky, nice light coconut smell. I like to use it in place of a cleanser when my skin is really dry and I&#x27;m not wearing makeup/don&#x27;t have much to wash off anyways.</li>
            <li> Love this coconut water face toner and my husband is hooked on it too. I use this daily after I cleanse my face and before my moisturizer which helps my skin absorb the moisturizer even better. I also use it as a refresher whenever I&#x27;m at home and my skin is feeling dry. The nozzle on this bottle gives a nice wide coverage. I hold my bottle about 6-8 inches in front of my face and spray the upper and lower parts of my face. I let it sit for a second after sprayed and lightly pat it into my skin with clean fingertips. During the summer I keep it in the refrigerator for a nice cool spritz.</li>
            <li> Part of my everyday regiment.</li>
            <li> I of course use this in conjunction with the face wash, and it doesn&#x27;t burn my face like other toners have when I put it on. The only time it did was when I over exfoliated with a sponge, but other than that it feels great, smells good, and as far as I can tell using it in conjunction with the face creams and wash has helped keep my face cleaner and when I break out it&#x27;s not as bad as before and is instead much improved.</li>
