            <li>Wife&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>Great price since you are receiving 3 perfumes...</li>
            <li>Great try me set...</li>
            <li>The scents are amazing, and the price is great!</li>
            <li>The Inis Or and Inis Moonlight give a lovely twist to an already wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>have gotten many compliments on these perfumes!</li>
            <li>so I can fit them in my travel bag when I fly.  </li>
            <li>Nice smelling but for me...</li>
            <li>Nice packaging.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for and arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li>They are very light and not intrusive.</li>
            <li>Love all 3 products...</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Inis.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t decide which is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t yet decided on one Ilike better.</li>
            <li>The inside top comes off and becomes stuck in the top.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.  </li>
            <li>Ideal way to try out the different Inis scents.</li>
            <li>I love having a little bit of each one to mix things up and these all smell wonderful on anyone.</li>
            <li>I love the Inis Or - regular Inis is still great of course but the moonlight is stinky - not my fav old lady gag but nice glass bottles and worth the cost</li>
            <li>Just lovely scents so clean and pretty.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s also uni-sex and not too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>I bought Inis Or a while back and loved the cologne.  </li>
            <li>Unique crisp scents, will buy again!</li>
            <li>Very fun trio, cost is just as much in Ireland</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY strong &amp; my husband personally did not care for it on me.  </li>
            <li>I usually wear Opium but the Inis Or is great for every day.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Love the set, good price but not sure if I will order again as this was my second order</li>
            <li>Just the right size if you want to take a nice scent along with you for travel, or just in your purse, or if you want to give it a try without committing to a huge, expensive bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a fresh smell - really reminds you of the ocean.</li>
            <li>Love this little pack of perfumes.</li>
            <li>I love that these come in the small sample sizes</li>
            <li>No other words for it.  </li>

            <li> have gotten many compliments on these perfumes! Especially love the Inis-energy of the sea.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. One of my wife&#x27;s favorites (and mine...)</li>
            <li> Nice smelling but for me... It&#x27;s VERY strong &amp; my husband personally did not care for it on me.  Nice packaging.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> I love the Inis Or - regular Inis is still great of course but the moonlight is stinky - not my fav old lady gag but nice glass bottles and worth the cost</li>
            <li> Love all 3 products... Great price since you are receiving 3 perfumes... Great try me set... I will be ordering again...</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Inis. It&#x27;s such a fresh smell - really reminds you of the ocean. I like that it&#x27;s also uni-sex and not too sweet smelling. It&#x27;s a perfect summer scent. The Inis Or and Inis Moonlight give a lovely twist to an already wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I went to Ireland and bought some of these scents.  I love that these come in the small sample sizes so I can fit them in my travel bag when I fly.  Just lovely scents so clean and pretty.</li>
            <li> I bought Inis Or a while back and loved the cologne.  I usually wear Opium but the Inis Or is great for every day.  I love the scent.  So I bought the three pack and the Inis and Moonlight both are excellent colognes too.</li>
            <li> Love this little pack of perfumes. Each scent has a uniqueness to it. Can&#x27;t decide which is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li> These are truly Irish fragrances from Ireland. The box set will last you at least a year (my last order did). I always get a compliment. They are very light and not intrusive. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Ideal way to try out the different Inis scents. I don&#x27;t believe there are any of the three I don&#x27;t like in this set. A little goes a long way with these scents as they seem to last without needing to be refreshed frequently. Haven&#x27;t yet decided on one Ilike better.</li>
            <li> Just the right size if you want to take a nice scent along with you for travel, or just in your purse, or if you want to give it a try without committing to a huge, expensive bottle.  This sampler is perfect!  Plus it&#x27;s from Ireland, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> Love the set, good price but not sure if I will order again as this was my second order and I had the same problem both times. The inside top comes off and becomes stuck in the top. Both are made thin metal.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells. Its hard to find. Glad I bought it. I plan on using it often.</li>
            <li> Very fun trio, cost is just as much in Ireland so well priced for the US</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.  No other words for it.  The scents are amazing, and the price is great!</li>
            <li> Inis and Inis Moonlight were already favorites. ..can now add Inis Or to that as well.  Great price and just the perfect size to bring everywhere with you.</li>
            <li> I love having a little bit of each one to mix things up and these all smell wonderful on anyone.</li>
            <li> Unique crisp scents, will buy again! Perfect travel size also.</li>
