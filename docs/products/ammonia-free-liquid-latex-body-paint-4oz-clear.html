            <li>And whatever you do, make sure you shave any area that you apply it to, because if you don&#x27;t it feels like a waxing when you peel it off.</li>
            <li>So happy I spent more money on an ammonia-free based latex!</li>

            <li>Originally I bought Mehron flesh colored to do a mask.</li>
            <li>It was perfect for my Halloween mask that scared the doody out of everyone who came walked past me.</li>

            <li>It comes off clean.</li>
            <li>It A Special Type Of Lotion.</li>
            <li>Also if you do it near a sink, make sure you clean it out after you apply for makeup!</li>
            <li>YOU EYE (IT Was So Cool)</li>
            <li>Next Year &amp; A Good Possibility</li>
            <li>4oz might not seem like much, but it is more than I will ever need.</li>
            <li>Free Lip Wax Right...??</li>
            <li>CAME OFF PRETTY EASY TOO.</li>
            <li>It was a decent type of liquid latex but not my favorite</li>
            <li>This Quick</li>
            <li>Also SO Many Colors To Choose From Even Stuff Made Directly For Kids!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, it gets the job done and is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>It comes right off, and is not painful at all.</li>
            <li>WAS WAY TO MUCH!!</li>
            <li>it is ammonia free, considering I work a lot with liquid latex, but this drips way too much.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>My 5 year old is into costume makeup so this has fit her needs for a while now!</li>
            <li>Extremely watery which is a good thing</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>It smells a little like tuna fish when applying, but smells better than the ones with ammonia for sure.</li>
            <li>This stuff is perfect for zombie makeup because it is a little thicker than regular liquid latex.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping - Item is exactly as it was described!</li>
            <li>The seller accidently gave me the purple liquid latex body paint, when I had ordered the clear one (which on my part, I thought was white) and was super kind to offer to send me the clear one, free of charge.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend It!!</li>
            <li>It Even Is Able To Let Things Stick On Your Body Or GO For A Color &amp; Actually Do Body Paint Like Kim Zolciak Biermann</li>
            <li>MY FIANCE HAD AND DIDNT USE MUCH!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome product that shouldn&#x27;t be trifled so carelessly.</li>
            <li>I was able to create super realistic bullet wounds and scars on my baby sister who equally was called &amp;#34;ugly&amp;#34; with her costume.</li>
            <li>I really hope the color doesn&#x27;t matter to you or your project.</li>
            <li>SO I Went Straight To The Source....</li>
            <li>How  Much Product I Could Get.</li>
            <li>SO The Big Thing Here Is Ammonia Free</li>
            <li>Well Thanks All</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Also, this stuff is capable of ripping out body hair, so I recommend shaving any area where you are planning on using it.</li>
            <li>I had ordered this product on the 18th of February and got it on the 23rd, so really fast shipping (it was supposed to come on the 25th).</li>
            <li>this works very well.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s my new favorite liquid latex, however, the cost is somewhat, yet not much of an issue when you&#x27;re looking for quality to this.</li>
            <li>Peels off like bandaid, doesn&#x27;t hurt but doesn&#x27;t feel pleasent, especially with more facial hair/ body hair to stick to.</li>
            <li>, it sticks well, it dries quickly and even though its only 4oz, there is plenty!</li>
            <li>I Ended Up At The Main Source</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone trying to create realistic looking flesh wounds.</li>
            <li>Tight &amp; Put It Up In A Safe</li>
            <li>You Face Feels Amazingly Soft!!</li>
            <li>Finally, I would recommend putting down protective skin salve before using the product, as it is quite a bear to remove (however, warm, soapy water and some patience - and pain tolerance - should do the trick).</li>
            <li>there is a slight smell but it goes away as soon as it dries, I love this for my professional halloween makeup, its a must have and you cant beat the price.</li>
            <li>It was easy to layer with toilet paper and tore to create the appearance of actual torn flesh.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product for my purposes and the cost is quite reasonable once you realize that a little can go a long way.</li>
            <li>I Was Able To Get The 16oz Clear &amp; Body Prep For Less Price!</li>
            <li>But It Was Directly From The Dealer!</li>
            <li>As A Thin Liquid SO Apply Lightly On The Foam Brush!!</li>
            <li>Dries fast, especially when done near a heated lamp.</li>
            <li>On skin, it was clear.</li>
            <li>Instead Of buying 3 Or 4 4oz Of Clear Here</li>
            <li>I bought the clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as durability, it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li>Cause It MIGHT Help Those With Sensitive Skin??</li>
            <li>So BOO to the huge mess I had to clean up after and waste of product.</li>
            <li>As said in its right, not much of an odor is released that can cause irritation, to those with sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li>You Barely Notice It &amp; Your Into The Grove Of Things!!</li>
            <li>It goes on white and as it dries, it starts to turn clear.</li>
            <li>The latex paints on white and dries clear.</li>
            <li>So I ordered the clear and while yes I did technically get a latex body paint</li>
            <li>wow does it smell when you open the jar it comes in!  </li>
            <li>But, because it&#x27;s so thin, you need more layers.</li>
            <li>As the title suggests, this liquid latex is much thinner and runnier than other brands.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent for use as a base coat when swatching nail polish and as a mask when doing messy nail art techniques, plus it&#x27;s a better value than what&#x27;s being offered through various small nail polish vendors!</li>
            <li>It even held up my boyfriend&#x27;s devil horns, and those were nearly a foot long!</li>
            <li>Aside from that, this applys evenly, and does indeed dry clear, and glossy.</li>
            <li>It can cause itching and burning if applied directly to areas with hair after it&#x27;s dry, and peeling it off of areas with hair is akin to getting a wax, so I would recommend shaving or applying a layer of Vaseline before applying latex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Instead Of buying 3 Or 4 4oz Of Clear Here</li>
            <li> I bought the clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as durability, it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> Cause It MIGHT Help Those With Sensitive Skin??</li>
            <li> So BOO to the huge mess I had to clean up after and waste of product.</li>
            <li> As said in its right, not much of an odor is released that can cause irritation, to those with sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li> You Barely Notice It &amp; Your Into The Grove Of Things!!</li>
            <li> It goes on white and as it dries, it starts to turn clear.</li>
            <li> The latex paints on white and dries clear.</li>
            <li> So I ordered the clear and while yes I did technically get a latex body paint</li>
            <li> wow does it smell when you open the jar it comes in!  </li>
            <li> But, because it&#x27;s so thin, you need more layers.</li>
            <li> As the title suggests, this liquid latex is much thinner and runnier than other brands.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for use as a base coat when swatching nail polish and as a mask when doing messy nail art techniques, plus it&#x27;s a better value than what&#x27;s being offered through various small nail polish vendors!</li>
            <li> It even held up my boyfriend&#x27;s devil horns, and those were nearly a foot long!</li>
            <li> Aside from that, this applys evenly, and does indeed dry clear, and glossy.</li>
            <li> It can cause itching and burning if applied directly to areas with hair after it&#x27;s dry, and peeling it off of areas with hair is akin to getting a wax, so I would recommend shaving or applying a layer of Vaseline before applying latex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a hard time opening the jar at first</li>
            <li> Flat</li>
            <li> Small product, little costly, but it definitely has a loyal fan.</li>
            <li> To Dry Before You Start The Next Layer!!</li>
            <li> if you do get this, be careful when you open it.</li>
            <li> As Long As You Use Body Prep Before Putting On The Liquid Latex.</li>
            <li> This Stuff Goes A Long Way</li>
            <li> You will still have to peel off some excess, but as long as you wash the brush</li>
            <li> The bottle is way smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Also, It didn&#x27;t come sealed, so be very careful when you open it.</li>
            <li> To Dry</li>
            <li> The 2 Day UPS &amp; Limited Way</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as clear as I thought it would be, when it dries, but I usually apply makeup over it, so it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With toilet paper, it dried to a yellow color.</li>
            <li> This little jar will last me quite some time!</li>
            <li> 32oz Made Things Difficult &amp; Was Very Unsure About There Recent Shipping Accidents &amp; The Cost Of Shipping</li>
            <li> just be careful when opening it.</li>
            <li> Quickly Don&#x27;t Drag Out The Process</li>
            <li> A little bit of this stuff goes a long way!</li>
            <li> If you do not wash the wet latex off of the brush as soon as you are done applying it, it will never come off!</li>
            <li> Since I use it for my nails I pour it into an empty nail polish bottle - when I open the polish bottle, I hardly notice the smell then</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell that bad despite what all the videos claimed, it works so well, and it hardly takes any to get the job done; I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> So It Looks Hidden</li>
            <li> But Not The Big Ones Use The Small Ones!!</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a fishy smell, but it goes away when dried.</li>
            <li> It basically had gelled into one big latex lump with a thin liquid around it.</li>
            <li> So Sorry Amazon Not Enough Choices!!</li>
            <li> If Your Wondering &amp; Looking For Something That Regular Latex Does Such As Making Open Wounds &amp; Gory Bloody Things.</li>
            <li> It reeks to high heaven, but not so bad once it dries.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for small children just because I had a hard time getting mine to sit through having the stinky stuff slathered all over her</li>
            <li> Hardly any smell at all and whatever smell</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re gonna give me the choice of picking a color you should at least give me that color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I placed my order late on a Sunday night, and the stuff arrived with Wednesday&#x27;s mail.</li>
            <li> At Least You&#x27;ll Get A</li>
            <li> But By The 2nd Layer Its Not As Bad</li>
            <li> I use this as a base coat for swatching of nail polishes, or to apply near my cuticles, to reduce the amount of cleanup.</li>

            <li> The smell is not to bad, but It wouldn&#x27;t go away even after I took off the latex.</li>
            <li> I never knew liquid latex smelled this bad!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Easy to use and wonderful! So happy I spent more money on an ammonia-free based latex!</li>
            <li> Good for Halloween look.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very easy to apply and remove. The only downside to it for me was the smell! Would recommend and buy again :)</li>
            <li> It goes on white and as it dries, it starts to turn clear. I used it for a film shoot. Creepy looking when it peels off!</li>
            <li> As the title suggests, this liquid latex is much thinner and runnier than other brands. It also has a very strong smell of chemicals. When it dries, this goes away. But, because it&#x27;s so thin, you need more layers. More layers means more drying time. The chemical smell is also somewhat troubling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, it gets the job done and is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use around my cuticles when I do nail art (stamping or water marbling). I love this stuff. Since I use it for my nails I pour it into an empty nail polish bottle - when I open the polish bottle, I hardly notice the smell then -but wow does it smell when you open the jar it comes in!  The latex paints on white and dries clear.</li>
            <li> So I ordered the clear and while yes I did technically get a latex body paint I got purple which is not what I ordered I figure if you&#x27;re gonna give me the choice of picking a color you should at least give me that color.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to order this I really hope the color doesn&#x27;t matter to you or your project.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for use as a base coat when swatching nail polish and as a mask when doing messy nail art techniques, plus it&#x27;s a better value than what&#x27;s being offered through various small nail polish vendors!</li>
            <li> Used this to do a zipper face costume. I did a practice run and thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work...the zipper wasn&#x27;t sticking to my skin...but I just needed to give it a minute to start drying and get sticky. Hardly any smell at all and whatever smell I did notice faded very quickly. Zipper stuck all night, even in the rain. Peeling it off was as easy as pulling a bandaid.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked perfect for the FX makeup I was doing (I was doing a zombie theme this year) but it stunk something AWFUL. Not recommended for small children just because I had a hard time getting mine to sit through having the stinky stuff slathered all over her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as durability, it&#x27;s alright. It lasted all night. Didn&#x27;t peel or anything, and didn&#x27;t leave any noticable residue on the skin when peeled off. Just don&#x27;t get it in your hair! lol</li>
            <li> I placed my order late on a Sunday night, and the stuff arrived with Wednesday&#x27;s mail. It reeks to high heaven, but not so bad once it dries. It did what I wanted it to do with my Halloween costume. What can I say? I got no complaints.</li>
            <li> I like that fact it is ammonia free, considering I work a lot with liquid latex, but this drips way too much. Maybe I got a bad one, but the one I got almost had the consistency of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you do get this, be careful when you open it. I had a hard time opening the jar at first and when I finally got it open, a lot of it splashed out. So BOO to the huge mess I had to clean up after and waste of product.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit wierd when applying, dries just fine. Did zipper face for halloween, lots of layers appllied but still have so much left. Peels off like bandaid, doesn&#x27;t hurt but doesn&#x27;t feel pleasent, especially with more facial hair/ body hair to stick to. Very good product. Dries fast, especially when done near a heated lamp.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my zombie Costume! Just don&#x27;t use it on any part of your body that has hair IE eyebrows,mustache, eyelashes, sideburns. It&#x27;s worse than pulling off a band aid! But this stuff works great! Also if you do it near a sink, make sure you clean it out after you apply for makeup! It hardens up quick!</li>
            <li> So many fun things to do with this product. Still finding more each time I use it. And I have been using it for everything. I do a lot of crafting and it makes a great stiffener or sealer depending what I am working with.</li>
            <li> It was a decent type of liquid latex but not my favorite</li>
            <li> Originally I bought Mehron flesh colored to do a mask. Then I realized that was a mistake. Turning over to this brand which I hadn&#x27;t ever heard of and was worried for, this ended up pulling through (and not smelling as bad). With toilet paper, it dried to a yellow color. On skin, it was clear. It was perfect for my Halloween mask that scared the doody out of everyone who came walked past me. I was able to create super realistic bullet wounds and scars on my baby sister who equally was called &amp;#34;ugly&amp;#34; with her costume. Small product, little costly, but it definitely has a loyal fan. I would buy this product again and again despite the price to size ratio. It even held up my boyfriend&#x27;s devil horns, and those were nearly a foot long!</li>
            <li> A little runny, but when used correctly it&#x27;s perfect for what I needed it for, deff would purchase again</li>
            <li> Extremely watery which is a good thing just be careful when opening it. Im a actor in haunted houses and im involved in zombie crawls that take place in warm weather and I gotta say this liquid latex is awesome once I put it on it was ON I was sweating running moving around and it stayed put</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness this is amazing, it sticks well, it dries quickly and even though its only 4oz, there is plenty! there is a slight smell but it goes away as soon as it dries, I love this for my professional halloween makeup, its a must have and you cant beat the price. I would buy this again, and again and again!</li>
            <li> This liquid latex worked incredibly well to create zombie bite wounds on my neck and face. It was easy to layer with toilet paper and tore to create the appearance of actual torn flesh. I would highly recommend this product to anyone trying to create realistic looking flesh wounds. Oh, and the smell is gross, but not overpowering. Finally, I would recommend putting down protective skin salve before using the product, as it is quite a bear to remove (however, warm, soapy water and some patience - and pain tolerance - should do the trick).</li>
            <li> Ok So I Started Looking Into Latex Because Of My Daughter. I Ran Across This Stuff &amp; Read The Reviews. It Look Like This Was So Much Better &amp; It NOT Having Ammonia Helped Me Make My Decision!! It Was 2 Days Before Halloween &amp; I Needed This Quick But The Reviews About The Company Who Ships This Made Me Iffy &amp; Body Prep Was Much More Difficult To Find On Amazon But I Did Find It! Here It Is...http://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Latex-Fashions-Clean-Finishing/dp/B003BEDUPE/ref&#x3D;pd_rhf_se_p_img_4 WHEN It Came Time To Check Out Here On Amazon The 2 Day UPS &amp; Limited Way To Buy The Liquid Latex ) ONLY 2 SIZES) A 4oz Or A 32oz Made Things Difficult &amp; Was Very Unsure About There Recent Shipping Accidents &amp; The Cost Of Shipping WAS WAY TO MUCH!! I Couldn&#x27;t Get An 8oz Or 16oz I Could Just Get The 4oz &amp; 32oz! SO I Went Straight To The Source....Liquid Latex Online.Com. They Have Everything But Ya Duhh!! They Would!! I Was Able To Find Everything I Needed &amp; Better Sizes &amp; Shipping Rates Were The Same But It Was Directly From The Dealer! I Was Able To Get The 16oz Clear &amp; Body Prep For Less Price! Instead Of buying 3 Or 4 4oz Of Clear Here Which Made It Way Too Expensive &amp; Body Prep &amp; Taking A Chance That It May Not Reach Me Through This 3rd Party Distributor In Time I Sadly Opted Out Of Amazon &amp; BPJLLC. I Ended Up At The Main Source Easily Got What I Wanted &amp; Paid The $18.90 (It Was The Same @ Amazon But It Took Away How  Much Product I Could Get. So I Would Ended With Not Enough Latex To Get Done What We We&#x27;re Needing! Also Getting It In Time Wondering If The 3rd Party Getting The Order From Amazon Would Possibly Hold It Up &amp; It Wouldn&#x27;t Reach Me On The 31st Of Oct. . SO When I Placed My Order @ Liquid Latex Online.Com I Left A &amp;#34;Note&amp;#34; At Check Out Stating That I Paid For The 2 Day UPS &amp; I Needed It For Halloween Please Ship It ASAP!! SO I GOT IT RIGHT ON TIME!! I Think It Helps If There The Ones Making It &amp; Shipping It That Way It Will Get Here On Time &amp; It Did!! NOW ON TO THEPRODUCT ITS SELF!!

I Did Follow Trough &amp; Did Use The Body Prep &amp; I Highly Recommend It!! Save Yourself  From Most Of The Pain &amp; After You Take It Off With The Body Clean You Face Feels Amazingly Soft!! As Long As You Use Body Prep Before Putting On The Liquid Latex. It A Special Type Of Lotion. SO The Big Thing Here Is Ammonia Free Which I Think Is So Much Better Cause It MIGHT Help Those With Sensitive Skin?? NOW The Smell Oh Ya There Is A Smell Kinda Fishy &amp; At 1st you Think Its Gonna SINGE The Hair Outta Your Nose!! LOL But It Goes Away Quickly!! But remember You Will Be Applying Multiple Layers But By The 2nd Layer Its Not As Bad &amp; You Get Over It! 3rd &amp; 4th Layer You Barely Notice It &amp; Your Into The Grove Of Things!! Being 1st Timers &amp; Me Needing It To Dry Flat So It Looks Hidden You Need To Use A Craft Or Any foam Painting Brush But Not The Big Ones Use The Small Ones!! Remember This Id LIQUID Not Gel Or Foam Its Starts Out As A Thin Liquid SO Apply Lightly On The Foam Brush!! AS It Dries Build Up Your Layers &amp; Remember You Have To Wait For Each Layer To Dry Before You Start The Next Layer!! TAKE NOTE...This Stuff Goes A Long Way &amp; I Got Enough For Halloween Next Year &amp; A Good Possibility The Year After That &amp; I Bought A 16oz Jar!! Just Make Sure You Close It Up Tight &amp; Put It Up In A Safe Remember All Spot!! This Body Paint Does Both Things If Your Wondering &amp; Looking For Something That Regular Latex Does Such As Making Open Wounds &amp; Gory Bloody Things.

She Did Her Hubby&#x27;s Football Uniform &amp; It Was Amazingly Crazy &amp; It Looked Good!! Couldn&#x27;t Tell She Was Naked Not One Bit!! Don&#x27;t Know If She Used This Brand Tough! Hers Was Probably More AlongThe Lines Of A Bit More Paint. OK So I Love This Stuff &amp; I Think Its The Best Out There &amp; You Definitely Get Your $Moneys$ Worth If You Do It My Way!! Also SO Many Colors To Choose From Even Stuff Made Directly For Kids!! So Sorry Amazon Not Enough Choices!! 1 More Tip When Removing Off Your Body Go Quickly Don&#x27;t Drag Out The Process &amp; You&#x27;ll Be Thankful That You Did Rip It Off Like A Band Aid!!

LOL I Also Think I Would Definitely Use This Over Spirit Gum Cause Too Many Horror Stories &amp; Lots Of 5 Stars Ratings Here For This!! Ok Well Thanks All</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Albeit, it reeks.</li>
            <li> This is great for what its intended to be used for! It has a bit of a fishy smell, but it goes away when dried. I used to turn myself into a zombie for a night and it worked perfectly for a first time trying this product. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way!</li>
            <li> wORKED GREAT FOR HALLOWEEN FACE MAKEUP IDEA MY FIANCE HAD AND DIDNT USE MUCH! CAME OFF PRETTY EASY TOO. WILL HAVE PLENTY FOR NEXT YEAR! THANKS</li>
            <li> I bought the clear. It basically had gelled into one big latex lump with a thin liquid around it. I tried shaking and stirring to break it up. No luck. I deemed this unusable and tossed it into the trash.</li>
            <li> It dries quick, comes off easy. It&#x27;s durable. It&#x27;s not as clear as I thought it would be, when it dries, but I usually apply makeup over it, so it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it to see how it interacts with hairy skin surfaces. It can cause itching and burning if applied directly to areas with hair after it&#x27;s dry, and peeling it off of areas with hair is akin to getting a wax, so I would recommend shaving or applying a layer of Vaseline before applying latex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested it on cardboard and linoleum, it sticks to both. The product doesn&#x27;t seem to stain clothing.</li>
            <li> This Stuff is Awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell that bad despite what all the videos claimed, it works so well, and it hardly takes any to get the job done; I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> I use this product when working with henna, to seal and protect a design overnight. For my purposes, I use a medium sized paintbrush to apply. If you do not wash the wet latex off of the brush as soon as you are done applying it, it will never come off! You will still have to peel off some excess, but as long as you wash the brush you&#x27;ll be able to use it again. Also, this stuff is capable of ripping out body hair, so I recommend shaving any area where you are planning on using it. Overall, a good product for my purposes and the cost is quite reasonable once you realize that a little can go a long way.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! My 5 year old is into costume makeup so this has fit her needs for a while now! She still has a lot to use too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very stinky... FYI..but awesome product either way</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product on the 18th of February and got it on the 23rd, so really fast shipping (it was supposed to come on the 25th). The seller accidently gave me the purple liquid latex body paint, when I had ordered the clear one (which on my part, I thought was white) and was super kind to offer to send me the clear one, free of charge. The reason why I wanted this product is that I had watched a YouTube video that demonstrated using it for your nails when you paint them, to reduce the amount of touch-ups. All-in-all I am super happy with my purple body paint and surprised and pleased with the seller&#x27;s kindness.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping - Item is exactly as it was described!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a zombie costume to make wounds. It make realistic-looking cuts! It smells a little like tuna fish when applying, but smells better than the ones with ammonia for sure. And whatever you do, make sure you shave any area that you apply it to, because if you don&#x27;t it feels like a waxing when you peel it off. It comes off clean. 4oz might not seem like much, but it is more than I will ever need. Would buy this again!</li>
            <li> this works very well. i used it on my niece halloween costume. she was zipper face. it was very realistic and nice. the package and delivery was good too. nothing leaked. i recommend this</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for zombie makeup because it is a little thicker than regular liquid latex.</li>
            <li> Great stuff that makes some awesome looking makeup.</li>
            <li> The bottle is way smaller than I expected. Also, It didn&#x27;t come sealed, so be very careful when you open it. The smell is not to bad, but It wouldn&#x27;t go away even after I took off the latex. Good for nail art.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s my new favorite liquid latex, however, the cost is somewhat, yet not much of an issue when you&#x27;re looking for quality to this. As said in its right, not much of an odor is released that can cause irritation, to those with sensitive sense of smell. It&#x27;s an awesome product that shouldn&#x27;t be trifled so carelessly.</li>
            <li> I never knew liquid latex smelled this bad! Aside from that, this applys evenly, and does indeed dry clear, and glossy. I use this as a base coat for swatching of nail polishes, or to apply near my cuticles, to reduce the amount of cleanup. It comes right off, and is not painful at all. This little jar will last me quite some time! Very pleased.</li>
