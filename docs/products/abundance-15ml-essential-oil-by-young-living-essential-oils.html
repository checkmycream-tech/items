            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Abundance smells amazing.</li>
            <li>but it becomes a nice smell once you get used to it.  </li>
            <li>Very good positive vibes</li>
            <li>Young living oils are the best.</li>
            <li>A great product but pretty pricey for the size.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>You will love it.  </li>
            <li>It removes energetic blocks to receiving &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; and bounty into your life.</li>
            <li>OMG this is my all time favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>, I love it</li>
            <li>Smells divine, love this blend.</li>
            <li>It is said that we limit how much wealth, abundance and good that flows into and through our lives.</li>
            <li>It has strong patchouli and spruce/fir tones, with cinnamon and citrus as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I have been using essential oils for many years, and have found Young Living oils to be the best.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an important part of my business ritual now.  </li>
            <li>If I win the lottery I will definitely update my review.</li>
            <li>This blend from Young Living is one of the best blends of some very powerful and important essential</li>
            <li>the most effective essential oil therapys</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but what an incredible scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankincense, myrrh, and patchouli are some of the more potent and famous of the historical oils, and their medicinal uses are being increasingly proven by modern research.</li>
            <li>I was very glad to see amazon selling it, even though through an independent seller.  </li>
            <li>Their ability to be absorbed into the body, including components which can cross the blood/brain barrier, make them powerful medicinal and health giving agents, vastly superior (and far safer) in many ways to &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; drugs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While this oil blend is intended to draw &amp;#34;abundance&amp;#34; to one, this is also a very good general blend for a range of other uses.</li>
            <li>Right now it is my favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li>Never fails to lift my mood.</li>
            <li>I never fail to receive a windfall or breakthrough within 3 days of applying the oil with intention.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to do your research on pricing and shipping before making final decisions.</li>
            <li>Too strong of a fragrance can send me into an instant migraine.  </li>
            <li>Thanks you</li>
            <li>If it turns out to be beneficial, the strong smell will be worth it, but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell.  </li>
            <li>Not intolerable by any means, but a very pungent blend, unlike the Young Living combos I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li>All these oils are also protective from various ills, e.g. clove and cinnamon are powerful</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to odors.  </li>
            <li>encourage you to study the reference material about this blend if you are interested in essential oils.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong and takes a little while to get used to...</li>
            <li>Cinnamon, clove, orange, and ginger are likewise known for their power in various applications, also being proven by modern research.</li>
            <li>Years ago I had a friend of mine who distributed for Young Living recommend this oil to me.  </li>
            <li>It is a soft scent not sharp or severe.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price, and if you simply get a deep whiff out of the bottle without applying it you can make it last forever.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and had s hard time finding a real essential oil in a store so had to order it online.</li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils and like to experiment.  </li>
            <li>but I need rich, deep oils that will stay on my skin because perfumes and other scents just never last on me.</li>
            <li>Be clear and specific about what you wish to receive into your life when applying this oil -</li>
            <li>I recommend all Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>It was priced comparably to other places I&#x27;d seen on line and shipped fast.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by a colleague of mine at a conference.  I was very glad to see amazon selling it, even though through an independent seller.  It was priced comparably to other places I&#x27;d seen on line and shipped fast.  I smell this essential oil a lot, sometimes every morning.  Right now it is my favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils and like to experiment.  I ordered this based on other reviews.  I am so glad I tried it.  It is a little pricey but what an incredible scent.  You will love it.  It is a stronger scents with an earthy undertone.  Not to overpowering but a stronger scent than some.  It is uplifting and calming for me.</li>
            <li> Abundance smells amazing. I can detect patchouli, evergreen, spicy notes. Never fails to lift my mood.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell. I diffuse it a lot in my house.</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; blend. Sometimes I imagine swimming in an ocean of this oil. Be clear and specific about what you wish to receive into your life when applying this oil - It removes energetic blocks to receiving &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; and bounty into your life. I never fail to receive a windfall or breakthrough within 3 days of applying the oil with intention. It is said that we limit how much wealth, abundance and good that flows into and through our lives. This oil promotes the ability to allow &amp;#34;more&amp;#34; flow. It is well worth the price, and if you simply get a deep whiff out of the bottle without applying it you can make it last forever. I have sometimes applied it to doorjambs with the intention of drawing wealth.  Excellent as a mood lifter. I use a few bottles a year.</li>
            <li> This blend from Young Living is one of the best blends of some very powerful and important essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using essential oils for many years, and have found Young Living oils to be the best. (I also think they are overpriced due to the pyramid/multilevel marketing structure of YL&#x27;s business, but that is another story.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense, myrrh, and patchouli are some of the more potent and famous of the historical oils, and their medicinal uses are being increasingly proven by modern research. Cinnamon, clove, orange, and ginger are likewise known for their power in various applications, also being proven by modern research. Spruce is probably the least well known of these oils, but is also quite useful and powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this oil blend is intended to draw &amp;#34;abundance&amp;#34; to one, this is also a very good general blend for a range of other uses. All these oils are also protective from various ills, e.g. clove and cinnamon are powerful antimicrobials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this blend along with Thieves quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I encourage you to study the reference material about this blend if you are interested in essential oils. Their ability to be absorbed into the body, including components which can cross the blood/brain barrier, make them powerful medicinal and health giving agents, vastly superior (and far safer) in many ways to &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; drugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a friend of mine who distributed for Young Living recommend this oil to me.  He told me to put it on my hands and feet and money would come to me.  Of course, I thought the notion was ridiculous...but I had to try it anyway just to see IF it may work the way he said it would.  I would rub it on my hands (but not my feet).  I started adding a few drops into my fountain that I had running in my office.  The smell is strong and takes a little while to get used to...but it becomes a nice smell once you get used to it.  After adding this oil to the rest of my feng shui prosperity ritual, I did notice a difference and found that money does come into my life.  If I notice that things are slow at my office, I&#x27;ll dump some of this oil into my fountain and the phones will start ringing off the hook.  I know it&#x27;s a tad expensive but it&#x27;s worth it.  To me it&#x27;s just a business write-off since I use it at my office and it&#x27;s an important part of my business ritual now.  Try it and you will definitely see an increase in your prosperity as well!</li>
            <li> OMG this is my all time favorite scent.  I wear it everywhere.  One friend can tell when I&#x27;ve entered the building because it is so distinctive.  I think for some people it might be a little overpowering but I need rich, deep oils that will stay on my skin because perfumes and other scents just never last on me. A great product but pretty pricey for the size.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to odors.  Too strong of a fragrance can send me into an instant migraine.  This has worked well with our diffuser.  We only need 2 drops and it puts out just enough aroma without being overpowering.  It is a soft scent not sharp or severe.</li>
            <li> Very good positive vibes, I love it and I would recommend this product to every one I know. Thanks you</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really HATE this, but if you go to the young living site (www.youngliving.org), and purchase from a distributor, it is only about $44.00...</li>
            <li> This would not necessarily be an oil I would choose to diffuse for the scent alone.  It has strong patchouli and spruce/fir tones, with cinnamon and citrus as well.  Not intolerable by any means, but a very pungent blend, unlike the Young Living combos I&#x27;m used to.  I read to apply it to the bottoms of my feet, which I have been doing, and I rub the residue left on my hands over my heart center.  If it turns out to be beneficial, the strong smell will be worth it, but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell.  If I win the lottery I will definitely update my review.</li>
            <li> Smells divine, love this blend. I recommend all Young Living Essential Oils. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> the most effective essential oil therapys</li>
            <li> Young living oils are the best. The seller was excellent. Just make sure to do your research on pricing and shipping before making final decisions.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and had s hard time finding a real essential oil in a store so had to order it online. It was a little out of my price range but I wanted it sooo bad!</li>
