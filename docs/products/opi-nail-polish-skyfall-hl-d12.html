            <li>OPI are the best nail polishes - this one like the others dries fast, has great color, and applies easily.</li>
            <li>This color is amazing.</li>

            <li>and I will be honest</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely as well.</li>
            <li>Skyfall is a beautiful fancy color that is a rich merlot wine, more on the warm side than a vamp-ish color.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, color and the new hit color for nails for the 2012-2013 season.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as bright as the picture though that could be to the brand of my top coat which is Schivetech (I love it)</li>
            <li>This is by far the best color ever!</li>
            <li>love love love this product!</li>

            <li>All my friends love the color also.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m out of top coat, and I decided to put it to the chip test.</li>
            <li>top coat&lt;</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful color!</li>
            <li>Sophisticated and stylish, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
            <li>Wonderful polish, shipping, and overall experience!  </li>
            <li>I know most of my reviews mention how well a polish goes on.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely color nail polish, rich and very becoming.</li>
            <li>Looks best when my nails are long.</li>
            <li>Great polish, deep rich color that applies nicely and dries very quickly..</li>
            <li>Lots of shine and after putting a top coat on every 3 days it lasted two full weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different but , in a beautiful way.</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful fall color.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly!</li>
            <li>I Love OPI and was very happy to be able to get this color before it was hard to find!</li>
            <li>That little note was a wonderful touch!</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous color.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t chip  and the seller was fantastic</li>
            <li>Great color, second order.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful color and stays on for a long time without chipping.  </li>
            <li>Not much to say other than OPI is great nail polish and this color is amazing and great for the winter</li>
            <li>Very nice red!</li>
            <li>The color on the nail is just as rich as the picture online.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and the color is precise to the photo.</li>
            <li>It looks like a rich full bodied wine.</li>
            <li>It not only put out great colors, but their quality is always first rate.  </li>
            <li>True to color in pictures, with OPI quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is absolutely lovely, and very versatile.  </li>
            <li>But...it does chip pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be a bit more vibrant and have a richer color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and have been referring people to this particular seller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend OPI as a top quality polish.</li>
            <li>She really likes it, though you definitely need two coats, and a nice husband to apply to the toes!  </li>
            <li>Very classy &amp; sophisticated color.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li>Brushes on really well and smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice polish, however, it isn&#x27;t as red as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>essentially it&#x27;s that trendy oxblood color</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and delivered well before the delivery window!</li>
            <li>everyone is into right now.</li>
            <li>If you love dark reds, you&#x27;ll love this color.</li>
            <li>I love the color but barely use because of chipping.</li>
            <li>Though, just like every other OPI nail color it chips quickly, it is still looks amazing for going out and not too distractive for the office.</li>
            <li>it has lasted me such a long time, and when I wear it&#x27;s so beautiful and timeless</li>
            <li>but it is a lovely winter color especially for those who have a golden sheen to their skin</li>
            <li>As it turns out, the color is more of a brownish red.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this was the same color as Severine in Skyfall.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this color!</li>
            <li>Here, what you see is exactly what you get and that is the exact shade I have been looking and looking for.  </li>
            <li>but pretty nonetheless...</li>
            <li>This was my first opi nail polish purchase, and now I have over 40 opi nail polish before this nail polish</li>
            <li>Tried this color with my last pedicure and just love it.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>This is a nice dark red and works Weill with most skin tones.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect oxblood red, however it is very thick and peeled off quickly.</li>
            <li>Only con is that it cheaps easily, unlike other OPI colors I own.</li>
            <li>To me, the picture on here looks more vibrant than it actually is on my nails.</li>
            <li>Looks better on long nails!</li>
            <li>A great dark red</li>
            <li>When I ordered I used standard shipping and it was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a darker red than the ever popular &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not really a waitress&amp;#34; color, tending more towards a browner red.</li>
            <li>and I really, really like this color for the winter months.</li>
            <li>But this fastly became her favori</li>
            <li>so get it fast if it appeals to you.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore it.  </li>
            <li>OPI polish goes on very smoothly and lasts well with little to no chipping as long as you use a top coat.</li>
            <li>The formula is just thick enough to cover opaquely in a couple coats, and the color is beyond beautiful.  </li>
            <li>This is a gorgeous, really DARK red polish.  </li>
            <li>Dark &amp; fabulous!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect blend of dark red, brown, black...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely brighter in the picture than in person; expect a deep, dark red and you&#x27;ll be happy!  </li>
            <li>anyway, it came packaged nicely and is still a very pretty color, just not exactly how I expected!</li>
            <li>BUT... when I recieved this particular color from the seller it was rather gooey as if it had sat on a self for years..  </li>
            <li>dark brown red, very elegant</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Skyfall&amp;#34; color looks just as vibrant as the picture.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color a deep reddish brown.</li>
            <li>That is why only three stars, the color is very pretty otherwise.</li>
            <li>In fact, it looked very professional!</li>
            <li>I received this product very promptly, even in this busy time of the year.</li>
            <li>It is a nice dark red and matches a lot of colors of clothes</li>
            <li>I have over 90 bottles of nail polish (I know ridiculous), but whenever anyone asks me what my favorite nail polish is I say OPI Skyfall!</li>
            <li>I regret taking so long, and would strongly recommend not only this color, but this particular seller.</li>
            <li>I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas last year and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a deep, rich red nail polish.</li>
            <li>It almost came out more like a brownish red than a deep red.</li>
            <li>yet still classy!</li>
            <li>Typical of OPI, it has a smooth, finished look, and doesn&#x27;t chip as quickly as some other brands do.</li>
            <li>A clear coat is recommended to avoid transfer with this one.</li>
            <li>, it chips very easily despite use of a base and top coat.</li>
            <li>it really does not take to long for the coats</li>
            <li>when mine came, at least from looking at the color inside the bottle, it is more of a dusky orangey toned red.</li>
            <li>The entire experience was trouble free...</li>
            <li>and I did not use a top coat, but I don&#x27;t remember this happening with other Opi polishes I used in the past.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s a loely color, it&#x27;s VERY dark, much darker than in the picture.  </li>

            <li> True to color in pictures, with OPI quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is absolutely lovely, and very versatile.  </li>
            <li> But...it does chip pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be a bit more vibrant and have a richer color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and have been referring people to this particular seller.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend OPI as a top quality polish.</li>
            <li> She really likes it, though you definitely need two coats, and a nice husband to apply to the toes!  </li>
            <li> Very classy &amp; sophisticated color.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> Brushes on really well and smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice polish, however, it isn&#x27;t as red as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> essentially it&#x27;s that trendy oxblood color</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and delivered well before the delivery window!</li>
            <li> everyone is into right now.</li>
            <li> If you love dark reds, you&#x27;ll love this color.</li>
            <li> I love the color but barely use because of chipping.</li>
            <li> Though, just like every other OPI nail color it chips quickly, it is still looks amazing for going out and not too distractive for the office.</li>
            <li> it has lasted me such a long time, and when I wear it&#x27;s so beautiful and timeless</li>
            <li> but it is a lovely winter color especially for those who have a golden sheen to their skin</li>
            <li> As it turns out, the color is more of a brownish red.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this was the same color as Severine in Skyfall.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this color!</li>
            <li> Here, what you see is exactly what you get and that is the exact shade I have been looking and looking for.  </li>
            <li> but pretty nonetheless...</li>
            <li> This was my first opi nail polish purchase, and now I have over 40 opi nail polish before this nail polish</li>
            <li> Tried this color with my last pedicure and just love it.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This is a nice dark red and works Weill with most skin tones.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect oxblood red, however it is very thick and peeled off quickly.</li>
            <li> Only con is that it cheaps easily, unlike other OPI colors I own.</li>
            <li> To me, the picture on here looks more vibrant than it actually is on my nails.</li>
            <li> Looks better on long nails!</li>
            <li> A great dark red</li>
            <li> When I ordered I used standard shipping and it was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a darker red than the ever popular &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not really a waitress&amp;#34; color, tending more towards a browner red.</li>
            <li> and I really, really like this color for the winter months.</li>
            <li> But this fastly became her favori</li>
            <li> so get it fast if it appeals to you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore it.  </li>
            <li> OPI polish goes on very smoothly and lasts well with little to no chipping as long as you use a top coat.</li>
            <li> The formula is just thick enough to cover opaquely in a couple coats, and the color is beyond beautiful.  </li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous, really DARK red polish.  </li>
            <li> Dark &amp; fabulous!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect blend of dark red, brown, black...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely brighter in the picture than in person; expect a deep, dark red and you&#x27;ll be happy!  </li>
            <li> anyway, it came packaged nicely and is still a very pretty color, just not exactly how I expected!</li>
            <li> BUT... when I recieved this particular color from the seller it was rather gooey as if it had sat on a self for years..  </li>
            <li> dark brown red, very elegant</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Skyfall&amp;#34; color looks just as vibrant as the picture.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color a deep reddish brown.</li>
            <li> That is why only three stars, the color is very pretty otherwise.</li>
            <li> In fact, it looked very professional!</li>
            <li> I received this product very promptly, even in this busy time of the year.</li>
            <li> It is a nice dark red and matches a lot of colors of clothes</li>
            <li> I have over 90 bottles of nail polish (I know ridiculous), but whenever anyone asks me what my favorite nail polish is I say OPI Skyfall!</li>
            <li> I regret taking so long, and would strongly recommend not only this color, but this particular seller.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas last year and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a deep, rich red nail polish.</li>
            <li> It almost came out more like a brownish red than a deep red.</li>
            <li> yet still classy!</li>
            <li> Typical of OPI, it has a smooth, finished look, and doesn&#x27;t chip as quickly as some other brands do.</li>
            <li> A clear coat is recommended to avoid transfer with this one.</li>
            <li> , it chips very easily despite use of a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> it really does not take to long for the coats</li>
            <li> when mine came, at least from looking at the color inside the bottle, it is more of a dusky orangey toned red.</li>
            <li> The entire experience was trouble free...</li>
            <li> and I did not use a top coat, but I don&#x27;t remember this happening with other Opi polishes I used in the past.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s a loely color, it&#x27;s VERY dark, much darker than in the picture.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting wear.</li>
            <li> It is such a deep shade, it is not easy to define it as red.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You must let dry in between coat&#x27;s</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a deep burgundy red, and this is a bit morbid, but it looks like dried blood, and now I understand why it&#x27;s named Skyfall.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a limited editions</li>
            <li> however this product is described everywhere (online swatches on multiple websites) as a dark red/maroon color.</li>
            <li> Type of dark red- hint of maroon.&lt;br /&gt;edgy</li>
            <li> However it is extremely close to several other OPI colors.</li>
            <li> It looks a little darker than the screen image but close enough for us.  </li>
            <li> a little less blood red than the pic</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> It goes to almost a plum with some outfits, and can appear almost like a dark cinnamon with others.</li>
            <li> I even used an OPI base coat and top coat</li>
            <li> Color is dark burgundy, if applied one thin coat it looks closer to dark red, but with two coats it is closer to the read advertised color.</li>
            <li> Very dark burgundy.</li>
            <li> But certain polishes either naturally go on badly or do so because of age.</li>
            <li> It came out a bit too dull for me.</li>
            <li> Color lasts for a least a week without any  chipping or tip wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed lately that the OPI brand has declined in quality</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I applied it too thick</li>
            <li> Tough and stays on For about 5 day.</li>
            <li> Tough and stays on For about 5 day</li>
            <li> maybe mine is a batch that was a little off, and maybe I&#x27;ll put it on my nails and be shocked at the color difference from the bottle.</li>
            <li> ( I don&#x27;t use fake nails</li>
            <li> base coat</li>
            <li> I would think 8 or 9 bucks for nail polish are you insane, but when I bought this the quality the opaqueness it luxurious</li>
            <li> Anti- Bleak is a dupe.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this color seeming I pick it on every nail visit.. BUT... when I recieved this particular color from the seller it was rather gooey as if it had sat on a self for years..  Although I love the color I didn&#x27;t love the condition of the product once I recieved it....</li>
            <li> OPI are the best nail polishes - this one like the others dries fast, has great color, and applies easily. This color is fun and is great for many looks.</li>
            <li> Very nice red! dark brown red, very elegant</li>
            <li> I bought this color based on the color presented in the picture. As it turns out, the color is more of a brownish red. The image is misleading but I still like the color.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely color nail polish, rich and very becoming. The price was good and it arrived quickly. I highly recommend OPI as a top quality polish.</li>
            <li> I love the color and of course OPI nail polish quality is superb! I love the fact that this was the same color as Severine in Skyfall. Looks better on long nails!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous color. Will be perfect for Fall and like always with OPI its fantastic. Doesn&#x27;t chip  and the seller was fantastic</li>
            <li> This is a nice dark red and works Weill with most skin tones.  OPI polish goes on very smoothly and lasts well with little to no chipping as long as you use a top coat.</li>
            <li> Love the color and would recommend it to everyone.Long lasting wear. All my friends love the color also. Brushes on really well and smooth</li>
            <li> I had this before and wanted a spare. It is a nice dark red and matches a lot of colors of clothes</li>
            <li> I love this color. It looks like a rich full bodied wine. Lots of shine and after putting a top coat on every 3 days it lasted two full weeks. I like to take my polish when I get a manicure so I can do touch-ups.....but in this case I didn&#x27;t have to. I&#x27;m always satisfied with OPI.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color a deep reddish brown. Nice cream formula that wears well. Color lasts for a least a week without any  chipping or tip wear.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas last year and she absolutely loves it! The &amp;#34;Skyfall&amp;#34; color looks just as vibrant as the picture.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to holiday color and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a deep, rich red nail polish.</li>
            <li> Skyfall is a beautiful fancy color that is a rich merlot wine, more on the warm side than a vamp-ish color. It looks indulgent, Two coats and you&#x27;ve got the color from the bottle, looks great with glittering gold accents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice polish, however, it isn&#x27;t as red as I had hoped. To me, the picture on here looks more vibrant than it actually is on my nails. I was hoping it would be a bit more vibrant and have a richer color. It came out a bit too dull for me. It almost came out more like a brownish red than a deep red. Great nail polish, but beware it may be darker than you expect.</li>
            <li> OPI makes some great nail color and this is no exception.  This is a darker red than the ever popular &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not really a waitress&amp;#34; color, tending more towards a browner red.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this color! I have over 90 bottles of nail polish (I know ridiculous), but whenever anyone asks me what my favorite nail polish is I say OPI Skyfall! This is by far the best color ever! A great dark red and it&#x27;s nice and shiny you don&#x27;t even need a top coat!</li>
            <li> I love OPI.  It not only put out great colors, but their quality is always first rate.  However, sometimes, the shade you see in the bottle is not always the shade that comes out once painted on your nails.  But Skyfall is not one of those.  Here, what you see is exactly what you get and that is the exact shade I have been looking and looking for.  Thank you OPI!</li>
            <li> I liked the color... a little less blood red than the pic but pretty nonetheless... I love OPI brand and it shipped on time, so I would order from these guys again</li>
            <li> True to color in pictures, with OPI quality.&lt;br /&gt;Almost merlot in color; shine without sparkle or shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful winter or holiday color!</li>
            <li> Great color, second order.</li>
            <li> Dark &amp; fabulous! Looks best when my nails are long. Toss up whether this one or &amp;#34; Casino Royale&amp;#34; is my fav of Skyfall Collection. Great fall &amp; winter color. No orange tint, goes with any color your wearing. Packaged &amp; sent in bubble wrap. Arrived in a week.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this color immediately. Tried to buy it locally but no one had it in stock. Found it here on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;so I purchased 2 bottles of it. Very classy &amp; sophisticated color.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful color and stays on for a long time without chipping.  I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different but , in a beautiful way.</li>
            <li> I wore Skyfall nail polish for the premiere of James Bond&#x27;s Skyfall.  My nails looked as good as that woman&#x27;s on-screen.  She looks better than me in every way (she&#x27;s taller) but my nails looked FIERCE!</li>
            <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than OPI is great nail polish and this color is amazing and great for the winter</li>
            <li> I discovered OPI nail polishes quite awhile ago.  Their nail polishes are my favorite and I really, really like this color for the winter months.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect oxblood red, however it is very thick and peeled off quickly. I don&#x27;t think I applied it too thick and I did not use a top coat, but I don&#x27;t remember this happening with other Opi polishes I used in the past. That is why only three stars, the color is very pretty otherwise.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and the color is precise to the photo. I am Very pleased! I will definitely be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> I love OPI polishes and I will be honest: i haven&#x27;t put this on my nails quite yet, as it came in the mail just yesterday. however this product is described everywhere (online swatches on multiple websites) as a dark red/maroon color. when mine came, at least from looking at the color inside the bottle, it is more of a dusky orangey toned red. maybe mine is a batch that was a little off, and maybe I&#x27;ll put it on my nails and be shocked at the color difference from the bottle. anyway, it came packaged nicely and is still a very pretty color, just not exactly how I expected!</li>
            <li> I Love OPI and was very happy to be able to get this color before it was hard to find!</li>
            <li> I love this color- looks very similar to the picture. Type of dark red- hint of maroon.&lt;br /&gt;edgy yet still classy!</li>
            <li> This was my first opi nail polish purchase, and now I have over 40 opi nail polish before this nail polish I would think 8 or 9 bucks for nail polish are you insane, but when I bought this the quality the opaqueness it luxurious it has lasted me such a long time, and when I wear it&#x27;s so beautiful and timeless, I love this nail polish!</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail and LOVE...LOVE....LOVE this color! It is deep and luscious! Goes on nicely as well. Delivered quickly! But...it does chip pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I bought i for a fried of mine who always has her nails painted and has tons of colors.  But this fastly became her favori&lt;br /&gt;te.  It&#x27;s a limited editions so get it fast if it appeals to you.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing. It&#x27;s the perfect blend of dark red, brown, black... essentially it&#x27;s that trendy oxblood color everyone is into right now. Only con is that it cheaps easily, unlike other OPI colors I own.</li>
            <li> The formula is just thick enough to cover opaquely in a couple coats, and the color is beyond beautiful.  It&#x27;s a deep burgundy red, and this is a bit morbid, but it looks like dried blood, and now I understand why it&#x27;s named Skyfall.  If you&#x27;ve seen the film, you&#x27;ll understand.</li>
            <li> Tried this color with my last pedicure and just love it.  Hard to find locally.  Order it through Amazon and so happy with the color.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous, really DARK red polish.  It&#x27;s the same color you&#x27;ll see on screen in Skyfall, so it&#x27;s the go-to color for any Bond Girl!  While it&#x27;s a loely color, it&#x27;s VERY dark, much darker than in the picture.  Yes, there can be a color difference with different monitors. I&#x27;ve looked at the picture on multiple monitors and on the monitor that shows it the darkest that might be just a shade lighter than what the polish looks like in the brightest sunlight.  It&#x27;s definitely brighter in the picture than in person; expect a deep, dark red and you&#x27;ll be happy!  If you love dark reds, you&#x27;ll love this color. Perfect when paired with Goldeneye!</li>
            <li> She really likes it, though you definitely need two coats, and a nice husband to apply to the toes!  It looks a little darker than the screen image but close enough for us.  Great for an evening out!</li>
            <li> Had to apply five coats for the look in the photo</li>
            <li> I ordered this a while ago, I just hadn&#x27;t had a chance to use it until 2 days ago. I&#x27;m out of top coat, and I decided to put it to the chip test. Incredibly, the polish has yet to chip!! This color is AMAZING! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and have been referring people to this particular seller. When I ordered I used standard shipping and it was delivered very quickly. It also contained a hand written note thanking me for ordering and, of course, reminding me to write a review. I regret taking so long, and would strongly recommend not only this color, but this particular seller. That little note was a wonderful touch!</li>
            <li> Loved the movie this is named for and the polish is gorgeous on.  Very, very, very sexy, indeed! Woo Hoo!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color.  It was delivered as scheduled.</li>
            <li> Love this polish and what a great color,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on:&lt;br /&gt;one base coat&lt;br /&gt;two coats of polish&lt;br /&gt;one top coat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must let dry in between coat&#x27;s it really does not take to long for the coats&lt;br /&gt;to dry.</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture. Such a beautiful color! The quality of the nail polish is awesome too. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect color for me.</li>
            <li> This shade is a perfect complement to almost any outfit. It is such a deep shade, it is not easy to define it as red. It goes to almost a plum with some outfits, and can appear almost like a dark cinnamon with others. Typical of OPI, it has a smooth, finished look, and doesn&#x27;t chip as quickly as some other brands do.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to wear it yet, but I do love the color and it will probably make its way onto my toes today! Super fast shipping and delivered well before the delivery window!</li>
            <li> LOVED this color! Excellent nail polish. Bought it to try it out and must say it is great color. Though, just like every other OPI nail color it chips quickly, it is still looks amazing for going out and not too distractive for the office. In fact, it looked very professional! Color is dark burgundy, if applied one thin coat it looks closer to dark red, but with two coats it is closer to the read advertised color.</li>
            <li> Nail polish was great. Tough and stays on For about 5 day. Nail polish was great. Tough and stays on For about 5 day</li>
            <li> After seeing this at the nail salon, I had to have it.  It&#x27;s a deep burgundy red.  Sophisticated and stylish, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the Skyfall color but was sad that after only 2 days it was chipping.  I even used an OPI base coat and top coat but those didn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
            <li> Great service. Great product!!!!!!! Great color and true to pic shown online. The entire experience was trouble free...Will order again.....,</li>
            <li> Color is amazing! Great polish, deep rich color that applies nicely and dries very quickly.. love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed lately that the OPI brand has declined in quality, it chips very easily despite use of a base and top coat. I love the color but barely use because of chipping.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful fall color. Very dark burgundy. However it is extremely close to several other OPI colors. Anti- Bleak is a dupe. Pepe&#x27;s Purple Passion and Pamplona Purple are very similar, so if you already have those in your collection, you might not need this one.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, color and the new hit color for nails for the 2012-2013 season. Great stocking stuffer. I received this product very promptly, even in this busy time of the year. Wonderful color. Since receiving this, I am seeing everyone on TV wearing this color. Beautiful and strong.</li>
            <li> Wonderful polish, shipping, and overall experience!  The color is absolutely lovely, and very versatile.  I absolutely adore it.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I love this color! It&#x27;s not as bright as the picture though that could be to the brand of my top coat which is Schivetech (I love it) but it is a lovely winter color especially for those who have a golden sheen to their skin</li>
            <li> I know most of my reviews mention how well a polish goes on. But certain polishes either naturally go on badly or do so because of age. This one went on beautifully. I debated putting two coats on this one also. A clear coat is recommended to avoid transfer with this one. The color on the nail is just as rich as the picture online. I&#x27;m quite happy with this one. No age issues and multiple coats aren&#x27;t needed. ( I don&#x27;t use fake nails so I have no idea if that would make a difference.) very happy with my purchase.</li>
