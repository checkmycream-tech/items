            <li>It smells delicious, lasts a long time and has a rich lather.  </li>

            <li>Considering how long it lasts, and the many uses available from one bar-it is quite cost effective.</li>
            <li>I first bought this soap in Sonoma from a little shop, and was very happy to find that Amazon sells it.  </li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about this product..</li>
            <li>the scent is lovely and the soap literally lasts for months with normal use.</li>
            <li>Not only is it pretty, it smells sooooo good.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Never before have i paid $7.50 a bar for soap but this was indeed worth it.</li>
            <li>This Pomegranate was my favorite so far out of all the others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Many of the expensive hotels I have stayed in supply French soaps for their guests, and many have interesting and great smells.  </li>
            <li>The bars are very large</li>
            <li>This is a very smooth, luxurious soap that smells lightly of pomegranate, which is slightly different than the other Provence soaps that are more herb-y or flower-y.</li>
            <li>I have bought a several different bars and all are quite simple exquisite</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t suds up too much and it makes my laundry smell soooo goood!</li>
            <li>This soap (just like other Pre de Provence soaps) smells beautifully and lasts very long.</li>
            <li>It is very long lasting and has a nice mild scent to it.</li>
            <li>It also does not dry out your skin like cheap soaps do.</li>
            <li>a go-to one if you want a pure and gentle one.</li>
            <li>As far as effects on the skin, the soap is fairly nice feeling and didn&#x27;t dry my skin etc, so maybe their other soaps would be okay.    </li>
            <li>The bar is huge, and will last 6 - 8 weeks with normal once a day bathing -</li>
            <li>Highly recommend (</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s not easy to get a ton of scent from pomegranate</li>
            <li>I was actually amazed at the length it lasted and the huge amount of uses possible from one bar.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they tested this fragrance first, but it is just what the title states, simply hideous.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have taken a real liking to French soaps.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, and continues to have the pleasant smell - my trip to Sonoma was a long time ago and only now is my bar getting small enough</li>
            <li>This is better than the average everyday soaps.</li>
            <li>These soaps last such a long time that it really does not feel more expensive than using bar soaps found in supermarkets.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We have purchased most of the Pre de Provence soaps scents there is and this one is just OK.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make the bathroom smell yummy like some of them do. The ananas (pineapple) one is&lt;br /&gt;incredible if you love a really fresh smelling soap for spring and summer and the milk is&lt;br /&gt;always a go-to one if you want a pure and gentle one. This one smelled a little synthetic&lt;br /&gt;to me altho my husband was OK with it. I am sure there was nothing synthetic about it knowing&lt;br /&gt;the quality of ingredients this company uses but it just comes across that way scent wise. I&lt;br /&gt;am sure it&#x27;s not easy to get a ton of scent from pomegranate seeds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this one again, I will stick with ananas and milk.</li>
            <li> This soap has a very fake bubble gum smell when you smell the bar, but after it&#x27;s on the skin, it leaves a bitter herbal scent that is not pleasant at all! As far as effects on the skin, the soap is fairly nice feeling and didn&#x27;t dry my skin etc, so maybe their other soaps would be okay.    I don&#x27;t know if they tested this fragrance first, but it is just what the title states, simply hideous.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit artificial. I&#x27;m going to buy local and handmade from now on.</li>
            <li> The scent of this soap is not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like bubble gum&lt;br /&gt;and the color is not pleasant either&lt;br /&gt;it looks like the color of bubble gum.&lt;br /&gt;Was disappointed&lt;br /&gt;and I am always pleased with my Amazon purchases...</li>
            <li> This is a very smooth, luxurious soap that smells lightly of pomegranate, which is slightly different than the other Provence soaps that are more herb-y or flower-y. It does not smell like bubble gum, as a previous reviewer stated. Even my guy used it (and liked it and kept using it) and was not overly concerned that he smelled girly, which he did not.</li>
            <li> I first bought this soap in Sonoma from a little shop, and was very happy to find that Amazon sells it.  it has a nice, fruity, non-perfumey smell.  I happen to be totally grossed out by bubble gum and have been  for 30 years - I do not smell anything in anyway related to bubble gum. Everyone&#x27;s sense of smell is different and a person&#x27;s  sense of smell can even be temporarily \\&quot;off\\&quot; due to a medication or something.  This has a very nice smell, and does not dry my skin out or irritate it.  It lasts a long time, and continues to have the pleasant smell - my trip to Sonoma was a long time ago and only now is my bar getting small enough that I started worrying and looking for a place to repurchase it! Highly recommend (although I too love the Linden scented bar!!)</li>
            <li> And another great bath bar.Pomegranate-great fregrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m exceedingly happy with the large bar of soap.  I&#x27;ve become a fan of Pre de Provence soaps and decided to try this scent for a change.  It&#x27;s lovely and I expect that I will enjoy bathing with it just as I do the others I have ordered and used.  These soaps last such a long time that it really does not feel more expensive than using bar soaps found in supermarkets.  So it feels a bit like a luxury without winding up costing like a luxury.</li>
            <li> Been using these bars for a couple of years now,  yes they are a bit more,  but for me they last 2 months!.  They smell great and feel great as you bathe,  I buy them by the case,  I call them flavors instead of scents,</li>
            <li> I NOW SMELL LIKE A POMEGRANATE.</li>
            <li> This soap is a lot for the money.  It smells delicious, lasts a long time and has a rich lather.  My skin feels soft and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful seller and an even better product!</li>
            <li> Truly one of the finest makers of soap.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this product..the scent is lovely and the soap literally lasts for months with normal use. I have never experienced a soap that lasts this long, it lathers very well,no need to use a large amount of the soap as it goes a long way. I am quite picky as to soap and shower gels and this brand is simply my favorite. Considering how long it lasts, and the many uses available from one bar-it is quite cost effective. My spouse loves this soap as well as he is quite discerning when it comes to soaps and shower gels as well. Makes a wonderful gift as well, and thus far, I have not heard of one person who I have gifted this soap with who did not like it. Too many compliments to list. I was actually amazed at the length it lasted and the huge amount of uses possible from one bar. Highly recommend for those who love a change of pace and delightful soap to pamper themselves. In my opinion, it is well worth the price. Product is of high quality and indulgent in a wonderful way. The scent sticks with you and is more than pleasant--it is delightful and it a very effective product.</li>
            <li> Expensive soap. Never before have i paid $7.50 a bar for soap but this was indeed worth it. The bars are very large so you actually get a lot of soap. This Pomegranate was my favorite so far out of all the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> This a real good smelling soap, it leaves you feeling squeaky clean and not soo fry. But it does leave soap scum,</li>
            <li> Big, thick bar for the price.  Scent not as strong as I hopped (pomegranate) but still nice.  The Gardenia smells better.  Smooth skin!</li>
            <li> This soap lathers well and smells wonderful. That is why I buy it and lasts quite a while. I have bought a several different bars and all are quite simple exquisite and they make excellent gifts.</li>
            <li> This soap (just like other Pre de Provence soaps) smells beautifully and lasts very long. I did not really measure it but it was long. It also does not dry out your skin like cheap soaps do.</li>
            <li> Had to throw this bar into the garbage because no one in the house could stand the smell of this soap.</li>
            <li> This is better than the average everyday soaps. Everything was as described. Had a nice scent, yet, not overpowering. Felt silky.</li>
            <li> However, but this batch starts separating about 2/3&#x27;s into the bar.  It is a milling issue and makes the bar rough to the skin when using at this stage.</li>
            <li> I have taken a real liking to French soaps.  Many of the expensive hotels I have stayed in supply French soaps for their guests, and many have interesting and great smells.  This soap follows that same trend.  To me, it has a slight hint of cherry blossom in the scent - very hard to describe because this soaps smells very different from anything else I have tried - and I really like it.  The bar is huge, and will last 6 - 8 weeks with normal once a day bathing - so it is a good deal for the money (in my opinion).  I hope you will try it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how smooth it leaves my skin. It somehow lasts longer than the other bars!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Product was fine, but did not meet my expectations. The price doesn&#x27;t match the quality. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I use this in my homemade laundry detergent. Not only is it pretty, it smells sooooo good. We have a HE front loading washer. It doesn&#x27;t suds up too much and it makes my laundry smell soooo goood!</li>
            <li> This is a great bar of soap.  It is very long lasting and has a nice mild scent to it.</li>
