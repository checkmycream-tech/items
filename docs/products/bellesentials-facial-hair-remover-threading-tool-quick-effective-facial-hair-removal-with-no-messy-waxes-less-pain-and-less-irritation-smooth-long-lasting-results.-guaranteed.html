            <li>Great tool - came quickly and great service!  </li>
            <li>The eyebrow shaper is simply a fine razor, and I had to go to the video on the website to find instructions for its best use.</li>
            <li>but I loved it wanted to find an easier way to replace waxing for my peach fuzz</li>
            <li>I have fair hair</li>
            <li>but Its good for maintenance.</li>
            <li>All in all a good deal</li>

            <li>It is wonderful, never has my chin been so clean of hairs.  </li>
            <li>happy to have been able to try something new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit leary of razors, but I used it on top of my eyebrow to help shape it and it worked great.</li>
            <li>but I love it and great price.</li>
            <li>Very creative design.</li>
            <li>I was able to buy this product during a promotion and am happy to share my experience with it.</li>
            <li>The price is right, and the tool works great!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite grooming tool!</li>
            <li>no need for scheduling an appointment for threading those areas any more!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have this tool!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I sometimes have to use tweezers for some missed hair, but this tool is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>This is a fairly effective hair removal tool, but don&#x27;t for a minute believe the &amp;#34;pain-free&amp;#34; hype.</li>
            <li>I liked the eyebrow trimmer that came with the threading tool.</li>
            <li>This product is so handy.  </li>
            <li>I received this at a promotional rate to use, review and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its really effective.</li>
            <li>Bonus eyebrow razor was nice too.</li>
            <li>This hair removing tool is effective, but not without a bit of pain.</li>
            <li>It is not as effective as advertised and it is NOT PAINLESS.</li>
            <li>will come in handy for travel.</li>
            <li>I liked the size and thought it was well made.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate how effectively it grabs and removes that fuzz and stray hairs.  </li>
            <li>Fast and effective; i was extremely impressed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Loving it.</li>
            <li>But to my surprise it was so easy tho use and effective!</li>
            <li>I would have to say, however this was a great success!</li>
            <li>Good easy</li>
            <li>Item is as described and surprisingly it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The hair remover is very easy to use, it grips onto the hair very easily and viola</li>
            <li>For $10.95, I think it&#x27;s a good cheap hair removal option.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this, it did pluck some hairs out, took longer and wasn&#x27;t more effective than my tweezer.</li>
            <li>So in the car with natural sunlight would be perfect to use this.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>It even takes the very fine hairs off</li>
            <li>Quick, easy, pain free and great price!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Good one but pain full</li>
            <li>is when I notice those fine peach hairs in places I do not want them!</li>
            <li>Good product and the shipment was quick</li>
            <li>This works well, but is not pain free!</li>
            <li>This is simple and works perfectly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the best and easiest method of facial hair remover I have found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad they did because I love the product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT &amp; you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on healthy diet</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews for Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I will never use another device, cream or tweezers again, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it any more.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Excellent facial hair remover.</li>
            <li>I was blown away at how many hairs it was able to pull out at a time.  </li>
            <li>I received the item free in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>What a very awesome invention, I received my Spring Facial hair remover and immediately started trying to figure out how to use it.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with the product as it prevents me from having to manually pluck or wax!</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I cannot stress how much I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>Removes maybe two at most hair follicles at a time.  </li>
            <li>Now as I age even more hairs are coming in, so I bought this product.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly for my upper and lower lip ....</li>
            <li>A different type of pain from waxing and takes time to perfect technique, which I haven&#x27;t yet done.</li>
            <li>a video or photo instructions  may have been better.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always good for a laugh.</li>
            <li>misses more hairs than it&#x27;ll get, might as well take tweezers to them.</li>
            <li>and I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>A wonderful device to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend usig a tweezer is better than this tool.</li>
            <li>I use it in a twisty, open and closing way and find that works best for me.</li>
            <li>and I was able to do it without a mirror</li>
            <li>there is more breakage than i was hoping for, but it does work and i will probably get better at it as time goes by.</li>
            <li>Best suited for larger areas.  </li>
            <li>This works ok.  </li>
            <li>Probably would work better with practice and patience.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product for facial hair!</li>
            <li>There are many times when I try to get to the salon</li>
            <li>After getting use to it, it worked so much better than plucking.</li>
            <li>and I was so glad to find your product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used to help remove unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Works ok .</li>
            <li>As you get used to it then &#x27;grab&#x27; more at a time.  </li>
            <li>I love it because I can do touch ups at any time and don&#x27;t have to go anywhere, spend time on waxing etc.</li>
            <li>This product was rather interesting to me, as I&#x27;ve never heard of or seen anything like it.</li>
            <li>I love it!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This threading tool grabs many hairs at one time and speeds up the removal process</li>
            <li>but its so much better than using tweezers and pinching your skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>Every once in a while once in awhile you run across something that just makes your life easier and better.  </li>
            <li>Thank goodness :)</li>
            <li>Never used these before and was surprised how good it work!</li>
            <li>My face was smoother and cleaner after just one use, its a must have for all the girls, i never used the razor but its handy for emergency clean up i guess.</li>
            <li>It did arrive on time and in perfect condition and the long razor was included</li>
            <li>My daughter has a higher priced one and this works just as good</li>
            <li>It definitely is effective and quick, but painless?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be nice to have a quick guide on the package.</li>
            <li>it’s a great tool for removing your facial hair in the privacy of your own home.  </li>
            <li>So when I was offered this Spring Facial Hair Remover for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I said why not.</li>
            <li>not leave your skin bright red like the waxing does, so quick and painless is a great option for me.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Be sure that your face is clean before using and be sure to moisturize afterward.</li>
            <li>, it would be more secure in your hands if it were rubber, but it seems to be a negligible problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most importantly, gave me a boost of confidence.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I tried it and could not get it to work worth anything.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s serrated and really works at a good angle to get those eyebrow hairs also.</li>
            <li>the price is right, the support from the company is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This item was delivered very quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>So easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I found the device easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>It seemed some it could grip on some rather easily</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it was not so easy removing the thicker hairs on the chin.</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use..</li>
            <li>It is very easily removing  the unwanted hair from her face and she is using for her upper lip and the product is good no problems with it .</li>
            <li>The best little tool I ever got ahold of..</li>
            <li>This makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It works great on upper lip.  </li>
            <li>handles are cheap plastic and look tacky, but who sees them?  </li>
            <li>Now I use this every night for a couple of minutes and I am smooth.</li>
            <li>This threading tool became available to purchase discounted during a promotion, so I bought it hoping it would help.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t shave because then the hairs come back as ingrown hairs, but tweezing, and now this  threading tool works great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pain free.  </li>
            <li>One note, this is not a pain free experience.  </li>
            <li>It is not pain free, but tolerable.</li>
            <li>...let&#x27;s just say it wasn&#x27;t comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Works well for a quick and easy cleanup job.  </li>
            <li>not as user friendly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>and it is extremely effective at peach fuzz removal from forehead, cheeks, chin, jawline, and most importantly - your upper lip.</li>
            <li>I am planning on buying more for myself &amp; all my sisters &amp; all my friends ;-)</li>
            <li>I was pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t going to work.  </li>
            <li>Seems pretty durable and sure</li>
            <li>I was so excited because it worked.</li>
            <li>(I have to ice after I use it, not to break out) but it is way more gentle than waxing</li>
            <li>My husband ordered this for me online as the reviews for this product was good overall.</li>
            <li>The pain for me was not bad</li>
            <li>But once you know what to expect it really is not bad at all in fact I am hooked on this threading tool.  </li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t strong enough for those, but it is getting newer hairs quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s simple, easy to use, and effective.</li>
            <li>but once I got the hang of it, it was pretty easy.</li>
            <li>I feel lucky to have discovered it.</li>
            <li>Super product and doesn&#x27;t make you break out like wax does.</li>
            <li>Much better than so many of those chemical-filled creams that can cause burns and have to be re-bought as hair grows back.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>It was quick.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery and great little gadget!  </li>
            <li>this is fast and easy, this is my true feels of the items as i got it on discount</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure that it prevents or slows new hairs from growing, but it does appear to be pulling the hairs from the root.  </li>
            <li>Fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use and very efficient too.  </li>
            <li>This works really well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does the job on the upper lip area and even grabs most of the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it hurts!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it does!  </li>
            <li>It will gently pull the fine hairs out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this tool a few times since I purchased it and am quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li>and I am already so much happier with how smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li>It definitely isn&#x27;t painless but it is a lot easier to use than trying to thread your own face.</li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see how permanent the hair removal is as it is too early for me to tell.</li>
            <li>That in and of itself makes this item SO worth while, all for $10.95,</li>
            <li>It doen&#x27;t worth a penny</li>
            <li>Its totally worth the cost though</li>
            <li>It does it job and is worth it.</li>
            <li>But the pain is SO worth the no chemicals or wax on my face.</li>
            <li>Hurts like the devil, but you end up getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Super economical compared to a threading service or the hair removal</li>
            <li>Very handy little tool.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work great with much less pain than waxing, too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly painless--you are pulling hair out by the roots, but it doesn&#x27;t last and best of all there is no swelling.</li>
            <li>I showed it to a friend, and she didn&#x27;t get any hair, so I laughed and said &amp;#34;then twist your hands the OTHER direction&amp;#34; and blammo.  </li>
            <li>I will be honest and say unless I&#x27;m using this product incorrectly I do notice that when it rolls a certain direction - it definitely removes hair, but wrapping the hair into the spring and pulling the hair away from the face is a quick &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li>I used it right after I got out of the shower</li>
            <li>the hairs just pulled right out with no pain</li>
            <li>Takes practice and each time I use it I have to find the right rhythm again.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not working for you, then your technique isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>Works great, does sting a lot first few times and takes some practice.</li>
            <li>I just wish I knew about this great little tool and company years  ago!</li>
            <li>This little tool is amazing!</li>
            <li>I read a lot of the reviews and some said it was not pain free and perhaps their skin is more sensitive than mine, but for me, I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>It got better very quickly once I just expected it.</li>
            <li>Not completely &amp;#34;painless&amp;#34; but effective .</li>
            <li>After a little practice, I am learning how to be more accurate with it, and I do not think I will be tweezing anymore!</li>
            <li>Product delivery was fast but as far using it it hurts more than waxing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good at targeting all the hairs and your upper lip is left completely clean.</li>
            <li>Wow!  works fabulously.  </li>
            <li>I brought this remover to my wife she likes very much.</li>
            <li>Makes taking care of facial hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I give it a high rating even with the &amp;#34;pain free&amp;#34; experience not holding true.</li>
            <li>It stretched out too easily and would not return to its original shape.  </li>
            <li>I received the blue handled Threading tool on a special sellers promotional offer along with the free eyebrow razor.</li>
            <li>The only difference is you could not use this product for your eyebrows as they require more precision.</li>
            <li>And sometimes the first pass doesn&#x27;t do it, so you have to try again.</li>
            <li>My first introduction to products like this was 12 years ago while serving our country in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>but sadly, no.  </li>
            <li>It worked on my first try.</li>
            <li>Finer hairs are removed, the coarser ones not so much, but they&#x27;re then easier to see for removing with tweezers!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this and have recommended it to friends already, and I have only had it one day!!.  </li>
            <li>It felt exactly what I would have imagined plucking 15 hairs out at once would feel like:  </li>
            <li>I have from time to time about a dozen hairs that i consistently used a tweezer to pluck from my chin.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is probably because I used to tweeze my upper lip hair off, rather than waxing it or bleaching it, but I love this.</li>
            <li>it really works!</li>
            <li>thank goodness, nobody wants ingrowns on their face!</li>
            <li>Very recommended!</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well just like</li>
            <li>And it really does!</li>
            <li>I bought for 5$ only and worked much better .</li>
            <li>The threader seems to break the facial hairs more often than pulling them out by the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it sure keeps the facial fuzz away!</li>
            <li>I tried this hair remover out on my husband and let me tell you it was funny.  </li>
            <li>and it worked better for me the second time around.</li>
            <li>Overall the product says what it does, and I am pleased with that.</li>
            <li>This thing really works!</li>
            <li>When I first received this threading tool I was scared to try it because how could this spring device be painless??</li>
            <li>At first you don&#x27;t know what to expect so</li>
            <li>This is unfortunately not what I was hoping it was.  </li>
            <li>It has alittle pinch the first couple times you do it</li>
            <li>PROs for this tool: easy to use, easy to clean, works (though it takes several rolls over the same area to get all the hair gone)</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to remove their own facial hair easily.</li>
            <li>I watched a couple of short videos online so that I knew exactly what to do and for the first time in years, my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My daughter recorded me trying it for the first time, much to her amusement.</li>
            <li>She has said so many times that why did it take so long for her to find this.</li>
            <li>The item shipped fast and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t exactly say it is pain free but not nearly as painful as other methods.</li>
            <li>I really like it very easy to use and very fast little pain in first 1 minute and nothing after</li>
            <li>There is some redness immediately following hair removal, but it goes away very quickly and there isn&#x27;t any reactions</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This just isnt precise enough if you don&#x27;t have much hair to remove.</li>
            <li>The product is straight forward and works well.</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>so I was really hoping it would work</li>
            <li>this thing takes a bit to get used to, but it really works</li>
            <li>Yes this works fast once you get the hang of</li>
            <li>This is not a painless way to remove hairs but really fast if you use it correctly.</li>
            <li>I still rub my thumb along my chin line but only because it is so amazingly smooth</li>
            <li>but, again, pretty normal for any hair removal product with me.  </li>
            <li>As I continued on, it didn&#x27;t hurt as much....</li>
            <li>She said it worked even better than expected</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much faster than tweezing, which would take me around 40 minutes to do and I would have to do it every week.</li>
            <li>Very simple.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Works well... much easier than tweezing.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated the instructions on the cardboard slide attached to the remover.</li>
            <li>This is a fast and affordable way to keep hair at bay.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>The only thing is its not pain free</li>
            <li>It works very well, but it did take me a minute to figure out how to work it.  </li>
            <li>It follows the curves of my face really well</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Much quicker.  </li>
            <li>So , I had the opportunity to try this product out and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I just feel the need to change it&#x27;s uses up to fit my personal preferences.</li>
            <li>and now I don&#x27;t feel any pain because you really get use to it.  </li>
            <li>You wonder where has it been your whole life.  </li>
            <li>this product is very well made, but no hair was removed for me when I used it.  </li>
            <li>I personally can deal with more discomfort on my legs than something as sensitive my face.</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of a wax treatment with out the mess!</li>
            <li>so I thought I would try this instead of some of the more extreme options.</li>
            <li>Although I was skeptical, this handy little product works great.</li>
            <li>It works really good taking off the hairs if your not good with pain though....</li>
            <li>Convenient, small, effective.</li>
            <li>Pain is similar to tweezing or threading - not bad at all.</li>
            <li>probably because there were less hairs to pluck, and I was getting more used to it.    </li>
            <li>Then as I got older</li>
            <li>You may still need to tweeze some shorter, thicker hairs, but the Bellesentials hair remover got 97% and left my face clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>Fast and far cheaper than threading!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this tool.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>They responded to a minor glitch with my order right away and did much more than I expected to solve the problem.  </li>
            <li>I do love this little thing though.  </li>
            <li>Felt a little better when I used it as soon as I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I definitely love my newest little gadget and look forward to not having to wax.  </li>
            <li>so I believe my pours were opened up a little more than normal and</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old and the mustache is growing way too fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really pain free</li>
            <li>I saw this during product launch and thought to myself - it&#x27;s worth a try, because I have unwanted facial hair growing.</li>
            <li>Difficult to clean the hairs out of the spring, but overall a good product.  </li>
            <li>This tool works on fine facial hair, does not remove coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get the really fine hairs/peach fuzz, but it definitely works well on coarse hairs.  </li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair on my upper lip and it loves to shine.</li>
            <li>product is quite effective with removing the little peach fuzz on chin and upper lip area</li>
            <li>No mixing, no mess, no microwaving, no prep; just roll it between your fingers and go!!</li>
            <li>so this was all new to me.  </li>
            <li>I finally found something I&#x27;m comfortable using on my upper lip!  </li>
            <li>, so he took the threading tool created an upside down U and quickly removed a handful of hair off my face!</li>
            <li>It came VERY fast in the mail, like the next day almost.  </li>
            <li>Well, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The company was very professional.  </li>
            <li>I was very nervous at first thinking I was going to pinch my self or better yet cut off too much hair in the wrong spot.</li>
            <li>I would give it a five except for the fact that a second item came alongside the first</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>So it arrived, the first thing I noticed was that the directions are in Japanese (even though it&#x27;s made in China).</li>
            <li>I would recommend to those willing to try the product without instruction as they are in Chinese</li>
            <li>Easy to use and those little hairs Don&#x27;t stand a chance.</li>
            <li>I noticed my peach fuzz on my upper lip started  not being so peachy, and more dense and dark.  </li>
            <li>Flipping it around to get it to work on the chin was a little challenging but the flexibility of this tool ended up working there also pulling out multiple hairs at a time.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I stumbled upon this little tool!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be used on eyebrows and difficult to be precise about the hairs you&#x27;re pulling, so it&#x27;s not an alternative to threading if you need a detailed cleanup.  </li>
            <li>and I can control the amount of pain I have to tolerate in order to keep the chin line and lip line clear.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t recommend for anyone who has sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>It does take some getting used to as far as pain of ripping the hair out and what works for you</li>
            <li>worked well... completely painless...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Y&#x27;all know I like to have natural options, and frugal ones as well.    </li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised to find it works.</li>
            <li>No messy creams that burn the skin..</li>
            <li>this works well if you can&#x27;t get to a professional threader.</li>
            <li>As far as the pain level I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>My skin is way too sensitive to use this product</li>
            <li>After a few minutes of using the Spring Hair Remover, my lip was just as smooth as it is when waxed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable and if you have facial hair</li>
            <li>I have only ever plucks my eyebrows before, so I was excited to try something new, and hopefully faster, but I was doubtful about how accurate this product would be.. for such a simple tool, it is surprisingly easy to use and quick to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I would much rather do this than have the chemical burns from Nair other hair removal methods, they were not working for me very well anyway</li>
            <li>Removes hair effortlessly with no pain and no mess.</li>
            <li>This tool has no mess factor or risk of burning my skin.</li>
            <li>but it is better than waxing which usually leaves my face red and then makes me break out.  </li>
            <li>It does take a little time to get the knack but not bad.</li>
            <li>It is small, compact, and lightweight can fit about anywhere.</li>
            <li>If you buy a normal spring, it will achieve the same functionality.</li>
            <li>Minor pain but not nearly as bad as tweezing the tiny individual hairs</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s a little sting that goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I will say, though, that this really is only for FACIAL hair, not for any other parts of your body mainly because you can&#x27;t get the right curve of the coil with the right amount of force to pull the hair out on any other part of your body.</li>
            <li>I have a scar right along my chin line that I have had for 35 years, and dark hair always grew from that spot.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair mixed with coarse dark hair on my face- a recipe for disaster.  </li>
            <li>For such a simple tool this really works.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is, it will definitely pull the root out, which can also be scary too.</li>
            <li>There is a little pain, but it&#x27;s worth it to have a fuzzless face.</li>
            <li>Very good product and feels exactly like threading (a little painful but necessary).</li>
            <li>this product is great for the lip area, as waxing is so painful.</li>
            <li>I got clear instructions in English.</li>
            <li>Have only used it once so far so would like to see how it works going forward.  </li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, the threading tool works well to yank out the facial hair, even the baby soft fuzz hair.</li>
            <li>and they say that as you keep using the threading tool it will slow growth since it&#x27;s pulling the hairs from the root, and they will grow in thinner and more sparse than before using the tool.&lt;br /&gt;Small enough to keep in your purse, for the days you have extra time in the car, when the sun is out</li>
            <li>It does hurt a little, but the more often you do it the less it hurts.</li>
            <li>It took the hair right out, just a few minutes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see a problem with the handles as other users did.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that such a simple tool could work so well.</li>
            <li>It works ok on the upper lip but not really great for the chin, which is where I have the issue.</li>
            <li>But it is hard to line it up in the right place to get the hairs!</li>
            <li>I was looking for an alternative to monthly waxing and this little tool works pretty well.</li>
            <li>So far this wasn&#x27;t faster than waxing but still didn&#x27;t take long</li>
            <li>Chemicals leave me red and irritated; plucking was inconsistent (frequently found a foot long granny hair sprung from my chin...</li>
            <li>and all I can say is at least it&#x27;s over quickly</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t think it is any worse than waxing easier, no mess, faster, and works better.  </li>
            <li>It took a little while to get the hang of it and a couple of times it really zings you, but plucking hurts as well.</li>
            <li>Either way, highly recommend if you have extremely dark and fast-growing hair like me on your face.</li>

            <li> but I loved it wanted to find an easier way to replace waxing for my peach fuzz</li>
            <li> I have fair hair</li>

            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly effective hair removal tool, but don&#x27;t for a minute believe the &amp;#34;pain-free&amp;#34; hype.</li>
            <li> I liked the eyebrow trimmer that came with the threading tool.</li>
            <li> This product is so handy.  </li>
            <li> I received this at a promotional rate to use, review and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its really effective.</li>
            <li> Bonus eyebrow razor was nice too.</li>
            <li> This hair removing tool is effective, but not without a bit of pain.</li>
            <li> It is not as effective as advertised and it is NOT PAINLESS.</li>
            <li> will come in handy for travel.</li>
            <li> I liked the size and thought it was well made.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate how effectively it grabs and removes that fuzz and stray hairs.  </li>
            <li> Fast and effective; i was extremely impressed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Loving it.</li>
            <li> But to my surprise it was so easy tho use and effective!</li>
            <li> I would have to say, however this was a great success!</li>
            <li> Good easy</li>
            <li> Item is as described and surprisingly it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The hair remover is very easy to use, it grips onto the hair very easily and viola</li>
            <li> For $10.95, I think it&#x27;s a good cheap hair removal option.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this, it did pluck some hairs out, took longer and wasn&#x27;t more effective than my tweezer.</li>
            <li> So in the car with natural sunlight would be perfect to use this.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> It even takes the very fine hairs off</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, pain free and great price!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Good one but pain full</li>
            <li> is when I notice those fine peach hairs in places I do not want them!</li>
            <li> Good product and the shipment was quick</li>
            <li> This works well, but is not pain free!</li>
            <li> This is simple and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the best and easiest method of facial hair remover I have found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad they did because I love the product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT &amp; you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on healthy diet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews for Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I will never use another device, cream or tweezers again, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it any more.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> Excellent facial hair remover.</li>
            <li> I was blown away at how many hairs it was able to pull out at a time.  </li>
            <li> I received the item free in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li> What a very awesome invention, I received my Spring Facial hair remover and immediately started trying to figure out how to use it.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with the product as it prevents me from having to manually pluck or wax!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I cannot stress how much I LOVE this.</li>
            <li> Removes maybe two at most hair follicles at a time.  </li>
            <li> Now as I age even more hairs are coming in, so I bought this product.  </li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my upper and lower lip ....</li>
            <li> A different type of pain from waxing and takes time to perfect technique, which I haven&#x27;t yet done.</li>
            <li> a video or photo instructions  may have been better.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always good for a laugh.</li>
            <li> misses more hairs than it&#x27;ll get, might as well take tweezers to them.</li>
            <li> and I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> A wonderful device to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend usig a tweezer is better than this tool.</li>
            <li> I use it in a twisty, open and closing way and find that works best for me.</li>
            <li> and I was able to do it without a mirror</li>
            <li> there is more breakage than i was hoping for, but it does work and i will probably get better at it as time goes by.</li>
            <li> Best suited for larger areas.  </li>
            <li> This works ok.  </li>
            <li> Probably would work better with practice and patience.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product for facial hair!</li>
            <li> There are many times when I try to get to the salon</li>
            <li> After getting use to it, it worked so much better than plucking.</li>
            <li> and I was so glad to find your product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used to help remove unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Works ok .</li>
            <li> As you get used to it then &#x27;grab&#x27; more at a time.  </li>
            <li> I love it because I can do touch ups at any time and don&#x27;t have to go anywhere, spend time on waxing etc.</li>
            <li> This product was rather interesting to me, as I&#x27;ve never heard of or seen anything like it.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This threading tool grabs many hairs at one time and speeds up the removal process</li>
            <li> but its so much better than using tweezers and pinching your skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> Every once in a while once in awhile you run across something that just makes your life easier and better.  </li>
            <li> Thank goodness :)</li>
            <li> Never used these before and was surprised how good it work!</li>
            <li> My face was smoother and cleaner after just one use, its a must have for all the girls, i never used the razor but its handy for emergency clean up i guess.</li>
            <li> It did arrive on time and in perfect condition and the long razor was included</li>
            <li> My daughter has a higher priced one and this works just as good</li>
            <li> It definitely is effective and quick, but painless?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be nice to have a quick guide on the package.</li>
            <li> it’s a great tool for removing your facial hair in the privacy of your own home.  </li>
            <li> So when I was offered this Spring Facial Hair Remover for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I said why not.</li>
            <li> not leave your skin bright red like the waxing does, so quick and painless is a great option for me.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Be sure that your face is clean before using and be sure to moisturize afterward.</li>
            <li> , it would be more secure in your hands if it were rubber, but it seems to be a negligible problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most importantly, gave me a boost of confidence.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I tried it and could not get it to work worth anything.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s serrated and really works at a good angle to get those eyebrow hairs also.</li>
            <li> the price is right, the support from the company is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This item was delivered very quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> So easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I found the device easy to use.</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> It seemed some it could grip on some rather easily</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it was not so easy removing the thicker hairs on the chin.</li>
            <li> easy to use</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use..</li>
            <li> It is very easily removing  the unwanted hair from her face and she is using for her upper lip and the product is good no problems with it .</li>
            <li> The best little tool I ever got ahold of..</li>
            <li> This makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It works great on upper lip.  </li>
            <li> handles are cheap plastic and look tacky, but who sees them?  </li>
            <li> Now I use this every night for a couple of minutes and I am smooth.</li>
            <li> This threading tool became available to purchase discounted during a promotion, so I bought it hoping it would help.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t shave because then the hairs come back as ingrown hairs, but tweezing, and now this  threading tool works great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pain free.  </li>
            <li> One note, this is not a pain free experience.  </li>
            <li> It is not pain free, but tolerable.</li>
            <li> ...let&#x27;s just say it wasn&#x27;t comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Works well for a quick and easy cleanup job.  </li>
            <li> not as user friendly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> and it is extremely effective at peach fuzz removal from forehead, cheeks, chin, jawline, and most importantly - your upper lip.</li>
            <li> I am planning on buying more for myself &amp; all my sisters &amp; all my friends ;-)</li>
            <li> I was pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t going to work.  </li>
            <li> Seems pretty durable and sure</li>
            <li> I was so excited because it worked.</li>
            <li> (I have to ice after I use it, not to break out) but it is way more gentle than waxing</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this for me online as the reviews for this product was good overall.</li>
            <li> The pain for me was not bad</li>
            <li> But once you know what to expect it really is not bad at all in fact I am hooked on this threading tool.  </li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t strong enough for those, but it is getting newer hairs quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s simple, easy to use, and effective.</li>
            <li> but once I got the hang of it, it was pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I feel lucky to have discovered it.</li>
            <li> Super product and doesn&#x27;t make you break out like wax does.</li>
            <li> Much better than so many of those chemical-filled creams that can cause burns and have to be re-bought as hair grows back.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> It was quick.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery and great little gadget!  </li>
            <li> this is fast and easy, this is my true feels of the items as i got it on discount</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure that it prevents or slows new hairs from growing, but it does appear to be pulling the hairs from the root.  </li>
            <li> Fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use and very efficient too.  </li>
            <li> This works really well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does the job on the upper lip area and even grabs most of the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it hurts!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it does!  </li>
            <li> It will gently pull the fine hairs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this tool a few times since I purchased it and am quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li> and I am already so much happier with how smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li> It definitely isn&#x27;t painless but it is a lot easier to use than trying to thread your own face.</li>
            <li> It will be interesting to see how permanent the hair removal is as it is too early for me to tell.</li>
            <li> That in and of itself makes this item SO worth while, all for $10.95,</li>
            <li> It doen&#x27;t worth a penny</li>
            <li> Its totally worth the cost though</li>
            <li> It does it job and is worth it.</li>
            <li> But the pain is SO worth the no chemicals or wax on my face.</li>
            <li> Hurts like the devil, but you end up getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Super economical compared to a threading service or the hair removal</li>
            <li> Very handy little tool.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work great with much less pain than waxing, too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly painless--you are pulling hair out by the roots, but it doesn&#x27;t last and best of all there is no swelling.</li>
            <li> I showed it to a friend, and she didn&#x27;t get any hair, so I laughed and said &amp;#34;then twist your hands the OTHER direction&amp;#34; and blammo.  </li>
            <li> I will be honest and say unless I&#x27;m using this product incorrectly I do notice that when it rolls a certain direction - it definitely removes hair, but wrapping the hair into the spring and pulling the hair away from the face is a quick &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> I used it right after I got out of the shower</li>
            <li> the hairs just pulled right out with no pain</li>
            <li> Takes practice and each time I use it I have to find the right rhythm again.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not working for you, then your technique isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> Works great, does sting a lot first few times and takes some practice.</li>
            <li> I just wish I knew about this great little tool and company years  ago!</li>
            <li> This little tool is amazing!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews and some said it was not pain free and perhaps their skin is more sensitive than mine, but for me, I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> It got better very quickly once I just expected it.</li>
            <li> Not completely &amp;#34;painless&amp;#34; but effective .</li>
            <li> After a little practice, I am learning how to be more accurate with it, and I do not think I will be tweezing anymore!</li>
            <li> Product delivery was fast but as far using it it hurts more than waxing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good at targeting all the hairs and your upper lip is left completely clean.</li>
            <li> Wow!  works fabulously.  </li>
            <li> I brought this remover to my wife she likes very much.</li>
            <li> Makes taking care of facial hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I give it a high rating even with the &amp;#34;pain free&amp;#34; experience not holding true.</li>
            <li> It stretched out too easily and would not return to its original shape.  </li>
            <li> I received the blue handled Threading tool on a special sellers promotional offer along with the free eyebrow razor.</li>
            <li> The only difference is you could not use this product for your eyebrows as they require more precision.</li>
            <li> And sometimes the first pass doesn&#x27;t do it, so you have to try again.</li>
            <li> My first introduction to products like this was 12 years ago while serving our country in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> but sadly, no.  </li>
            <li> It worked on my first try.</li>
            <li> Finer hairs are removed, the coarser ones not so much, but they&#x27;re then easier to see for removing with tweezers!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and have recommended it to friends already, and I have only had it one day!!.  </li>
            <li> It felt exactly what I would have imagined plucking 15 hairs out at once would feel like:  </li>
            <li> I have from time to time about a dozen hairs that i consistently used a tweezer to pluck from my chin.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is probably because I used to tweeze my upper lip hair off, rather than waxing it or bleaching it, but I love this.</li>
            <li> it really works!</li>
            <li> thank goodness, nobody wants ingrowns on their face!</li>
            <li> Very recommended!</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well just like</li>
            <li> And it really does!</li>
            <li> I bought for 5$ only and worked much better .</li>
            <li> The threader seems to break the facial hairs more often than pulling them out by the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it sure keeps the facial fuzz away!</li>
            <li> I tried this hair remover out on my husband and let me tell you it was funny.  </li>
            <li> and it worked better for me the second time around.</li>
            <li> Overall the product says what it does, and I am pleased with that.</li>
            <li> This thing really works!</li>
            <li> When I first received this threading tool I was scared to try it because how could this spring device be painless??</li>
            <li> At first you don&#x27;t know what to expect so</li>
            <li> This is unfortunately not what I was hoping it was.  </li>
            <li> It has alittle pinch the first couple times you do it</li>
            <li> PROs for this tool: easy to use, easy to clean, works (though it takes several rolls over the same area to get all the hair gone)</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to remove their own facial hair easily.</li>
            <li> I watched a couple of short videos online so that I knew exactly what to do and for the first time in years, my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> My daughter recorded me trying it for the first time, much to her amusement.</li>
            <li> She has said so many times that why did it take so long for her to find this.</li>
            <li> The item shipped fast and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t exactly say it is pain free but not nearly as painful as other methods.</li>
            <li> I really like it very easy to use and very fast little pain in first 1 minute and nothing after</li>
            <li> There is some redness immediately following hair removal, but it goes away very quickly and there isn&#x27;t any reactions</li>
            <li> I certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This just isnt precise enough if you don&#x27;t have much hair to remove.</li>
            <li> The product is straight forward and works well.</li>
            <li> This works very well.  </li>
            <li> This really works.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> so I was really hoping it would work</li>
            <li> this thing takes a bit to get used to, but it really works</li>
            <li> Yes this works fast once you get the hang of</li>
            <li> This is not a painless way to remove hairs but really fast if you use it correctly.</li>
            <li> I still rub my thumb along my chin line but only because it is so amazingly smooth</li>
            <li> but, again, pretty normal for any hair removal product with me.  </li>
            <li> As I continued on, it didn&#x27;t hurt as much....</li>
            <li> She said it worked even better than expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much faster than tweezing, which would take me around 40 minutes to do and I would have to do it every week.</li>
            <li> Very simple.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Works well... much easier than tweezing.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> I appreciated the instructions on the cardboard slide attached to the remover.</li>
            <li> This is a fast and affordable way to keep hair at bay.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> The only thing is its not pain free</li>
            <li> It works very well, but it did take me a minute to figure out how to work it.  </li>
            <li> It follows the curves of my face really well</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Much quicker.  </li>
            <li> So , I had the opportunity to try this product out and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I just feel the need to change it&#x27;s uses up to fit my personal preferences.</li>
            <li> and now I don&#x27;t feel any pain because you really get use to it.  </li>
            <li> You wonder where has it been your whole life.  </li>
            <li> this product is very well made, but no hair was removed for me when I used it.  </li>
            <li> I personally can deal with more discomfort on my legs than something as sensitive my face.</li>
            <li> It kind of reminds me of a wax treatment with out the mess!</li>
            <li> so I thought I would try this instead of some of the more extreme options.</li>
            <li> Although I was skeptical, this handy little product works great.</li>
            <li> It works really good taking off the hairs if your not good with pain though....</li>
            <li> Convenient, small, effective.</li>
            <li> Pain is similar to tweezing or threading - not bad at all.</li>
            <li> probably because there were less hairs to pluck, and I was getting more used to it.    </li>
            <li> Then as I got older</li>
            <li> You may still need to tweeze some shorter, thicker hairs, but the Bellesentials hair remover got 97% and left my face clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> Fast and far cheaper than threading!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this tool.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They responded to a minor glitch with my order right away and did much more than I expected to solve the problem.  </li>
            <li> I do love this little thing though.  </li>
            <li> Felt a little better when I used it as soon as I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I definitely love my newest little gadget and look forward to not having to wax.  </li>
            <li> so I believe my pours were opened up a little more than normal and</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and the mustache is growing way too fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really pain free</li>
            <li> I saw this during product launch and thought to myself - it&#x27;s worth a try, because I have unwanted facial hair growing.</li>
            <li> Difficult to clean the hairs out of the spring, but overall a good product.  </li>
            <li> This tool works on fine facial hair, does not remove coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the really fine hairs/peach fuzz, but it definitely works well on coarse hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair on my upper lip and it loves to shine.</li>
            <li> product is quite effective with removing the little peach fuzz on chin and upper lip area</li>
            <li> No mixing, no mess, no microwaving, no prep; just roll it between your fingers and go!!</li>
            <li> so this was all new to me.  </li>
            <li> I finally found something I&#x27;m comfortable using on my upper lip!  </li>
            <li> , so he took the threading tool created an upside down U and quickly removed a handful of hair off my face!</li>
            <li> It came VERY fast in the mail, like the next day almost.  </li>
            <li> Well, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The company was very professional.  </li>
            <li> I was very nervous at first thinking I was going to pinch my self or better yet cut off too much hair in the wrong spot.</li>
            <li> I would give it a five except for the fact that a second item came alongside the first</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> So it arrived, the first thing I noticed was that the directions are in Japanese (even though it&#x27;s made in China).</li>
            <li> I would recommend to those willing to try the product without instruction as they are in Chinese</li>
            <li> Easy to use and those little hairs Don&#x27;t stand a chance.</li>
            <li> I noticed my peach fuzz on my upper lip started  not being so peachy, and more dense and dark.  </li>
            <li> Flipping it around to get it to work on the chin was a little challenging but the flexibility of this tool ended up working there also pulling out multiple hairs at a time.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I stumbled upon this little tool!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be used on eyebrows and difficult to be precise about the hairs you&#x27;re pulling, so it&#x27;s not an alternative to threading if you need a detailed cleanup.  </li>
            <li> and I can control the amount of pain I have to tolerate in order to keep the chin line and lip line clear.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend for anyone who has sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to as far as pain of ripping the hair out and what works for you</li>
            <li> worked well... completely painless...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;all know I like to have natural options, and frugal ones as well.    </li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised to find it works.</li>
            <li> No messy creams that burn the skin..</li>
            <li> this works well if you can&#x27;t get to a professional threader.</li>
            <li> As far as the pain level I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> My skin is way too sensitive to use this product</li>
            <li> After a few minutes of using the Spring Hair Remover, my lip was just as smooth as it is when waxed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable and if you have facial hair</li>
            <li> I have only ever plucks my eyebrows before, so I was excited to try something new, and hopefully faster, but I was doubtful about how accurate this product would be.. for such a simple tool, it is surprisingly easy to use and quick to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I would much rather do this than have the chemical burns from Nair other hair removal methods, they were not working for me very well anyway</li>
            <li> Removes hair effortlessly with no pain and no mess.</li>
            <li> This tool has no mess factor or risk of burning my skin.</li>
            <li> but it is better than waxing which usually leaves my face red and then makes me break out.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little time to get the knack but not bad.</li>
            <li> It is small, compact, and lightweight can fit about anywhere.</li>
            <li> If you buy a normal spring, it will achieve the same functionality.</li>
            <li> Minor pain but not nearly as bad as tweezing the tiny individual hairs</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a little sting that goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I will say, though, that this really is only for FACIAL hair, not for any other parts of your body mainly because you can&#x27;t get the right curve of the coil with the right amount of force to pull the hair out on any other part of your body.</li>
            <li> I have a scar right along my chin line that I have had for 35 years, and dark hair always grew from that spot.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair mixed with coarse dark hair on my face- a recipe for disaster.  </li>
            <li> For such a simple tool this really works.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is, it will definitely pull the root out, which can also be scary too.</li>
            <li> There is a little pain, but it&#x27;s worth it to have a fuzzless face.</li>
            <li> Very good product and feels exactly like threading (a little painful but necessary).</li>
            <li> this product is great for the lip area, as waxing is so painful.</li>
            <li> I got clear instructions in English.</li>
            <li> Have only used it once so far so would like to see how it works going forward.  </li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, the threading tool works well to yank out the facial hair, even the baby soft fuzz hair.</li>
            <li> and they say that as you keep using the threading tool it will slow growth since it&#x27;s pulling the hairs from the root, and they will grow in thinner and more sparse than before using the tool.&lt;br /&gt;Small enough to keep in your purse, for the days you have extra time in the car, when the sun is out</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little, but the more often you do it the less it hurts.</li>
            <li> It took the hair right out, just a few minutes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a problem with the handles as other users did.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that such a simple tool could work so well.</li>
            <li> It works ok on the upper lip but not really great for the chin, which is where I have the issue.</li>
            <li> But it is hard to line it up in the right place to get the hairs!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to monthly waxing and this little tool works pretty well.</li>
            <li> So far this wasn&#x27;t faster than waxing but still didn&#x27;t take long</li>
            <li> Chemicals leave me red and irritated; plucking was inconsistent (frequently found a foot long granny hair sprung from my chin...</li>
            <li> and all I can say is at least it&#x27;s over quickly</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I don&#x27;t think it is any worse than waxing easier, no mess, faster, and works better.  </li>
            <li> It took a little while to get the hang of it and a couple of times it really zings you, but plucking hurts as well.</li>
            <li> Either way, highly recommend if you have extremely dark and fast-growing hair like me on your face.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only took about 20 minutes vs an hour and a half I normally spend removing my peach fuzz, squinting into a mirror</li>
            <li> Probably works better if you have a lot of long hair but short random hairs ...</li>
            <li> It only took a minute to get the process down with very little prickly pain but adjusted quickly.</li>
            <li> I found the Spring Threading Tool to be really efficient at removing multiple &amp;#34;whiskers&amp;#34; at once with little pain and minimal effort.</li>
            <li> , I cannot stress enough how long it takes..</li>
            <li> The directions say to bend the tool and place it flat against your face.</li>
            <li> This little, inexpensive tool is going to save big bucks since I&#x27;ve been paying for professional waxing services for some time.</li>
            <li> Better than waxes, and other methods I&#x27;ve tried, including expensive salon hair removal on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to work it correctly, and I expected it to be more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries but really works.  </li>
            <li> I have to confess I was surprised by how well this little tool works.</li>
            <li> It was pretty painful, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> Its effective and painful</li>
            <li> This being said, I wax my upper lip, the hair isn&#x27;t dark but if it gets fuzzy enough, it casts a shadow.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not completely painless, though</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s strangely addicting.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s hard to get the smaller hair sometimes, but luckily they provide a small razor for the pesky hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, easy and you don&#x27;t need nasty chemicals!&lt;br</li>
            <li> there is a small learning curve, but anything new has a learning curve.</li>
            <li> And&#x27;s it such a simple little thing.  </li>
            <li> Go slow at first with only a few hairs.  </li>
            <li> Takes just a little practice but far surpasses bleaching or waxing, takes half the time and leaves no lasting redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately was not impressed by this contraption, it sounds like a great idea and if you have the time and patience</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like pulling off a band-aid than what I thought would feel like painfully tweezing several hairs at once.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t miss a single hair.</li>
            <li> , i had dark facial hair and within 10 mins  could yank on all the hair from my face.</li>
            <li> I could only do a small section of chin and upper lip at a time.  </li>
            <li> This will save me money in the long run and I can do this every other day or so.</li>
            <li> After I completed my upper lip, I put a little bit of Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel astringent on the area and cleaned the tool with rubbing alcohol, like the directions suggested.</li>
            <li> Not as painful as tweezing and more than 10x faster.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely more painful than plucking</li>
            <li> To me it was minimal pain -</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries and it hurts at first but a few passes each night and no more whiskers.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected made me break out</li>
            <li> I tried using it a couple of times per day but at only a few strands at a time, I would never have a hairless face.</li>
            <li> It does hurt some but thats expected when ripping out hair.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple tries to get it to work.  </li>
            <li> I have spent years of electrolysis and plucking chin hairs.  </li>
            <li> This product was exactly as I expected, and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> There is some pain involved but is so minimal .</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to have those few days of walking around with upper lip hair.</li>
            <li> It simply didn&#x27;t work and the few hairs it did remove</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not designed to groom eyebrows well</li>
            <li> :) This little product makes quick work of a painful, tedious job.</li>
            <li> usually in the middle of the work day).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen or done the other threading that is out there</li>
            <li> I also used this on my forehead for little hairs and on the little blonde hairs that are all around my face that give me a peach fuzzy look.</li>
            <li> First , It&#x27;s difficult to use , I never figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why others had pain, but I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> I have a hairy face due to my nationalities.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be too sharp</li>
            <li> I was paying $8 to $10 dollars every other week to get my eyebrows &amp;#34;threaded&amp;#34; and now I can do it my self.</li>
            <li> Its easy but PAINFUL.</li>
            <li> so it is hard to see facial hair to remove it.</li>
            <li> Not worth returning.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is there isn&#x27;t direction with the tool.</li>
            <li> And for those with sensitive skin that react poorly to wax and chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is less painful than threading (the upper lip area can be sensitive) and took about 5 minutes total.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was dull after the first use!</li>
            <li> I have PCOS symptoms of facial hair growth that isn&#x27;t really that bad</li>
            <li> It does seem less of a shock/painful the longer</li>
            <li> And not have tho deal with the redness and slight pian that you have with threading.</li>
            <li> This is not true.</li>
            <li> Not true in my case.  </li>
            <li> I do a little every day</li>
            <li> It takes a little patience and some trial and error.</li>
            <li> I did feel a little bit of discomfort when removing the hair</li>
            <li> I have used it a little bit every day and would have given it 5 stars except that the description stated &amp;#34;pain free&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tolerable pain but still stings a little</li>
            <li> This item is way to pricy and not worth it!</li>
            <li> it does catch you off guard and does hurt a little bit.</li>
            <li> Very hard to keep close to skin and twist at the same time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put it down!</li>
            <li> I allowed the hair on my face to grow out, and the tool pulled out a few strands.</li>
            <li> you do have to roll it a few times to pick up all the hairs.</li>
            <li> I just use a few time ist not</li>
            <li> I appreciate that there is no irritation left behind</li>
            <li> the ouch plus short stubby broken off hair.</li>
            <li> wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money</li>
            <li> I do have to follow up with tweezers for a few stray hairs, but I&#x27;d say it removes 95% on</li>
            <li> I was watching my toddler walking and using it to get rid of my upper lip hair walking behind her</li>
            <li> I am still plucking the stiff regrowth from years of plucking.  </li>
            <li> It seems like a small little razor.</li>
            <li> CONs for this tool: it does take several rolls over the same area to get the hair gone, it&#x27;s painful (comparable to threading).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was also a little worried because this brand was a little less expensive than other brands.  </li>
            <li> This takes around 5 minutes to do my entire upper lip and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s painful</li>
            <li> And, yes, it does hurt a little, but anytime you pull hairs out by the roots it is going to hurt!  </li>
            <li> (once you&#x27;ve tweezed every single hair off your upper lip for 6 years, anything is less painful than that).</li>
            <li> And it takes a little practice to master the technique, but after watching the video on Amazon it wasn&#x27;t too hard.</li>
            <li> Was a little hard to figure out how to use it</li>
            <li> and it hurts very little, however I´m  </li>
            <li> it really does work, and it doesnt hurt that bad.</li>
            <li> Took a few attempts to master the motion and voila!  </li>
            <li> Does get small hairs though.</li>
            <li> No more waxes, creams, trips to the salon.</li>
            <li> No more waxing for me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quite difficult with 4 kids and only 2 are in school.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money !</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can take this along when I travel and keep my face free of those nasty little hairs.</li>
            <li> Hard to use and removes very little.  </li>
            <li> Often times when pulling hair out it tends to be a little painful, with the Spring Facial Hair Remover, I’m pulling hairs out with little to no pain at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find an easier way to get rid of unwanted facial hair that wasn&#x27;t as painful as my epilator and other tools I&#x27;d tried.</li>
            <li> and depilatories (hated even more and always left nasty, irritated red marks on my face).</li>
            <li> having a hard time getting the hairs on the side of my lip</li>
            <li> and I would hardly call it pain.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Kinda hurts and seems like a slow process,</li>
            <li> I had to leave a few stragglers behind because I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.</li>
            <li> it was WAY less painful than waxing or getting a burn from  cream removers, and less painful than tweezing because it works SO fast.)  </li>
            <li> No MORE tweezing!</li>
            <li> Not quite (and I mean, not quite...</li>
            <li> No more waxing for me!</li>
            <li> No more peach fuzz!</li>
            <li> but that was to be expected, but it was totally less painful than waxing…</li>
            <li> it removes all the small thin hairs that are a hassle with tweezers.</li>
            <li> Like others said, it is a little difficult to remove hairs from under the chin.  </li>
            <li> Does as described, can be a little difficult to get use to using and doesn&#x27;t get everything, every time, I would recommend for those who don&#x27;t want to use chemicals, waxes, etc...</li>
            <li> I imagine if you are used to waxing your upper lip, the pain won&#x27;t be as bad.</li>
            <li> Woke up the next day with my face having a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> But when something is bad and I can do my fellow Amazon shoppers a solid by warning them, I&#x27;m going to do it.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely not what it says and it hurts sooo bad, u don&#x27;t want to use it again</li>
            <li> This was not a good thing.</li>
            <li> This thing is completely and absolutely worthless.  </li>
            <li> It does literally pull the hair off of your face, and it&#x27;s not a pleasant experience if you&#x27;re not expecting it.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to use</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t too bad, but lip definitely pretty painful.  </li>
            <li> I was going crazy every day tweezing, because my skin is so sensitive that creams leave burn scars and waxing was too painful.  </li>
            <li> Did the job in terms of removing hair, but the handling broken after a day.</li>
            <li> Less painful than others described.</li>
            <li> But removing hair from the upper lip area hurts soooo bad!</li>
            <li> Little painful but gets the job done</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for trying crazy things to remove my chin and lip hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little uncomfortable, but, not as painful as tweezing one hair at a time.  </li>
            <li> Too bad I did not look for something like this in the past, it would of save me time and money.</li>
            <li> No more painful than plucking or waxing.</li>
            <li> Entirely useless.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time getting it to pull out all the hair.  </li>
            <li> and others were too difficult.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product, I want my money back.</li>
            <li> all wrong...</li>
            <li> I think I was doing it wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with it.  </li>
            <li> It is painful but no more painful than tweezers.</li>
            <li> Twisting the two handles can be awkward, and if you are elderly or have arthritis, this won&#x27;t work too well for you.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have tried bleaches (hated!)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is pain-free, but it isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>

            <li> Extremely painful.</li>

            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so painful.</li>
            <li> and they said it&#x27;s painful too.</li>
            <li> it is also painful and time intensive.  </li>
            <li> I must say it is painful, but I haven&#x27;t found any method of hair removal yet</li>
            <li> Did not find it painful as some reviews indicated</li>
            <li> Not too painful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This item was delivered very quickly and packaged well. Item is as described and surprisingly it is very easy to use. The product is straight forward and works well. I am happy I ordered this. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> For me i was a greatexperience, my face feel better...and this work very good.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy.  Have only used it once so far so would like to see how it works going forward.  To me it was minimal pain - just like pulling a hair out</li>
            <li> Pros: It definitely works. I was surprised that such a simple tool could work so well. It does the job on the upper lip area and even grabs most of the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it hurts! It is definitely not painless. I imagine if you are used to waxing your upper lip, the pain won&#x27;t be as bad. If you are like me and have only used cream hair removers on that area, be prepared for some pain. I suck it up because I like the results. There is some redness immediately following hair removal, but it goes away very quickly and there isn&#x27;t any reactions (sometimes wax or cream removers would leave me with breakouts or bumps. Not so with this product.)</li>
            <li> This works well, but is not pain free!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this can be advertised as no pain and no irritation. This is not true. The good thing is, it will definitely pull the root out, which can also be scary too.</li>
            <li> Not completely &amp;#34;painless&amp;#34; but effective . love it!!</li>
            <li> So easy. Almost addictive. Waxing always made me break out and was such a chore. I just grab this while doing my makeup and touch up any hairs I see.</li>
            <li> This is simple and works perfectly! No MORE tweezing!</li>
            <li> This works very well.  I followed the directions on line and it worked great for my mustache.  I am 66 years old and the mustache is growing way too fast.  I always cut it off with my cuticle scissors and it left stubble.  This leaves nothing.  It does take a little time to get the knack but not bad.</li>
            <li> Very good product and feels exactly like threading (a little painful but necessary). Took a few attempts to master the motion and voila!  The only difference is you could not use this product for your eyebrows as they require more precision.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where this product has been all my life!  It is wonderful, never has my chin been so clean of hairs.  I don&#x27;t like to wax nor use products like  Nair and saw this tool by. browsing.  I sometimes have to use tweezers for some missed hair, but this tool is AMAZING.  I certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Workd like a charm, the razor that comes with it is really great too.</li>
            <li> This was very painful.</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim and it is a great product! Removes hair effortlessly with no pain and no mess. I recommend this product to anyone thinking about it.</li>
            <li> This really works.  And, yes, it does hurt a little, but anytime you pull hairs out by the roots it is going to hurt!  Makes taking care of facial hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me. It did pull the fuzz but not the coarser hair around my chin. I did however like the eyebrow razor.</li>
            <li> It works great on upper lip.  Like others said, it is a little difficult to remove hairs from under the chin.  I would highly recommend this tool.  I no longer need to get my upper lip threaded when I go for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It does work!!! and it hurts very little, however I´m  having a hard time getting the hairs on the side of my lip</li>
            <li> Extremely painful. Flimsy handles. Entirely useless.</li>
            <li> Great tool! It definitely isn&#x27;t painless but it is a lot easier to use than trying to thread your own face.</li>
            <li> Did the job in terms of removing hair, but the handling broken after a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been threaded and waxed, both have their pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PROs for this tool: easy to use, easy to clean, works (though it takes several rolls over the same area to get all the hair gone), skin doesn&#x27;t rip off (like mine does with waxing), and I don&#x27;t break out from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CONs for this tool: it does take several rolls over the same area to get the hair gone, it&#x27;s painful (comparable to threading).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the time/money to get their facial areas threaded.  And for those with sensitive skin that react poorly to wax and chemicals.</li>
            <li> This tool works on fine facial hair, does not remove coarse hair.  It is not without pain.  I could only do a small section of chin and upper lip at a time.  Too painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the best and easiest method of facial hair remover I have found. Chemicals leave me red and irritated; plucking was inconsistent (frequently found a foot long granny hair sprung from my chin...usually in the middle of the work day). It takes a few tries and it hurts at first but a few passes each night and no more whiskers. I feel lucky to have discovered it.</li>
            <li> It works really good taking off the hairs if your not good with pain though.... then don&#x27;t get it cause your gonna hate it but I loved it wanted to find an easier way to replace waxing for my peach fuzz it was emberacing it&#x27;s even embarrassing to say it here but yes I recommend it any time of the year !!!</li>
            <li> I finally found something I&#x27;m comfortable using on my upper lip!  I hate tweezing, waxing and bleaching.  I do love this little thing though.  It was pretty painful, but worth it.  I would think you&#x27;d get used to it after a couple of uses.  It took the hair right out, just a few minutes and I was done.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.  I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected made me break out</li>
            <li> It could be operator error but I can&#x27;t get it work for me, the way I need it to.</li>
            <li> I was worried this would hurt but it doesnt. Makes my life easier</li>
            <li> Convenient, small, effective. But it hurts....A LOT. That isn&#x27;t the product&#x27;s fault so it still gets five stars....but if you are looking for painless...this isn&#x27;t the solution. But then, what is??</li>
            <li> Super product and doesn&#x27;t make you break out like wax does.</li>
            <li> Product delivery was fast but as far using it it hurts more than waxing</li>
            <li> Works great. Less painful than others described. Easier than waxing</li>
            <li> This tool did not work for me. I&#x27;m an African-American so maybe it didn&#x27;t work because of hair texture. I allowed the hair on my face to grow out, and the tool pulled out a few strands. I tried using it a couple of times per day but at only a few strands at a time, I would never have a hairless face.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works really well. It does hurt some but thats expected when ripping out hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I only wish I would have found out about this product earlier. It does hurt a little, but the more often you do it the less it hurts. And it takes a little practice to master the technique, but after watching the video on Amazon it wasn&#x27;t too hard. I bought one for my teenage daughter and it worked well for her too. It&#x27;s cheap, easy and you don&#x27;t need nasty chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and some people said they didn&#x27;t get instructions, or they weren&#x27;t in English - but the company must have changed this. I got clear instructions in English.</li>
            <li> Truly a great product!!  It works just like they say, the price is right, the support from the company is amazing.  I totally recommend the product and I&#x27;m very impressed with the company handling it.  They responded to a minor glitch with my order right away and did much more than I expected to solve the problem.  I&#x27;m so glad they did because I love the product.  Very happy with my order.  5 stars!</li>
            <li> not as user friendly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly effective hair removal tool, but don&#x27;t for a minute believe the &amp;#34;pain-free&amp;#34; hype. This thing HURTS. You are essentially tangling your hair in a spring and pulling it out; not just one at a time, like with tweezers, but several at a time. And sometimes the first pass doesn&#x27;t do it, so you have to try again. I liked the eyebrow trimmer that came with the threading tool.</li>
            <li> My first introduction to products like this was 12 years ago while serving our country in Hawaii. That product kinda worked, and I have been searching for something similar ever since. Et voila, here it is! Ladies, the construction of this item is second to none and it is extremely effective at peach fuzz removal from forehead, cheeks, chin, jawline, and most importantly - your upper lip. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT &amp; you will too - it works!!!!!(Amen!) there is a small learning curve, but anything new has a learning curve. I am planning on buying more for myself &amp; all my sisters &amp; all my friends ;-)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last as I thought it would. The process doing around the face took longer than having the hairs being removed for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but it made me break out. I&#x27;m on healthy diet and I cleaned my face before and after doing the process. Woke up the next day with my face having a bad reaction. Don&#x27;t recommend for anyone who has sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> It definitely removed hair. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so painful. Felt a little better when I used it as soon as I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is so handy.  i was only tweezing the upper lip, but now i can get rid of fuzz all over!  makes a great skin base for makeup.  i haven&#x27;t used the eyebrow razor yet but i will.  you do have to roll it a few times to pick up all the hairs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews for Amazon.  But when something is bad and I can do my fellow Amazon shoppers a solid by warning them, I&#x27;m going to do it.  This thing is completely and absolutely worthless.  If I could have given this zero stars I would have.  Honestly, I tried it and could not get it to work worth anything. I hate to wax so I was really hoping it would work but sadly, no.  Do not waste your money.  This is a piece of junk.  I threw it out.</li>
            <li> I just use a few time ist not what&#x27;s they said</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to as far as pain of ripping the hair out and what works for you but it definitely works!  I do a little every day and then I will keep up on it.  The tool itself works great!</li>
            <li> I have to confess I was surprised by how well this little tool works. It takes some practice to work it correctly, and I expected it to be more uncomfortable. Very satisfying purchase!</li>
            <li> worked well... completely painless...Great product...</li>
            <li> this thing takes a bit to get used to, but it really works</li>
            <li> Yes this works fast once you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never heard or seen anything like this.  I&#x27;ve never seen or done the other threading that is out there so this was all new to me.  I found a Youtube video that explained out to use this.  I received this at a promotional rate to use, review and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got the hang of using this, it was pulling out multiple hairs at a time along the upper lip.  Flipping it around to get it to work on the chin was a little challenging but the flexibility of this tool ended up working there also pulling out multiple hairs at a time.  This is not a painless way to remove hairs but really fast if you use it correctly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have fair hair so it is hard to see facial hair to remove it. I found the device easy to use. It worked on my first try.</li>
            <li> I break out when I was, and tweezing doesn&#x27;t work. This made me break-out a bit (I have to ice after I use it, not to break out) but it is way more gentle than waxing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this tool a few times since I purchased it and am quite happy with the results. Finer hairs are removed, the coarser ones not so much, but they&#x27;re then easier to see for removing with tweezers! Twisting the two handles can be awkward, and if you are elderly or have arthritis, this won&#x27;t work too well for you. It will be interesting to see how permanent the hair removal is as it is too early for me to tell. The eyebrow shaper is simply a fine razor, and I had to go to the video on the website to find instructions for its best use.</li>
            <li> I brought this remover to my wife she likes very much.It is very easily removing  the unwanted hair from her face and she is using for her upper lip and the product is good no problems with it .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works! Amazing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and have recommended it to friends already, and I have only had it one day!!.  It came VERY fast in the mail, like the next day almost.  I watched a couple of short videos online so that I knew exactly what to do and for the first time in years, my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s.  I have a scar right along my chin line that I have had for 35 years, and dark hair always grew from that spot. Then as I got older I noticed my peach fuzz on my upper lip started  not being so peachy, and more dense and dark.  I was going crazy every day tweezing, because my skin is so sensitive that creams leave burn scars and waxing was too painful.  Was this painless? Not quite (and I mean, not quite...it was WAY less painful than waxing or getting a burn from  cream removers, and less painful than tweezing because it works SO fast.)  I had a nervous habit of running my thumb along my chin line, or along the side of my mouth to &#x27;feel&#x27; if any coarse hairs were growing, and it became a constant habit.  Now, I have no fear. I still rub my thumb along my chin line but only because it is so amazingly smooth I can&#x27;t get over it.  I showed it to a friend, and she didn&#x27;t get any hair, so I laughed and said &amp;#34;then twist your hands the OTHER direction&amp;#34; and blammo.  She had just used a dipilatory cream and she still got results from this threading device.  I will never use another device, cream or tweezers again, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it any more. That in and of itself makes this item SO worth while, all for $10.95,</li>
            <li> Love this.  I was pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t going to work.  I am a sucker for trying crazy things to remove my chin and lip hair.  I have baby fine hair mixed with coarse dark hair on my face- a recipe for disaster.  It took me a couple tries to get it to work.  The instructions send you to a video, but it looks the lady in the video is just rolling it around on her arm (one handed) then her face.  That doesn&#x27;t work.  You actually twist the handles.  Play around with it- you will know when it starts working- Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;Chin wasn&#x27;t too bad, but lip definitely pretty painful.  On the other hand, I don&#x27;t think it is any worse than waxing easier, no mess, faster, and works better.  I have sensitive skin so it turned the usually red for an hour after, but, again, pretty normal for any hair removal product with me.  I was also a little worried because this brand was a little less expensive than other brands.  I would have to say, however this was a great success!</li>
            <li> Excellent facial hair remover.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:edf5b923c7fae4ec770ebcdfb80eed4f]] My daughter recorded me trying it for the first time, much to her amusement. I was blown away at how many hairs it was able to pull out at a time.  It definitely is effective and quick, but painless?  I can&#x27;t say it was painless.  It felt exactly what I would have imagined plucking 15 hairs out at once would feel like:  it hurt!  As I continued on, it didn&#x27;t hurt as much....probably because there were less hairs to pluck, and I was getting more used to it.    For $10.95, I think it&#x27;s a good cheap hair removal option.  Much better than so many of those chemical-filled creams that can cause burns and have to be re-bought as hair grows back.  Y&#x27;all know I like to have natural options, and frugal ones as well.    *I received the item free in exchange for an honest review.  The opinions are mine alone.</li>
            <li> This was received by my daughter.  She said it worked even better than expected</li>
            <li> What a very awesome invention, I received my Spring Facial hair remover and immediately started trying to figure out how to use it.  it’s a great tool for removing your facial hair in the privacy of your own home.  The hair remover is very easy to use, it grips onto the hair very easily and viola the hair is pulled out.  I used it right after I got out of the shower so I believe my pours were opened up a little more than normal and the hairs just pulled right out with no pain whats so ever.  I definitely love my newest little gadget and look forward to not having to wax.  Often times when pulling hair out it tends to be a little painful, with the Spring Facial Hair Remover, I’m pulling hairs out with little to no pain at all.</li>
            <li> I have from time to time about a dozen hairs that i consistently used a tweezer to pluck from my chin. I ordered this, it did pluck some hairs out, took longer and wasn&#x27;t more effective than my tweezer. Had to go back to plucking with my tweezer full-time. The pain for me was not bad and I would hardly call it pain. Bearable.</li>
            <li> This tool does a great job of removing hair, however it is not as painless as stated.  But then again you are plucking hairs so one should expect to feel pain.  Overall I am very happy with the product as it prevents me from having to manually pluck or wax!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful tool - I had never seen one, before.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It doen&#x27;t worth a penny</li>
            <li> Misses some hair. but Its good for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Its really effective. I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It works ok on the upper lip but not really great for the chin, which is where I have the issue. I have PCOS symptoms of facial hair growth that isn&#x27;t really that bad so I thought I would try this instead of some of the more extreme options. This just isnt precise enough if you don&#x27;t have much hair to remove. Probably works better if you have a lot of long hair but short random hairs ... probably not.</li>
            <li> This is probably because I used to tweeze my upper lip hair off, rather than waxing it or bleaching it, but I love this. It&#x27;s so much faster than tweezing, which would take me around 40 minutes to do and I would have to do it every week. This takes around 5 minutes to do my entire upper lip and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s painful (once you&#x27;ve tweezed every single hair off your upper lip for 6 years, anything is less painful than that). It&#x27;s so good at targeting all the hairs and your upper lip is left completely clean. I also used this on my forehead for little hairs and on the little blonde hairs that are all around my face that give me a peach fuzzy look. I cannot stress how much I LOVE this. I will say, though, that this really is only for FACIAL hair, not for any other parts of your body mainly because you can&#x27;t get the right curve of the coil with the right amount of force to pull the hair out on any other part of your body. Either way, highly recommend if you have extremely dark and fast-growing hair like me on your face. This is a god send.</li>
            <li> it really works! it&#x27;s not completely painless, though</li>
            <li> Very hard to use and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to use.  Removes maybe two at most hair follicles at a time.  I do not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I would give it a five except for the fact that a second item came alongside the first but there were no instructions on how to use it. It seems like a small little razor. But I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> It definitely works. It takes time to get used to maneuvering the tool. Also, it&#x27;s hard to get the smaller hair sometimes, but luckily they provide a small razor for the pesky hairs.</li>
            <li> Real painful but what hair removal isn&#x27;t?  I did it on my upper lip and ended up breaking out.  Company definitely should remove &amp;#34;painless hair removal&amp;#34;.....that just doesn&#x27;t exist.  I can&#x27;t return but probably won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> You have to get use to it pulling multiple hairs at a time but I was pleasantly surprised to find it works.</li>
            <li> Well, I have very sensitive skin. I was gettting my face threaded by too often my skin got caught in the thread. Oh my! This was not a good thing. So, I saw this Threading Tool, bought it and I love it! It takes some trial and error to make it work but I got the hang of it...whoa it&#x27;s fun...easy! Fast and far cheaper than threading! Get one.</li>
            <li> I received the blue handled Threading tool on a special sellers promotional offer along with the free eyebrow razor. I was happy to test this out on my daughter and myself.&lt;br /&gt;First of all there are no instructions, so I went to you tube and searched for a video on how to use this. Very simple.&lt;br /&gt;Just make a U shape as seen in the photo, then put the spring up to your skin and rotate the coils up as you spin the blue handles outward. It will gently pull the fine hairs out. Alot easier than tweezing, especially in between the eyebrows. You can use it on your cheeks, upper lip, chin and neck. Takes a fraction of the time and they say that as you keep using the threading tool it will slow growth since it&#x27;s pulling the hairs from the root, and they will grow in thinner and more sparse than before using the tool.&lt;br /&gt;Small enough to keep in your purse, for the days you have extra time in the car, when the sun is out is when I notice those fine peach hairs in places I do not want them! So in the car with natural sunlight would be perfect to use this.&lt;br /&gt;Does not leave your skin bright red like the waxing does, so quick and painless is a great option for me.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy to have been able to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;The Bonus eyebrow razor was nice too. I&#x27;m a bit leary of razors, but I used it on top of my eyebrow to help shape it and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. It actually works.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as described. Works well... much easier than tweezing.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it is pain-free, but it isn&#x27;t bad.  Just don&#x27;t use it on any longer hair (no eyebrows).  Good easy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles are cheap plastic and look tacky, but who sees them?  The thing works.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite grooming tool! Takes just a little practice but far surpasses bleaching or waxing, takes half the time and leaves no lasting redness or irritation. Can be used on the upper lip, chin and cheeks.I just wish I knew about this great little tool and company years  ago!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it. Not worth returning.</li>
            <li> I have spent years of electrolysis and plucking chin hairs.  Now as I age even more hairs are coming in, so I bought this product.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it so I went to You Tube and found a competitor&#x27;s video which helped immensely.  I am still plucking the stiff regrowth from years of plucking.  This product isn&#x27;t strong enough for those, but it is getting newer hairs quite nicely.  Shipping was fast.  Product arrived as described with a bonus eyebrow razor.  I like that razor.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my upper and lower lip .... no need for scheduling an appointment for threading those areas any more!</li>
            <li> A different type of pain from waxing and takes time to perfect technique, which I haven&#x27;t yet done.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as I expected, and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. Directions are included (I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make it work without them!) but it&#x27;s simple, easy to use, and effective. This makes a huge difference. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts in areas that I&#x27;m using it, so I&#x27;m convinced that it&#x27;s pulling the hair out by the root, and not just breaking it off- thank goodness, nobody wants ingrowns on their face!</li>
            <li> . I bought tow of these. because of the reviews. Save your money. First , It&#x27;s difficult to use , I never figure out how to use it. The instruction don&#x27;t help. a video or photo instructions  may have been better.</li>
            <li> it really does work, and it doesnt hurt that bad. My face feels smoother</li>
            <li> Wow!  works fabulously.  Not as painful as tweezing and more than 10x faster.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic! Very recommended!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. She has said so many times that why did it take so long for her to find this.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt like I thought it would. :) This little product makes quick work of a painful, tedious job. So easy to use. This should be on every woman&#x27;s  list.</li>
            <li> ouch!  painless my a$$</li>
            <li> This product works well at removing facial hair. It is painful but no more painful than tweezers. I had my teenage boys try it and they said it&#x27;s painful too. Once in a while I chase them around the house with it and try to get them to use it and they wont. It&#x27;s always good for a laugh. The plus side to using this over tweezers is it can pull numerous hairs at once and the motion to get them out is quicker and easier than plucking. Another bonus is I&#x27;m not using chemicals on my face. It does seem less of a shock/painful the longer I do it. I would highly recommend this product. Works well.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately was not impressed by this contraption, it sounds like a great idea and if you have the time and patience it probably works-but that is the key, I cannot stress enough how long it takes..it&#x27;s definitely painless compared to my wax but it just didn&#x27;t work for me like I had hoped..misses more hairs than it&#x27;ll get, might as well take tweezers to them. It did arrive on time and in perfect condition and the long razor was included, I&#x27;ll keep them both but probably won&#x27;t ever be used.</li>
            <li> Very handy little tool.  I was not expecting it to work so well but it does.  Kinda hurts and seems like a slow process, but with practice, maybe I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> The best little tool I ever got ahold of..No messy creams that burn the skin.. No trying to use tweezers for facial hair.. I just sit and watch tv and do it without looking in a mirror or even thinking about it..You all need to try one..I am going to order another one soon</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> A wonderful device to remove facial hair. I appreciated the instructions on the cardboard slide attached to the remover. It only took a minute to get the process down with very little prickly pain but adjusted quickly. A very simple device with a big result. Too bad I did not look for something like this in the past, it would of save me time and money. A great product!</li>
            <li> This hair removing tool is effective, but not without a bit of pain. It&#x27;s just like getting your eyebrows waxed/threaded, it takes some getting used to.  I find that it saves me time and  I like that it removes all the small thin hairs that are a hassle with tweezers. Be sure that your face is clean before using and be sure to moisturize afterward.</li>
            <li> Had problems getting it working.</li>
            <li> Just received this yesterday and it is just as advertised! Quick, easy, pain free and great price! I read a lot of the reviews and some said it was not pain free and perhaps their skin is more sensitive than mine, but for me, I was pleasantly surprised! I was all prepared for it to hurt like crazy! I will be recommending this to all my friends!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a simple device composed of a spring. If you buy a normal spring, it will achieve the same functionality. This is the same as a spring clearing your facial hair... It is not as effective as advertised and it is NOT PAINLESS. I recommend usig a tweezer is better than this tool.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to pull out all unwanted hair.  I had a difficult time getting it to pull out all the hair.  It seemed some it could grip on some rather easily and others were too difficult.  It left me looking for an option to get all unwanted facial hair not just some.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing! It works so well and I had no pain whatsoever. I&#x27;m not sure why others had pain, but I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different. Mine just tingled. I use it in a twisty, open and closing way and find that works best for me. It didn&#x27;t work as well just by twisting alone. And it&#x27;s strangely addicting. I couldn&#x27;t stop using it!</li>
            <li> Minor pain but not nearly as bad as tweezing the tiny individual hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only took about 20 minutes vs an hour and a half I normally spend removing my peach fuzz, squinting into a mirror and I was able to do it without a mirror</li>
            <li> This little tool is amazing! I have been threading my eyebrows and upper lip for years. I purchased this product to take care of my upper lip (I&#x27;ll leave the eyebrows to the experts!) and it works amazingly well. It is less painful than threading (the upper lip area can be sensitive) and took about 5 minutes total. There was no redness or irritation. After I completed my upper lip, I put a little bit of Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel astringent on the area and cleaned the tool with rubbing alcohol, like the directions suggested. Mine did come with directions and it was very simple to figure out how to use! I am so glad I stumbled upon this little tool!! In the past, I have tried bleaches (hated!) and depilatories (hated even more and always left nasty, irritated red marks on my face). This product does not even compare to those and I can&#x27;t recommend enough!</li>
            <li> this works well if you can&#x27;t get to a professional threader. there is more breakage than i was hoping for, but it does work and i will probably get better at it as time goes by. will come in handy for travel.</li>
            <li> It works great! No more waxing for me! UPDATE: do not store on your bathroom or any place humid. It rusted. I would buy again and store it in my closet or bedroom instead.</li>
            <li> i thought i would give this a try.  it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the add implies.  it is also painful and time intensive.  It won&#x27;t replace waxing</li>
            <li> Works well for a quick and easy cleanup job.  Takes practice and each time I use it I have to find the right rhythm again.  It doesn&#x27;t get the really fine hairs/peach fuzz, but it definitely works well on coarse hairs.  Difficult to clean the hairs out of the spring, but overall a good product.  Can&#x27;t be used on eyebrows and difficult to be precise about the hairs you&#x27;re pulling, so it&#x27;s not an alternative to threading if you need a detailed cleanup.  Best suited for larger areas.  Pain is similar to tweezing or threading - not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to use. Does get small hairs though. Takes awhile.</li>
            <li> I have RA and the medicines I take one side effect is excess facial hair growth. I wanted to try something that wasn&#x27;t chemical or take the chance of cuts with shaving. This works pretty well. You just need to take time and patience to use it. There is some pain involved but is so minimal .</li>
            <li> This works ok.  Probably would work better with practice and patience.  I don&#x27;t have either.  As far as the pain level I can&#x27;t complain.  It&#x27;s definitely more painful than plucking but you obviously can cover a larger area.</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair on my upper lip and it loves to shine.I haven&#x27;t the time for waxing and when I use creams the hair is quickly back.This is a fast and affordable way to keep hair at bay.</li>
            <li> My skin is way too sensitive to use this product</li>
            <li> Good product and the shipment was quick</li>
            <li> It does truly work !  I noticed some reviews mention their facial hair is not pulled out. The directions say to bend the tool and place it flat against your face. I did this and rolled the ends between my thumbs and fire fingers. The tool worked great. There is a little pain, but it&#x27;s worth it to have a fuzzless face.</li>
            <li> If you are into pain then this is the product for you!  Reminds me of the Epilady!</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all i send It back to the returns department on Lexington  KY 40511</li>
            <li> This was designed by a sick, sadistic SOB!! Hurts like the devil. Removed the hair, but don&#x27;t think I can work up to the torture of using it again.</li>
            <li> This little, inexpensive tool is going to save big bucks since I&#x27;ve been paying for professional waxing services for some time. It seems to work great with much less pain than waxing, too! Love it!</li>
            <li> I swear this is a life saver.  Yes, it is a little uncomfortable, but, not as painful as tweezing one hair at a time.  Once you get used to it, you&#x27;ll be like me, getting rid of facial hair while you watch TV.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. It does what it says.</li>
            <li> Hard to use and removes very little.  Back to my tweezer use!</li>
            <li> Wow! Has to be one of the best purchases I have made in years! No more waxes, creams, trips to the salon. I have only been using the Threading Tool for about 3 days and I am already so much happier with how smooth my skin is. I have a lot of hair on my upper lip and chin and it seemed that I was constantly waxing and plucking. Now I use this every night for a couple of minutes and I am smooth. Try t! It really works.</li>
            <li> Could not figure out how it worked.  Very awkward.</li>
            <li> I got the product on time.  It works pretty well just like the instructions said.  The only thing is its not pain free but it is better than waxing which usually leaves my face red and then makes me break out.  So far this wasn&#x27;t faster than waxing but still didn&#x27;t take long and I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Good one but pain full</li>
            <li> Little painful but gets the job done</li>
            <li> Does as described, can be a little difficult to get use to using and doesn&#x27;t get everything, every time, I would recommend for those who don&#x27;t want to use chemicals, waxes, etc...</li>
            <li> If I could rate it one star I would! Terrible product, I want my money back. Doesn&#x27;t work at all! Dissapointment</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this for me online as the reviews for this product was good overall. Its easy but PAINFUL. Its totally worth the cost though, i had dark facial hair and within 10 mins  could yank on all the hair from my face. Its effective and painful but i guess its just like an ant bite so its not a big deal. My face was smoother and cleaner after just one use, its a must have for all the girls, i never used the razor but its handy for emergency clean up i guess. All in all a good deal and i am happy i bought this.</li>
            <li> The item shipped fast and was exactly as described.  The company was very professional.  It works very well, but it did take me a minute to figure out how to work it.  Awesome product for facial hair!</li>
            <li> Great! Easy to use and those little hairs Don&#x27;t stand a chance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a problem with the handles as other users did. Seems pretty durable and sure, it would be more secure in your hands if it were rubber, but it seems to be a negligible problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely removes hair from the upper lip! Very effective, but not painless. That is just a part of the process, so don&#x27;t let that deter you from buying this product. It does it job and is worth it.</li>
            <li> I really like it very easy to use and very fast little pain in first 1 minute and nothing after</li>
            <li> Works as intended. Easy to use. Most importantly, gave me a boost of confidence. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I found the Spring Threading Tool to be really efficient at removing multiple &amp;#34;whiskers&amp;#34; at once with little pain and minimal effort. I wanted to find an easier way to get rid of unwanted facial hair that wasn&#x27;t as painful as my epilator and other tools I&#x27;d tried. This threading tool became available to purchase discounted during a promotion, so I bought it hoping it would help. And it really does! Once you get the hang of it, the threading tool works well to yank out the facial hair, even the baby soft fuzz hair. It follows the curves of my face really well so I don&#x27;t miss a single hair. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the packaging didn&#x27;t come with instructions and I couldn&#x27;t decipher how to use it from the packaging, so I had to go online and look up video tutorials.</li>
            <li> Works great, does sting a lot first few times and takes some practice. Still need to tweeze some stubborn hairs but I love it and great price. My daughter has a higher priced one and this works just as good</li>
            <li> Very effective! Some pain involved, but feels just like threading pain.</li>
            <li> I just received this today. It takes a little patience and some trial and error. No more waxing for me. It even takes the very fine hairs off so I don&#x27;t have to have those few days of walking around with upper lip hair. This will save me money in the long run and I can do this every other day or so.</li>
            <li> I have a hairy face due to my nationalities. I&#x27;ve got 12 so any one of them could be to blame...lol. This being said, I wax my upper lip, the hair isn&#x27;t dark but if it gets fuzzy enough, it casts a shadow. There are many times when I try to get to the salon but it&#x27;s quite difficult with 4 kids and only 2 are in school. So when I was offered this Spring Facial Hair Remover for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I said why not. So it arrived, the first thing I noticed was that the directions are in Japanese (even though it&#x27;s made in China). I can&#x27;t read Japanese so I checked out the reviews on Amazon for help. It definitely did. I was doing it all wrong...haha. I got started and was startled because it kinda of hurt. It got better very quickly once I just expected it. Either way you look at it, ripping hair out hurts and I&#x27;d rather be the one causing it. After a few minutes of using the Spring Hair Remover, my lip was just as smooth as it is when waxed. I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to remove their own facial hair easily.</li>
            <li> this product is great for the lip area, as waxing is so painful. this is fast and easy, this is my true feels of the items as i got it on discount</li>
            <li> just got this and tried it. the instructions are all in chinese or japanese, so you will have to refer back to the listing to see how it works.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product!  So easy to use and very efficient too.  Especially good is you wear glasses. Thankful I found it!!!</li>
            <li> Works well, but I find it quite painful to use!</li>
            <li> Was a little hard to figure out how to use it but once I got the hang of it, it was pretty easy. It did take the hair of places that I didn&#x27;t want it to be. It was quick. I will continue using the product when summer comes and see how well it works. I would recommend to those willing to try the product without instruction as they are in Chinese</li>
            <li> Although I was skeptical, this handy little product works great. I must say it is painful, but I haven&#x27;t found any method of hair removal yet that isn&#x27;t. I like the fact that I can take this along when I travel and keep my face free of those nasty little hairs. Very creative design.</li>
            <li> product is quite effective with removing the little peach fuzz on chin and upper lip area but it was not so easy removing the thicker hairs on the chin. I did feel a little bit of discomfort when removing the hair but that was to be expected, but it was totally less painful than waxing…so thumbs up to that!</li>
            <li> It works! But it is hard to line it up in the right place to get the hairs!</li>
            <li> I got it and I love it! It took a little while to get the hang of it and a couple of times it really zings you, but plucking hurts as well. After getting use to it, it worked so much better than plucking. I liked the size and thought it was well made. I ordered yours above all the others for the eyebrow razor. I thought it might be too sharp but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s serrated and really works at a good angle to get those eyebrow hairs also. So the razor included and the price were the 2 deciding factors when choosing between several, I have curly hair so I can&#x27;t shave because then the hairs come back as ingrown hairs, but tweezing, and now this  threading tool works great. I am in my sixties so I do have some upper lip and chin hairs and I was so glad to find your product, I just wished I had found it sooner. Yes try this one and the razor is great for your eyebrow because you cannot use the treading tool on them.</li>
            <li> I like this tool a lot.  It&#x27;s probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used to help remove unwanted facial hair.  I have used it a little bit every day and would have given it 5 stars except that the description stated &amp;#34;pain free&amp;#34;.  Not true in my case.  It&#x27;s tolerable pain but still stings a little and all I can say is at least it&#x27;s over quickly and I can control the amount of pain I have to tolerate in order to keep the chin line and lip line clear.  Just don&#x27;t tell me it&#x27;s pain free.  Tell me it&#x27;s going to pull the hair out and there&#x27;s a little sting that goes away quickly.  I appreciate that there is no irritation left behind and I appreciate how effectively it grabs and removes that fuzz and stray hairs.  I&#x27;m glad to have this tool!</li>
            <li> Never used these before and was surprised how good it work!</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery and great little gadget!  Did not find it painful as some reviews indicated and it may be that waxing doesn&#x27;t bother me either.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it does!  It is very effective!  One note, this is not a pain free experience.  It does literally pull the hair off of your face, and it&#x27;s not a pleasant experience if you&#x27;re not expecting it.  Since it works incredibly well I give it a high rating even with the &amp;#34;pain free&amp;#34; experience not holding true.</li>
            <li> It hurt badly and the hair didn&#x27;t come all the way out.It left my chin red and bruised</li>
            <li> works great! easy to use</li>
            <li> Love it! And it does hurt! But the pain is SO worth the no chemicals or wax on my face. It does lesson the hair that grows back.</li>
            <li> Works. It took a few tries but really works.  No more painful than plucking or waxing. Much quicker.  I&#x27;m using on upper lip area.</li>
            <li> Works ok . Don&#x27;t waste your money ! I had one before that I bought for 5$ only and worked much better . This item is way to pricy and not worth it!</li>
            <li> Wish I had found this years ago!  Initially it does sting and hurt a bit.  Go slow at first with only a few hairs.  As you get used to it then &#x27;grab&#x27; more at a time.  I love it because I can do touch ups at any time and don&#x27;t have to go anywhere, spend time on waxing etc.</li>
            <li> The threader seems to break the facial hairs more often than pulling them out by the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the ouch plus short stubby broken off hair.</li>
            <li> Hurts like the devil, but you end up getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Super economical compared to a threading service or the hair removal creams.&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s not working for you, then your technique isn&#x27;t right. When you twist the ends of this, it needs to roll up your face (rather than rolling in place). Yeah, it will bring tears to your eyes, but it only stings for a second and you&#x27;ll have great results!</li>
            <li> Fast and effective; i was extremely impressed. It&#x27;s not exactly painless--you are pulling hair out by the roots, but it doesn&#x27;t last and best of all there is no swelling. No mixing, no mess, no microwaving, no prep; just roll it between your fingers and go!! You may still need to tweeze some shorter, thicker hairs, but the Bellesentials hair remover got 97% and left my face clear and smooth. Best result for the money, of any product I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Works great. My only complaint is there isn&#x27;t direction with the tool. It directs you to the website. I&#x27;d be nice to have a quick guide on the package.</li>
            <li> This works really well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was so excited because it worked. Unfortunately, it was dull after the first use! It is not pain free, but tolerable.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to monthly waxing and this little tool works pretty well. It&#x27;s not really pain free but it sure keeps the facial fuzz away!</li>
            <li> This is workinh really good</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift and my bestie loves it!</li>
            <li> So , I had the opportunity to try this product out and for a reasonable price. I tried this hair remover out on my husband and let me tell you it was funny.  He was like it doesn&#x27;t work until it  snatched some of his hair out, lol. I laughed.  I think I was doing it wrong so I tried it again and it worked better for me the second time around. If you are hairy and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money getting  your face waxed, I would suggest giving the Spring Facial Hair Remover Threading Tool a try. What do you have to lose besides hair?</li>
            <li> Product does not remove hair that easily, kind of awkward to operate</li>
            <li> This product was rather interesting to me, as I&#x27;ve never heard of or seen anything like it. I saw this during product launch and thought to myself - it&#x27;s worth a try, because I have unwanted facial hair growing. I will be honest and say unless I&#x27;m using this product incorrectly I do notice that when it rolls a certain direction - it definitely removes hair, but wrapping the hair into the spring and pulling the hair away from the face is a quick &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; for me. I personally can deal with more discomfort on my legs than something as sensitive my face. Overall the product says what it does, and I am pleased with that. I just feel the need to change it&#x27;s uses up to fit my personal preferences. It kind of reminds me of a wax treatment with out the mess! Genius product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note* My body&#x27;s reaction may differ from another&#x27;s body,</li>
            <li> This thing really works! But removing hair from the upper lip area hurts soooo bad! I had to leave a few stragglers behind because I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. Hopefully I can get them all next time. Definitely does what it says it does. No complaints there.</li>
            <li> When I first received this threading tool I was scared to try it because how could this spring device be painless?? There were no directions that came with the product so I was holding the threading tool saying wonder how you use this? My husband said I will show you how it works, so he took the threading tool created an upside down U and quickly removed a handful of hair off my face! At first you don&#x27;t know what to expect so it does catch you off guard and does hurt a little bit. But once you know what to expect it really is not bad at all in fact I am hooked on this threading tool.  I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt; I have a lot of facial hair and I&#x27;m always trying to find a way to eliminate it. Tweezers took forever and removed one hair at a time.  This threading tool grabs many hairs at one time and speeds up the removal process and now I don&#x27;t feel any pain because you really get use to it.  I can&#x27;t put it down! It&#x27;s very affordable and if you have facial hair I say it&#x27;s a must!</li>
            <li> This is unfortunately not what I was hoping it was.  It simply didn&#x27;t work and the few hairs it did remove...let&#x27;s just say it wasn&#x27;t comfortable.  It stretched out too easily and would not return to its original shape.  I&#x27;m sorry but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was unsure how this Facial Hair remover would work? After using it a couple of times I finally achieved it! I made it more difficult than it was.You just bend and twist. It has alittle pinch the first couple times you do it and then you get use to it but its so much better than using tweezers and pinching your skin.  Also means you save time because the Spring facial remover removes the hair at root so it takes 4-6 weeks to grow back.  It is small, compact, and lightweight can fit about anywhere. Great for a gift, it does come with instructions. I was able to buy this product during a promotion and am happy to share my experience with it.</li>
            <li> This tool is great! I wouldn&#x27;t exactly say it is pain free but not nearly as painful as other methods. It does a great job removing hairs you didn&#x27;t even realize were there!</li>
            <li> I was very nervous at first thinking I was going to pinch my self or better yet cut off too much hair in the wrong spot. But to my surprise it was so easy tho use and effective! I was paying $8 to $10 dollars every other week to get my eyebrows &amp;#34;threaded&amp;#34; and now I can do it my self. And not have tho deal with the redness and slight pian that you have with threading. I absolutely love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Better than waxes, and other methods I&#x27;ve tried, including expensive salon hair removal on my upper lip. The price is right, and the tool works great! Would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Item does not work as described. Very hard to keep close to skin and twist at the same time.</li>
            <li> It is definitely not what it says and it hurts sooo bad, u don&#x27;t want to use it again wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money</li>
            <li> Great tool - came quickly and great service!  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Spring Facial Hair Remover Threading Tool is sooo much easier than using a wax which is messy and risky.  This tool has no mess factor or risk of burning my skin. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  Every once in a while once in awhile you run across something that just makes your life easier and better.  And&#x27;s it such a simple little thing.  You wonder where has it been your whole life.  No more peach fuzz! I am obsessed with it.  Works great. Not too painful.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> For such a simple tool this really works.  It&#x27;s more like pulling off a band-aid than what I thought would feel like painfully tweezing several hairs at once.  I would much rather do this than have the chemical burns from Nair other hair removal methods, they were not working for me very well anyway (and the hair seemed to be growing back faster than ever.)  I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week, so I can&#x27;t say for sure that it prevents or slows new hairs from growing, but it does appear to be pulling the hairs from the root.  It&#x27;s really not designed to groom eyebrows well, I&#x27;ve only used it on my upper lip.  I do have to follow up with tweezers for a few stray hairs, but I&#x27;d say it removes 95% on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> this product is very well made, but no hair was removed for me when I used it.  I will try to Google it online to see if any pointer are give on usage.</li>
            <li> I have only ever plucks my eyebrows before, so I was excited to try something new, and hopefully faster, but I was doubtful about how accurate this product would be.. for such a simple tool, it is surprisingly easy to use and quick to get the job done. After a little practice, I am learning how to be more accurate with it, and I do not think I will be tweezing anymore! Thank goodness :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Loving it. It is so easy to use.. Don&#x27;t even have to look at the mirror when doing it... I was watching my toddler walking and using it to get rid of my upper lip hair walking behind her.. Wala... Finished without a hassle...</li>
            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;  Its realy nice products and vary comfortable.i am happy .....</li>
