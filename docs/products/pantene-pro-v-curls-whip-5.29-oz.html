            <li> I have really, and I mean really bone dry hair, although I do have bones in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, wavy, thick, and super long.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry as I normally do, and it is now a fuzzy, frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> Now I am going to try, Sta-Sof-Fro Hair &amp; Scalp Spray Extra Dry.</li>
            <li> It is the only one that I have ever found that leaves me with body and curl and absolutely no crunch.  </li>
            <li> We have tried EVERY product out there to tame naturally curly hair into a semblance of order.</li>
            <li> It not only turns my usual frizz into curls that last for the promised 48 hours, it actually leaves my hair feeling softer instead of drier.  </li>
            <li> but that could be due to my massive amount of hair!</li>
            <li> I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried a few days in a row, but it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Some days my hair is curly in one area and not in other areas.  </li>
            <li> It weighed my hair down although it made it shiny.</li>
            <li> my hair is curlier, less frizzy, and softer.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the stuff doesn&#x27;t come out whipped anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also too heavy.</li>
            <li> I usually use Pantene mousse.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find at stores in Las Vegas but ever faithful Amazon has it!</li>
            <li> boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anywho, It just made my hair fell fake and nappy.</li>
            <li> This product is useless.  </li>
            <li> Really bad.</li>
            <li> Will never creat those nasty crunchy curls.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this mousse.  It is the only one that I have ever found that leaves me with body and curl and absolutely no crunch.  I cannot find it in any stores  I hope that Pantene is not discontinuing this product.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair a frizzy mess. Really bad.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the stuff doesn&#x27;t come out whipped anymore. The squirting apparatus on both of the ones I&#x27;ve used just basically stopped working. Last time, I couldn&#x27;t get any product out and before that it just poured out all soupy. Not a fluffy whip. It&#x27;s also too heavy. It weighed my hair down although it made it shiny.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products for curly hair I have ever used (and I have tried MANY). I have dry, tight curls and this product provides great definition and hold without the crunch of a normal mousse. I love it!</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance and preserves the curl.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair styling product I have used more than once.  It not only turns my usual frizz into curls that last for the promised 48 hours, it actually leaves my hair feeling softer instead of drier.  Only problem with it, it&#x27;s becoming hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> True, it has no hold, but it the best leave-in conditioner I have used to date.  Just follow-up with Pantene Pro-V Mousse Curl Defining Maximum Hold.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best product ever for my curly hair!! Will never creat those nasty crunchy curls. Everybody&#x27;s curly hair is different but definitely worth trying a bottle of this!!</li>
            <li> We have tried EVERY product out there to tame naturally curly hair into a semblance of order. This is the BEST and our new favorite! Leaves hair non greasy, non frizzy, and non crunchy. Hard to find at stores in Las Vegas but ever faithful Amazon has it!</li>
            <li> I have curly/wavy hair that I prefer to let dry naturally. I have used gels and mousse to style my hair but both leave my hair with no shine and crunchy texture. Walking through the aisles, I came upon this product. Nothing to lose by trying it. When I first put it on I thought that it didn&#x27;t look to promising...boy, was I wrong. My hair dried and looked fantastic. No crunch, lots of shine and soft texture. What a great product!!!</li>
            <li> I have really, and I mean really bone dry hair, although I do have bones in my hair. Yohohohohoho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, It just made my hair fell fake and nappy. I don&#x27;t like it much. The smell is nice so I gave it 2 stars for the smell. It also finished quickly. Now I am going to try, Sta-Sof-Fro Hair &amp; Scalp Spray Extra Dry. Fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> This product is useless.  I may as well put no product in my hair.  True, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy, but it gives no control at all.  I let my hair air dry as I normally do, and it is now a fuzzy, frizzy mess.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried a few days in a row, but it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Really love this for my fine, curly hair.Leaves it soft and helps curls to form and last.</li>
            <li> This mousse is fabulous!I put it on my wet hair and when it dried, it smelled wonderful and my hair was so soft and frizz free!It is like whipped cream when you apply it! its so delicious for your hair.My hair is very frizzy and damaged alot.This product helped bring it back to life. I love it !!!I recommend that you purchase it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time with excellent results.  It conditions my hair, brings life to my curls, and makes them last.</li>
            <li> I usually use Pantene mousse.  They were out of my normal one so I used this one.  It only lasted a week.  Normally a bottle lasts around a month.</li>
            <li> Some days my hair is curly in one area and not in other areas.  I just squish this whip where there are not curls and, &amp;#34;walla&amp;#34;, I have great curls that last the rest of the day.  Not greasy and gives a shine.</li>
            <li> This is great product! It gives my curls great definition, with moisture, and no build-up or residue. Kinky Girl Approved!</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, wavy, thick, and super long. I have tried every kind of mousse and gel out there and this is the only product that left my hair feeling soft and frizz free. My only complaint is that it runs out pretty quickly... but that could be due to my massive amount of hair!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! My hair was soft, curly, moisturized and smelled good to boot! I have tried MANY products for curly hair and this beats them all!</li>
            <li> works great on my hair. only thing that works on my wavy hair. awesome!</li>
            <li> i have tried basically everything out there for curls, drugstore &amp; salon. this stuff is AMAZING. this one product acts as a leave-in conditioner and as a curl refiner.... my hair is curlier, less frizzy, and softer. love it! and it smells good :).</li>
