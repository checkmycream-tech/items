            <li>They store easily and work great on the tear off roll.</li>
            <li>Good, quick service!!</li>
            <li>Nice try OPI, but not for me...</li>
            <li>Nice that you don&#x27;t have to cut your own foil but</li>
            <li>I like to do my own gel nails after my kids go to bed.  </li>
            <li>I do my own gel nails and when it&#x27;s time to change..</li>
            <li>These wraps are kind of handy if you don&#x27;t want to cut up your own foil.  </li>
            <li>I do my own gel nails and have no problems at all.</li>
            <li>I do my own gel nails.</li>
            <li>Liked the wraps.</li>
            <li>I made my own foil wraps with cotton pads and foil that I cut into strips.</li>
            <li>I wear disposable gloves to keep them warm and in place.  </li>
            <li>After a year of going to salons to have them tear or scrape off the polish, I decided to try this product on my own at home.  </li>
            <li>Yes, one can cut up their own aluminum foil and use cotton balls, and in fact, that&#x27;s what I did before buying these.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails</li>
            <li>That is quite the challenge using my own foil and cotton ball.  </li>
            <li>They stay in place really well because of the aluminum foil which conforms to your finger perfectly.</li>
            <li>I do my own at home gels polish with OPI colors.  </li>
            <li>These wraps are durable and effective.</li>
            <li>These are so nice - and make removing the shellac/gel polish so easy!  </li>
            <li>If the polish do not come off very easily, reapply acetone to the cotton pad and repeat the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Whatever solution they put on the pads must not be very strong.  </li>
            <li>By far the best removal wraps I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $$ if you are going to do your own gel manicures!</li>
            <li>They stay on better.</li>
            <li>These work so much better than the stretchy plastic ones that are supposedly self-stick (mine never stuck...)</li>
            <li>love these.</li>
            <li>but these ones work a lot better.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>This allows me to save money and also am able to use one hand to read etc.</li>
            <li>Works better with acetone remover.</li>
            <li>if you use foil and cotton or some pad work ok too</li>
            <li>After reading reviews on these and seeing people say that aluminum foil and cotton balls work better, I gave that method a try.</li>
            <li>They work SOOO much better.</li>
            <li>they are much better.</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>Much better than tin foil and cotton balls :-)</li>
            <li>The salons use these removal wraps, but they charge $5 or more to take the gel polish off, and you can do that at home with these wraps.  </li>
            <li>Foils worked better than any others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Better than soaking your fingertips in acetone to remove gel polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to place some acetone on a cotton ball and wrapping your finger w foil paper homemade.</li>
            <li>so it would hold the mold you squeeze it into better b ut</li>
            <li>I use to try to soak my nails in acetone, but this is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy these, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>these are FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>I love these for the convenience and ease of use.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work without pressure (it has some pressure from the pad</li>
            <li>Tonight I did side-by-side with the Orly pockets and the OPI foils and used a twist-tie to keep the acetone in contact with the polish better.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>so I love these.  </li>
            <li>In 5 minutes, the acetone ate through the polish and most of the acrylic underneath.  </li>
            <li>No dripping acetone on the furniture any more.</li>
            <li>These are really good - they make gel polish removal super easy.</li>
            <li>I liked them, but it didn&#x27;t always get the tip of the nail clean.  </li>
            <li>Found it to do pretty good job of removing my gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li>ok to take them off easily</li>
            <li>so it is important that I be able to do this with one hand.  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>They make the process of soaking off your gel nail polish super easy, and you&#x27;re not stuck in your seat soaking your nails in a dish!</li>
            <li>These are easy to self-apply and remove.  </li>
            <li>250ct]]allows one to easily soak nails and foil wrap without help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>

            <li>They are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>These wraps make gel polish removal easy.</li>
            <li>love this item, great quality and easy to use though I can only wrap the fingers on 1 hand at a time, so</li>
            <li>You can easily make these at home with aluminum foil and a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easier to get the twist tie on very quickly</li>
            <li>I like this product, because it is easy to remove Gel polish with it.  </li>
            <li>It makes gel nail polish removal easy.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to place the pad</li>
            <li>Wow - so nice!  </li>
            <li>Be sure to file the top of your nails first.  </li>
            <li>These are super!</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use, works quickly, especially with the opi nail polish remover!</li>
            <li>These little babies are awesome.</li>
            <li>The Opi Nail wraps are much easier to use than making your own with tinfoil and cotton.</li>
            <li>From now on gels are essentially free and I can watch whatever I want on TV while I have girl maintenance time.</li>
            <li>These wraps don&#x27;t fit my fingers well.</li>
            <li>The wraps will be somewhat secure, as secure as tinfoil on your nails can be.</li>
            <li>B001B0ZZFS Neutrogena Body Oil, Light Sesame</li>
            <li>Formula, Fragrance Free, 8.5 Ounce]], to protect my skin and cuticles.</li>
            <li>(They&#x27;re available on Amazon through Sally Beauty.)  </li>
            <li>These things really are great and SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much</li>
            <li>they really do!!!  </li>
            <li>Makes them very economical.</li>
            <li>The cotton seems small, but it works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;For a better job, do first one hand</li>
            <li>I used to do the foil and cotton ball, which totally works, but to me this is just so handy and a roll lasts forever!</li>
            <li>I use them on the Orly Fx and they work but just don&#x27;t wrap around the finger cleanly</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes the polish came right off!  </li>
            <li>Keep an old towel handy in case of drips.</li>
            <li>The 250 count lasts me several months, so I think it is a good buy.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I decided to do our own gels, and this stuff helps when soaking off the old gel.  </li>
            <li>I have to change them because my nails have grown too much - the polish still looks fabulous!).  </li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see if the twist tie is what made the most difference or the foam pad (which soaked up more acetone but the foil have always still been wet when I&#x27;ve opened them</li>
            <li>I thought this might be a waste of money since i could just make my own with foil and cotton balls, however it was so much easier and more effective.  </li>
            <li>This wraps are super practical, just tear them off and leave them on for 25, 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are just super for removing the gel coats.  </li>
            <li>your time is worth more than money, this is a very convenient item.</li>
            <li>This is much easier to use, and I don&#x27;t use as much acetone either, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I have read that people say it is just as easy to use foil and a cotton ball for shellac removal, and I suppose that could be true, but I find these to be the right size and very convenient.</li>
            <li>These wraps make home removal  easy and MUCH cheaper than a salon.</li>
            <li>Fast and quick shipping as always!</li>
            <li>These are great but all they are is foil with a little pad on it.</li>
            <li>Both systems are worth the money but the twist tie is the real ticket to being quick about it!</li>
            <li>These are amazing, definitely will repurchase.  </li>
            <li>Around .88 each, worth it....</li>
            <li>Prior to buying this product, I tried soaking, scraping, and picking to remove the polish, I even tried to make my own copycat to this product by using Reynolds Wrap in conjunction with cotton makeup pads that I cut up.</li>
            <li>Barring operator error, they are likely to fit most if not all shapes and sizes of nails and fingers.</li>
            <li>and they are well worth the money.</li>
            <li>well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $.  </li>
            <li>but these were far more convenient and therefore faster to use.  </li>
            <li>and it was so worth it.</li>
            <li>For the price, these were well worth it.  </li>
            <li>These are totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that cotton balls and heavy duty foil are cheaper but this is quick and easy!  </li>
            <li>and the get pushes right off with orange stick.</li>
            <li>the polish practically flakes right off.</li>
            <li>Just the right size</li>
            <li>so you knew that the tie was in the right place to get maximum contact with the acetone.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>These were very easy to use and since I was so uncoordinated, I could only do one hand at a time.  </li>
            <li>I loved the promise that I could use these with less &amp;#34;scraping&amp;#34; of my nails.  </li>
            <li>I tend to do one hand at a time (all 5 fingers), and as a finger on the left hand is finished, I&#x27;ll move that foil to the right hand after adding more acetone to it.</li>
            <li>(it was very fast with either system).  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just the right side, they&#x27;re easy to use, they&#x27;re reasonably priced, they&#x27;re not messy  </li>
            <li>Most likely will be easier to do one hand at a time.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not even starting to lift, I squirt more acetone into the still folded foil, towards the pad</li>
            <li>These things have made my life so much easier!  </li>
            <li>This roll has saved me so much money!</li>
            <li>Simple, efficient &amp; what more is there to say about opi expert touch removal wraps 250ct</li>
            <li>I have no idea why this works so much better than a regular cotton ball with tin foil, but it does.</li>
            <li>but these work so much quicker and without having to submerse my fingers!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was wasteful</li>
            <li>so I just did two fingers at first.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually made me re-think even doing them though I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry AT</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t have 10-15 minutes to sit and wait then this works really well!  </li>
            <li>The first time I removed my gel nail polish</li>
            <li>It works great and no more pain!</li>
            <li>These take off gel nail polish in ten minutes and are very easy to use, I highly recommend them</li>
            <li>and then the other, otherwise, it gets kind of tricky to wrap the foil around one finger when you already have it wrapped on one hand.</li>
            <li>Plus you don&#x27;t spend the whole soaking time trying to push them on and make sure there&#x27;s enough contact.)</li>
            <li>They are pretty much like the foil/cotton ball method but easier.  </li>
            <li>I love to do my nails at home, but removal of gel nail polish can be a hassle since the remover needs to sit for so long.  </li>
            <li>Wait for about 15-20 minutes and your polish will be melted enough to remove easily.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that they released the polish so quickly.</li>
            <li>These are the same foil wraps that are used at the nail salon, and really make gel polish removal easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not be intimidated or conversely fooled by these innocent but powerful little squares.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Seem like it would cost too much to use these.</li>
            <li>Much easier than taking cotton and aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Much easier to apply and take off.</li>
            <li>I had too much difficulty doing this by myself.  </li>
            <li>I had to use cotton balls under the foils, the strip in the foils aren&#x27;t very absorbent.</li>
            <li>Makes removal soooooooooo much easier, just wish they were cheaper</li>
            <li>These wraps make removing gel nails so much easier.</li>
            <li>If it is ready to come off, it should begin to lift and curl immediately when the wrap is removed.</li>
            <li>The cotton balls soaked up too much acetone, as well, and i&#x27;d end up with acetone all over me.</li>
            <li>Much easier than struggling with cotton balls, tin foil and acetone.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>These are so much easier to work with than the soaking method.  </li>
            <li>This works very well, but needs some cleaning with a tool to&lt;br /&gt;remove residue.</li>
            <li>It would be a real pain to use tin foil &amp; cotton balls I believe.  </li>
            <li>When I removed them it didnt require me to scrape too much.  </li>
            <li>Once done, remove with your orange stick...scrape off gently.  </li>
            <li>This is soo much easier than going to your nail tech and having them grind on your nails sometimes injuring your nail bed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than cotton and tin foil.</li>
            <li>Need to get the correct dispenser for these to work really well.</li>
            <li>So in the interest of saving time (since that&#x27;s the whole reason I started gel manicures)</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t much difference</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t really want my skin soaking in the acetone, too, if I didn&#x27;t need it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m cheap and thought maybe I could get double the use!).</li>
            <li>I found it&#x27;s much easier to do one hand at a time, though.</li>
            <li>These work VERY well.  </li>
            <li>This is so much easier and very efficient.  </li>
            <li>I found that I didn&#x27;t really need them.</li>
            <li>it is very convience when applying the acetone.</li>
            <li>Much easier to just tape a cotton ball to your finger.</li>
            <li>These wraps really help shorten the time needed to redo my gel nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m right handed and using my left hand to remove the right hand</li>
            <li>To be frugal I than take off the wraps, apply more acetone and reuse them on the other hand.  </li>
            <li>Be careful tearing off, foil rips easily.</li>
            <li>I have the Red Carpet Manicure system, and have tried many different methods of removing the gel polish.</li>
            <li>Works much better than foil and cotton because each sheet wraps tightly on the finger and does&#x27;nt come off.  </li>
            <li>Highly overpriced.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>I am a little lazy and would rather use these than creating my own from cotton and foil  Compact and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>: I wish the cotton pad were a little thicker so that it wrapped more completely around the nail.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>I use each square twice by doing my one hand first and then following right afterwards w/ the second hand.</li>
            <li>and I only use 5 per manicure because they are pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>Found that I can use each twice, if removing carefully first time with regular polish - probably not shellac.</li>
            <li>If you have a 3rd hand that you&#x27;re not trying to take the polish off of, then you&#x27;ll be able to manipulate these on your fingertips to not only take the polish off, but to actually keep them on.  </li>
            <li>They limit the waste of nail polish remover, your fingers are not soaked in the remover, they fold and stay folded well and they are easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Not able to keep them on the fingers or apply enough acetone to work effectively.</li>
            <li>(I use very fitted latex gloves that are normally purchased for coloring your hair, then cut off the finger tips, so it is easier to put on the individual latex tips after applying the foil.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(But if you insist on foil, I&#x27;d definitely consider the twist tie thing - I&#x27;m guessing this was a big reason the polish came off so well and so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you wrap the finger tight and cover the tip to insure proper removal technique.</li>
            <li>These make it so much easier to wrap around each finger tightly and sit for about 10 minutes and the gel comes right off.</li>
            <li>The one bonus to the Orly pockets was that you could see the colored polish through the clear bag and the foam piece</li>
            <li>So much easier to use than regular aluminum wrap!</li>
            <li>Used these once so far.  </li>
            <li>Twenty minutes later the polish was ready to be removed.  </li>
            <li>Saves time for gel removal when go to salon, so instead of waiting 15-20 minutes in salon in complete boredom</li>
            <li>Such a simple concept, yet so indispensable for nail polish soak-off (regular or gel).</li>
            <li>They work very well and are much easier than cutting your own.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even look as if I had a polish remover anywhere near my nails.</li>
            <li>In less than 15 minutes the polish is separating from the nail bed and just a quick push of an orange stick and off comes the old polish leaving the nail unharmed.  </li>
            <li>Then after I get the polish off, I re-wet the pads with fresh remover and apply to the other side.</li>
            <li>Cuts down on time works better than expected.</li>
            <li>but my experience has been that removing gel is a real pain and takes a long time.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>But the fit isn&#x27;t tight enough that way, you need both layers.  </li>
            <li>Simply just foul and cotton, originally i am suspecting the cotton is just too thin to hold the liquid for long, however it still work out fine.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t big enough to stay on securely and they simply don&#x27;t take the Gel off very well.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not worth buying, wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li>I went back to look at the product on Amazon to see if I did something worng, and saw that the price now is $8 - what a complete RIP OFF!</li>
            <li>The whole process of using aluminum foil and cotton isn&#x27;t new to me, but it&#x27;s not a fun process.</li>
            <li>but they are actually more than long and wide enough for even long nails.  </li>
            <li>Using these foils, my gel polish typically just curls up and falls right off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few of the different gel nail color removal wraps available, and this was the only one that worked.</li>
            <li>To see if your gel nail color is ready to come off, carefully remove the latex glove tip and aluminum wrap from one finger and inspect the gel polish covering your nail.</li>
            <li>but I specifically bought a UV kit because I have a young child who goes to bed later</li>
            <li>No slipping of the pad away from where it belongs.  </li>
            <li>Much better than a lot of the wraps out there because the sponge is thin and doesn&#x27;t build up with excess acetone that squeezes out when wrapped</li>
            <li>Remember the good &#x27;ol days when you had to first soak a cotton ball/pad with polish remover or acetone, then awkwardly try to wrap it with strips of tin foil as the remover dripped freely down the side of your hand?</li>
            <li>It would take me forever and ever to get my polish off because the aluminum foil was never tight enough.</li>
            <li>I usually just have my boyfriend wrap my fingers on the other :).</li>
            <li>Only use a plastic or wooden tool and push very gently at the polish, any harder and you will damage the nail.</li>
            <li>Takes a little longer, but much neater!</li>
            <li>Easy to saturate w/ acetone and less messy then using cotton balls w/ foil.</li>
            <li>It keeps the acetone in contact with the polish the whole time - with foil I&#x27;d keep squeezing it to get it tight on the polish.  </li>
            <li>Not true I can use these more than once like at least 3or4 times.</li>
            <li>This method works very well for me and it keeps the foil tight enough to make constant contact with my nail.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good, quick service!!</li>
            <li> Nice try OPI, but not for me...</li>
            <li> Nice that you don&#x27;t have to cut your own foil but</li>
            <li> I like to do my own gel nails after my kids go to bed.  </li>
            <li> I do my own gel nails and when it&#x27;s time to change..</li>
            <li> These wraps are kind of handy if you don&#x27;t want to cut up your own foil.  </li>
            <li> I do my own gel nails and have no problems at all.</li>
            <li> I do my own gel nails.</li>
            <li> Liked the wraps.</li>
            <li> I made my own foil wraps with cotton pads and foil that I cut into strips.</li>
            <li> I wear disposable gloves to keep them warm and in place.  </li>
            <li> After a year of going to salons to have them tear or scrape off the polish, I decided to try this product on my own at home.  </li>
            <li> Yes, one can cut up their own aluminum foil and use cotton balls, and in fact, that&#x27;s what I did before buying these.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails</li>
            <li> That is quite the challenge using my own foil and cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> They stay in place really well because of the aluminum foil which conforms to your finger perfectly.</li>
            <li> I do my own at home gels polish with OPI colors.  </li>
            <li> These wraps are durable and effective.</li>
            <li> These are so nice - and make removing the shellac/gel polish so easy!  </li>
            <li> If the polish do not come off very easily, reapply acetone to the cotton pad and repeat the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Whatever solution they put on the pads must not be very strong.  </li>
            <li> By far the best removal wraps I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $$ if you are going to do your own gel manicures!</li>
            <li> They stay on better.</li>
            <li> These work so much better than the stretchy plastic ones that are supposedly self-stick (mine never stuck...)</li>
            <li> love these.</li>
            <li> but these ones work a lot better.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This allows me to save money and also am able to use one hand to read etc.</li>
            <li> Works better with acetone remover.</li>
            <li> if you use foil and cotton or some pad work ok too</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on these and seeing people say that aluminum foil and cotton balls work better, I gave that method a try.</li>
            <li> They work SOOO much better.</li>
            <li> they are much better.</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> Much better than tin foil and cotton balls :-)</li>
            <li> The salons use these removal wraps, but they charge $5 or more to take the gel polish off, and you can do that at home with these wraps.  </li>
            <li> Foils worked better than any others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Better than soaking your fingertips in acetone to remove gel polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to place some acetone on a cotton ball and wrapping your finger w foil paper homemade.</li>
            <li> so it would hold the mold you squeeze it into better b ut</li>
            <li> I use to try to soak my nails in acetone, but this is so much better.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy these, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> these are FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> I love these for the convenience and ease of use.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work without pressure (it has some pressure from the pad</li>
            <li> Tonight I did side-by-side with the Orly pockets and the OPI foils and used a twist-tie to keep the acetone in contact with the polish better.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> so I love these.  </li>
            <li> In 5 minutes, the acetone ate through the polish and most of the acrylic underneath.  </li>
            <li> No dripping acetone on the furniture any more.</li>
            <li> These are really good - they make gel polish removal super easy.</li>
            <li> I liked them, but it didn&#x27;t always get the tip of the nail clean.  </li>
            <li> Found it to do pretty good job of removing my gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li> ok to take them off easily</li>
            <li> so it is important that I be able to do this with one hand.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> They make the process of soaking off your gel nail polish super easy, and you&#x27;re not stuck in your seat soaking your nails in a dish!</li>
            <li> These are easy to self-apply and remove.  </li>

            <li> love this item, great quality and easy to use though I can only wrap the fingers on 1 hand at a time, so</li>
            <li> You can easily make these at home with aluminum foil and a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easier to get the twist tie on very quickly</li>

            <li> It makes gel nail polish removal easy.  </li>

            <li> Wow - so nice!  </li>
            <li> Be sure to file the top of your nails first.  </li>
            <li> These are super!</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use, works quickly, especially with the opi nail polish remover!</li>
            <li> These little babies are awesome.</li>
            <li> The Opi Nail wraps are much easier to use than making your own with tinfoil and cotton.</li>
            <li> From now on gels are essentially free and I can watch whatever I want on TV while I have girl maintenance time.</li>
            <li> These wraps don&#x27;t fit my fingers well.</li>
            <li> The wraps will be somewhat secure, as secure as tinfoil on your nails can be.</li>
            <li> B001B0ZZFS Neutrogena Body Oil, Light Sesame</li>
            <li> Formula, Fragrance Free, 8.5 Ounce]], to protect my skin and cuticles.</li>
            <li> (They&#x27;re available on Amazon through Sally Beauty.)  </li>
            <li> These things really are great and SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much</li>
            <li> they really do!!!  </li>
            <li> Makes them very economical.</li>
            <li> The cotton seems small, but it works great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a better job, do first one hand</li>
            <li> I used to do the foil and cotton ball, which totally works, but to me this is just so handy and a roll lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I use them on the Orly Fx and they work but just don&#x27;t wrap around the finger cleanly</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes the polish came right off!  </li>
            <li> Keep an old towel handy in case of drips.</li>
            <li> The 250 count lasts me several months, so I think it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I decided to do our own gels, and this stuff helps when soaking off the old gel.  </li>
            <li> I have to change them because my nails have grown too much - the polish still looks fabulous!).  </li>
            <li> It will be interesting to see if the twist tie is what made the most difference or the foam pad (which soaked up more acetone but the foil have always still been wet when I&#x27;ve opened them</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a waste of money since i could just make my own with foil and cotton balls, however it was so much easier and more effective.  </li>
            <li> This wraps are super practical, just tear them off and leave them on for 25, 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are just super for removing the gel coats.  </li>
            <li> your time is worth more than money, this is a very convenient item.</li>
            <li> This is much easier to use, and I don&#x27;t use as much acetone either, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I have read that people say it is just as easy to use foil and a cotton ball for shellac removal, and I suppose that could be true, but I find these to be the right size and very convenient.</li>
            <li> These wraps make home removal  easy and MUCH cheaper than a salon.</li>
            <li> Fast and quick shipping as always!</li>
            <li> These are great but all they are is foil with a little pad on it.</li>
            <li> Both systems are worth the money but the twist tie is the real ticket to being quick about it!</li>
            <li> These are amazing, definitely will repurchase.  </li>
            <li> Around .88 each, worth it....</li>
            <li> Prior to buying this product, I tried soaking, scraping, and picking to remove the polish, I even tried to make my own copycat to this product by using Reynolds Wrap in conjunction with cotton makeup pads that I cut up.</li>
            <li> Barring operator error, they are likely to fit most if not all shapes and sizes of nails and fingers.</li>
            <li> and they are well worth the money.</li>
            <li> well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $.  </li>
            <li> but these were far more convenient and therefore faster to use.  </li>
            <li> and it was so worth it.</li>
            <li> For the price, these were well worth it.  </li>
            <li> These are totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that cotton balls and heavy duty foil are cheaper but this is quick and easy!  </li>
            <li> and the get pushes right off with orange stick.</li>
            <li> the polish practically flakes right off.</li>
            <li> Just the right size</li>
            <li> so you knew that the tie was in the right place to get maximum contact with the acetone.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> These were very easy to use and since I was so uncoordinated, I could only do one hand at a time.  </li>
            <li> I loved the promise that I could use these with less &amp;#34;scraping&amp;#34; of my nails.  </li>
            <li> I tend to do one hand at a time (all 5 fingers), and as a finger on the left hand is finished, I&#x27;ll move that foil to the right hand after adding more acetone to it.</li>
            <li> (it was very fast with either system).  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just the right side, they&#x27;re easy to use, they&#x27;re reasonably priced, they&#x27;re not messy  </li>
            <li> Most likely will be easier to do one hand at a time.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not even starting to lift, I squirt more acetone into the still folded foil, towards the pad</li>
            <li> These things have made my life so much easier!  </li>
            <li> This roll has saved me so much money!</li>
            <li> Simple, efficient &amp; what more is there to say about opi expert touch removal wraps 250ct</li>
            <li> I have no idea why this works so much better than a regular cotton ball with tin foil, but it does.</li>
            <li> but these work so much quicker and without having to submerse my fingers!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was wasteful</li>
            <li> so I just did two fingers at first.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually made me re-think even doing them though I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry AT</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t have 10-15 minutes to sit and wait then this works really well!  </li>
            <li> The first time I removed my gel nail polish</li>
            <li> It works great and no more pain!</li>
            <li> These take off gel nail polish in ten minutes and are very easy to use, I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> and then the other, otherwise, it gets kind of tricky to wrap the foil around one finger when you already have it wrapped on one hand.</li>
            <li> Plus you don&#x27;t spend the whole soaking time trying to push them on and make sure there&#x27;s enough contact.)</li>
            <li> They are pretty much like the foil/cotton ball method but easier.  </li>
            <li> I love to do my nails at home, but removal of gel nail polish can be a hassle since the remover needs to sit for so long.  </li>
            <li> Wait for about 15-20 minutes and your polish will be melted enough to remove easily.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that they released the polish so quickly.</li>
            <li> These are the same foil wraps that are used at the nail salon, and really make gel polish removal easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not be intimidated or conversely fooled by these innocent but powerful little squares.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Seem like it would cost too much to use these.</li>
            <li> Much easier than taking cotton and aluminum foil.</li>
            <li> Much easier to apply and take off.</li>
            <li> I had too much difficulty doing this by myself.  </li>
            <li> I had to use cotton balls under the foils, the strip in the foils aren&#x27;t very absorbent.</li>
            <li> Makes removal soooooooooo much easier, just wish they were cheaper</li>
            <li> These wraps make removing gel nails so much easier.</li>
            <li> If it is ready to come off, it should begin to lift and curl immediately when the wrap is removed.</li>
            <li> The cotton balls soaked up too much acetone, as well, and i&#x27;d end up with acetone all over me.</li>
            <li> Much easier than struggling with cotton balls, tin foil and acetone.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> These are so much easier to work with than the soaking method.  </li>
            <li> This works very well, but needs some cleaning with a tool to&lt;br /&gt;remove residue.</li>
            <li> It would be a real pain to use tin foil &amp; cotton balls I believe.  </li>
            <li> When I removed them it didnt require me to scrape too much.  </li>
            <li> Once done, remove with your orange stick...scrape off gently.  </li>
            <li> This is soo much easier than going to your nail tech and having them grind on your nails sometimes injuring your nail bed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than cotton and tin foil.</li>
            <li> Need to get the correct dispenser for these to work really well.</li>
            <li> So in the interest of saving time (since that&#x27;s the whole reason I started gel manicures)</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t much difference</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t really want my skin soaking in the acetone, too, if I didn&#x27;t need it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m cheap and thought maybe I could get double the use!).</li>
            <li> I found it&#x27;s much easier to do one hand at a time, though.</li>
            <li> These work VERY well.  </li>
            <li> This is so much easier and very efficient.  </li>
            <li> I found that I didn&#x27;t really need them.</li>
            <li> it is very convience when applying the acetone.</li>
            <li> Much easier to just tape a cotton ball to your finger.</li>
            <li> These wraps really help shorten the time needed to redo my gel nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m right handed and using my left hand to remove the right hand</li>
            <li> To be frugal I than take off the wraps, apply more acetone and reuse them on the other hand.  </li>
            <li> Be careful tearing off, foil rips easily.</li>
            <li> I have the Red Carpet Manicure system, and have tried many different methods of removing the gel polish.</li>
            <li> Works much better than foil and cotton because each sheet wraps tightly on the finger and does&#x27;nt come off.  </li>
            <li> Highly overpriced.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I am a little lazy and would rather use these than creating my own from cotton and foil  Compact and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> : I wish the cotton pad were a little thicker so that it wrapped more completely around the nail.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I use each square twice by doing my one hand first and then following right afterwards w/ the second hand.</li>
            <li> and I only use 5 per manicure because they are pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> Found that I can use each twice, if removing carefully first time with regular polish - probably not shellac.</li>
            <li> If you have a 3rd hand that you&#x27;re not trying to take the polish off of, then you&#x27;ll be able to manipulate these on your fingertips to not only take the polish off, but to actually keep them on.  </li>
            <li> They limit the waste of nail polish remover, your fingers are not soaked in the remover, they fold and stay folded well and they are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Not able to keep them on the fingers or apply enough acetone to work effectively.</li>
            <li> (I use very fitted latex gloves that are normally purchased for coloring your hair, then cut off the finger tips, so it is easier to put on the individual latex tips after applying the foil.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (But if you insist on foil, I&#x27;d definitely consider the twist tie thing - I&#x27;m guessing this was a big reason the polish came off so well and so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you wrap the finger tight and cover the tip to insure proper removal technique.</li>
            <li> These make it so much easier to wrap around each finger tightly and sit for about 10 minutes and the gel comes right off.</li>
            <li> The one bonus to the Orly pockets was that you could see the colored polish through the clear bag and the foam piece</li>
            <li> So much easier to use than regular aluminum wrap!</li>
            <li> Used these once so far.  </li>
            <li> Twenty minutes later the polish was ready to be removed.  </li>
            <li> Saves time for gel removal when go to salon, so instead of waiting 15-20 minutes in salon in complete boredom</li>
            <li> Such a simple concept, yet so indispensable for nail polish soak-off (regular or gel).</li>
            <li> They work very well and are much easier than cutting your own.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even look as if I had a polish remover anywhere near my nails.</li>
            <li> In less than 15 minutes the polish is separating from the nail bed and just a quick push of an orange stick and off comes the old polish leaving the nail unharmed.  </li>
            <li> Then after I get the polish off, I re-wet the pads with fresh remover and apply to the other side.</li>
            <li> Cuts down on time works better than expected.</li>
            <li> but my experience has been that removing gel is a real pain and takes a long time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> But the fit isn&#x27;t tight enough that way, you need both layers.  </li>
            <li> Simply just foul and cotton, originally i am suspecting the cotton is just too thin to hold the liquid for long, however it still work out fine.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t big enough to stay on securely and they simply don&#x27;t take the Gel off very well.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not worth buying, wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> I went back to look at the product on Amazon to see if I did something worng, and saw that the price now is $8 - what a complete RIP OFF!</li>
            <li> The whole process of using aluminum foil and cotton isn&#x27;t new to me, but it&#x27;s not a fun process.</li>
            <li> but they are actually more than long and wide enough for even long nails.  </li>
            <li> Using these foils, my gel polish typically just curls up and falls right off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of the different gel nail color removal wraps available, and this was the only one that worked.</li>
            <li> To see if your gel nail color is ready to come off, carefully remove the latex glove tip and aluminum wrap from one finger and inspect the gel polish covering your nail.</li>
            <li> but I specifically bought a UV kit because I have a young child who goes to bed later</li>
            <li> No slipping of the pad away from where it belongs.  </li>
            <li> Much better than a lot of the wraps out there because the sponge is thin and doesn&#x27;t build up with excess acetone that squeezes out when wrapped</li>
            <li> Remember the good &#x27;ol days when you had to first soak a cotton ball/pad with polish remover or acetone, then awkwardly try to wrap it with strips of tin foil as the remover dripped freely down the side of your hand?</li>
            <li> It would take me forever and ever to get my polish off because the aluminum foil was never tight enough.</li>
            <li> I usually just have my boyfriend wrap my fingers on the other :).</li>
            <li> Only use a plastic or wooden tool and push very gently at the polish, any harder and you will damage the nail.</li>
            <li> Takes a little longer, but much neater!</li>
            <li> Easy to saturate w/ acetone and less messy then using cotton balls w/ foil.</li>
            <li> It keeps the acetone in contact with the polish the whole time - with foil I&#x27;d keep squeezing it to get it tight on the polish.  </li>
            <li> Not true I can use these more than once like at least 3or4 times.</li>
            <li> This method works very well for me and it keeps the foil tight enough to make constant contact with my nail.</li>
            <li> The professional grade of the foil makes them hold tight enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to easy and not that expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other wraps ( the white ones that that are like tape) and just regular gauze and foil.</li>
            <li> they stay on so much better than just cutting squares of foil</li>
            <li> so long</li>
            <li> Left them on gel nails for over ten minutes and still had to &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; off about half of the package.</li>
            <li> But let me tell you, these are so much easier, quicker to use, and less messy.</li>
            <li> and I can do one hand and then reuse the same wraps for the other hand with no problem.  </li>
            <li> but I tried putting it in just in a single layer for the nail side</li>
            <li> I have gel nails, and the only down side of them is the removal.</li>
            <li> Finally, I broke down and ordered these foil/cotton removal pads.</li>
            <li> the pad for acetone is in an awkward spot so they don&#x27;t wrap easily.</li>
            <li> - I used the little pockets again for the next two nails!  </li>
            <li> So I spent a little extra and just bought the removal wraps</li>
            <li> Just wet these with the OPI 99 or acetone, \\&quot;OPI 99 is better\\&quot;, put your nails in a plastic baggy, cover with a towel and leave on for 15 min.</li>
            <li> I tend to check them after 5 minutes by simply slipping my finger out of the &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; I made.</li>
            <li> works as expected.</li>
            <li> I do one hand then switch them onto the other hand.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s just a small area of cotton to soak the regular polish remover, no difference to use cosmetic cotton to do that, and cosmetic cotton are way cheaper than this.</li>
            <li> Apply to one hand and keep the other functional.</li>
            <li> Gone also are the days of trying to keep your fingers as still as possible while they rest (are squished) uncomfortably in a small &amp;#34;soaking&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have tried other methods, including my home cotton balls and foil and[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be easier to use on myself then the other options on the market.  </li>
            <li> did a side-by-side with these on one hand and the cotton pad/foil wrap on the other.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited 7/2013 - I knocked this down a star because I bought the Orly Gel &amp; Glitter Nail Lacquer Pocket Removers at Sally&#x27;s the other day and tried them this weekend.  </li>
            <li> Not really worth the $.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but much easier than tearing squares of foil and pulling blobs of cotton balls.  </li>
            <li> just love glitter nail polish, and I just hate taking it off.</li>
            <li> Fold in one of the side towards your finger pad and then fold in the other side, tightly, towards you finger pad.</li>
            <li> Lay you finger, nail side down on to of the pad.</li>
            <li> Fold the foil over your nail (so, your fingernail should be down on the pad and</li>
            <li> Now I have to buy the hands down wraps</li>
            <li> I just push down on the pump with the Wrap.  </li>
            <li> I could see if this worked - but for $25 it&#x27;s a total waste of my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> and I found that I used less acetone for the removal.  </li>
            <li> I previously used to soak off my gel nail polish with a bowl of acetone.</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping for (slightly) faster</li>
            <li> Both ways worked, but these are easier and I used a lot less acetone using this product.  </li>
            <li> Minimizes the mess and acetone needed.</li>
            <li> Wish it could cost a little less.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as tight as foil).  </li>
            <li> I wish they were a little shorter on the side that leads when you unroll it, but that&#x27;s just picky...</li>
            <li> Dip the little pads in the polish remover, and wrap around your nails.</li>
            <li> I think they are a little pricey for what they are</li>
            <li> I do wish the foil was a little thicker</li>
            <li> They are basically little plastic bags with a foam piece inside - it is folded over inside.</li>
            <li> When you put the little bags over your fingers you can get leaking</li>
            <li> The little foam pads did rip after a couple of nails</li>
            <li> I highly recommend spending the extra money these cost you wont be disappointed you did.</li>
            <li> Much easier than soaking a cotton ball and cutting foil.</li>
            <li> So much easier than cutting foil and wrapping around a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> I was too impatient to wait</li>
            <li> so I would remove my hand and attempt to scrape off the polish after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Polish pads are too thin to hold enough remover.</li>
            <li> I had difficulty wrapping every finger once I&#x27;d got a few wrapped....  </li>
            <li> cotton is so thin, it doesn&#x27;t hold enough acetone to quite do the job.</li>
            <li> The foil is heavy duty</li>
            <li> I tried a few times to use a cotton ball and piece of foil</li>
            <li> I did have to use two on one nail, but I expected that as I use a lot of gel product, so it is thick.  </li>
            <li> The foil is thick and the padding is very thin, but you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li> Makes removing gel polish much easier, but it is sometimes difficult to get them to stay on your fingers!</li>
            <li> Took a star out since it&#x27;s not a easy thing to do with them... not too comfy</li>
            <li> like I saw other people do, but it  was seriously a hassle.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little getting use to and hard to do by yourself.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to wrap the fingers on the 2nd hand.</li>
            <li> If you struggle with cotton balls and foil, or some dip system, struggle no more.</li>
            <li> and so I usually would spend the money for the polish removal at the salon.</li>
            <li> It usually takes FOREVER so soak off gel polish</li>
            <li> So I took a twist tie and put it over the nail and twisted it in back so that I could see the foam pad pressing on the polish.  </li>
            <li> I thought the picture looked to small</li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> HUGE disappointment!!  </li>
            <li> This was not very successful</li>
            <li> I found it easier to do one hand at a time, because it can be somewhat hard to wrap both hands at once.</li>
            <li> , I found them hard to apply and keep on.  </li>
            <li> Not a nice purchase whatsoever....</li>
            <li> /&gt;After all of your fingers are covered, leave the layers on for at least 10 minutes before checking the progress.</li>
            <li> However this is less time consuming than cutting foil into little squares.</li>
            <li> The foil paper is too thin and the cotton glued on the foil paper is too small.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I have to say about this product is that someone at O.P.I is being extremely rude for not showing me this product earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do think it is a bit easier and less expensive.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to get them to stay on</li>
            <li> a little difficult to use and keep on.</li>
            <li> Tried cutting foil combined with cotton balls what a waste.  </li>
            <li> I have tried cotton balls with foil wrapped around them, but it was awkward and could be messy.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m doubtful that there wasn&#x27;t enough</li>
            <li> These were honestly not a good purchase - sad</li>
            <li> Sorry I do not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Sorry to the OPI foil</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to already have the polish remover on the wraps, and I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the DIY method of soaking a cotton ball and wrapping with foil, and I made a horrible mess.  </li>
            <li> foil removal method wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> No spills, splatters, cutting foil, etc.  </li>
            <li> Before this product, I was cutting strips of foil to use with cotton balls in order to remove my gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> gel polish was very difficult.</li>
            <li> Stupid if you have the time</li>
            <li> The aluminum foil base allows the wrap to be molded to the tip of your finger with ease.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying, it&#x27;s just annoying.</li>
            <li> I hated this method.  </li>
            <li> On a side note too, the packaging is terrible...</li>

            <li> These wraps work so well! The foil is of a really excellent quality so they stay put once they are placed. I have used them a few times and they really take the pain out of soaking off the gel polish. The pads hold a good amount of acetone and leaking has not been an issue at all.</li>
            <li> The Opi Nail wraps are much easier to use than making your own with tinfoil and cotton. They stay on better.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes gel nails a breeze to remove.</li>
            <li> These are easy to self-apply and remove.  The foil helps to keep the heat in and process to remove gel polishes.</li>
            <li> These work so much better than the stretchy plastic ones that are supposedly self-stick (mine never stuck...) Fifteen minutes will get my Gelshine/Gelcolor removed with no hassles. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Use this product to remove gel nails.Tried cutting foil combined with cotton balls what a waste.  Seem like it would cost too much to use these. Not true I can use these more than once like at least 3or4 times. If you have a heating pad try using it with the opi removal pads. love these.</li>
            <li> The cotton seems small, but it works great! I do one hand then switch them onto the other hand. Works great.</li>
            <li> I use these every 2 weeks when I do my gel nails.  Awesome product, easy to wrap and use.  I have tried others, these are the best.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use than regular aluminum wrap!</li>
            <li> Pros: The [[ASIN:B0073KABJ0 Opi Expert Touch Removal Wraps 250ct]]allows one to easily soak nails and foil wrap without help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I wish the cotton pad were a little thicker so that it wrapped more completely around the nail.</li>
            <li> I got these with the OPI Gelcolor and they are great. Much easier than taking cotton and aluminum foil. It&#x27;s to easy and not that expensive. Just wet these with the OPI 99 or acetone, \\&quot;OPI 99 is better\\&quot;, put your nails in a plastic baggy, cover with a towel and leave on for 15 min. and the get pushes right off with orange stick.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s just a small area of cotton to soak the regular polish remover, no difference to use cosmetic cotton to do that, and cosmetic cotton are way cheaper than this. And don&#x27;t to expect just wrap your finger with it and it remove the color away itself, you need to rub it untill it get off... It takes your time and money as well..Not a nice purchase whatsoever....I will not buy it again, take my word in it, go to local store and get nomal cosmetic cotton.</li>
            <li> Awesome, using a heating pad helps. Works great. Be careful tearing off, foil rips easily. Minimizes the mess and acetone needed.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t get these to work properly.  I soak the pads in 100% acetone and try to wrap one hand at a time... no dice.  I eventually just did it the old-fashioned cheap-o way... cotton balls and aluminum foil.  On a side note too, the packaging is terrible... this thing is constantly falling apart, the bottom comes off every time I move it.  For the price, you would think the thing wouldn&#x27;t constantly fall apart.  Nice try OPI, but not for me... no dice.</li>
            <li> This makes taking gel off nails a breeze!</li>
            <li> I have used this product on myself as well as on my customers and it works great.  In less than 15 minutes the polish is separating from the nail bed and just a quick push of an orange stick and off comes the old polish leaving the nail unharmed.  Works much better than foil and cotton because each sheet wraps tightly on the finger and does&#x27;nt come off.  Around .88 each, worth it....Great product!</li>
            <li> Used these once so far.  Found it to do pretty good job of removing my gel nail polish.  Most likely will be easier to do one hand at a time.</li>
            <li> Not able to keep them on the fingers or apply enough acetone to work effectively. If a second person could apply them and you don&#x27;t move, they could work</li>
            <li> I have gel nails, and the only down side of them is the removal. This wraps are super practical, just tear them off and leave them on for 25, 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a better job, do first one hand and then the other, otherwise, it gets kind of tricky to wrap the foil around one finger when you already have it wrapped on one hand.</li>
            <li> I love these!  Easy to use, and I only use 5 per manicure because they are pretty sturdy. Apply to one hand and keep the other functional. Then after I get the polish off, I re-wet the pads with fresh remover and apply to the other side. I don&#x27;t unwrap them, just slip them off. To add remover to the tubular wraps I squirt in a bit and pour any excess into the next tube and keep on going. Keep an old towel handy in case of drips. Easy-peasy! Yes, an indulgence, but so are gels, and I&#x27;ve saved enough to pay for all the supplies after 4 manicures! From now on gels are essentially free and I can watch whatever I want on TV while I have girl maintenance time.</li>
            <li> Nice that you don&#x27;t have to cut your own foil but the pad for acetone is in an awkward spot so they don&#x27;t wrap easily. I use them on the Orly Fx and they work but just don&#x27;t wrap around the finger cleanly</li>
            <li> I used  soak off wraps before with stikcer surface but these ones work a lot better. Much easier to apply and take off.</li>
            <li> Be sure to file the top of your nails first.  This is a better option to aluminum foil!</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a waste of money since i could just make my own with foil and cotton balls, however it was so much easier and more effective.  It was easier to wrap all 10 fingers and I found that I used less acetone for the removal.  I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I like to do my own gel nails after my kids go to bed.  I orginally tried soaking my nails in a bowl of acetone.  I hated this method.  I was too impatient to wait so I would remove my hand and attempt to scrape off the polish after a few minutes.  Then I tried the foil and cotton ball method.  I had too much difficulty doing this by myself.  Then I discovered the &amp;#34;band aide&amp;#34; type removers. I liked them, but it didn&#x27;t always get the tip of the nail clean.  I decided to try the OPI removal wraps.  They are pretty much like the foil/cotton ball method but easier.  I tore off 10 sheets, poured a bit of acetone on each, wrapped my nails up, and sat with my hands under a heating pad.  Twenty minutes later the polish was ready to be removed.  This seemed to get the entire nail, including the end.  The heating pad makes it work faster. And here is a tip, only remove one wrap at a time, it is easier to scrape off the polish while the acetone is stiil damp.</li>
            <li> I love these wraps!  I do my own gel nails and when it&#x27;s time to change..I put a couple drops of acetone on the wrap..wrap up my nail and stick it under a heating pad for about 10 to 15 minutes..and boom..gel polish is off. Love this!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without. 10-15 min after applying i remove and use a gel polish &#x27;scraper&#x27; and the polish practically flakes right off.</li>
            <li> These wraps don&#x27;t fit my fingers well. It is difficult to wrap the fingers on the 2nd hand. I had to use cotton balls under the foils, the strip in the foils aren&#x27;t very absorbent.</li>
            <li> Used them once and threw them away. Polish pads are too thin to hold enough remover.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the $.  I could have just used cotton balls and aluminum foil.  However this is less time consuming than cutting foil into little squares.</li>
            <li> I have tried several methods of removing my gel polish but none works like these wraps.  I gentlly scuff up the shiny polish apply the acetone to five  wraps to one hand and wait for 10 to 15 minutes.  I found that by using a heating pad it accelerates the process by about 5 minutes.  To be frugal I than take off the wraps, apply more acetone and reuse them on the other hand.  This allows me to save money and also am able to use one hand to read etc.</li>
            <li> These were very easy to use and since I was so uncoordinated, I could only do one hand at a time.  Then I realized that I only needed to use five of them to remove gel from both hands since they are still usable.  So instead of 25 removals, I will get 50.  Makes them very economical.</li>
            <li> I had difficulty wrapping every finger once I&#x27;d got a few wrapped....  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I didn&#x27;t like this...</li>
            <li> I have the Red Carpet Manicure system, and have tried many different methods of removing the gel polish. Prior to buying this product, I tried soaking, scraping, and picking to remove the polish, I even tried to make my own copycat to this product by using Reynolds Wrap in conjunction with cotton makeup pads that I cut up. Finally, I broke down and ordered these foil/cotton removal pads. They&#x27;re just the right side, they&#x27;re easy to use, they&#x27;re reasonably priced, they&#x27;re not messy  and, best of all, they work!</li>
            <li> The product works awesome. It takes a little getting use to and hard to do by yourself. I am getting the hand of it doing it by myself. Works better with acetone remover.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use- you put acetone on the pad and wrap\twist\fold around. I wish they were a little shorter on the side that leads when you unroll it, but that&#x27;s just picky... these are great and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Keep with a rubberband around them because the &amp;#34;lids&amp;#34; don&#x27;t stay on and they come unwrapped.</li>
            <li> It works. Simply just foul and cotton, originally i am suspecting the cotton is just too thin to hold the liquid for long, however it still work out fine.</li>
            <li> Four stars for being great product. Highly overpriced. Found that I can use each twice, if removing carefully first time with regular polish - probably not shellac.</li>
            <li> Makes removal soooooooooo much easier, just wish they were cheaper that&#x27;s why they got 4 stars instead of 5</li>
            <li> These wraps make removing gel nails so much easier. I&#x27;ve tried the other wraps ( the white ones that that are like tape) and just regular gauze and foil. These are a all in one- soak the pad with acetone and wrap them around your finger. They are easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product work perfect take off the gel polish but the true&lt;br /&gt;is if you use foil and cotton or some pad work ok too</li>
            <li> A little difficult to get them to stay on - just don&#x27;t move for 10-15 min.  The ends of the roll that keep it together fell off so I just threw them away, it&#x27;s not really necessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of the different gel nail color removal wraps available, and this was the only one that worked. The aluminum foil base allows the wrap to be molded to the tip of your finger with ease. The wraps seem to work best when you soak the cotton pad with acetone, wrap your finger tip with the foil, then put latex glove tips over your fingers to seal in the moisture of the acetone. (I use very fitted latex gloves that are normally purchased for coloring your hair, then cut off the finger tips, so it is easier to put on the individual latex tips after applying the foil.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all of your fingers are covered, leave the layers on for at least 10 minutes before checking the progress. To see if your gel nail color is ready to come off, carefully remove the latex glove tip and aluminum wrap from one finger and inspect the gel polish covering your nail. If it is ready to come off, it should begin to lift and curl immediately when the wrap is removed. DO NOT USE a METAL tool to push the polish off of your nail. Only use a plastic or wooden tool and push very gently at the polish, any harder and you will damage the nail. If the polish do not come off very easily, reapply acetone to the cotton pad and repeat the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get used to using this removal technique, you will realize that the only time consuming part of this is the 10 minutes you have to wait for the polish to soften.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on these and seeing people say that aluminum foil and cotton balls work better, I gave that method a try. It was awful. It would take me forever and ever to get my polish off because the aluminum foil was never tight enough. The cotton balls soaked up too much acetone, as well, and i&#x27;d end up with acetone all over me. My friend told me she uses these, so I purchased them. They work SOOO much better. This is my method: Put one or two squirts of acetone on the pad (I poured acetone into a glass bottle with a pump). Lay you finger, nail side down on to of the pad. Fold the foil over your nail (so, your fingernail should be down on the pad and the foil you just folded should be on your finger pad). Fold in one of the side towards your finger pad and then fold in the other side, tightly, towards you finger pad. This method works very well for me and it keeps the foil tight enough to make constant contact with my nail. I tend to check them after 5 minutes by simply slipping my finger out of the &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; I made.If it&#x27;s not even starting to lift, I squirt more acetone into the still folded foil, towards the pad and I slip my finger back in. Using these foils, my gel polish typically just curls up and falls right off. I tend to do one hand at a time (all 5 fingers), and as a finger on the left hand is finished, I&#x27;ll move that foil to the right hand after adding more acetone to it. These things really are great and SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I dock it a star? The cardboard on the ends and the white stopper thing falls out as soon as I put them in. I don&#x27;t need them, they don&#x27;t affect the structural integrity of the product or my ability to use it, but all the bits SHOULD stay where they are intended.</li>
            <li> These things have made my life so much easier!  Simple to wrap and remove gel nails.  I leave mine on longer then the gel polish remover suggests (25 mins) and then the polish just slides off. The 250 count lasts me several months, so I think it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> All this is, is a square of aluminum foil with something to hold the remover. Now I have to buy the hands down wraps they are much better. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These are just super for removing the gel coats.  Much easier than struggling with cotton balls, tin foil and acetone.  Will keep buying these for personal use.</li>
            <li> Saves time for gel removal when go to salon, so instead of waiting 15-20 minutes in salon in complete boredom I apply these when watching tv at home. I actually only use 5 at a time and reuse them twice before discarding. Very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> These wraps are kind of handy if you don&#x27;t want to cut up your own foil.  I thought they would already have the remover in them but they don&#x27;t, so be sure to buy that too!</li>
            <li> Such a simple concept, yet so indispensable for nail polish soak-off (regular or gel). Remember the good &#x27;ol days when you had to first soak a cotton ball/pad with polish remover or acetone, then awkwardly try to wrap it with strips of tin foil as the remover dripped freely down the side of your hand? Gone also are the days of trying to keep your fingers as still as possible while they rest (are squished) uncomfortably in a small &amp;#34;soaking&amp;#34; bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not be intimidated or conversely fooled by these innocent but powerful little squares. Barring operator error, they are likely to fit most if not all shapes and sizes of nails and fingers.</li>
            <li> If you struggle with cotton balls and foil, or some dip system, struggle no more. These are the very best for working with to remove gel nail polish. I ave used them now for a couple years and cannot imagine using anything else.  They limit the waste of nail polish remover, your fingers are not soaked in the remover, they fold and stay folded well and they are easy to apply. I do my own gel nails and have no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Great for removing gel polish.  Easy to use</li>
            <li> These wraps make gel polish removal easy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product works well</li>
            <li> These are so much easier to work with than the soaking method.  I love these and they are well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Made my own and was not as good as these already to use soak off gel polish. Recommend use for ease.</li>
            <li> These make taking off gel polish a breeze,  well worth the cost. Much better than tin foil and cotton balls :-)</li>
            <li> Love these! Worth the $$ if you are going to do your own gel manicures!</li>
            <li> I purchased these after a manicurist used them on me during a procedure. I previously used to soak off my gel nail polish with a bowl of acetone. That seemed to take forever. These little babies are awesome. Dip the little pads in the polish remover, and wrap around your nails. The wraps will be somewhat secure, as secure as tinfoil on your nails can be. I found it easier to do one hand at a time, because it can be somewhat hard to wrap both hands at once. Wait for about 15-20 minutes and your polish will be melted enough to remove easily. Yes you can probably achieve the same effect with tin foil and cotton balls, but that&#x27;s a lot of effort when these are already pre-made. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use, works quickly, especially with the opi nail polish remover! Would recommend to anyone! Fast and quick shipping as always!</li>
            <li> These worked great. Much easier than soaking a cotton ball and cutting foil.</li>
            <li> These are really good - they make gel polish removal super easy.</li>
            <li> This roll has saved me so much money! The price for a removal kit, 1 time use, is maybe 8$! love this item, great quality and easy to use though I can only wrap the fingers on 1 hand at a time, so I usually just have my boyfriend wrap my fingers on the other :). I totally recommend this product</li>
            <li> Good, quick service!!</li>
            <li> Cuts down on time works better than expected. Will not ever be without.</li>
            <li> This is the best application for removing your gel nails.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> These take off gel nail polish in ten minutes and are very easy to use, I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> The only way to get gel polish off is with acetone.  The salons use these removal wraps, but they charge $5 or more to take the gel polish off, and you can do that at home with these wraps.  They work great.</li>
            <li> I have read that people say it is just as easy to use foil and a cotton ball for shellac removal, and I suppose that could be true, but I find these to be the right size and very convenient. I think they are a little pricey for what they are but I like them.</li>
            <li> Foils worked better than any others I have tried. They store easily and work great on the tear off roll. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Product &amp; service were awesome. Better than soaking your fingertips in acetone to remove gel polish. Will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Use to remove gel before going to the salon.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and work wonderfully. I highly recommend spending the extra money these cost you wont be disappointed you did.</li>
            <li> I love to do my nails at home, but removal of gel nail polish can be a hassle since the remover needs to sit for so long.  I have tried cotton balls with foil wrapped around them, but it was awkward and could be messy.  These are great!  Just the right size and I can do one hand and then reuse the same wraps for the other hand with no problem.  Good product.</li>
            <li> PROs:&lt;br /&gt;- size and shape of aluminum is good.&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;- cotton is so thin, it doesn&#x27;t hold enough acetone to quite do the job.</li>
            <li> Much better than a lot of the wraps out there because the sponge is thin and doesn&#x27;t build up with excess acetone that squeezes out when wrapped</li>
            <li> I have Gel Manicures every 2 wks, thought this products would be great. I could remove the polish before going to the manicurist to save time. The foil paper is too thin and the cotton glued on the foil paper is too small. It&#x27;s better to place some acetone on a cotton ball and wrapping your finger w foil paper homemade. Sorry I do not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $.  I have tried other methods, including my home cotton balls and foil and[[ASIN:B003TMO3EU Shellac Remover Wraps 100 Count]] , I found them hard to apply and keep on.  I pre-treat my hands with [[ASIN:B001B0ZZFS Neutrogena Body Oil, Light Sesame Formula, Fragrance Free, 8.5 Ounce]], to protect my skin and cuticles. I use a nail polish remover dispenser to apply the acetone and put my hands in oven mitts.</li>
            <li> This works very well, but needs some cleaning with a tool to&lt;br /&gt;remove residue. I love my home gel system!</li>
            <li> These are super! Work wonderfully.  I do wish the foil was a little thicker so it would hold the mold you squeeze it into better b ut it is doable.  That is why the 4 stars.  I have to leave them on about 20-30min. with the Gelish line of products but it does work &amp; the polish just sort of &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; into globs as you rub it when finished.  Not so damaging to the nail as scraping it off.  It would be a real pain to use tin foil &amp; cotton balls I believe.  Heat from say a hair dryer seems to speed the process up. Like, I put my hand under a towel with the hair dryer for a minute or so.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I have newborn twins and I needed to streamline my manicure process. These are great but all they are is foil with a little pad on it. You can easily make these at home with aluminum foil and a cotton ball. But if you don&#x27;t have the time, these are great!</li>
            <li> Best thing to use with soak off polish</li>
            <li> I bought these to remove my shellac and they work perfect!  I use to try to soak my nails in acetone, but this is so much better.  definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I do my own gel nails. I thought this product would be easier to use on myself then the other options on the market.  I do think it is a bit easier and less expensive. Just make sure you wrap the finger tight and cover the tip to insure proper removal technique.</li>
            <li> I followed the suggestion about putting on the wraps and keeping them under a heating pad for 15 minutes.  When I removed them it didnt require me to scrape too much.  Liked the wraps.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  Simple, efficient &amp; what more is there to say about opi expert touch removal wraps 250ct</li>
            <li> I have no idea why this works so much better than a regular cotton ball with tin foil, but it does. I was hesitant to buy these, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. After I started using Gelish Structure, the cotton ball + foil removal method wasn&#x27;t cutting it. I was doubtful this would be any different, but the wraps definitely make a difference.</li>
            <li> Ladies!!!  Get these if you are taking off your gel nail polish. They work...they really do!!!  Just put on your gel nail polish remover and wrap your nails in these foils for about 15-20 minutes. I do it while I watch tv.  Once done, remove with your orange stick...scrape off gently.  This is soo much easier than going to your nail tech and having them grind on your nails sometimes injuring your nail bed.</li>
            <li> These are the same foil wraps that are used at the nail salon, and really make gel polish removal easy.  I&#x27;m right handed and using my left hand to remove the right hand gel polish was very difficult. I made my own foil wraps with cotton pads and foil that I cut into strips. This was not very successful and so I usually would spend the money for the polish removal at the salon. These wraps make home removal  easy and MUCH cheaper than a salon. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> By far the best removal wraps I have tried.  I wear disposable gloves to keep them warm and in place.  that also allows me to use my hands while I wait.</li>
            <li> these are FANTASTIC!  I used to soak my gel polish off in Acetone but these work so much quicker and without having to submerse my fingers!  LOVE it!</li>
            <li> After a year of going to salons to have them tear or scrape off the polish, I decided to try this product on my own at home.  It works great and no more pain!</li>
            <li> These are great and this is a wonderful price. Helps with the cost so I and keep it low for my clients. Thanks! A+++++</li>
            <li> I have tried others that don&#x27;t have the foil and they don&#x27;t work well. Found that cover with a heating pad for 15 minutes and the just melt off</li>
            <li> Makes removing gel polish much easier, but it is sometimes difficult to get them to stay on your fingers!</li>
            <li> Best thing I have found yet for removing gel polish.</li>
            <li> Whatever solution they put on the pads must not be very strong.  I kept them on longer than recommended but I still had to scrape at my nails to get them off.</li>
            <li> These are just what I wanted when I ordered them.  They work very well and are much easier than cutting your own.  They were shipped promptly and arrived when promised.</li>
            <li> Great idea)) very easy to use))</li>
            <li> These work great for removing gel polish. Much easier to use than cotton and tin foil.</li>
            <li> TRANSACTION WENT PERFECTLY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Love these things!  They save a lot of time, fuss and muss.  And for about a buck for all ten fingers.  Can&#x27;t go wrong here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought an alcohol pump bottle and put the acetone in it.  I just push down on the pump with the Wrap.  No spills, splatters, cutting foil, etc.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> These were honestly not a good purchase - sad I wasted so much money. They aren&#x27;t big enough to stay on securely and they simply don&#x27;t take the Gel off very well.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not worth buying, wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> works as expected. A bit pricey for just tinfoil and a piece of cotton.</li>
            <li> Good product, good transaction.&lt;br /&gt;If your time is worth more than money, this is a very convenient item.</li>
            <li> I loved the promise that I could use these with less &amp;#34;scraping&amp;#34; of my nails.  It didn&#x27;t work that way.  Perhaps I needed to sit even longer for it to work (I sat for over 30 minutes), but in the end I still scraped my nails.  I&#x27;m going back to the salon, so I don&#x27;t have to do all the scraping myself.</li>
            <li> a little difficult to use and keep on.</li>
            <li> Left them on gel nails for over ten minutes and still had to &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; off about half of the package.</li>
            <li> Need to get the correct dispenser for these to work really well.</li>
            <li> ok to take them off easily</li>
            <li> My daughter and I decided to do our own gels, and this stuff helps when soaking off the old gel.  It&#x27;s expensive, but much easier than tearing squares of foil and pulling blobs of cotton balls.  If you&#x27;re soaking off by yourself (no one to help) just do one hand at a time.  Takes a little longer, but much neater!</li>
            <li> Yes, one can cut up their own aluminum foil and use cotton balls, and in fact, that&#x27;s what I did before buying these. But let me tell you, these are so much easier, quicker to use, and less messy. I love these for the convenience and ease of use. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can \\&quot;make\\&quot; things like this yourself for cheaper but I specifically bought a UV kit because I have a young child who goes to bed later and I missed doing my nails.  The UV kits/gel polishes allow you longer-term manicures (mine last so long I have to change them because my nails have grown too much - the polish still looks fabulous!).  So in the interest of saving time (since that&#x27;s the whole reason I started gel manicures) I bought these hoping for (slightly) faster removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a side-by-side with these on one hand and the cotton pad/foil wrap on the other.  There wasn&#x27;t much difference but these were far more convenient and therefore faster to use.  The foil is heavy duty and I figure they&#x27;re $1 a manicure.  I&#x27;m sure that cotton balls and heavy duty foil are cheaper but this is quick and easy!  I will buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 7/2013 - I knocked this down a star because I bought the Orly Gel &amp; Glitter Nail Lacquer Pocket Removers at Sally&#x27;s the other day and tried them this weekend.  (They&#x27;re available on Amazon through Sally Beauty.)  Wow - so nice!  They are basically little plastic bags with a foam piece inside - it is folded over inside. At first I thought this was wasteful but I tried putting it in just in a single layer for the nail side (I didn&#x27;t really want my skin soaking in the acetone, too, if I didn&#x27;t need it and I&#x27;m cheap and thought maybe I could get double the use!). But the fit isn&#x27;t tight enough that way, you need both layers.  It usually takes FOREVER so soak off gel polish and I didn&#x27;t have time to commit to being hands-free for 20+ minutes so I just did two fingers at first.  (The instructions on these say check after 10 minutes and then wait another 2 minutes if it doesn&#x27;t come off but my experience has been that removing gel is a real pain and takes a long time. It&#x27;s actually made me re-think even doing them though I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry AT ALL how I use my nails and chips are my PET PEEVE (take thatoff if it looks trashy!)  ANYWAY - here&#x27;s the trick I used with them.  When you put the little bags over your fingers you can get leaking and I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work without pressure (it has some pressure from the pad but it&#x27;s not as tight as foil).  So I took a twist tie and put it over the nail and twisted it in back so that I could see the foam pad pressing on the polish.  Lots of benefits here:  1.  You can do stuff - maybe not with all 10 nails like that but if you do a couple of fingers on each hand you have enough fingers to manipulate things and you know they won&#x27;t fall off.  This is how I did it over an evening and it&#x27;s how I&#x27;ll be doing it in the future.  Stupid if you have the time but if you don&#x27;t have 10-15 minutes to sit and wait then this works really well!  2. It keeps the acetone in contact with the polish the whole time - with foil I&#x27;d keep squeezing it to get it tight on the polish.  After 10 minutes the polish came right off!  And the bonus - I used the little pockets again for the next two nails!  The little foam pads did rip after a couple of nails but I just turned them over - they weren&#x27;t ripped on the skin side!  I think I only used 4 to get this manicure off.  I loved them.  Sorry to the OPI foil but I&#x27;ll be using the Orly pockets from now on!  (But if you insist on foil, I&#x27;d definitely consider the twist tie thing - I&#x27;m guessing this was a big reason the polish came off so well and so quickly.  Plus you don&#x27;t spend the whole soaking time trying to push them on and make sure there&#x27;s enough contact.) Maybe I&#x27;ll do a side-by-side with the pockets and the foil using twist-ties.  It will be interesting to see if the twist tie is what made the most difference or the foam pad (which soaked up more acetone but the foil have always still been wet when I&#x27;ve opened them so I&#x27;m doubtful that there wasn&#x27;t enough acetone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 8-21-13 - turns out the twist tie is the key!  Tonight I did side-by-side with the Orly pockets and the OPI foils and used a twist-tie to keep the acetone in contact with the polish better.  Both worked equally well. So I bumped these up a star again and I suppose I&#x27;ll be buying these in the future as they&#x27;re cheaper and since they mold to your finger it&#x27;s easier to get the twist tie on very quickly (it was very fast with either system).  The one bonus to the Orly pockets was that you could see the colored polish through the clear bag and the foam piece so you knew that the tie was in the right place to get maximum contact with the acetone. Both systems are worth the money but the twist tie is the real ticket to being quick about it!</li>
            <li> I tried a few times to use a cotton ball and piece of foil like I saw other people do, but it  was seriously a hassle.  So I spent a little extra and just bought the removal wraps and it was so worth it.</li>
            <li> These Opi Removal Wraps are wonderful. They make the process of soaking off your gel nail polish super easy, and you&#x27;re not stuck in your seat soaking your nails in a dish! I found it&#x27;s much easier to do one hand at a time, though.</li>
            <li> These work VERY well.  So much easier than cutting foil and wrapping around a cotton ball.  I do my own nails so it is important that I be able to do this with one hand.  That is quite the challenge using my own foil and cotton ball.  I did have to use two on one nail, but I expected that as I use a lot of gel product, so it is thick.  I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> works - just like in the salons</li>
            <li> For the price, these were well worth it.  I wanted my nail time to be as pampered as possible since its my time so I love these.  they stay on so much better than just cutting squares of foil and they&#x27;re more comfortable.  The pad that you soak is the perfect size and did a great job.  I thought the picture looked to small but they are actually more than long and wide enough for even long nails.  I will continue getting these.</li>
            <li> I was using foil and pads that I would cut. What a pain in the neck. These are definitely easier to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the DIY method of soaking a cotton ball and wrapping with foil, and I made a horrible mess.  This is so much easier and very efficient.  In 5 minutes, the acetone ate through the polish and most of the acrylic underneath.  Definitely faster and cleaner than trying to soak it off in a bowl.  So glad I bought these!</li>
            <li> I like this product, because it is easy to remove Gel polish with it.  I have tried numerous stores around me, but no one sold something to remove get nail color.</li>
            <li> Before this product, I was cutting strips of foil to use with cotton balls in order to remove my gel nail polish. This is much easier to use, and I don&#x27;t use as much acetone either, which is nice.</li>
            <li> These make it so much easier to wrap around each finger tightly and sit for about 10 minutes and the gel comes right off. They stay in place really well because of the aluminum foil which conforms to your finger perfectly.</li>
            <li> Returned.  I found that I didn&#x27;t really need them.</li>
            <li> These work great and are durable.  No dripping acetone on the furniture any more.</li>
            <li> I put these on and watch TV for a while then do my nails.  Easiest I&#x27;ve found for taking off the gel polish.  And when I had my nails done in town this is also what she used.</li>
            <li> If you have a 3rd hand that you&#x27;re not trying to take the polish off of, then you&#x27;ll be able to manipulate these on your fingertips to not only take the polish off, but to actually keep them on.  :-/</li>
            <li> Great. Wish it could cost a little less.</li>
            <li> it is very convience when applying the acetone. the aluminum part is thicker than our regular aluminum foil (if you would like to save $ and use cut the regular aluminum paper), so sometimes I can reuse the wrap for the 2nd time that will also save some $ as well.</li>
            <li> These squares of foil w/ cotton pad attached makes it easier to remove gel nail polish. Easy to saturate w/ acetone and less messy then using cotton balls w/ foil. I use each square twice by doing my one hand first and then following right afterwards w/ the second hand.</li>
            <li> These are totally worth the money. I used to do the foil and cotton ball, which totally works, but to me this is just so handy and a roll lasts forever!</li>
            <li> The first time I removed my gel nail polish I cut up cotton cosmetic pads and foil and did it myself (these were on order).  The second time I used these.  Both ways worked, but these are easier and I used a lot less acetone using this product.  It makes gel nail polish removal easy.  I will definitely order these again when I need them.</li>
            <li> Best remover wraps out there. I do my own at home gels polish with OPI colors.  These stay on the best of the three I have tried.</li>
            <li> well it helps a lot to remove gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is you&#x27;d have to have the patience to leave them on. Took a star out since it&#x27;s not a easy thing to do with them... not too comfy</li>
            <li> These work well to remove the OPI Gelcolor nail polish. I have tried another type but find the foil easier to use.</li>
            <li> Much easier to just tape a cotton ball to your finger.</li>
            <li> I paid $27 for these wraps and used them the day I got them. I only used 5, I did as instructed and used OPI Expert Touch and it did NOTHING!!! It didn&#x27;t even look as if I had a polish remover anywhere near my nails. HUGE disappointment!!  I went back to look at the product on Amazon to see if I did something worng, and saw that the price now is $8 - what a complete RIP OFF! I could see if this worked - but for $25 it&#x27;s a total waste of my hard earned money. The ends of the product fell of immediately upon taking the plastic wrapper off of it. I can&#x27;t even return for a refund -  I have nothing good to say about this product.</li>
            <li> These wraps are durable and effective. The attached pads hold the acetone well. Even when I reuse the wraps, they work well in keeping the nail in contact with the acetone. The professional grade of the foil makes them hold tight enough to do the job. I was surprised that they released the polish so quickly. These wraps really help shorten the time needed to redo my gel nails.</li>
            <li> These are amazing, definitely will repurchase.  I consider them a must-have to remove gel polish.</li>
            <li> I am a little lazy and would rather use these than creating my own from cotton and foil  Compact and easy to use.  Great price!</li>
            <li> These are so nice - and make removing the shellac/gel polish so easy!  The foil is thick and the padding is very thin, but you don&#x27;t need much.  Overall - I will purchase agian.</li>
            <li> These wraps are very handy.  The pad is already attached to the foil.  Moisten the pad with your removal product and place over your nail gel to be removed.  No slipping of the pad away from where it belongs.  It is easy to place the pad just right.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I have to say about this product is that someone at O.P.I is being extremely rude for not showing me this product earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love glitter nail polish, and I just hate taking it off. The whole process of using aluminum foil and cotton isn&#x27;t new to me, but it&#x27;s not a fun process. It&#x27;s annoying, it&#x27;s just annoying. This is perfect. It&#x27;s perfectly sized, and it takes nothing to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must tell you this, though: I thought this was going to already have the polish remover on the wraps, and I was wrong. It&#x27;s nothing, you should just probably know this.</li>
