            <li>The new model has a nice silicone (I think) pad which is a great safety grip feature.</li>
            <li>Wahl 79524-5201 Chrome Pro 25 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit Wahl .i love it .it is a very good tool .thanks</li>
            <li>I have used this alot and love it</li>
            <li>kit comes with plenty of attachments, most of which I will never use.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you oil the blade after each use.</li>
            <li>Forget battery-powered beard trimmers, this thing is so much better and easier to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like and am satisfied</li>
            <li>Top line clippers and a lot cheaper than Walmart.</li>
            <li>Glad I checked before I used them</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad they came with everything I needed.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>Have been having my lovely wife cut my hair for years</li>
            <li>Glad I made the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I will buy here again fast shipping as well great customer service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy, Thanks :)</li>
            <li>but there are more attachments and</li>
            <li>so I need help of my wife with it, but I see how somebody with better hands coordination and a couple of mirrors could do it himself after some practice.</li>
            <li>Many of the accessories in this kit are just penny-worth fillers</li>
            <li>but I doubt you don&#x27;t have better one at home</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve seen better ones in Dollar Tree.</li>
            <li>Since I wasn&#x27;t sure if the self-haircut experiment would work I didn&#x27;t want to spend more than $40 on a pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m confident it will break in no time.</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly pleased with this product</li>
            <li>I have used Wahl most of the time.</li>
            <li>Powerful clipper good for home use</li>
            <li>Grate for edge up, fades , and all around hair cutts :)</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>You will probably be better off to purchase the two clippers separate if you want both to be quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;first time out of the gate she did a great job and in the 3 years since then the haircut-at-home thing has worked very well for</li>
            <li>/&gt;we really do love these clippers.</li>
            <li>Cuts smoothly, doesn&#x27;t warm up the blade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the most affordable price on amazon</li>
            <li>I Love it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Im really satisfy, the accesories and the bag are great to travel</li>
            <li>This clipper cuts much better than my friends that got theirs at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>MADE IN AMERICA, and it shows need I say more?</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The thumb guide caused the razor to stop moving at the top and bottom of it&#x27;s range.</li>
            <li>Two more words required</li>
            <li>I use it bi-weekly to trim up my boys with a #8 on top, #2 on the sides</li>
            <li>It was stressful just trying to drive to the place (traffic), then hoping the girl who does it best is actually working that day etc....PITA.</li>
            <li>It became one more thing to &#x27;schedule&#x27; in a day off....</li>
            <li>I wish I would have paid more for a better set.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use 3 drops of oil before</li>
            <li>I never ever needed this many adapters just to trim hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>We love this set of clippers.  </li>
            <li>i was just expecting a better quality group of clippers.</li>
            <li>love this shaver and would recommend this to anyone looking for shaver</li>
            <li>love it.&lt;br /&gt;it is coming with all the accessories needed for an hair cut.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic!  </li>
            <li>-- I gave realignment another shot with more patience and precision.</li>
            <li>The big one works great!  </li>
            <li>And my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Read the instructions you can do much more than a buzz cut.</li>
            <li>I love my kit.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE OKAY....</li>
            <li>Such a nice good quality set!</li>
            <li>I went with Oster Classic 76 since buying this, and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it.</li>
            <li>Stellar!!!</li>
            <li>the first one was nice but this clippers are by far the best.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Great clippers that give a close and smooth cut the first pass</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy at a good price</li>
            <li>Has a cool battery operated, &amp;#34;mini-me&amp;#34; trimmers, and a nice case with a zipper to keep all the supplies together.</li>
            <li>They are so quite and  powerful!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to use, and has all the accessories we need (and more) to get the job done.</li>
            <li>It works great – powerful, precise, smooth, never jams, easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>It has an impressive amount of power, but I find it limited in usefulness since it does not accept add-on attachments.</li>
            <li>Ordered and tried my very first own hair cut.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be a great set so far!</li>
            <li>THEY CREATE MORE EXQUISITE CLIPPERS THAN ANYONE ELSE, AND THE BLADES STAY SHARP FOREVER.</li>
            <li>I have been using this exact item for 3 years and by far it is the best ive used.</li>
            <li>So far they have been great</li>
            <li>Clippers so far have worked great and have no complaints about the performance</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say too much about them except they give a good cot</li>
            <li>Not a Walmart special!</li>
            <li>Blades are sharp, it came with plenty of extras, and the storage bag is awesome!</li>
            <li>The first one died after many many many uses.  </li>
            <li>Well constructed, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>good for the price and durable performance buy if you dont have more money to buy a professional one</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Reliable, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>These are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and takes like 10-15 minutes to do my haircut at home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would have given this 5 stars but about 2 years into using them, the set became somewhat noisy and sluggish ... not as easy to use as it had been.</li>
            <li>Guards are easy to change and it comes with a lot of them.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t turn on quite as easily.</li>
            <li>The kit came with a ton of guards and oil and brushes to make sure you keep your clippers clean and operational.</li>
            <li>The clipper length attachments are easy to take on/off.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Instructions easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>Nice clippers with simple advice for getting a good cut</li>
            <li>hair is sort of strong and it won&#x27;t budge to some clippers,</li>
            <li>Nice quality for the price..Was given as a Christmas present and the person loved it..</li>
            <li>Great product and has been a major money saver.</li>
            <li>Good directions are enclosed with a book and pictures to help new users.</li>
            <li>Also has kept me from spending a lot of money and many too radical haircuts from ambitious or over confident haircuts</li>
            <li>job.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer attachments feel like cheap/flimsy plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics are fine.</li>
            <li>Cuts my boys hair just fine.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about nine years and worked perfectly until something holding the blades broke recently.</li>
            <li>Smooth cut and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Noise level is just fine.  </li>
            <li>I have always owened Wahl clippers so I bought these assuming they would meet my needs just fine.</li>
            <li>These clippers are holding up just fine</li>
            <li>On time delivery, product is fine.</li>
            <li>The model works good but is very loud.</li>
            <li>Not high end on power or closeness but a very good buy for the price.  </li>
            <li>Is easy to operate, not for professional use, but good for your house.</li>
            <li>Cut the hair evenly and easily and easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>It is a great product even though I&#x27;m kind of bummed about the little guy.</li>
            <li>Clippers make a grinding sound on 30% of starts.  </li>
            <li>I was so upset because they are such great quality clippers</li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>Great product for personal all purpose use.</li>
            <li>Great product for personal all purpose use.</li>
            <li>actually this products is greaat so great</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cost much and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>The smaller clippers work great on the hairline and my beard plus being cordless is a bonus.</li>
            <li>, it felt cheap.</li>
            <li>but it just feels cheap.</li>
            <li>so I needed something cheap but to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Oil the clippers after each cut and have a fairly smooth experience with these.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use the battery-powered trimmer nearly as much as the big one, but both work great!</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This will pay for itself after the first 2 haircuts!!  </li>
            <li>It has been a very useful and has performed well.</li>
            <li>It, the large clipper, IS very easy to use...on someone else.</li>
            <li>I can quickly and easily cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>It was super easy to cut his hair</li>
            <li>I like the small one that comes with it the best.</li>
            <li>I saved more money than I paid for the kit on the first week</li>
            <li>Not only did I find a nice chrome of clippers but also chrome trimmers to boot all under $40 including shipping!  </li>
            <li>Not cutting!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for it&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li>thing better would be complete wireless connectivity. ! ! ! !</li>
            <li>Great value, sharp and strong.  </li>
            <li>You really do get a lot for your money with this kit like two POWERFUL clippers, blade guards, brush, oil and a NICE travel bag that holds ALL items.</li>
            <li>Everything you need to give a haircut, easy to handle, and the right price.</li>
            <li>I love WAHL because its products are made in the USA and they have very high quality.</li>
            <li>The Conair had worked ok, but were very noisy</li>
            <li>The clippers cut perfectly and have no problem going through relatively thick hair.</li>
            <li>1AA battery is clearly not enough to make it work good.</li>
            <li>Full set - everything you need to cut hair.  </li>
            <li>The indent on the top of the clippers does make it much easier to hold onto.</li>
            <li>They work good enough but they still pull hair.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, nice extra fittings.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, nice extra fittings.</li>
            <li>Its pretty easy to use...just take your time.  </li>
            <li>The blades have to be manually adjusted for a close cut but other than that,  its a great deal.</li>
            <li>Good weight , long enough electric cable, good value for price</li>
            <li>however the trimmers are not that good kind of dull.</li>
            <li>Luckily I kept mine.</li>
            <li>It cuts super well.</li>
            <li>Have used this brand for most of my life and they have all been the same - they just keep on clipping. . . :)</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was as stated.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment.</li>
            <li>replaced my 10 yr old wahl clippers  great so far</li>
            <li>Besides the impressive heft, the vibration is well controlled and emits a relatively low, steady hum--not a high whine or rattle like cheaper plastic-framed clippers and trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does come with scissors ... but they are pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li>It cuts very evenly and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Great hair clippers but the little guy was s</li>
            <li>I always keep my hair short ever since I retired from the military and these are perfect for maintaining my hair that perfect high and tight!</li>
            <li>yes, the little one is loud, but both work great!  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how fast this came and the amazing quality of the razor.</li>
            <li>im giving it a way for free thank you so much it will help them start out in life  </li>
            <li>I bought the set strictly for the clippers anyway and rarely use the trimmer.</li>
            <li>It was worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have feel so much more solid and comfortable.</li>
            <li>These hair clippers are worth every cent.</li>
            <li>You get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It stop working had to buy a better professional one</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to have this one as a back up.</li>
            <li>I would give this clipper a 5 star but the on/off switch seems more cheaply made than the last one I had.  </li>
            <li>The Wahl clippers are well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product was well worth the price and the money.</li>
            <li>It has a strong motor, and comes a decent set of accessories.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price..</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money</li>
            <li>Product has replaced an 8 year old Wahl cutter that was working ok.  </li>
            <li>This Wahl recently purchased is a bit heavier and a little more bulky but the cut is very nice and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Taking kids to the barber shop is not easy or cheap and now he can give them good haircuts at home.</li>
            <li>The blades are really sharp, and the 8 guards are fantastic, I cut my own hair every week, and it never looks like I got or need a hair cut, now @ $10.00 a haircut that a savings of $520.00 a year.</li>
            <li>The delivery was right on time.  </li>
            <li>The price is just right for me.</li>
            <li>The new one definitely cuts better and more evenly.  </li>
            <li>Despite it&#x27;s size and the amount of items included it is a relatively clean kit that doesn&#x27;t require much juggling of the parts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and the various guides are easy to clip on and off.</li>
            <li>New one is lighter and works just fine.</li>
            <li>We are happy with it but not sure why there have to be 25 pieces.</li>
            <li>it came with a good bundle, i love the small trimmer too!!</li>
            <li>Only thing not included in the kit are batteries for the smaller clippers..still a great value.</li>
            <li>Its not the sellers fault, but when I got the clippers, you had to hit them for them to come on every time, but I return them, and got a full refund, these usually are some good clippers</li>
            <li>The bigger shaver works great and there are a ton of different plastic guides.</li>
            <li>Came to us quickly and works very well.  </li>
            <li>This is the second pair of wahl hair clippers that I have bought the first one was great, but that was a different model.</li>
            <li>as far as giving great looking professional hair cuts he was looking for a little more than these clippers could offer.</li>
            <li>Very much recommend this item.</li>
            <li>The wireless trimmer that is include is very cheap takes only one AA battery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After use, cleaning the inside does its job maintaining this equipment to top standard.</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply the oil that comes with the kit after use, preventing future rust.</li>
            <li>These clippers are my first pair ever.</li>
            <li>The are my first pair</li>
            <li>After the first couple haircuts it pays for it&#x27;s self.</li>
            <li>smaller clipper is excellent if you want your wife or girlfriend, or significant other to trim around your ears and back.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first set 3 years ago.</li>
            <li>My first Wahl was bought in 2008 when I started to shave myself.</li>
            <li>Boy was I pleased to discover it&#x27;s such an affordable piece of equipment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>construction is very sturdy, and the included attachments make trimming a cinch!</li>
            <li>Ive never buy Whal, to be the first item I bought from this brand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and will last for many years.</li>
            <li>The touch up trimmer is pretty clutch as well.</li>
            <li>So many tools Included for the low price although I bought it At Wall-mart for 29$(plus taxes)</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Old pair shorted while overseas and these have more than filled the shoes of the prior.</li>
            <li>I did find that I had to go over his hair again to catch hairs that didn&#x27;t get cut the first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty noisy.</li>
            <li>The clippers don&#x27;t get hot after using them for a while.</li>
            <li>I wanted a higher quality and thought this would be it.  </li>
            <li>We bought this to replace a Wahl clipper that we had owned for 45 years.&lt;br /&gt;Since my husband is shiny on top, he decided to go with a buzz cut last year.</li>
            <li>Perfect choice for a casual beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with the Wahl brand as a quality product, but am surprised this has its name on it.  </li>
            <li>It was so easy to do, I just use the 4 guide for the sides and the back, the 5 guide for the crown and upper side edges, and the 6 guide to finish off the top.  </li>
            <li>Clippers are well made, quiet, good selection of guides for different hair lengths and side trimming, etc.</li>
            <li>There is nothing fancy about them, and they are a lot lighter than the ones that I&#x27;ve had in the past, but they are pretty good.</li>
            <li>Also the cape is very low quality, we just tossed ours and got a better, they don&#x27;t cost that much.  </li>
            <li>It was a cheap piece of junk that is probably only worth about $3</li>
            <li>Nice product , same exactly as my old one</li>
            <li>These clippers cut thru the hair like a hot knife thru butter and are very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is ok, but I had to wait for a long time for get this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Just to clarify, mostly my praises going to main big clipper.</li>
            <li>The little trimmer that comes with it is very cheap feeling but does the job when you need a quick touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I liked this one because it has all the different sized clippers along with the right and left ear tapers.</li>
            <li>It includes 10 different sizes of guards so you can easily use it on yourself if you dont have anybody else around to cut your hair.</li>
            <li>This Kit was purchased as a backup to another Wahl kit that has been used for several years (and is going strong) in this household.  </li>
            <li>Take good care of it and it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>The large corded clipper works well.  </li>
            <li>Many multiple uses and works like brand new.</li>
            <li>She is very high on the WAHL brand.....</li>
            <li>I liked but the little machine does not work</li>
            <li>The clipper works just fine like my old Wahl set which was over 23yrs old.</li>
            <li>It is a little bit heavy but works great!</li>
            <li>Works great to cut my hair and my 9 year old son&#x27;s hair at least once a week.</li>
            <li>The combs can be properly tighten so it makes huge noise and always scares my son.</li>
            <li>For the price of $20 you cant really complain.</li>
            <li>Still was much cheaper than the one</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Works well and is very affordable.</li>
            <li>Very well packaged, thank you.  </li>
            <li>absolutely junk with rubbish quality.</li>
            <li>going straight to the bin.</li>
            <li>For the money this is perfect for home hair cutting and trimming.  </li>
            <li>Buy with caution.&lt;br /&gt;Overall sturdy construction but the smaller clippers is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so it really saves money and time</li>
            <li>and I have no complains about how my haircut looks, nothing different with barber shop results.t by sound</li>
            <li>so it really saves money and time</li>
            <li>Trimmers not so much.</li>
            <li>He normally uses Remington products, so this was the first Wahl he&#x27;s ever tried.</li>
            <li>This Wahl branded product is very noisy and adjusting it lessens the noise but decrease the hair clipping effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I use this to cut mine and my boy&#x27;s hair and it has worked very well.</li>
            <li>but I bought a beard trimmer that works very well for that</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>These save me so much money, it&#x27;s unreal.</li>
            <li>Everything works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like these Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>The process is a real pain in the neck</li>
            <li>Expected a better cut from what I&#x27;m use to from wahl.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Francis.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair (short &amp; shaggy) as well as my friends and this grip prevents those occasional slips when my hand may get whet.  </li>
            <li>If I wanted good scissors, I expect to spend at least this much again.  </li>
            <li>smaller trimmer does not seem to be very powerful</li>
            <li>like I&#x27;m pleased and recommend I recommend it to other customers are very versatile and</li>
            <li>The motor is strong and cuts through my thick hair easily and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I am 57 yrs old with a special needs, 29 year old, son who does not like the barber shop.</li>
            <li>I have been cutting my own hair for roughly 7 years now with Wahl clippers and overall, they are great and fairly cheap when you consider how much you&#x27;d be saving on haircuts.</li>
            <li>The small trimmer works great for trimming around his ears and back of neck.</li>
            <li>I use classic butch haircut (1/4&amp;#34; during summer, 1/2&amp;#34; during winter) and my hair grow really, really fast, so to keep them look neat</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make too much noise and it works decently.</li>
            <li>Lots of attachments for different length cuts and the small cordless trimmer is great.</li>
            <li>There are special taper guides for the ears, but I haven&#x27;t tried those yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller clipper is basically a piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Hello thanks for the fast delivery, but why the clipper machine do very very loud noise???&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li>But there is enough grip to have full control.</li>
            <li>the additional small trimmer is quite handy.  </li>
            <li>soon as you hold these clippers, you realize you&#x27;re holding a robustly built piece of equipment, exactly like a professional barber/stylist would use.</li>
            <li>silver finish is really slick and make cleaning off the clippers super easy.</li>
            <li>The additional smaller trimmers allow an even closer shave and quick trims in between cuts.</li>
            <li>In my non-professional opinion this set will stand up to the most expensive clipper sets out there for sure.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the set, would purchase another and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have used an older beard trimmer for my neck and ear line</li>
            <li>The larger clippers are not that loud at all and run smoothly.</li>
            <li>Also, buy a decent hand mirror to trim up the neck (hardest part)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My boyfriend bought this because he dropped his older one and the blade broke.</li>
            <li>Basically pulls out the hair very loudly!</li>
            <li>It has pretty wide blade for touch-up trimmer and because of it it&#x27;s harder to use it around ears or temples to taper it nice.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>and I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This product is high quality.  </li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Although small machine is not very useful, the bigger machine is almost perfect.</li>
            <li>clippers alone have a built-in adjustable guard that varies the hair length from &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; to about a little more than a 1/4 in.</li>
            <li>The main clippers and even the smaller clippers are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The hair clippers I received where extremely loud when turn on and vibrated too much.</li>
            <li>It is a gift for a friend of mine and I am pleased about the kit, hope it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>The mini trimmer is also useful for sideburns and back neck area touch ups.</li>
            <li>big savings, fun</li>
            <li>Everything is exactly as expected if not more, I was using a really cheap set originally and this upgrade was SO worth the $$.  </li>
            <li>High quality and design are evident and will last for years!</li>
            <li>does not show me absolutely new</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone needing a new pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>I decided to get a new one</li>
            <li>And needs new clippers.</li>
            <li>The blades are pretty harsh directly on the skin you&#x27;re trying to clean up.</li>
            <li>Otherwise they are exactly the same, and they are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a professional caliber clipper set, this is it!  </li>
            <li>Think of my safety first, I went back with Wahl.</li>
            <li>Everything was cut pretty evenly and the only difficulty I had was dealing with my sideburns/ears.</li>
            <li>I am going to request a replacement for the small unit, and if this request is processed appropriately, I will increase my rating.</li>
            <li>Feel the same as many of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>Love the small trimmer that comes with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second pair - my first pair lasted 3 years with 0 oil.</li>
            <li>Costco sells the exact same clippers but with batteries for $30.</li>
            <li>I think trimmer would really benefit from better power sourse, may be 2 batteries, but they wanted to make it very small rather than efficient.</li>
            <li>I think trimmer would really benefit from better power sourse, may be 2 batteries, but they wanted to make it very small rather than efficient.</li>
            <li>I received this combo kit in early December;  the large AC-powered unit works great;  unfortunately, the smaller trimmer worked a couple of times and then stopped working.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that the smaller trimmer runs on a single AA battery and it drains super quick.</li>
            <li>There is a loud clicking noise when they first start, but after that they are quiet.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s about the same model , more money and less attachments .</li>
            <li>One day I&#x27;m going to be bold enough to actually cut my hair with this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are sharp, cut very well and are pretty well built.</li>
            <li>We bought this set to replace a much older one and the quality improvement is apparent.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a heavy-duty trimmer that comes as a complete set with all the shields and a full complement of other accessories (scissors, mini-trimmer,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a minimal investment and worth your money pretty much the second or third time you use them.</li>
            <li>Two regular haircombs included are very cheap and narrow, you can use them</li>
            <li>so I just use one guard and shave his whole head the same length.</li>
            <li>and we have not had this problem so far.</li>
            <li>but I like the clippers and the beard trimmer so far.</li>
            <li>I needed a replacement for my 25 year old Wahl -</li>
            <li>These clippers work as advertised so far.  </li>
            <li>I had no trouble with it getting overheated.  </li>
            <li>Got them for my husband and he can use them on our 6year old</li>
            <li>I gave my self a professional looking haircut with it</li>
            <li>It has a lot of different options when it comes to what size he wants for his cut.</li>
            <li>Had an old Wahl that have used for over 15 years, still works but decided it was time for an upgrade.</li>
            <li>Professional quality.</li>
            <li>My old clippers died and I got these.</li>
            <li>but they are 5 years old</li>
            <li>With these clippers you get a professional cut.  </li>
            <li>and professional.</li>
            <li>The clipper itself feels very well built and solid.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is light, but not cheap and runs on 1 AA battery.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s Who Concert loud</li>
            <li>then there&#x27;s this trimmer loud...</li>
            <li>So far I had no issue with this purchase.</li>
            <li>This is so expensive in stores, but it&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
            <li>It certainly ain&#x27;t having trouble with the ladies;)</li>
            <li>the best thing of this product is that it contain a small size shaver which can cut off some difficult rim for the complete size shaver</li>
            <li>The shields snap securely onto the clippers and are sufficiently stiff that they are not likely to bend or break under normal use.</li>
            <li>Procuring my own pair of clippers as opposed to relying on scissors and razors has made cutting my friend&#x27;s hair so much easier (and faster)!</li>
            <li>main (big) clipper exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Wahl clipper is good but the small one is waste of inclusion..</li>
            <li>Clippers work good but seem a little dull at times.  </li>
            <li>The new detail clippers only require one AA battery.</li>
            <li>Though, I appreciate that it&#x27;s battery operated so you can just install a new battery in a second and use it again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Though, I appreciate that it&#x27;s battery operated so you can just install a new battery in a second and use it again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is important because cheaply made shields can bend and result in an uneven cut, or worse, can break suddenly and allow the blade to cut much deeper into the hair.</li>
            <li>you can find it for around $30 or less, it&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li>The only negative (if you can call it that) is that there are too many pieces in the kit.</li>
            <li>The clipper was really very loud and make big noise in my house.</li>
            <li>We have 3 other clippers and they all get hot.  </li>
            <li>The small clippers are great for neckline and behind the ears.  </li>
            <li>My old clippers had a smaller one for doing detail trimming and required two AA batteries.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd Wahl clipper set this household has owned and used since the early 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a replacement for a 10 year old Wahl that had finally died.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working well and have no regrets.</li>
            <li>the quality I expected thanks</li>
            <li>Wahl 79524-5201 Chrome Pro 25 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit is a solid clipper.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think its professional enough...</li>
            <li>The set is complete with every guard possible, plus a wrap to keep hair off of yourself.</li>
            <li>Ill never use, but nice to have.</li>
            <li>The blade was not very sharp and tugs on your skin causing scratches.</li>
            <li>Not very sharp at all.</li>
            <li>This device is really useful for hair cutting,  with a  lot os acessories and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The small one runs out of batteries quickly</li>
            <li>Very sturdy feeling and sharp set up clippers.</li>
            <li>Have used it twice so far and since it was the same as my last set</li>
            <li>The set has all the sizes that I want and some extra good ones from cutting around the ear.</li>
            <li>yes it is a little loud but not as loud as my OLD norelco</li>
            <li>It has several combs for different lengths and the little trimmer is useful.  </li>
            <li>The little clipper seems to work OK for small trim jobs so all in all</li>
            <li>Scissors are cheapy again, they would work for some time, but handles are narrow and uncomfortable and they give kinda light and cheap feeling, $3 scissors from local store</li>
            <li>These clippers are quite strong on thick hair and is not very noisy.  </li>
            <li>I have used them a few times each month for more than a year and have had no issues other than one guard cracking slightly.</li>
            <li>Everything is good but the battery clipper is bad cause</li>
            <li>This is an amazing hair cutting machine.</li>
            <li>but he does an amazing job cutting hair.</li>

            <li> has been so handy to have.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Lots of guards all together in a nice bag.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t already have a trimmer, though, it&#x27;s nice for squaring up sideburns and, in conjunction with a comb, for trimming eyebrows as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice kit for home haircuts.</li>
            <li> Nice pair of clippers.</li>

            <li> I knew I wanted a nice chrome set of clippers from Wahl like my father&#x27;s</li>
            <li> THE WAHL HAIR CUTTER IS NICE</li>
            <li> The detailer is a nice addition as well.</li>
            <li> I decided I would try to cut my own hair and bought this product.  </li>

            <li> But this product has impressed me so far.</li>
            <li> Best home haircut since I bought my old Wahl 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Easy to use!  </li>
            <li> The main clippers are very good.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Wahl clippers - they are very good quality.</li>
            <li> So far so good everything works great.</li>
            <li> Great seller, nice price, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> First haircut was great.  </li>
            <li> Since I am bald on top I cant justifie paying for haircuts anymore do it myselfer now and this product makes it very easy top do</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and wanted something that was easy to use and hold onto.</li>
            <li> The new model has a nice silicone (I think) pad which is a great safety grip feature.</li>
            <li> Wahl 79524-5201 Chrome Pro 25 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit Wahl .i love it .it is a very good tool .thanks</li>
            <li> I have used this alot and love it</li>
            <li> kit comes with plenty of attachments, most of which I will never use.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you oil the blade after each use.</li>
            <li> Forget battery-powered beard trimmers, this thing is so much better and easier to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like and am satisfied</li>
            <li> Top line clippers and a lot cheaper than Walmart.</li>
            <li> Glad I checked before I used them</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad they came with everything I needed.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> Have been having my lovely wife cut my hair for years</li>
            <li> Glad I made the purchase.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I will buy here again fast shipping as well great customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy, Thanks :)</li>
            <li> but there are more attachments and</li>
            <li> so I need help of my wife with it, but I see how somebody with better hands coordination and a couple of mirrors could do it himself after some practice.</li>
            <li> Many of the accessories in this kit are just penny-worth fillers</li>
            <li> but I doubt you don&#x27;t have better one at home</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve seen better ones in Dollar Tree.</li>
            <li> Since I wasn&#x27;t sure if the self-haircut experiment would work I didn&#x27;t want to spend more than $40 on a pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m confident it will break in no time.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl most of the time.</li>
            <li> Powerful clipper good for home use</li>
            <li> Grate for edge up, fades , and all around hair cutts :)</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> You will probably be better off to purchase the two clippers separate if you want both to be quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;first time out of the gate she did a great job and in the 3 years since then the haircut-at-home thing has worked very well for</li>
            <li> /&gt;we really do love these clippers.</li>
            <li> Cuts smoothly, doesn&#x27;t warm up the blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also the most affordable price on amazon</li>
            <li> I Love it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Im really satisfy, the accesories and the bag are great to travel</li>
            <li> This clipper cuts much better than my friends that got theirs at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> MADE IN AMERICA, and it shows need I say more?</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The thumb guide caused the razor to stop moving at the top and bottom of it&#x27;s range.</li>
            <li> Two more words required</li>
            <li> I use it bi-weekly to trim up my boys with a #8 on top, #2 on the sides</li>
            <li> It was stressful just trying to drive to the place (traffic), then hoping the girl who does it best is actually working that day etc....PITA.</li>
            <li> It became one more thing to &#x27;schedule&#x27; in a day off....</li>
            <li> I wish I would have paid more for a better set.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use 3 drops of oil before</li>
            <li> I never ever needed this many adapters just to trim hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> We love this set of clippers.  </li>
            <li> i was just expecting a better quality group of clippers.</li>
            <li> love this shaver and would recommend this to anyone looking for shaver</li>
            <li> love it.&lt;br /&gt;it is coming with all the accessories needed for an hair cut.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic!  </li>
            <li> -- I gave realignment another shot with more patience and precision.</li>
            <li> The big one works great!  </li>
            <li> And my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Read the instructions you can do much more than a buzz cut.</li>
            <li> I love my kit.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE OKAY....</li>
            <li> Such a nice good quality set!</li>
            <li> I went with Oster Classic 76 since buying this, and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it.</li>
            <li> Stellar!!!</li>
            <li> the first one was nice but this clippers are by far the best.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Great clippers that give a close and smooth cut the first pass</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy at a good price</li>
            <li> Has a cool battery operated, &amp;#34;mini-me&amp;#34; trimmers, and a nice case with a zipper to keep all the supplies together.</li>
            <li> They are so quite and  powerful!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to use, and has all the accessories we need (and more) to get the job done.</li>
            <li> It works great – powerful, precise, smooth, never jams, easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> It has an impressive amount of power, but I find it limited in usefulness since it does not accept add-on attachments.</li>
            <li> Ordered and tried my very first own hair cut.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a great set so far!</li>
            <li> THEY CREATE MORE EXQUISITE CLIPPERS THAN ANYONE ELSE, AND THE BLADES STAY SHARP FOREVER.</li>
            <li> I have been using this exact item for 3 years and by far it is the best ive used.</li>
            <li> So far they have been great</li>
            <li> Clippers so far have worked great and have no complaints about the performance</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say too much about them except they give a good cot</li>
            <li> Not a Walmart special!</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp, it came with plenty of extras, and the storage bag is awesome!</li>
            <li> The first one died after many many many uses.  </li>
            <li> Well constructed, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> good for the price and durable performance buy if you dont have more money to buy a professional one</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Reliable, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> These are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and takes like 10-15 minutes to do my haircut at home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would have given this 5 stars but about 2 years into using them, the set became somewhat noisy and sluggish ... not as easy to use as it had been.</li>
            <li> Guards are easy to change and it comes with a lot of them.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn on quite as easily.</li>
            <li> The kit came with a ton of guards and oil and brushes to make sure you keep your clippers clean and operational.</li>
            <li> The clipper length attachments are easy to take on/off.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Instructions easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> Nice clippers with simple advice for getting a good cut</li>
            <li> hair is sort of strong and it won&#x27;t budge to some clippers,</li>
            <li> Nice quality for the price..Was given as a Christmas present and the person loved it..</li>
            <li> Great product and has been a major money saver.</li>
            <li> Good directions are enclosed with a book and pictures to help new users.</li>
            <li> Also has kept me from spending a lot of money and many too radical haircuts from ambitious or over confident haircuts</li>
            <li> job.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer attachments feel like cheap/flimsy plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics are fine.</li>
            <li> Cuts my boys hair just fine.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about nine years and worked perfectly until something holding the blades broke recently.</li>
            <li> Smooth cut and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Noise level is just fine.  </li>
            <li> I have always owened Wahl clippers so I bought these assuming they would meet my needs just fine.</li>
            <li> These clippers are holding up just fine</li>
            <li> On time delivery, product is fine.</li>
            <li> The model works good but is very loud.</li>
            <li> Not high end on power or closeness but a very good buy for the price.  </li>
            <li> Is easy to operate, not for professional use, but good for your house.</li>
            <li> Cut the hair evenly and easily and easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> It is a great product even though I&#x27;m kind of bummed about the little guy.</li>
            <li> Clippers make a grinding sound on 30% of starts.  </li>
            <li> I was so upset because they are such great quality clippers</li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product for personal all purpose use.</li>
            <li> Great product for personal all purpose use.</li>
            <li> actually this products is greaat so great</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cost much and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> The smaller clippers work great on the hairline and my beard plus being cordless is a bonus.</li>
            <li> , it felt cheap.</li>
            <li> but it just feels cheap.</li>
            <li> so I needed something cheap but to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Oil the clippers after each cut and have a fairly smooth experience with these.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use the battery-powered trimmer nearly as much as the big one, but both work great!</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This will pay for itself after the first 2 haircuts!!  </li>
            <li> It has been a very useful and has performed well.</li>
            <li> It, the large clipper, IS very easy to use...on someone else.</li>
            <li> I can quickly and easily cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> It was super easy to cut his hair</li>
            <li> I like the small one that comes with it the best.</li>
            <li> I saved more money than I paid for the kit on the first week</li>
            <li> Not only did I find a nice chrome of clippers but also chrome trimmers to boot all under $40 including shipping!  </li>
            <li> Not cutting!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for it&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> thing better would be complete wireless connectivity. ! ! ! !</li>
            <li> Great value, sharp and strong.  </li>
            <li> You really do get a lot for your money with this kit like two POWERFUL clippers, blade guards, brush, oil and a NICE travel bag that holds ALL items.</li>
            <li> Everything you need to give a haircut, easy to handle, and the right price.</li>
            <li> I love WAHL because its products are made in the USA and they have very high quality.</li>
            <li> The Conair had worked ok, but were very noisy</li>
            <li> The clippers cut perfectly and have no problem going through relatively thick hair.</li>
            <li> 1AA battery is clearly not enough to make it work good.</li>
            <li> Full set - everything you need to cut hair.  </li>
            <li> The indent on the top of the clippers does make it much easier to hold onto.</li>
            <li> They work good enough but they still pull hair.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, nice extra fittings.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, nice extra fittings.</li>
            <li> Its pretty easy to use...just take your time.  </li>
            <li> The blades have to be manually adjusted for a close cut but other than that,  its a great deal.</li>
            <li> Good weight , long enough electric cable, good value for price</li>
            <li> however the trimmers are not that good kind of dull.</li>
            <li> Luckily I kept mine.</li>
            <li> It cuts super well.</li>
            <li> Have used this brand for most of my life and they have all been the same - they just keep on clipping. . . :)</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was as stated.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> replaced my 10 yr old wahl clippers  great so far</li>
            <li> Besides the impressive heft, the vibration is well controlled and emits a relatively low, steady hum--not a high whine or rattle like cheaper plastic-framed clippers and trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does come with scissors ... but they are pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li> It cuts very evenly and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Great hair clippers but the little guy was s</li>
            <li> I always keep my hair short ever since I retired from the military and these are perfect for maintaining my hair that perfect high and tight!</li>
            <li> yes, the little one is loud, but both work great!  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how fast this came and the amazing quality of the razor.</li>
            <li> im giving it a way for free thank you so much it will help them start out in life  </li>
            <li> I bought the set strictly for the clippers anyway and rarely use the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It was worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have feel so much more solid and comfortable.</li>
            <li> These hair clippers are worth every cent.</li>
            <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It stop working had to buy a better professional one</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to have this one as a back up.</li>
            <li> I would give this clipper a 5 star but the on/off switch seems more cheaply made than the last one I had.  </li>
            <li> The Wahl clippers are well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product was well worth the price and the money.</li>
            <li> It has a strong motor, and comes a decent set of accessories.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price..</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money</li>
            <li> Product has replaced an 8 year old Wahl cutter that was working ok.  </li>
            <li> This Wahl recently purchased is a bit heavier and a little more bulky but the cut is very nice and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Taking kids to the barber shop is not easy or cheap and now he can give them good haircuts at home.</li>
            <li> The blades are really sharp, and the 8 guards are fantastic, I cut my own hair every week, and it never looks like I got or need a hair cut, now @ $10.00 a haircut that a savings of $520.00 a year.</li>
            <li> The delivery was right on time.  </li>
            <li> The price is just right for me.</li>
            <li> The new one definitely cuts better and more evenly.  </li>
            <li> Despite it&#x27;s size and the amount of items included it is a relatively clean kit that doesn&#x27;t require much juggling of the parts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and the various guides are easy to clip on and off.</li>
            <li> New one is lighter and works just fine.</li>
            <li> We are happy with it but not sure why there have to be 25 pieces.</li>
            <li> it came with a good bundle, i love the small trimmer too!!</li>
            <li> Only thing not included in the kit are batteries for the smaller clippers..still a great value.</li>
            <li> Its not the sellers fault, but when I got the clippers, you had to hit them for them to come on every time, but I return them, and got a full refund, these usually are some good clippers</li>
            <li> The bigger shaver works great and there are a ton of different plastic guides.</li>
            <li> Came to us quickly and works very well.  </li>
            <li> This is the second pair of wahl hair clippers that I have bought the first one was great, but that was a different model.</li>
            <li> as far as giving great looking professional hair cuts he was looking for a little more than these clippers could offer.</li>
            <li> Very much recommend this item.</li>
            <li> The wireless trimmer that is include is very cheap takes only one AA battery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After use, cleaning the inside does its job maintaining this equipment to top standard.</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply the oil that comes with the kit after use, preventing future rust.</li>
            <li> These clippers are my first pair ever.</li>
            <li> The are my first pair</li>
            <li> After the first couple haircuts it pays for it&#x27;s self.</li>
            <li> smaller clipper is excellent if you want your wife or girlfriend, or significant other to trim around your ears and back.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first set 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> My first Wahl was bought in 2008 when I started to shave myself.</li>
            <li> Boy was I pleased to discover it&#x27;s such an affordable piece of equipment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> construction is very sturdy, and the included attachments make trimming a cinch!</li>
            <li> Ive never buy Whal, to be the first item I bought from this brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and will last for many years.</li>
            <li> The touch up trimmer is pretty clutch as well.</li>
            <li> So many tools Included for the low price although I bought it At Wall-mart for 29$(plus taxes)</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Old pair shorted while overseas and these have more than filled the shoes of the prior.</li>
            <li> I did find that I had to go over his hair again to catch hairs that didn&#x27;t get cut the first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty noisy.</li>
            <li> The clippers don&#x27;t get hot after using them for a while.</li>
            <li> I wanted a higher quality and thought this would be it.  </li>
            <li> We bought this to replace a Wahl clipper that we had owned for 45 years.&lt;br /&gt;Since my husband is shiny on top, he decided to go with a buzz cut last year.</li>
            <li> Perfect choice for a casual beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with the Wahl brand as a quality product, but am surprised this has its name on it.  </li>
            <li> It was so easy to do, I just use the 4 guide for the sides and the back, the 5 guide for the crown and upper side edges, and the 6 guide to finish off the top.  </li>
            <li> Clippers are well made, quiet, good selection of guides for different hair lengths and side trimming, etc.</li>
            <li> There is nothing fancy about them, and they are a lot lighter than the ones that I&#x27;ve had in the past, but they are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Also the cape is very low quality, we just tossed ours and got a better, they don&#x27;t cost that much.  </li>
            <li> It was a cheap piece of junk that is probably only worth about $3</li>
            <li> Nice product , same exactly as my old one</li>
            <li> These clippers cut thru the hair like a hot knife thru butter and are very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is ok, but I had to wait for a long time for get this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just to clarify, mostly my praises going to main big clipper.</li>
            <li> The little trimmer that comes with it is very cheap feeling but does the job when you need a quick touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I liked this one because it has all the different sized clippers along with the right and left ear tapers.</li>
            <li> It includes 10 different sizes of guards so you can easily use it on yourself if you dont have anybody else around to cut your hair.</li>
            <li> This Kit was purchased as a backup to another Wahl kit that has been used for several years (and is going strong) in this household.  </li>
            <li> Take good care of it and it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> The large corded clipper works well.  </li>
            <li> Many multiple uses and works like brand new.</li>
            <li> She is very high on the WAHL brand.....</li>
            <li> I liked but the little machine does not work</li>
            <li> The clipper works just fine like my old Wahl set which was over 23yrs old.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit heavy but works great!</li>
            <li> Works great to cut my hair and my 9 year old son&#x27;s hair at least once a week.</li>
            <li> The combs can be properly tighten so it makes huge noise and always scares my son.</li>
            <li> For the price of $20 you cant really complain.</li>
            <li> Still was much cheaper than the one</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Works well and is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged, thank you.  </li>
            <li> absolutely junk with rubbish quality.</li>
            <li> going straight to the bin.</li>
            <li> For the money this is perfect for home hair cutting and trimming.  </li>
            <li> Buy with caution.&lt;br /&gt;Overall sturdy construction but the smaller clippers is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> so it really saves money and time</li>
            <li> and I have no complains about how my haircut looks, nothing different with barber shop results.t by sound</li>
            <li> so it really saves money and time</li>
            <li> Trimmers not so much.</li>
            <li> He normally uses Remington products, so this was the first Wahl he&#x27;s ever tried.</li>
            <li> This Wahl branded product is very noisy and adjusting it lessens the noise but decrease the hair clipping effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I use this to cut mine and my boy&#x27;s hair and it has worked very well.</li>
            <li> but I bought a beard trimmer that works very well for that</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These save me so much money, it&#x27;s unreal.</li>
            <li> Everything works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like these Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> The process is a real pain in the neck</li>
            <li> Expected a better cut from what I&#x27;m use to from wahl.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Francis.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair (short &amp; shaggy) as well as my friends and this grip prevents those occasional slips when my hand may get whet.  </li>
            <li> If I wanted good scissors, I expect to spend at least this much again.  </li>
            <li> smaller trimmer does not seem to be very powerful</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;m pleased and recommend I recommend it to other customers are very versatile and</li>
            <li> The motor is strong and cuts through my thick hair easily and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I am 57 yrs old with a special needs, 29 year old, son who does not like the barber shop.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for roughly 7 years now with Wahl clippers and overall, they are great and fairly cheap when you consider how much you&#x27;d be saving on haircuts.</li>
            <li> The small trimmer works great for trimming around his ears and back of neck.</li>
            <li> I use classic butch haircut (1/4&amp;#34; during summer, 1/2&amp;#34; during winter) and my hair grow really, really fast, so to keep them look neat</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make too much noise and it works decently.</li>
            <li> Lots of attachments for different length cuts and the small cordless trimmer is great.</li>
            <li> There are special taper guides for the ears, but I haven&#x27;t tried those yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller clipper is basically a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Hello thanks for the fast delivery, but why the clipper machine do very very loud noise???&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> But there is enough grip to have full control.</li>
            <li> the additional small trimmer is quite handy.  </li>
            <li> soon as you hold these clippers, you realize you&#x27;re holding a robustly built piece of equipment, exactly like a professional barber/stylist would use.</li>
            <li> silver finish is really slick and make cleaning off the clippers super easy.</li>
            <li> The additional smaller trimmers allow an even closer shave and quick trims in between cuts.</li>
            <li> In my non-professional opinion this set will stand up to the most expensive clipper sets out there for sure.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the set, would purchase another and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used an older beard trimmer for my neck and ear line</li>
            <li> The larger clippers are not that loud at all and run smoothly.</li>
            <li> Also, buy a decent hand mirror to trim up the neck (hardest part)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this because he dropped his older one and the blade broke.</li>
            <li> Basically pulls out the hair very loudly!</li>
            <li> It has pretty wide blade for touch-up trimmer and because of it it&#x27;s harder to use it around ears or temples to taper it nice.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> and I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is high quality.  </li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Although small machine is not very useful, the bigger machine is almost perfect.</li>
            <li> clippers alone have a built-in adjustable guard that varies the hair length from &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; to about a little more than a 1/4 in.</li>
            <li> The main clippers and even the smaller clippers are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The hair clippers I received where extremely loud when turn on and vibrated too much.</li>
            <li> It is a gift for a friend of mine and I am pleased about the kit, hope it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The mini trimmer is also useful for sideburns and back neck area touch ups.</li>
            <li> big savings, fun</li>
            <li> Everything is exactly as expected if not more, I was using a really cheap set originally and this upgrade was SO worth the $$.  </li>
            <li> High quality and design are evident and will last for years!</li>
            <li> does not show me absolutely new</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone needing a new pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> I decided to get a new one</li>
            <li> And needs new clippers.</li>
            <li> The blades are pretty harsh directly on the skin you&#x27;re trying to clean up.</li>
            <li> Otherwise they are exactly the same, and they are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a professional caliber clipper set, this is it!  </li>
            <li> Think of my safety first, I went back with Wahl.</li>
            <li> Everything was cut pretty evenly and the only difficulty I had was dealing with my sideburns/ears.</li>
            <li> I am going to request a replacement for the small unit, and if this request is processed appropriately, I will increase my rating.</li>
            <li> Feel the same as many of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Love the small trimmer that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second pair - my first pair lasted 3 years with 0 oil.</li>
            <li> Costco sells the exact same clippers but with batteries for $30.</li>
            <li> I think trimmer would really benefit from better power sourse, may be 2 batteries, but they wanted to make it very small rather than efficient.</li>
            <li> I think trimmer would really benefit from better power sourse, may be 2 batteries, but they wanted to make it very small rather than efficient.</li>
            <li> I received this combo kit in early December;  the large AC-powered unit works great;  unfortunately, the smaller trimmer worked a couple of times and then stopped working.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that the smaller trimmer runs on a single AA battery and it drains super quick.</li>
            <li> There is a loud clicking noise when they first start, but after that they are quiet.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s about the same model , more money and less attachments .</li>
            <li> One day I&#x27;m going to be bold enough to actually cut my hair with this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are sharp, cut very well and are pretty well built.</li>
            <li> We bought this set to replace a much older one and the quality improvement is apparent.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a heavy-duty trimmer that comes as a complete set with all the shields and a full complement of other accessories (scissors, mini-trimmer,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a minimal investment and worth your money pretty much the second or third time you use them.</li>
            <li> Two regular haircombs included are very cheap and narrow, you can use them</li>
            <li> so I just use one guard and shave his whole head the same length.</li>
            <li> and we have not had this problem so far.</li>
            <li> but I like the clippers and the beard trimmer so far.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for my 25 year old Wahl -</li>
            <li> These clippers work as advertised so far.  </li>
            <li> I had no trouble with it getting overheated.  </li>
            <li> Got them for my husband and he can use them on our 6year old</li>
            <li> I gave my self a professional looking haircut with it</li>
            <li> It has a lot of different options when it comes to what size he wants for his cut.</li>
            <li> Had an old Wahl that have used for over 15 years, still works but decided it was time for an upgrade.</li>
            <li> Professional quality.</li>
            <li> My old clippers died and I got these.</li>
            <li> but they are 5 years old</li>
            <li> With these clippers you get a professional cut.  </li>
            <li> and professional.</li>
            <li> The clipper itself feels very well built and solid.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is light, but not cheap and runs on 1 AA battery.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s Who Concert loud</li>
            <li> then there&#x27;s this trimmer loud...</li>
            <li> So far I had no issue with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is so expensive in stores, but it&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
            <li> It certainly ain&#x27;t having trouble with the ladies;)</li>
            <li> the best thing of this product is that it contain a small size shaver which can cut off some difficult rim for the complete size shaver</li>
            <li> The shields snap securely onto the clippers and are sufficiently stiff that they are not likely to bend or break under normal use.</li>
            <li> Procuring my own pair of clippers as opposed to relying on scissors and razors has made cutting my friend&#x27;s hair so much easier (and faster)!</li>
            <li> main (big) clipper exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Wahl clipper is good but the small one is waste of inclusion..</li>
            <li> Clippers work good but seem a little dull at times.  </li>
            <li> The new detail clippers only require one AA battery.</li>
            <li> Though, I appreciate that it&#x27;s battery operated so you can just install a new battery in a second and use it again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Though, I appreciate that it&#x27;s battery operated so you can just install a new battery in a second and use it again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is important because cheaply made shields can bend and result in an uneven cut, or worse, can break suddenly and allow the blade to cut much deeper into the hair.</li>
            <li> you can find it for around $30 or less, it&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li> The only negative (if you can call it that) is that there are too many pieces in the kit.</li>
            <li> The clipper was really very loud and make big noise in my house.</li>
            <li> We have 3 other clippers and they all get hot.  </li>
            <li> The small clippers are great for neckline and behind the ears.  </li>
            <li> My old clippers had a smaller one for doing detail trimming and required two AA batteries.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Wahl clipper set this household has owned and used since the early 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for a 10 year old Wahl that had finally died.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working well and have no regrets.</li>
            <li> the quality I expected thanks</li>
            <li> Wahl 79524-5201 Chrome Pro 25 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit is a solid clipper.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think its professional enough...</li>
            <li> The set is complete with every guard possible, plus a wrap to keep hair off of yourself.</li>
            <li> Ill never use, but nice to have.</li>
            <li> The blade was not very sharp and tugs on your skin causing scratches.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp at all.</li>
            <li> This device is really useful for hair cutting,  with a  lot os acessories and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The small one runs out of batteries quickly</li>
            <li> Very sturdy feeling and sharp set up clippers.</li>
            <li> Have used it twice so far and since it was the same as my last set</li>
            <li> The set has all the sizes that I want and some extra good ones from cutting around the ear.</li>
            <li> yes it is a little loud but not as loud as my OLD norelco</li>
            <li> It has several combs for different lengths and the little trimmer is useful.  </li>
            <li> The little clipper seems to work OK for small trim jobs so all in all</li>
            <li> Scissors are cheapy again, they would work for some time, but handles are narrow and uncomfortable and they give kinda light and cheap feeling, $3 scissors from local store</li>
            <li> These clippers are quite strong on thick hair and is not very noisy.  </li>
            <li> I have used them a few times each month for more than a year and have had no issues other than one guard cracking slightly.</li>
            <li> Everything is good but the battery clipper is bad cause</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair cutting machine.</li>
            <li> but he does an amazing job cutting hair.</li>
            <li> NOT VERY SHARP FOR GREY HAIR...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend the Norelco Body Groomer if you&#x27;re planning on using this little guy for any sort of extensive clean-up work.</li>
            <li> Works well and the wife was wanting a new complete kit after dealing with 2 partial kits for the last few years.</li>
            <li> I also needed something that was easy enough to figure out for a non-professional salon stylist, since my wife is cutting my hair and she&#x27;s never cut hair professionally.</li>
            <li> has been using them for years and say they last a long time.......</li>
            <li> I was surprised the only thing I would say the beard trimmers should be a little sharper</li>
            <li> I was procrastinating the very thought of having two purchase new hair clippers simply because they&#x27;re simply too expensive thru the retail stores.  </li>
            <li> unit is more complicated and heavier than expected</li>
            <li> It is powered by a single AA battery and does not last at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a bad product, because my father has the exact same pair with the exact same problem.</li>
            <li> I like this set because it is very comfortable and convenient when it includes instruction and everything we need for cutting hair</li>
            <li> They work and do the job a little loud and seam a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> cutting shields are appropriately sized to cover all lengths from 1/8\\&quot; up to 1\\&quot; (in 1/8-inch increments).</li>
            <li> I upgraded to these when I was cutting more then just my son&#x27;s hair (I&#x27;m not a professional and do not claim to be)</li>
            <li> I am not a professional stylist by any means</li>
            <li> The cape is not as heavy duty as the old one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve to revert to using my professional clippers since this one is a waste of time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;re 2 curved long clips included and I have no ideas what you&#x27;d use it for unless you have really long shoulder length hair, but then you probably wouldn&#x27;t use clippers, right?&lt;br /&gt;Little battery operated trimmer included in this set doesn&#x27;t deserve anymore than 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> Maybe a long time.</li>
            <li> Such as expected.</li>
            <li> Not professional grade</li>
            <li> It should have been long range of 110V - 240V.</li>
            <li> For the price, I should have made this change long ago.  </li>
            <li> I needed a hair trimmer that was easy to use and versatile enough for doing all the detail work involved in cutting hair.</li>
            <li> I have several professional clippers, and this clipper is just not very good.  </li>
            <li> The main unit cuts unevenly and is extremely heavy, while the smaller unit does not work at all.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed considering my last clippers which were also this brand were great ..</li>
            <li> I recommend saving your money and buying a little more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I wish the attachments were interchangeable for the smaller clipper and other Wahl trimming products.</li>
            <li> seriously though, this set comes with absolutely everything.</li>
            <li> Simply turn it off for a few seconds, turn it back on, and it should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The included mini-trimmer runs on a single \\&quot;AA\\&quot; battery.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, it will kick into a very loud buzzying, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to long duration usage.</li>
            <li> Not like the barbers usually use, this are too loud.</li>
            <li> Same issues with the little beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> The little one is no match for the plug in Peanut version, and doesn&#x27;t have enough power.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft case, and would like a hard case.</li>
            <li> The old clipper was dull and not up to the job at all</li>
            <li> It hardly picks up enough speed to cut any hair, especially along the neckline.</li>
            <li> It trims as expected.</li>
            <li> Feels heavy and solid - and is made in the US which is a rarity these days.</li>
            <li> Received them faster than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Not really a problem</li>
            <li> It was everything that I expected.</li>
            <li> Not just a few, it pulls at my hair the entire time I use the clippers.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> THE CUT IS NOT VERY CLOSE</li>
            <li> It will also be louder than any other plug-in tool in the house.</li>
            <li> I would keep looking at other cutters/trimmers.</li>
            <li> The blades our sharp and the case is convenient.</li>
            <li> My other Wahl clipper needed to be replaced after 10 years and 2 people using it every week.</li>
            <li> is loosing its sharp on the blade after almost 5 to 6 months</li>
            <li> (DOES NOT WORK),,,I AM RETURNING THE SMALL HAIR CUTTER ONLY,,, FOR A REPLACEMENT.,,,,,,,,THANK</li>
            <li> It makes for an extremely aggrivating experience.</li>
            <li> Looked at other clippers but these took my eye.  </li>
            <li> I had my son use the small clippers to finish off my neck area and back hairline.  </li>
            <li> However, search for the same thing without the small trimmer.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> This hair clipper works very well, which makes my time cutting hair extensively</li>
            <li> the little one was not strong enough to remove air let alone hair.</li>
            <li> The small one is a little noisy though, and I&#x27;m not sure how long the single batter will last in it.</li>
            <li> Clean cutting with little pulling.  </li>
            <li> My previous clippers were Wahl also, the motor went out on my previous, but Wahls tend to last forever with very little maintenance.  </li>
            <li> and I only cut hair from time to time, always males and only short / medium length fades, so I am no means an expert when it comes to cutting hair with clippers.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the working voltage is 110V, not a dynamic 110-220V, may be inconvenient when travelling outside USA.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It has multiple trimming lengths cuts through his thick beard without any problems.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/ Other than that, it was fine.</li>
            <li> My Philips Norelco shaver has a trimmer built in the back, and I also have a small Remington hair/beard trimmer, so this Wahl trimmer ends up being redundant and less versatile.</li>
            <li> It has run down the battery twice, but we&#x27;ve used it quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> not what I expected!!</li>
            <li> I mean I get the same haircut every time, a 4, 5, and 6 guide.  </li>
            <li> It would not maintain constant speed and it&#x27;s just made very poorly, not to mention the blades have rusted very badly since I last used it.</li>
            <li> Blades stay sharp (oil it after every few uses).</li>
            <li> They seem bulkier than previous Wahls that I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> Paid twice the price for half the produce before</li>
            <li> This one is well made and quieter than our previous model.</li>
            <li> The package also came with no instructions or warranty papers, that led me to think this item had been used and return previously.</li>
            <li> I had a Wahl previously but with out the goodies.</li>
            <li> I did try some other less expensive brands but they were not nearly the same quality.</li>
            <li> We paid for them pretty quickly by cutting the kids&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> Might be because this was my first time cutting hair or the razor.</li>
            <li> but it seems the body of the unit has been made a little cheaper  than previous models I have owned.</li>
            <li> right and left ear taper guards, instructions on cutting hair, and a thin plastic cover to keep the clippings off your neck and shoulders)</li>
            <li> its hard to tell when you first buy an item.. if something goes wrong i will update my comment</li>
            <li> We have had other clippers in the past that tug on his hair</li>
            <li> The motor is weak and I have to go over the same spots repeatedly because it misses patches of my hair.</li>
            <li> THE WAHL HAIRCUTTING CUTTER IS (FINE),,,THE LITTLE BATTERY DRVEN HAIR CUTTER  </li>
            <li> These Clippers leave little hair sticking up and do not cut evenly.</li>
            <li> The little shaver turned on once and immediately died.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, just at a little oil</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the little one yet.  </li>
            <li> The only minor negatives are that the case is not really set up to organize the various clipper attachments and they generally fall out all over the place inside it and that after cutting the blades can develop small dark spots in between the cutting edges if they are not cleaned thoroughly after each use</li>
            <li> i have to look for a voltage step down!</li>
            <li> I wasted my money this time around.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel as heavy as the Andis or Oster brands, in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> The mini one is a waste of time.  </li>
            <li> Using them for a few months now and don&#x27;t imagine</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending $20 every 3 weeks to get a haircut at Supercuts when all they were doing was using a clipper at the same length all the way around.</li>
            <li> A few of my pals have these trimmers, and I always just sort of assumed they were like a $75 kit.</li>
            <li> when i retired a few years ago i became unwilling to try to figure out and mesh my semi-retired long-time hair stylist&#x27;s availability / schedule with mine.  </li>
            <li> i bought another pair and with prime it was in our home in a few days, no delivery</li>
            <li> Now after a few cuts, it intermittently causes it to stop moving and when that happens, it rips your hair out if you&#x27;re mid-stroke trying to cut your hair.</li>
            <li> very poor quality parts, extremely noise, over heating, unusable even if you just open the box.</li>
            <li> and you had to cut slowly because they would clog up and bog down the motor.</li>
            <li> Even with a THICK beard, it NEVER boggs down or pull my hairs.</li>
            <li> Also the adjustment lever on the side is big and makes it hard to trim close behind eats.  </li>
            <li> He usually likes to keep it at level 1.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with a Wahl, its well made and it will last years.</li>
            <li> I chose this kit one since it also includes a small machine.</li>
            <li> Im not really sure what circumstances would arise to make that happen, but these are not the clippers to use in that situation.</li>
            <li> The added small trimmer was the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> Small clipper pulls hair way too often.</li>
            <li> Made in USA (note, the small trimmers are from China).  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a basic set you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy the razor that doesn&#x27;t come with the small thing.</li>
            <li> but they leave tons of small hairs sticking up that don&#x27;t get cut.</li>
            <li> clippers belong in the trash, i&#x27;m not sure how they managed to get a 4.5 star rating.</li>
            <li> The extra touch-up trimmer is all but useless.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, the tiny clippers were already broken, there goes the lifetime warranty already!</li>
            <li> No more waiting in hair salons.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable noise, sounds like a lawn mower</li>
            <li> I am a male 45 years old, and was sick and tired of paying anywhere from $12 to $18 for a haircut plus tip.  </li>
            <li> It is very heavy as well.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed  with this, The clipper is extremely loud, when adjusted it barely cuts close.</li>
            <li> They are well within warranty and Wahl stood by their product and were very helpful for a return, but I was extremely disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> The portable mini clipper is a little weak.</li>
            <li> this sort of quality would be hard to find even in Africa.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;i used to cut my poodle&#x27;s hair, how hard can it</li>
            <li> You would have to press ridiculously hard to deform or break them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about my Wahl clipper set.</li>
            <li> I have to clip them at least every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Taking back to cutting my hair to save money from going to the hair stylist.</li>
            <li> I use it at least 30 times per year,</li>
            <li> Works well even with son&#x27;s thick hair and beard, use for both with no problems</li>
            <li> The trimmer on the other hand is almost useless.</li>
            <li> I mean you can kill it in a matter of a couple trims.</li>
            <li> The small clippers are a bit weak though.</li>
            <li> The battery trimmer is useless and the shears are too sharp for a close trim.</li>
            <li> The small one uses battery and it is weak.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that the unit does not have all of the clipper settings, no half setting.</li>
            <li> Little trimmer died after one use.&lt;br /&gt;Big trimmer does mediocre</li>
            <li> but not good</li>
            <li> The unit actually pulls your hair instead of cutting it which is rather unfortunate considering the price.</li>
            <li> My husband and son have used it at least 4 times!  </li>
            <li> These people keep on cutting in cost and giving you less for you money .</li>
            <li> works great-entire set is a little awkward though.</li>
            <li> The combs are cheap and the clippers did a terrible job at cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> My beard/body hair trimmer had recently broken after 4 years of use, so this was to replace it and use to cut hair.  </li>
            <li> power button is unnecessarily designed and makes it finicky to turn off and on.</li>
            <li> They stand behind their product and DELIVER on customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> The trimmer that came with it was broken.</li>
            <li> People say the mini trimmer doesn&#x27;t work well, but after receiving mine and having it work poorly, I fiddled with it and got the battery to make a stronger connection to the trimmer</li>
            <li> I wear my hair shorter now (almost buzz cut) and like others here was tired of paying $12-15 every time I needed a haircut -</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re not great at cleaning up the excess hair after you set the lining.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is even worse.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the amount of money I spent, on the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst set I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> Its also very weak since it is battery operated.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, never head to the barbershop again!</li>
            <li> It looks and feels expensive.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with Wahl.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with a Wahl.</li>
            <li> Within three uses, It has become practically useless.</li>
            <li> WE THOUGTH WERE VERY THIN YOU CAN SEE THREW THEM ?</li>
            <li> It was annoying to go to barber shops so often – not to mention unpleasant $10-12 waste every time, it also takes time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my friend&#x27;s hair (with scissors and razors) for years.</li>
            <li> I am not an expert in cutting hairs and neither have used the trimmers before for hair cutting.</li>
            <li> so when i bought a set of these and told my wife she was going to be cutting my hair from then-</li>
            <li> and I knew it within 5 minutes of cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> The issue is that all the neighborhood will know you are cutting hair ,  </li>
            <li> I have been cutting my hair with this set for over 5 years now and these do not skip a beat.</li>
            <li> the machine is bad, does not work</li>
            <li> I might have just gotten a bad one but feeling and looking how it is made (plastic)</li>
            <li> But still not to bad</li>
            <li> Does not come with a neck brush :(</li>
            <li> Wish I would have tried these out before my 30 day return period was over :(</li>
            <li> :( will never buy them again..</li>
            <li> The housing isn&#x27;t metal but chromed plastic and the adjustment lever hits the housing also.  :(  </li>
            <li> Came with guidelines for cutting too!</li>
            <li> ,i dont want it,so i make return,because this haircutting just for my son,he hate it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if maybe I got a bad set of clippers when I bought these, but they were horrible.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another Wahl product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!  </li>
            <li> They are horrible and have no power.</li>
            <li> They are terrible!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this clipper!</li>
            <li> However, the product itself is terrible.</li>
            <li> am very mad that I purchased this!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice clippers with simple advice for getting a good cut</li>
            <li> Useing it to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> It this my second clippers the first one was nice but this clippers are by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have used this alot and love it</li>
            <li> We are saving lots of money with this product. Is easy to operate, not for professional use, but good for your house.</li>
            <li> My husband works in a correctional facility so he has to keep his hair short. We use these clippers to cut his hair about every 2 weeks. I am not a hairstylist so I just use one guard and shave his whole head the same length. He usually likes to keep it at level 1. We have had other clippers in the past that tug on his hair and we have not had this problem so far. You do have to keep the razor oiled so that it doesn&#x27;t get cut in your hair. It cuts very evenly and it is easy to use. This was a good value and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The blades are really sharp, and the 8 guards are fantastic, I cut my own hair every week, and it never looks like I got or need a hair cut, now @ $10.00 a haircut that a savings of $520.00 a year. Dennis.</li>
            <li> It, the large clipper, IS very easy to use...on someone else. Be prepared to draw blood if it&#x27;s a one person operation. It will also be louder than any other plug-in tool in the house. That is assuming your skilsaw is in the garage.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers to replace a Conair pair that I had bought in a store. The Conair had worked ok, but were very noisy and you had to cut slowly because they would clog up and bog down the motor. These clippers cut thru the hair like a hot knife thru butter and are very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with plenty of attachments, most of which I will never use. The main clippers and even the smaller clippers are well worth the price. My old clippers had a smaller one for doing detail trimming and required two AA batteries. The new detail clippers only require one AA battery.</li>
            <li> Product was with all the pieces as it was described.</li>
            <li> Great product and has been a major money saver.</li>
            <li> Had a whal for 10 years prior and it needed replacement so I bought another one and it broke within 3 months so I got this one. We will see how it holds up but I like the clippers and the beard trimmer so far.</li>
            <li> I was wondering if these clippers would be quality given the price. They are great. Just make sure you oil the blade after each use.</li>
            <li> Hello thanks for the fast delivery, but why the clipper machine do very very loud noise???&lt;br /&gt;also does not show me absolutely new has hit!!what can I do now?</li>
            <li> Everything is good but the battery clipper is bad cause no charging just 1 battery</li>
            <li> It has been a very useful and has performed well. Use it several times a month for family haircuts. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed  with this, The clipper is extremely loud, when adjusted it barely cuts close. The trimmer does not give a cut any closer than the clipper. The trimmer does not give defined lines for marking. I wasted my money this time around.</li>
            <li> nice hair cutting kit incl a trimmer too. Nice carrying case and quality blades.... saving some dollars by using this Machine every 2 months.....</li>
            <li> Forget battery-powered beard trimmers, this thing is so much better and easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers alone have a built-in adjustable guard that varies the hair length from &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; to about a little more than a 1/4 in. For beard trimming (for the 3/4-day stubble look, I set the guard to it&#x27;s longest setting and just buzz away. Then reduce it to about 1/2 it&#x27;s length for the mustache area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I&#x27;ll throw on the No. 1 guard and trim up my sideburns as well. One day I&#x27;m going to be bold enough to actually cut my hair with this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The silver finish is really slick and make cleaning off the clippers super easy. But there is enough grip to have full control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many hair clippers through the years and this one is the best I&#x27;ve owned. Many multiple uses and works like brand new.</li>
            <li> The clipper was really very loud and make big noise in my house.</li>
            <li> They are alright kinda get what you pay for. They work and do the job a little loud and seam a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> The product is ok, but I had to wait for a long time for get this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like and am satisfied</li>
            <li> Works well even with son&#x27;s thick hair and beard, use for both with no problems</li>
            <li> This hair clipper works very well, which makes my time cutting hair extensively short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is sort of strong and it won&#x27;t budge to some clippers, however this one cuts like pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use, cleaning the inside does its job maintaining this equipment to top standard. Make sure you apply the oil that comes with the kit after use, preventing future rust.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy at a good price</li>
            <li> Top line clippers and a lot cheaper than Walmart.</li>
            <li> Great clippers. Doesn&#x27;t snag at all. Good build quality.</li>
            <li> It was everything my boyfriend wanted. Everything you need to give a haircut, easy to handle, and the right price.</li>
            <li> I have used WAHL clippers for 20 years.  This product cuts well but is buggy.  Clippers make a grinding sound on 30% of starts.  Must tighten to eliminate noise.</li>
            <li> The clippers are actually really good. They are sharp, cut very well and are pretty well built. The trimmer on the other hand is almost useless. It is powered by a single AA battery and does not last at all. I mean you can kill it in a matter of a couple trims. Its also very weak since it is battery operated. For the price of $20 you cant really complain. I bought the set strictly for the clippers anyway and rarely use the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The model works good but is very loud. I like the small one that comes with it the best. And is battery powered not that plug it in to recharge it. Still was much cheaper than the one it the school, of the same thing.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying used clippers but this does not say anywhere that they are used. When I opened the package there was hair in both clippers and on the white sheet. Glad I checked before I used them or I may have given myself something using a contaminated product.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas present from wife.  My beard/body hair trimmer had recently broken after 4 years of use, so this was to replace it and use to cut hair.  I put a battery in the trimmer and it broke immediately upon getting some hair into it.  I am familiar with the Wahl brand as a quality product, but am surprised this has its name on it.  I would keep looking at other cutters/trimmers.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! It works awesome and the kit came with everything I needed! Great deal on a great product.</li>
            <li> Works great! Brand new and perfect condition!</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with a Wahl, its well made and it will last years. My last one did. Thanks.</li>
            <li> These clippers are my first pair ever. They don&#x27;t feel as heavy as the Andis or Oster brands, in my humble opinion. I&#x27;ve been cutting my friend&#x27;s hair (with scissors and razors) for years. Procuring my own pair of clippers as opposed to relying on scissors and razors has made cutting my friend&#x27;s hair so much easier (and faster)! So far, I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about my Wahl clipper set. The are my first pair and I&#x27;m glad they came with everything I needed.</li>
            <li> Works well and is very affordable. After the first couple haircuts it pays for it&#x27;s self. Was very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> These clippers are good I was surprised the only thing I would say the beard trimmers should be a little sharper I am so happy</li>
            <li> The smaller kit was DOA, don&#x27;t pay for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t do bald!! Smallest is a clipper 1 think 1/8 of inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise ok.</li>
            <li> I use this on my dogs.  It does a great job.</li>
            <li> This kit is a good quality one for a good price. The clippers cut perfectly and have no problem going through relatively thick hair. The clippers have a noticeable weight to them which might deter some people but I prefer. The only minor negatives are that the case is not really set up to organize the various clipper attachments and they generally fall out all over the place inside it and that after cutting the blades can develop small dark spots in between the cutting edges if they are not cleaned thoroughly after each use</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for my 25 year old Wahl - so I can send my blades out for sharpening. The new model has a nice silicone (I think) pad which is a great safety grip feature. I cut my own hair (short &amp; shaggy) as well as my friends and this grip prevents those occasional slips when my hand may get whet.  Wahl has been my choice for over 40 years for its durability and ease of use. Also has kept me from spending a lot of money and many too radical haircuts from ambitious or over confident haircuts I couldn&#x27;t wait to grow out.  Very well packaged, thank you.  Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Have been having my lovely wife cut my hair for years and she loves these. I can&#x27;t say too much about them except they give a good cot and they don&#x27;t cut me (LOL)</li>
            <li> Well constructed, easy to use.  A quality product.  Owner&#x27;s manual has very good instructions.  Glad I made the purchase.  AAA+</li>
            <li> Very sturdy feeling and sharp set up clippers. Also the accessories are great and useful. Overall great deal and awesome product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchase this product in Amazone.com, when i&#x27;received it i&#x27;ve just realise that the Power supply it&#x27;s 110V. In my country West Africa we are using 220V &amp;#34;...problem i&#x27;may need a transformer for using it &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Got it and wife has used it to manage my hair. It was worth the cost.</li>
            <li> They get the job done well!! Definately worth the money. The small clippers are a bit weak though. Does not come with a neck brush :(</li>
            <li> Clippers are well made, quiet, good selection of guides for different hair lengths and side trimming, etc. smaller clipper is excellent if you want your wife or girlfriend, or significant other to trim around your ears and back.</li>
            <li> It provied a lot of kit. They are useful.&lt;br /&gt;It helps cut hair by my self.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good price and preforamance.</li>
            <li> Clippers work good but seem a little dull at times.  They seem bulkier than previous Wahls that I&#x27;ve had.  Also the adjustment lever on the side is big and makes it hard to trim close behind eats.  The mini one is a waste of time.  Basically pulls out the hair very loudly!</li>
            <li> good for the price and durable performance buy if you dont have more money to buy a professional one bye</li>
            <li> I use trimmers to shave my head and these just don&#x27;t cut it *rimshot*. The motor is weak and I have to go over the same spots repeatedly because it misses patches of my hair. I&#x27;d use it as a last resort, but it&#x27;s a pain in the ass. Same issues with the little beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Cuts very good. It doesnt switch our breaker. The blades our sharp and the case is convenient. The additional smaller trimmers allow an even closer shave and quick trims in between cuts.</li>
            <li> For those of us with no training these clippers work amazingly well.</li>
            <li> It was a gift. My son loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product. One might think &amp;#34;Well they must be crappy if you had to buy them twice...&amp;#34; NOPE! I purchased my first set 3 years ago. I recently traveled to Brazil and I accidentally left the clippers out next to the sink at the in-laws out and they rusted over. I was so upset because they are such great quality clippers, that I bought the same set again. My only criticism is that they took the mirror out of the set. Luckily I kept mine. Otherwise they are exactly the same, and they are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> It trims as expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for the price.  Not a Walmart special!</li>
            <li> Have used this on kids to trim their hairs. I am not an expert in cutting hairs and neither have used the trimmers before for hair cutting. But this product has impressed me so far.</li>
            <li> Saving money!!  I use this to cut my husband and son&#x27;s hair.  Works great, easy to use.  Lots of features!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a professional caliber clipper set, this is it!  I have used several different types of clippers over the years and this is the nicest set that I have ever owned.  I am not a professional stylist by any means and I only cut hair from time to time, always males and only short / medium length fades, so I am no means an expert when it comes to cutting hair with clippers.  In my non-professional opinion this set will stand up to the most expensive clipper sets out there for sure.</li>
            <li> These clippers work as advertised so far.  The small one is a little noisy though, and I&#x27;m not sure how long the single batter will last in it.</li>
            <li> Just received for my son and the s-trimmer don&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;waste of money..i wonder if this is another product from china??&lt;br /&gt;cheap but not good</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!  I purchased these to give my son and husband haircuts in the summer ... They are horrible and have no power. Very disappointed considering my last clippers which were also this brand were great .. And lasted for years.  Wish I would have tried these out before my 30 day return period was over :(</li>
            <li> absolutely junk with rubbish quality. very poor quality parts, extremely noise, over heating, unusable even if you just open the box. going straight to the bin. this sort of quality would be hard to find even in Africa.</li>
            <li> This Kit was purchased as a backup to another Wahl kit that has been used for several years (and is going strong) in this household.  Only time will tell if it has the endurance of the &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; kit.  This is the 3rd Wahl clipper set this household has owned and used since the early 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Probably my 3rd Wahl clipper in 15 years. My previous clippers were Wahl also, the motor went out on my previous, but Wahls tend to last forever with very little maintenance.  Blades stay sharp (oil it after every few uses).</li>
            <li> It is a gift for a friend of mine and I am pleased about the kit, hope it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this trimmer. It has multiple trimming lengths cuts through his thick beard without any problems. It noticibly reduced his trimming time compared to the trimmer he had been using. The small trimmer works great for trimming around his ears and back of neck.</li>
            <li> One of the best I have ever had, the mini razor makes it very nice.  Very much recommend this item.</li>
            <li> My first Wahl was bought in 2008 when I started to shave myself. This kit is my third one. I got this clipper this August in Louisiana. It&#x27;s a good product. I love WAHL because its products are made in the USA and they have very high quality. One time I switched to Conair because it was cheaper. However, I got what I paid for. My Conair just last for 3 months. Think of my safety first, I went back with Wahl.</li>
            <li> the machine is bad, does not work so I want the return of my money or failing reintegrate me my product.</li>
            <li> We bought this to cut our kid&#x27;s hair. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The machine is very nice</li>
            <li> It cuts super well. I am so glad I bought this. I would recommend this to anyone needing a new pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Smooth. Comes in Great organizing kit.</li>
            <li> For the money this is perfect for home hair cutting and trimming.  Feels heavy and solid - and is made in the US which is a rarity these days.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality!  Son n law loves it and said it what he wanted and works great.  He is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, never head to the barbershop again! Using them for a few months now and don&#x27;t imagine I will ever but a different brand. Shipper was prompt! Received them faster than I had expected. 5 star service! 5 star product. Paid twice the price for half the produce before and I will never do that again!</li>
            <li> Good set of clippers , Price is ok !</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  This was my second one which I gave as a gift to my friend.  Reliable, easy to use.  Exceptional service and delivery.  Thank you A+</li>
            <li> My friend recommended Wahl Haircutting Machine. I chose this kit one since it also includes a small machine. Although small machine is not very useful, the bigger machine is almost perfect. I have already recommended this kit to my friends. Do not hesisate, buy one!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Wahl haircutting kit to replace one that I have had for 40 years. The blades finally did not line up after dropping it a couple times. This Wahl recently purchased is a bit heavier and a little more bulky but the cut is very nice and comfortable.</li>
            <li> works great and very easy to use. Cut the hair evenly and easily and easy to clean as well. Good purchase!</li>
            <li> Set included everything i needed to keep well groomed.  The clippers are great.  Only thing not included in the kit are batteries for the smaller clippers..still a great value.</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers I have ordered yet. I am 57 yrs old with a special needs, 29 year old, son who does not like the barber shop. Thank you again Wahl</li>
            <li> It cuts hair like its supposed to!&lt;br /&gt;Great haircutting kit for the price. It includes 10 different sizes of guards so you can easily use it on yourself if you dont have anybody else around to cut your hair. Like me. For the last 12 years.&lt;br /&gt;The power button is unnecessarily designed and makes it finicky to turn off and on. Not really a problem unless, say,  you had to shave the head of the president in the next 12 seconds or else the planet would blow up. Im not really sure what circumstances would arise to make that happen, but these are not the clippers to use in that situation. Buy with caution.&lt;br /&gt;Overall sturdy construction but the smaller clippers is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Little trimmer died after one use.&lt;br /&gt;Big trimmer does mediocre job.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer attachments feel like cheap/flimsy plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics are fine.</li>
            <li> Have used it twice so far and since it was the same as my last set and I expect it to be just as good.  Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for my boy friend. He uses it all the time he just doesn&#x27;t like the trimmer because it&#x27;s Battery powered.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clipper for someone else and she loves it...... She is very high on the WAHL brand.....has been using them for years and say they last a long time.......</li>
            <li> Got for husband bday and he seems to like I a lot.  So far so good everything works great. Buy</li>
            <li> I had never used hair trimmers before, but I thought I would try them so my grandfather didn&#x27;t have to get out this winter.  These are so easy to use.  Very easy to hold and control.  There is a loud clicking noise when they first start, but after that they are quiet.  I had no trouble with it getting overheated.  Excellent bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> We have 3 other clippers and they all get hot.  I have a Wahl at home so I ordered this one and everyone is happy that their necks are not getting burned now.</li>
            <li> Great product for personal all purpose use. Easy to use, nice extra fittings. Great product for personal all purpose use. Easy to use, nice extra fittings.</li>
            <li> I order these clippers as a Christmas of 2013 gift for my father and he loved them and I have two bots and a nephew and he uses them to cut there hair and it works like they visit a barber shop. I will buy here again fast shipping as well great customer service. I&#x27;m happy, Thanks :)</li>
            <li> Awesome! I love it! Thanks</li>
            <li> We bought this set to replace a much older one and the quality improvement is apparent.  The cape is not as heavy duty as the old one but there are more attachments and the additional small trimmer is quite handy.  We are very pleased.</li>
            <li> It was everything that I expected. But it was w gift for someone</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have several professional clippers, and this clipper is just not very good.  I bought this item to use on my son, and he complains every time I use it. It pulls his hair, and the power cord doesn&#x27;t appear to be very sturdy for everyday use. I&#x27;ve to revert to using my professional clippers since this one is a waste of time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> I bought this set in Walmart almost 2 years ago and still love it! I use classic butch haircut (1/4&amp;#34; during summer, 1/2&amp;#34; during winter) and my hair grow really, really fast, so to keep them look neat I have to clip them at least every 3-4 weeks. It was annoying to go to barber shops so often – not to mention unpleasant $10-12 waste every time, it also takes time. Once I tried these clippers I never went back to any haircut places. It&#x27;s so easy to use and takes like 10-15 minutes to do my haircut at home. I can&#x27;t taper back of my neck myself so I need help of my wife with it, but I see how somebody with better hands coordination and a couple of mirrors could do it himself after some practice. Since I bought this set it saved me almost $100 and keep counting! Just to clarify, mostly my praises going to main big clipper. It works great – powerful, precise, smooth, never jams, easy to adjust. Many of the accessories in this kit are just penny-worth fillers and it&#x27;s obvious. Two regular haircombs included are very cheap and narrow, you can use them but I doubt you don&#x27;t have better one at home, I&#x27;ve seen better ones in Dollar Tree. Scissors are cheapy again, they would work for some time, but handles are narrow and uncomfortable and they give kinda light and cheap feeling, $3 scissors from local store I have feel so much more solid and comfortable. There&#x27;re 2 curved long clips included and I have no ideas what you&#x27;d use it for unless you have really long shoulder length hair, but then you probably wouldn&#x27;t use clippers, right?&lt;br /&gt;Little battery operated trimmer included in this set doesn&#x27;t deserve anymore than 3 stars. It has pretty wide blade for touch-up trimmer and because of it it&#x27;s harder to use it around ears or temples to taper it nice. 1AA battery is clearly not enough to make it work good. I tried few different alkaline batteries and they all work well only for a few touch-ups and then trimmer starting to work slower and slower, you can even hear it by sound it makes. I think trimmer would really benefit from better power sourse, may be 2 batteries, but they wanted to make it very small rather than efficient. Though, I appreciate that it&#x27;s battery operated so you can just install a new battery in a second and use it again.&lt;br /&gt;I still give this set 5 stars despite junky cordless trimmer and cheapy fillers accessories, because kit cost is equal to only 4 men&#x27;s haircuts in barber shop so it really saves money and time and I have no complains about how my haircut looks, nothing different with barber shop results.t by sound it makes.

            <li> Don&#x27;t get cut like a shave</li>
            <li> RECOMENDADO 1000% SALUDOS</li>
            <li> It is everything I needed to give my  husband a haircut. Blades are sharp, it came with plenty of extras, and the storage bag is awesome!</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending $20 every 3 weeks to get a haircut at Supercuts when all they were doing was using a clipper at the same length all the way around. Since I wasn&#x27;t sure if the self-haircut experiment would work I didn&#x27;t want to spend more than $40 on a pair of clippers. After doing some research online I came across these clippers, which had great reviews and seemed like they would get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main (big) clipper exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and the various guides are easy to clip on and off. The cord is long enough to reach the bathtub from the outlet by the sink and while the motor is powerful it doesn&#x27;t *usually* flip the circuit breaker. I&#x27;ve used the clippers twice and there was no discomfort or hair pulling. Everything was cut pretty evenly and the only difficulty I had was dealing with my sideburns/ears. There are special taper guides for the ears, but I haven&#x27;t tried those yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller clipper is basically a piece of junk. It&#x27;s powered by a double A battery, but as soon as you turn it on you can hear it straining and I&#x27;m confident it will break in no time. The blades are pretty harsh directly on the skin you&#x27;re trying to clean up. I&#x27;d highly recommend the Norelco Body Groomer if you&#x27;re planning on using this little guy for any sort of extensive clean-up work.</li>
            <li> My other Wahl clipper needed to be replaced after 10 years and 2 people using it every week. I hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> I already own one of these products which was purchased about four to five years ago.  It still works fine, but three of us use this&lt;br /&gt;haircutting kit, so I decided to get one all for myself!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for a 10 year old Wahl that had finally died. This one is well made and quieter than our previous model. Cuts my boys hair just fine. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the set, would purchase another and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This machine is pro quality for about $30 US.  Paid for itself with two haircuts - which I did myself with the aid of a hand mirror.</li>
            <li> big noise for it machine,i dont want it,so i make return,because this haircutting just for my son,he hate it one.if you dont worry noise,it&#x27;s good machine for you</li>
            <li> Impressed with equipment and the zippered pouch it came in.  First haircut was great.  Bonus: Assembled in USA.</li>
            <li> Since I am bald on top I cant justifie paying for haircuts anymore do it myselfer now and this product makes it very easy top do</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try the clippers, but the trimmer didn&#x27;t work when we opened the package, so we returned it promptly.</li>
            <li> The clippers work great however the trimmers are not that good kind of dull.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good buy but neither work as well as i thought they would, but  I didnt wanna spend the time to return so I kept them anyway.</li>
            <li> These hair clippers are worth every cent. They went though my beard like going through butter. They are so quite and  powerful!!</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly pleased with this product and I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone. You really do get a lot for your money with this kit like two POWERFUL clippers, blade guards, brush, oil and a NICE travel bag that holds ALL items. The operation of the clippers is exceptional. Even with a THICK beard, it NEVER boggs down or pull my hairs. This brand is the best in the business. They stand behind their product and DELIVER on customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> These clippers get the job done. There is nothing fancy about them, and they are a lot lighter than the ones that I&#x27;ve had in the past, but they are pretty good.</li>
            <li> I bought this same item about 10 y ago . I decided to get a new one and it&#x27;s about the same model , more money and less attachments . These people keep on cutting in cost and giving you less for you money . Its a reliable brand , that should not use this kind of strategy , that&#x27;s all .</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl most of the time. I did try some other less expensive brands but they were not nearly the same quality. The added small trimmer was the icing on the cake. The motor is strong and cuts through my thick hair easily and efficiently. Works great to cut my hair and my 9 year old son&#x27;s hair at least once a week. This kit just replaced my prior Wahl clippers that lasted years and paid for themselves over and over. Great investment, great product for the price.  I saved more money than I paid for the kit on the first week I had them,</li>
            <li> Powerful clipper good for home use</li>
            <li> Grate for edge up, fades , and all around hair cutts :) Got them for my husband and he can use them on our 6year old</li>
            <li> Works great. So far so good!</li>
            <li> After I used it only one time, the s-trimmer stopped working. I don&#x27;t recommend that product.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Fair price. Excellent shipping and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does an excellent job on my hair using the #2 guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length on the power cord is good also.</li>
            <li> A few of my pals have these trimmers, and I always just sort of assumed they were like a $75 kit. Boy was I pleased to discover it&#x27;s such an affordable piece of equipment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the battery-powered trimmer nearly as much as the big one, but both work great! I have a (sometimes unruly) beard and this trimmer combination is the perfect way to keep it tidy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction is very sturdy, and the included attachments make trimming a cinch! I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this exact item for 3 years and by far it is the best ive used. Love this item.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great.  I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of different trimmers over the years and this one beats them all.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I sent this back. the little one was not strong enough to remove air let alone hair. the big one was just not up to Wahl standards.</li>
            <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The large corded clipper works well.  The smaller trimmer, is junk.  I might have just gotten a bad one but feeling and looking how it is made (plastic) I don&#x27;t think so.  Small clipper pulls hair way too often. Also the cape is very low quality, we just tossed ours and got a better, they don&#x27;t cost that much.  You will probably be better off to purchase the two clippers separate if you want both to be quality.</li>
            <li> not what I expected!!</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the clippers. Works good and has plenty of sizes to choose length.</li>
            <li> Taking back to cutting my hair to save money from going to the hair stylist. Even though cutting my own hair takes linger time, using this kit, my haircuts feel almost up to par with that of the stylists. The set has all the sizes that I want and some extra good ones from cutting around the ear. There are great combs and scissors to use for styling. I don&#x27;t regret this buy.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, I had always rated Wahl as one of the top cutters out here! I was hoping that I could of further adjust the blade to get a lower graded cut! All in all, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I needed a hair trimmer that was easy to use and versatile enough for doing all the detail work involved in cutting hair. I also needed something that was easy enough to figure out for a non-professional salon stylist, since my wife is cutting my hair and she&#x27;s never cut hair professionally. Well, this kit by Wahl fits the bill perfectly. It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to use, and has all the accessories we need (and more) to get the job done. We don&#x27;t have our teenage sons lining up for their turns yet, but, perhaps, in time. Maybe a long time.</li>
            <li> I used it on my son and it worked as advertised. I am very happy with these clippers! Thanks for the great deal!</li>
            <li> So far, so good! I gave my self a professional looking haircut with it and it looks real good.  I would definitely get a different clipper specifically for fading though in the future.  I plan on giving my two boys haircuts to save some $.</li>
            <li> Great hair clippers but the little guy was s***</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working well and have no regrets.</li>
            <li> The small one runs out of batteries quickly</li>
            <li> Clippers work great. Trimmers not so much. Trimmers are cordless and suck through batteries.</li>
            <li> The hair clippers I received where extremely loud when turn on and vibrated too much. Not like the barbers usually use, this are too loud. The package also came with no instructions or warranty papers, that led me to think this item had been used and return previously.</li>
            <li> when i retired a few years ago i became unwilling to try to figure out and mesh my semi-retired long-time hair stylist&#x27;s availability / schedule with mine.  so when i bought a set of these and told my wife she was going to be cutting my hair from then-on she said,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;i used to cut my poodle&#x27;s hair, how hard can it be?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first time out of the gate she did a great job and in the 3 years since then the haircut-at-home thing has worked very well for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would have given this 5 stars but about 2 years into using them, the set became somewhat noisy and sluggish ... not as easy to use as it had been. no big shake ... as inexpensive as they are i bought another pair and with prime it was in our home in a few days, no delivery charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we really do love these clippers.</li>
            <li> good product, like it</li>
            <li> Got this set for my husband for our anniversary (don&#x27;t judge, I&#x27;m practical!), he loves it! It looks and feels expensive. It has a lot of different options when it comes to what size he wants for his cut. Has a cool battery operated, &amp;#34;mini-me&amp;#34; trimmers, and a nice case with a zipper to keep all the supplies together. Score!</li>
            <li> It stop working had to buy a better professional one</li>
            <li> Folks,Get This one!! If you never cut someones hair this kit makes it a breeze.. Truly any one can do it with this system!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, arrived on time and in great condition! Despite it&#x27;s size and the amount of items included it is a relatively clean kit that doesn&#x27;t require much juggling of the parts.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Cuts smoothly, doesn&#x27;t warm up the blade. Good weight , long enough electric cable, good value for price</li>
            <li> Its not the sellers fault, but when I got the clippers, you had to hit them for them to come on every time, but I return them, and got a full refund, these usually are some good clippers, maybe they just fell before they got to me.</li>
            <li> Had an old Wahl that have used for over 15 years, still works but decided it was time for an upgrade. New one is lighter and works just fine.</li>
            <li> very happy; great cut.</li>
            <li> Such as expected. Works great.</li>
            <li> GREAT VALUE but i star to feel like is loosing its sharp on the blade after almost 5 to 6 months it came with a good bundle, i love the small trimmer too!!</li>
            <li> Wahl is a great brand and my husband LOVES it.  He normally uses Remington products, so this was the first Wahl he&#x27;s ever tried.</li>
            <li> I received this combo kit in early December;  the large AC-powered unit works great;  unfortunately, the smaller trimmer worked a couple of times and then stopped working.  I am going to request a replacement for the small unit, and if this request is processed appropriately, I will increase my rating.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for me boyfriend and he loves it. It&#x27;s still working for him four months later with no issues. He says she recommends it as it is one of the best kits out there. It&#x27;s also the most affordable price on amazon so I would definitely take advantage of that! Every man should have one of these!</li>
            <li> I Love it!&lt;br /&gt;This has been so handy to have.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these clippers.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. It&#x27;s very handy and nice. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> When I received the product the clippers were off centered before I even had a chance to use them so I am returning it this week.</li>
            <li> my husband loved this. He had an older model and this one was perfect. Great for the price and love the brand.</li>
            <li> The clippers are very nice.  Made in USA (note, the small trimmers are from China).  Good weight.  Lots of guards all together in a nice bag.  It does come with scissors ... but they are pretty cheap.  that didn&#x27;t take away from the rating for me, because I bought these for the clippers, not the scissors.  If I wanted good scissors, I expect to spend at least this much again.  We paid for them pretty quickly by cutting the kids&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect choice for a casual beard trimmer. I use it exclusively and don&#x27;t expect to change until it breaks. Then I&#x27;ll buy another one</li>
            <li> This clipper has the potential to create hearing problems. This Wahl branded product is very noisy and adjusting it lessens the noise but decrease the hair clipping effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Chrome Pro Deluxe 25-Piece Haircutting Kit is an excellent value at $40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as you hold these clippers, you realize you&#x27;re holding a robustly built piece of equipment, exactly like a professional barber/stylist would use. Besides the impressive heft, the vibration is well controlled and emits a relatively low, steady hum--not a high whine or rattle like cheaper plastic-framed clippers and trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting shields are appropriately sized to cover all lengths from 1/8\\&quot; up to 1\\&quot; (in 1/8-inch increments). The shields snap securely onto the clippers and are sufficiently stiff that they are not likely to bend or break under normal use. This is important because cheaply made shields can bend and result in an uneven cut, or worse, can break suddenly and allow the blade to cut much deeper into the hair. I have no worries about these shields. You would have to press ridiculously hard to deform or break them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included mini-trimmer runs on a single \\&quot;AA\\&quot; battery. It has an impressive amount of power, but I find it limited in usefulness since it does not accept add-on attachments. My Philips Norelco shaver has a trimmer built in the back, and I also have a small Remington hair/beard trimmer, so this Wahl trimmer ends up being redundant and less versatile. If you don&#x27;t already have a trimmer, though, it&#x27;s nice for squaring up sideburns and, in conjunction with a comb, for trimming eyebrows as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a heavy-duty trimmer that comes as a complete set with all the shields and a full complement of other accessories (scissors, mini-trimmer, right and left ear taper guards, instructions on cutting hair, and a thin plastic cover to keep the clippings off your neck and shoulders), then I would not hesitate to buy this set. It&#x27;s excellent and well made.</li>
            <li> Nice kit for home haircuts.</li>
            <li> I use this to cut mine and my boy&#x27;s hair and it has worked very well. Guards are easy to change and it comes with a lot of them. I used it on my beard once with good result but I bought a beard trimmer that works very well for that so have not done it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller trimmer does not seem to be very powerful so I have avoided using it. I have used an older beard trimmer for my neck and ear line but it&#x27;s nice to have this one as a back up.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality and good looking clippers.  Not high end on power or closeness but a very good buy for the price.  The small clippers are great for neckline and behind the ears.  If you are looking for a basic set you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> This is my second Wahl.  I use it at least 30 times per year, so that&#x27;s a lot of saving on haircuts.  My first one lasted about nine years and worked perfectly until something holding the blades broke recently.</li>
            <li> Feel the same as many of the other reviews.  So far, so good.  No issues and no complaints.  Would recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Love the small trimmer that comes with it. Has all the settings you need and it cuts well.</li>
            <li> Ive never buy Whal, to be the first item I bought from this brand Im really satisfy, the accesories and the bag are great to travel</li>
            <li> fast shipping and great product looks great and works great! big one i use on my head and comes with all the trimmings of sizes and all</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy the razor that doesn&#x27;t come with the small thing. It was a cheap piece of junk that is probably only worth about $3</li>
            <li> Muy bueno muchas gracias!!!</li>
            <li> This product is high quality.  My brother loved it and I did too.</li>
            <li> This clipper cuts much better than my friends that got theirs at Walmart.  The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t like the case.  It&#x27;s a soft case, and would like a hard case.</li>
            <li> Pro 25 was just what we needed. Works great on strait and curly hair.</li>
            <li> yes, the little one is loud, but both work great!  Use them every two weeks for my husbands head-shave with the #1 guard and use no guard and a comb for his beard trim.</li>
            <li> It works great and the instructions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Nice pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Not professional grade</li>
            <li> actually this products is greaat so great</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;m pleased and recommend I recommend it to other customers are very versatile and the quality I expected thanks</li>
            <li> MADE IN AMERICA, and it shows need I say more? Professional quality. I hacked my hair off with the China model I bought, I did not have the courage to trim my nose:}&lt;br /&gt;Tbone&lt;br /&gt;Littleton,Co</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how fast this came and the amazing quality of the razor. Very very happy. A+++++</li>
            <li> The blades have to be manually adjusted for a close cut but other than that,  its a great deal. If someone don&#x27;t know how to adjust the blade...ask someone at your local Barbershop</li>
            <li> Wahl 79524-5201 Chrome Pro 25 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit Wahl .i love it .it is a very good tool .thanks</li>
            <li> I would give this clipper a 5 star but the on/off switch seems more cheaply made than the last one I had.  It doesn&#x27;t turn on quite as easily. Otherwise, the set I bought has everything you need.</li>
            <li> The trimmer that came with it was broken. &#x3D;/ Other than that, it was fine. Doesn&#x27;t make too much noise and it works decently.</li>
            <li> THE WAHL HAIRCUTTING CUTTER IS (FINE),,,THE LITTLE BATTERY DRVEN HAIR CUTTER  (DOES NOT WORK),,,I AM RETURNING THE SMALL HAIR CUTTER ONLY,,, FOR A REPLACEMENT.,,,,,,,,THANK YOU CHARLES CHIANESE CHUCKY0178@GMAIL.COM</li>
            <li> the best! hsband loves it all! good price!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cost much and it works amazingly. People say the mini trimmer doesn&#x27;t work well, but after receiving mine and having it work poorly, I fiddled with it and got the battery to make a stronger connection to the trimmer and it works great now. 5/5, awesome product awesome price</li>
            <li> The battery trimmer is useless and the shears are too sharp for a close trim.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Total trash! The main unit cuts unevenly and is extremely heavy, while the smaller unit does not work at all.</li>
            <li> Smooth cut and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My grandson loves his clipped set.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for 8 years now. My old clippers died and I got these. They work alright, until they decide to rip the hair out of your head. Not just a few, it pulls at my hair the entire time I use the clippers. It makes for an extremely aggrivating experience. Not only that, but they leave tons of small hairs sticking up that don&#x27;t get cut. I didn&#x27;t get a bad product, because my father has the exact same pair with the exact same problem. I bought clipper lubricant to try to fix it, but it did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers belong in the trash, i&#x27;m not sure how they managed to get a 4.5 star rating.</li>
            <li> After several months, its got louder and would not function properly.  It even slices &amp; cuts my head when I use it without any guard.</li>
            <li> Love it. Have used it twice. Works great. My son in law cuts my hair for me and also his kids</li>
            <li> The main clippers are very good. Not the best in the business, but perfect for giving myself a #3 buzz cut. The extra touch-up trimmer is all but useless. It hardly picks up enough speed to cut any hair, especially along the neckline. Don&#x27;t buy this set because of the extra trimmer.</li>
            <li> I loved my Wahl Mohawk which died after 20+ years. So I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another Wahl product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed. I don&#x27;t get as close a cut (I use no attachments) or an even cut.&lt;br /&gt;I have to shave my head twice a month now.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to them (not asking for any money) but they never answered.</li>
            <li> I bought these at Walmart. They are terrible! This is the second pair of wahl hair clippers that I have bought the first one was great, but that was a different model. These Clippers leave little hair sticking up and do not cut evenly. This problem  started almost from the beginning. I recommend saving your money and buying a little more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> If am not in a country where the voltage output is between 110V - 120V i have to look for a voltage step down! It should have been long range of 110V - 240V. This item is a travelling companion!!</li>
            <li> Works GREAT!!!! Both machines are perfect!! All the clips/combs fit and work perfectly to style hair. I highly recommend! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The little shaver turned on once and immediately died. The bigger shaver works great and there are a ton of different plastic guides. It is a great product even though I&#x27;m kind of bummed about the little guy.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, the tiny clippers were already broken, there goes the lifetime warranty already! Didn&#x27;t even use them before sending back. Disappointed in the amount of money I spent, on the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit heavy but works great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if maybe I got a bad set of clippers when I bought these, but they were horrible. This is my 3rd set I&#x27;ve owned. I had the Color pro which still work to this day even though I dropped them years ago. I also have the Wahl Designer pro which still work well but they are 5 years old and my wife uses them to cut our dogs hair now. This is by far the worst set I&#x27;ve owned and I knew it within 5 minutes of cutting my hair. The thumb guide caused the razor to stop moving at the top and bottom of it&#x27;s range. Now after a few cuts, it intermittently causes it to stop moving and when that happens, it rips your hair out if you&#x27;re mid-stroke trying to cut your hair. They are well within warranty and Wahl stood by their product and were very helpful for a return, but I was extremely disappointed in these. I have been cutting my own hair for roughly 7 years now with Wahl clippers and overall, they are great and fairly cheap when you consider how much you&#x27;d be saving on haircuts. I&#x27;ve saved well over $1,000 cutting my own hair over the years.</li>
            <li> great device but need better shape up trimmer</li>
            <li> These clippers do a great job for the price. I cut my husband&#x27;s and my son&#x27;s hair and we have saved a ton of money by making the investment in these clippers. It&#x27;s a minimal investment and worth your money pretty much the second or third time you use them. I highly recommend Wahl clippers - they are very good quality.</li>
            <li> Works Great.  Looked at other clippers but these took my eye.  Good quality and cut fades great.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good quality product. And American made!</li>
            <li> Excellent product I get well, congratulations excellent recommend seller</li>
            <li> Substandard. I think.</li>
            <li> These save me so much money, it&#x27;s unreal. I&#x27;m on my second pair - my first pair lasted 3 years with 0 oil. I now oil after every use.</li>
            <li> Great kit and you can&#x27;t go wrong with Wahl. I always keep my hair short ever since I retired from the military and these are perfect for maintaining my hair that perfect high and tight! The kit came with a ton of guards and oil and brushes to make sure you keep your clippers clean and operational. The smaller clippers work great on the hairline and my beard plus being cordless is a bonus. The larger clippers are not that loud at all and run smoothly. I say you get what you pay for and with these, I can tell they are built well and will last.</li>
            <li> High quality. Extra battery powered shaver is convenient. A lot of accessories.  Handy car rying case in cluded. Two more words required</li>
            <li> Great value.  Full set - everything you need to cut hair.  Seems durable.  I have used them a few times each month for more than a year and have had no issues other than one guard cracking slightly.</li>
            <li> a trusted name and a solid product. I wish the attachments were interchangeable for the smaller clipper and other Wahl trimming products.</li>
            <li> With these clippers you get a professional cut.  Nice selection of guards.  Clean cutting with little pulling.  I use it bi-weekly to trim up my boys with a #8 on top, #2 on the sides faded to #1.  This is my second one.  The first one died after many many many uses.  Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Wahl 79524-5201 Chrome Pro 25 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit is a solid clipper. The clipper length attachments are easy to take on/off. The mini trimmer is also useful for sideburns and back neck area touch ups. Sometimes, it will kick into a very loud buzzying, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to long duration usage. Simply turn it off for a few seconds, turn it back on, and it should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can find it for around $30 or less, it&#x27;s worth buying. It&#x27;s sturdy and will last for many years.</li>
            <li> works great-entire set is a little awkward though.</li>
            <li> Stop working in two months</li>
            <li> Nice product , same exactly as my old one and it last for a years</li>
            <li> I wear my hair shorter now (almost buzz cut) and like others here was tired of paying $12-15 every time I needed a haircut - which with short hair is about every month. It was stressful just trying to drive to the place (traffic), then hoping the girl who does it best is actually working that day etc....PITA. It became one more thing to &#x27;schedule&#x27; in a day off....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally ordered this and all is good. Trick is to start w/ the longer guides and work your way shorter. Get used to the tool. Its pretty easy to use...just take your time.  Also, buy a decent hand mirror to trim up the neck (hardest part)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m wondering why I didn&#x27;t do this years ago even when my hair was longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Not bad. It serves it&#x27;s purpose. I wish I would have paid more for a better set. Also the mini clipper does not work well.</li>
            <li> and professional. The only drawback is that the working voltage is 110V, not a dynamic 110-220V, may be inconvenient when travelling outside USA.</li>
            <li> Ordered and tried my very first own hair cut.  Worked like a charm and my wife helped with trimming the back.  Cannot be happier.  No more waiting in hair salons.</li>
            <li> So far so good. only used a couple times but no problems.  yes it is a little loud but not as loud as my OLD norelco so that is not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> I am a #1 buzz kind of guy and for that I can say it works like a charm. The touch up trimmer is pretty clutch as well.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, just at a little oil and it was good to go.  Cuts like a charm.  Noise level is just fine.  Hope to get years of service out of it. Nice feel to grip in the hand, both the lard clippers and the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works just perfect. big savings, fun Using it So many tools Included for the low price although I bought it At Wall-mart for 29$(plus taxes) Just Go For It.. I would recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> I was procrastinating the very thought of having two purchase new hair clippers simply because they&#x27;re simply too expensive thru the retail stores.  I knew I wanted a nice chrome set of clippers from Wahl like my father&#x27;s but again I knew I would have to pay a fortune.  But Amazon.com saved the day yet again.  Not only did I find a nice chrome of clippers but also chrome trimmers to boot all under $40 including shipping!  With today&#x27;s gas prices on the rise along with clothes, food and recreation its nice to get a break in cost somewhere!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and wanted something that was easy to use and hold onto. I liked this one because it has all the different sized clippers along with the right and left ear tapers. The indent on the top of the clippers does make it much easier to hold onto. Bought it on amazon and saved about $10 vs. Target.</li>
            <li> Dear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like ask you about this product&lt;br /&gt;can i use this machine  with 220 volts or 110 volts or both&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards ,,,</li>
            <li> Great Product!!  Perfect Clipper!!  Excellent Seller!!</li>
            <li> Used it twice. Everything works very well. Happy with the product. And its made in the USA!</li>
            <li> great product, I am very glad to have him, is the best and original, thanks for the sale</li>
            <li> I can quickly and easily cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  Have even used it for a couple of friends who needed their head buzzed!</li>
            <li> THE WAHL HAIR CUTTER IS NICE BUT THERE WAS MACHANICAL PROBLEM WITH IT .  THE SHEETS WE THOUGTH WERE VERY THIN YOU CAN SEE THREW THEM ?</li>
            <li> The clippers and liners are excellent for the price. The liners are battery operated so if you add a lithium battery they will last forever</li>
            <li> I really like these Wahl clippers. The clipper itself feels very well built and solid. It cuts hair very easily. The detailer is a nice addition as well. The only problem I have with it is its power. Its battery powered so thats probably why but it definitely does the job. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a male 45 years old, and was sick and tired of paying anywhere from $12 to $18 for a haircut plus tip.  I mean I get the same haircut every time, a 4, 5, and 6 guide.  I decided I would try to cut my own hair and bought this product.  It was so easy to do, I just use the 4 guide for the sides and the back, the 5 guide for the crown and upper side edges, and the 6 guide to finish off the top.  I had my son use the small clippers to finish off my neck area and back hairline.  Make sure you use 3 drops of oil before and after you use it after a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> The clipper works just fine like my old Wahl set which was over 23yrs old. The only negative (if you can call it that) is that there are too many pieces in the kit. I never ever needed this many adapters just to trim hair. The little clipper seems to work OK for small trim jobs so all in all it&#x27;s a good clipper set.</li>
            <li> the best thing of this product is that it contain a small size shaver which can cut off some difficult rim for the complete size shaver</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Instructions easy to follow.  Will pay for itself after two uses.  The Wahl clippers are well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with a Wahl. Have used this brand for most of my life and they have all been the same - they just keep on clipping. . . :)</li>
            <li> Perfect pair of hair clippers and trimmers for the money.  Very nice quality.  Thought they were for a beard but they are for hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use!  Good directions are enclosed with a book and pictures to help new users. Price is within reason.</li>
            <li> We got this over a month ago and its well paid itself already!  My husband and son have used it at least 4 times!  Haven&#x27;t used the little one yet.  This baby is well put together.  It feels sturdy.</li>
            <li> It is a very good set for the price. Works really well. Would recommend it. The blades are self-sharpening so that is good as well.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair cutting machine. It comes with everything shown in the picture and all are great to have and use. I use this once a week and the only problem was that the blade eventually wears away. After buying a replacement blade, it worked great. Take good care of it and it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this because he dropped his older one and the blade broke. This is so expensive in stores, but it&#x27;s a good razor. My boyfriend is very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Old pair shorted while overseas and these have more than filled the shoes of the prior. A very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Great clippers that give a close and smooth cut the first pass</li>
            <li> I have used it to cut hair once on my husband. I did find that I had to go over his hair again to catch hairs that didn&#x27;t get cut the first time. Might be because this was my first time cutting hair or the razor. I really liked it otherwise. Seems to be a great set so far!</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money. However, search for the same thing without the small trimmer. The small one uses battery and it is weak.</li>
            <li> very good machine come with all pieces good for haircuts and shape ups also to trim your beard</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was as stated. Love it.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> Disappointed that the unit does not have all of the clipper settings, no half setting. unit is more complicated and heavier than expected</li>
            <li> We love this set of clippers.  I upgraded to these when I was cutting more then just my son&#x27;s hair (I&#x27;m not a professional and do not claim to be) but I do cut family members hair.  Everything is exactly as expected if not more, I was using a really cheap set originally and this upgrade was SO worth the $$.  I would absolutely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Wahl clipper is good but the small one is waste of inclusion..i may have used it twice and it stopped working..:( will never buy them again..</li>
            <li> they cut nicely. i was just expecting a better quality group of clippers. i don&#x27;t think its professional enough...it was a gift to my cousin whos a barber and really good too. to replace his set that i lost but he wasn&#x27;t very happy with it. as far as giving great looking professional hair cuts he was looking for a little more than these clippers could offer. but he still uses it for at home grooming.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for the whole family. Not noisy. Lots of attachments for different length cuts and the small cordless trimmer is great.</li>
            <li> Shaver works great and the mini shaver is great for traveling&lt;br /&gt;I love this shaver and would recommend this to anyone looking for shaver</li>
            <li> I wanted a professional look with good quality, the chrome made it look so nice and the quality is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my choice, it is working fine and get the work done, love it.&lt;br /&gt;it is coming with all the accessories needed for an hair cut.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price. It is everything I was hoping it would be and I feel I wont have to buy another one for a while</li>
            <li> If you want a full cut or clean up, this set is perfect.  High quality and design are evident and will last for years!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t line hair very good at all. And they&#x27;re not great at cleaning up the excess hair after you set the lining.</li>
            <li> This is the gift that my wife wanted so she could cut my hair and the price was the best</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hair clippers I have ever used. This product was well worth the price and the money. This product gives the best results.</li>
            <li> Gave a pair to our daughter for Christmas, as she is a cosmetologist. She says they work great, and she gets nice clean cuts with them.</li>
            <li> My Husband was very happy with the kit as was I. We were able to get it for a great deal!</li>
            <li> Works fantastic!  After 2 haircuts for my sons, it has paid for itself.</li>
            <li> Totally dosent work. Just noisy as hell. Noisy...</li>
            <li> Very good product for the price.  Satisfied buyer!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son-in-law and he was thrilled.  Taking kids to the barber shop is not easy or cheap and now he can give them good haircuts at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for three years now.  Pros: It has a strong motor, and comes a decent set of accessories.  Cons: It&#x27;s pretty noisy. The blades don&#x27;t seem to cut well anymore despite moderate use (I&#x27;ve only used it for beard trimming), and often &#x27;bite&#x27;. Thinking it&#x27;s a blade alignment issue, I followed the instructions to realign them but it did not help.     Edit -- I gave realignment another shot with more patience and precision. It worked. The process is a real pain in the neck but it doesn&#x27;t bite anymore.</li>
            <li> Nice quality for the price..Was given as a Christmas present and the person loved it..They said it cuts as great as it looks..Worth the price..Happy customer and recipient..</li>
            <li> Such a nice good quality set! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl clippers for years.. This product is ripping my facial hair out. Not cutting! I am very disappointed with this clipper! Always had a.great product from Wahl! Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the value and good reviews. I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed with the product. The combs are cheap and the clippers did a terrible job at cutting my hair. The beard trimmer is even worse. It would not maintain constant speed and it&#x27;s just made very poorly, not to mention the blades have rusted very badly since I last used it. Not worth the money. I went with Oster Classic 76 since buying this, and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works well and the wife was wanting a new complete kit after dealing with 2 partial kits for the last few years.</li>
            <li> i like it, seems to be working well.. its hard to tell when you first buy an item.. if something goes wrong i will update my comment</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  But still not to bad and I can still useinv it every week to chives my face</li>
            <li> i got this to help someone out in life to open up a barre shop im giving it a way for free thank you so much it will help them start out in life  thank you</li>
            <li> The wireless trimmer that is include is very cheap takes only one AA battery. I wouldn&#x27;t have chosen this combination had I realized this.</li>
            <li> This device is really useful for hair cutting,  with a  lot os acessories and easy to use.  The issue is that all the neighborhood will know you are cutting hair ,  sounds like a Fire Alarm !!</li>
            <li> These clippers are quite strong on thick hair and is not very noisy.  We are happy with them after just using them four times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mel</li>
            <li> Quality set.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The blade was not very sharp and tugs on your skin causing scratches. Within three uses, It has become practically useless. It is very heavy as well. Save your money and shop for another brand/model.</li>
            <li> I liked but the little machine does not work</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a good cut. Pulls and tugs hair.</li>
            <li> The big one works great!  The little one is no match for the plug in Peanut version, and doesn&#x27;t have enough power.</li>
            <li> I have always owened Wahl clippers so I bought these assuming they would meet my needs just fine. So far they have been great but it seems the body of the unit has been made a little cheaper  than previous models I have owned. The little trimmer that comes with it is very cheap feeling but does the job when you need a quick touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair every 2 weeks and my 2 boys hair about every 3 weeks. These clippers are holding up just fine and I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. Expected a better cut from what I&#x27;m use to from wahl. Had to readjust to get close to what I needed</li>
            <li> They work good enough but they still pull hair.</li>
            <li> nanhsnnsj&lt;br /&gt;kkuhhyst&lt;br /&gt;loisustbgqnq&lt;br /&gt;kajahhgsfftwrwsvs&lt;br /&gt;lokijuyhggsg&lt;br /&gt;jjuhyhgafaf&lt;br /&gt;kkaijajjajaj</li>
            <li> Excellent, simply excellent.  Great value, sharp and strong.  Best home haircut since I bought my old Wahl 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> I had a Wahl previously but with out the goodies. This Wahl is great more like the pro&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable noise, sounds like a lawn mower</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, outstanding price, fast service. VERY SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad for Christmas. He&#x27;s not a barber but he does an amazing job cutting hair. Id recommend this for  anyone who cuts hair. And needs new clippers.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp at all.</li>
            <li> The company which I purchased this item from was great. However, the product itself is terrible. The unit actually pulls your hair instead of cutting it which is rather unfortunate considering the price.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase!  Came to us quickly and works very well.  It has several combs for different lengths and the little trimmer is useful.  It has run down the battery twice, but we&#x27;ve used it quite a bit.  Great purchase!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was a gift to a friend ,he liked it. The seller parked it nicely and it arrived in good condition. Great seller, nice price, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Stellar!!! Quick shipment. And my hair has never looked better. It certainly ain&#x27;t having trouble with the ladies;) seriously though, this set comes with absolutely everything. Read the instructions you can do much more than a buzz cut. The company is easy to work with!!</li>
            <li> great product.  The delivery was right on time.  The item was a gift and he loves it....</li>
            <li> I love my kit. The price is just right for me. You got to buy one too?  I will tell my friend about it? Thank you.</li>
            <li> This has everything you could possibly need. Totally worth the money and it saves us money by me doing my husband hair instead of him going to get it done somewhere else.</li>
            <li> On time delivery, product is fine.</li>
            <li> Costco sells the exact same clippers but with batteries for $30. This clipper cuts well. The portable mini clipper is a little weak. Otherwise get this for the home hair stylists, save your money with 2 clips at home.</li>
            <li> The combs can be properly tighten so it makes huge noise and always scares my son. Never buy anything here.</li>
            <li> These are very good clippers and the trimmer is not bad either. The set is complete with every guard possible, plus a wrap to keep hair off of yourself. There are ear trimming guards and eyebrow trimmers. I things Ill never use, but nice to have. The trimmer is light, but not cheap and runs on 1 AA battery. The clippers don&#x27;t get hot after using them for a while. And this is cheaper than it is in the store!</li>
            <li> Product has replaced an 8 year old Wahl cutter that was working ok.  The new one definitely cuts better and more evenly.  For the price, I should have made this change long ago.  Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s Who Concert loud then there&#x27;s this trimmer loud...Oh my lady Gaga.....that being said great haircut</li>
            <li> It cuts my hair that is about all I ask for.</li>
            <li> replaced my 10 yr old wahl clippers  great so far</li>
            <li> They work great! Definitely worth it for it&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> THEY ARE OKAY.... NOT VERY SHARP FOR GREY HAIR... THE CUT IS NOT VERY CLOSE BUT IT DOES GET THE JOB DONE... I KEPT THEM...</li>
            <li> I wanted a higher quality and thought this would be it.  Once arrived and I held the clippers, it felt cheap. The housing isn&#x27;t metal but chromed plastic and the adjustment lever hits the housing also.  :(  Clippers so far have worked great and have no complaints about the performance but it just feels cheap.</li>
            <li> This item has arrived with 110 volt and we use 220/240 volt and we have to convert to 220/240 volt before usage. Please take note of this. We are on 220/240 volt not 110 vvolt. However, it is good and excellent for use. Thanks, Francis.</li>
            <li> ,The best,,The best,,The best,,The best,,The best,,The best,,The best,,The best,,The best,,The best,,The best,,The best,,The best,</li>
            <li> WAHL NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME. THEY CREATE MORE EXQUISITE CLIPPERS THAN ANYONE ELSE, AND THE BLADES STAY SHARP FOREVER.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my hair with this set for over 5 years now and these do not skip a beat. The only downside is that the smaller trimmer runs on a single AA battery and it drains super quick.</li>
            <li> I used its ease to use and a gave a the styl that wanted</li>
            <li> Great kit for the money, cant be beat.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing better would be complete wireless connectivity. ! ! ! !</li>
            <li> I got it and it doesnt even work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I want to return it but dont know how!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very mad that I purchased this!</li>
            <li> Works great - easy to get desired results</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair so I needed something cheap but to get the job done. So far I had no issue with this purchase. Oil the clippers after each cut and have a fairly smooth experience with these.</li>
            <li> We bought this to replace a Wahl clipper that we had owned for 45 years.&lt;br /&gt;Since my husband is shiny on top, he decided to go with a buzz cut last year. He had been getting his hair cut at a salon but when he came home with the buzz cut I decided that was money we did not have to spend. The old clipper was dull and not up to the job at all so we ordered this one. We have recouped the cost of the clippers and are now banking savings. We are happy with it but not sure why there have to be 25 pieces.</li>
            <li> I like this set because it is very comfortable and convenient when it includes instruction and everything we need for cutting hair</li>
            <li> Purchased this because my oldest done needs his haircut so often and rather than spending $10 every 6 weeks I decided to just start doing it at home!!  This will pay for itself after the first 2 haircuts!!  It was super easy to cut his hair and now I can do it at home whenever needed!!  Came with guidelines for cutting too!</li>
