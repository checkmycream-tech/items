            <li>He was very pleased.</li>
            <li>amazing thx a lot guys</li>
            <li>Without the box, you don&#x27;t know what kind of Mont Blanc spray you have in the bottle.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best Mont Blanc fragrance.</li>
            <li>Something oddly familiar about it, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>very happy with the scent, it is different from most eau de toilette.</li>
            <li>most  have a lemon or lime scent that i do not like.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase of this product</li>
            <li>girls love it</li>
            <li>This is instantly becoming a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>dont like, wanted to try it since i use Mont Blanc Star walker, but this has a cheap smell to it.</li>
            <li>I hope this is genuine and not a counterfeit one.</li>
            <li>The product of your photograf is right--- I would like to know, why haven&#x27;t I received the product if I have more than a month ago for the bussiness?  </li>
            <li>strong and powerful smell all day.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Longevity is excellent on my skin, I get at least 8hrs, with a scent cloud of about 2 ft for the first 5 hrs.</li>
            <li>Well worth buying.</li>
            <li>This fragrance like many of the others in the product line is tasteful and mature.</li>
            <li>The cologne is pretty good , very much what i expected.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t normally mind, but this is a Christmas present for my husband, and I would have liked it to be pristine.</li>
            <li>This one smells nice, and like other Mont Blanc fragrances I&#x27;ve tried, is understated and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The Exceptionnel is a sweet and soft scent.</li>
            <li>This is another classic in the making!</li>
            <li>Very well priced.  </li>
            <li>Very manly colonge</li>
            <li>I really appreciated the very prompt delivery by the merchant.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This is an overall good product that I may purchase again and would certainly encourage other men to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>The dry down is patchouli and amber all the way, but it&#x27;s light and warm.</li>
            <li>This scent is the one that I receive more compliments than any other.  </li>
            <li>There is one other scent I use as well which receives just as many complements when I wear it</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if this eau de toilet spray is authentic because the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if this eau de toilet spray is authentic because the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>luckly I had the old one...</li>
            <li>so if you are gonna buy a tester keep the old bottle until you get it.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as advertised and expected.</li>
            <li>Not long lasting.</li>

            <li> this product do not have the fixative that I expected</li>
            <li> a little fragance with a big name, not really sattisfied probably need other hidden essence to release an impression.</li>
            <li> Also the bottle doesn&#x27;t has the imprint of the name of the spray as other Mon Blanc perfumes do.</li>
            <li> is not original, itÂ´s imitation.</li>
            <li> Anyway, Amazon price is about half that of Macy.</li>
            <li> I mean, for $26 what else can you expect?</li>
            <li> All of my Mont Blancs have been blind buys and everyone of them has been a winner.  </li>
            <li> and it will have to remain nameless...</li>

            <li> The product packaging was rough. Box torn and dirty. Wouldn&#x27;t normally mind, but this is a Christmas present for my husband, and I would have liked it to be pristine.</li>
            <li> The Exceptionnel is a sweet and soft scent. this is the best Mont Blanc EDT i ever had. Definitely, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bought it from Amazon.com but I don&#x27;t know if this eau de toilet spray is authentic because the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. it&#x27;s almost gone after about 30 minutes. May be about 20% of the beginning intensity is left.&lt;br /&gt;This is not original, itÂ´s imitation.</li>
            <li> very happy with the scent, it is different from most eau de toilette. most  have a lemon or lime scent that i do not like. i didn&#x27;t give it the highest rating because i thought the scent could last longer on the skin.</li>
            <li> amazing thx a lot guys</li>
            <li> Great scent hubby loves it! Smells really good.</li>
            <li> excellent after shave, love the scent of it.&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> A very sophisticated aroma.  Very well priced.  Well worth buying.</li>
            <li> dont like, wanted to try it since i use Mont Blanc Star walker, but this has a cheap smell to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son.  He loves this scent.  He was very pleased.</li>
            <li> The product of your photograf is right--- I would like to know, why haven&#x27;t I received the product if I have more than a month ago for the bussiness?  I&#x27;m worry about this and I need your answer..So I can&#x27;t rate this item yet..  Thank</li>
            <li> excellent product/ very happy with purchase/ Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is an overall good product that I may purchase again and would certainly encourage other men to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> This one smells nice, and like other Mont Blanc fragrances I&#x27;ve tried, is understated and not overpowering. It&#x27;s my daily use spray for work.</li>
            <li> Very manly colonge i love it</li>
            <li> The cologne is pretty good , very much what i expected. I really appreciated the very prompt delivery by the merchant.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!!!  My husband loved it!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> strong and powerful smell all day. Been buying this over and over again</li>
            <li> I guess the only difference with the \\&quot;Tester\\&quot;  is that there was no cap... that didn&#x27;t matter cause luckly I had the old one... so if you are gonna buy a tester keep the old bottle until you get it. Good timing well packed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase of this product</li>
            <li> ItÂ´s a little fragance with a big name, not really sattisfied probably need other hidden essence to release an impression.</li>
            <li> The purchase was made sastifactoriamente, recommend ...</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very good service, I recommend</li>
            <li> Bought it from Amazon.com but I don&#x27;t know if this eau de toilet spray is authentic because the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. it&#x27;s almost gone after about 45 minutes. May be about 20% of the beginning intensity is left. Also the bottle doesn&#x27;t has the imprint of the name of the spray as other Mon Blanc perfumes do. Only the cap has the word &amp;#34;Mont Blanc&amp;#34;. Without the box, you don&#x27;t know what kind of Mont Blanc spray you have in the bottle. Amazon.com should check with the distributor of this spray. Anyway, Amazon price is about half that of Macy. You got what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I have loved all the Mont Blanc sents.  This wasn&#x27;t a surprise it smells so good.  All of my Mont Blancs have been blind buys and everyone of them has been a winner.  This is another classic in the making!</li>
            <li> Just as described, excellent product. arrived on time</li>
            <li> smells very good ...girls love it</li>
            <li> Good perfume and for the price paid excellent.</li>
            <li> muy buen producto el hombre encantada con esto lo unico es que deberian envalarlo mas pequeÃ±o para que el envio no sea tan costoso</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. Enough said.</li>
            <li> Great price! Quick delivery. Product was exactly as advertised and expected.</li>
            <li> This scent is the one that I receive more compliments than any other.  It has a mascular scent to me and to others.  It works with my body chemistry I guess.  There is one other scent I use as well which receives just as many complements when I wear it and it will have to remain nameless...but I buy it from you as well.</li>
            <li> is smell very sweet!!</li>
            <li> This is instantly becoming a favorite of mine. This fragrance like many of the others in the product line is tasteful and mature. It has a distinguished quality.</li>
            <li> Me llego en perfecto estado, como lo esperaba! ya la he utilizado antes y es la que me gusta! desde Venezuela, Edo. Zulia!</li>
            <li> Not long lasting. I mean, for $26 what else can you expect? I hope this is genuine and not a counterfeit one.</li>
            <li> this product do not have the fixative that I expected</li>
            <li> excelente producto recomendado</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Mont Blanc fragrance. Something oddly familiar about it, but in a good way. Longevity is excellent on my skin, I get at least 8hrs, with a scent cloud of about 2 ft for the first 5 hrs. I get the citrus blast in the beginning along with the ginger and mint and a hint of lavender, but I don&#x27;t get the coffee for some reason. The dry down is patchouli and amber all the way, but it&#x27;s light and warm. A great work scent, inoffensive, smells great and lasts all day. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really good,  I recommend.</li>
    </ol>
