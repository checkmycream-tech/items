    <ol>
            <li>but I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>THE BEST IN THE MARKETS!!</li>
            <li>A MUCH BETTER PRODUCT OVER ALL!!!</li>
            <li>The best part about the lip injection is that it plumps and glosses, giving you a beautiful magazine cover look.</li>
            <li>you just didn&#x27;t cut i although the smell is great</li>
            <li>the techno glow is almost nude with like a gold glittery shimmer that looks great with every outfit and over any lip stain or lip stick.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT IS A GREAT PLUMPER!!!PROBABLY</li>
            <li>I use the orginal, and then apply a sort of nude lipstick over it with a lip brush and it looks great.</li>
            <li>and they looked really great.</li>
            <li>It looked great</li>
            <li>THEN YOULL BE SURE TO GET USED TO IT!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does tingle and make your lips warm, but it is a very pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li>It DOES create a wonderful rosy color though and it&#x27;s the most flattering lip product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>For your lips, this is a good thing, but if you should happen to get it on anything else, say hello to the jelly mustache/giant</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll tingle for about 10 minutes and then look gorgeous.</li>
            <li>YOURE POUT WILL NEVER LOOK SOOOO HUGE!!</li>
            <li>The illusion of sexy sensuality will all be shot as your kisser declares, \\&quot;What&#x27;s that!?</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>- my best friend in fact called me on the lip gloss, saying that he could tell I had gloss on - who wants that?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched for a good plumper and so far, this one works the best.  </li>
            <li>I liked the burn, as it makes it feel like it is working.</li>
            <li>It really plumped up my lips (especially my top lip).</li>
            <li>and it does make your lips a nice healthy redish color.</li>
            <li>This was rated one of the top lip plumpers.  </li>
            <li>&quot; but i would say its more of a prickly heat feeling).</li>
            <li>but they got a lovely rosy color that&#x27;s nicer than any of the hundreds of lipsticks I&#x27;ve bought and been disillusioned with.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>Most lip plumpers on the market today work to &#x27;plump&#x27; your lips through this process of irritation.      </li>
            <li>The more cinnamon oil a lip plumper contains, the more irritated your lips will become and the fuller they will look.</li>
            <li>, I want MORE sting, thats how you get \\&quot;pout\\</li>
            <li>In fact, I actually enjoyed the tingling sensation because it felt like the lip gloss was working.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gloss is pretty, tastes great, and results in a pretty flush to your lips.  </li>
            <li>It really gives your lipstick a more smooth, even surface in which to adhere and that allows for greater coverage and longer wear. :)</li>
            <li>Also, stick with the original...</li>
            <li>I originally got this as a sample from Sephora.</li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN, but if you LOVE that lip plumper tingle you cant get any better than this.</li>
            <li>I looked in the mirror and he was right!</li>
            <li>Good thing it was only a sample though.</li>
            <li>good for girls that need a big boost, but not for already plump girls like me.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;ve never had any issues with lip sensitivity, I really think you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>(I mean beautiful, magazine cover smoothe!)</li>
            <li>You will feal a mild tingling for a minute or so but not to the point where your lips feel like they are about to fall off.</li>
            <li>First - this stuff actually tastes good while doing what it says it does - plumps up your lips.</li>
            <li>your (lip liner, lip gloss, lipstick), then lightly brush your lips with Lip Injection; make sure you wipe all excess gloss on the edge of the tube first, the brush should be nearly \\&quot;empty\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This irritation is amplified when placed on one of the thinnest skinned, and most sensitive areas of your body -- your lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s up to you to decide if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>LIP VENOM IS NOT AS POWERFUL</li>
            <li>I do not kiss him right after I have put it on though either.</li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone looking to get a plumper that works right away...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably the best shade of lip color possible for anyone b/c it is your completely natural lip, only flushed.  </li>
            <li>As long as you keep it within your lipline, it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the gloss tingles a bit when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moderately intense, but so worth it because when you feel the tingle, you know it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li>Back to venom, a MUCH better product all around.</li>
            <li>I will continue using it, but in the future plan to layer it on top of lip fusion gloss.  </li>
            <li>If your new lip look generates some amorous advances and you find yourself kissed, you will transfer all this wonderful stuff, and all the irritating side effects, to your kissing partner.</li>
            <li>Immediatly after use my lips didn&#x27;t even burn, but the entire area around my lips turned bright red</li>
            <li>I was very excited about this product and considered it for a long time before I purchased it.</li>
            <li>i do believe my lips plump slightly but honestly that is not the reason i wear it.</li>
            <li>My lips were noticeably fuller but they certainly weren&#x27;t Angelia Jolie-style.</li>
            <li>It certainly wasn&#x27;t unbearable for me (in fact, it just felt as if my lips had fallen asleep and were now waking up)</li>
            <li>I was ready for a tingling sensation, but that much pain was too much.</li>
            <li>product REALLY DOES temporarily plump.  </li>
            <li>You could very well be allergic to this product.</li>
            <li>Lip venom did not do that as much as this one.  </li>
            <li>Too much gloss, or if you get it too close to the edges will give you a ring around your lips.  </li>
            <li>this one is hardcore and really stings my lips.</li>
            <li>However, my lips really looked fuller.</li>
            <li>so I could compare, and much to my surprise, there was no difference in size.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it does irritate your lips, but that&#x27;s the whole point.  </li>
            <li>and i tried a sample of this product..to see if it really worked.</li>
            <li>it was just really really tingly).</li>
            <li>and I really layered it on.  </li>
            <li>and I was very</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few friends try the gloss, and they&#x27;ve gone out and bought a tube for their own use.</li>
            <li>(as in a different review it is true that if you wear it and leave your hair down the wind can whip your hair into it and drag it across your face leaving you with a red line across your face, lol roll up the windows in the car ladies!!!)  </li>
            <li>but it did turn my lips a nice rosy shade (I used clear but because it brings blood to the lips they turn a natural pink).  </li>
            <li>We both have very sensitive skin so that could be the reason, but I still would not recommend this product to anyone just because it doesn&#x27;t really work anyway.</li>
            <li>It is high shine, and does plump up your lips.</li>
            <li>ALTHOUGH IT IS A TINY BIT INTENSE WHEN YOU TRY IT FOR THE FIRST 5 TIMES &lt;br</li>
            <li>I didnt find the scent that strong and liked the texture, it was thick enough for the shine to last on me but not sticky, and seemed to moisturize my lips.</li>
            <li>gloss\\&quot; with a lip brush to the MIDDLE of your upper and lower lip, lightly blending towards the corner of your mouth.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and why are some people surprised that it stings a little, not much</li>
            <li>My lips are not small</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my lips became so red and luscious, I didn&#x27;t even want to put lipstick over it for fear of ruining the effect.  </li>
            <li>As far as kissing goes my hubby has never complained of burning lips, than again</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was totally amazed that it really plumped up my lips!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting, tastes fine and is not sticky.</li>
            <li>Think of it as wearing black pants to conceal your toosh and white shirt to accent your chest :) &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>But interestingly, when I filled in the other half of my lips, all of sudden they looked larger.</li>
            <li>I have tried the clear frosty sample of this twice now.</li>
            <li>I think the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; factor is completely subjective because I have used this product for about a year now, and have given it numerous times as a gift to rousing thanks.</li>
            <li>I guess it all depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive or chapped lips, this product probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>and i dont know if the results warrant spending that much on lip gloss for the future when this tube runs out.</li>
            <li>But just in the center will be just right.  </li>
            <li>okay i am a serious lip plumper junkie.</li>
            <li>DO NOT put this product on a dry or sensitive lip or the sensation will move from irritation to pure pain.</li>
            <li>(if your lips aren&#x27;t too sensitive): apply a coat or 2 of this on completely bare lips (no balm!)</li>
            <li>The first time I smeared it on thick right out to the edge of my lips</li>
            <li>My lips instantly turned a light red..and got slightly plumper.</li>
            <li>i dont even care about if it makes my lips appear larger than normal</li>
            <li>while i have pretty voluptuous lips already, i am always curious about these lip plumping glosses.</li>
            <li>Within two minutes of applying I developed a rash around my mouth and red streaks on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Your body&#x27;s natural response to this irritant is to send extra blood to the area of irritation to try to protect it from harm.</li>
            <li>The Benefit plump doesn&#x27;t plump your lips as much as it works more like a lipstick base... which will smooth out the little lines on your lips that we all have (especially in the winter months).</li>
            <li>I think those who felt that the effects were \\&quot;minimal\\&quot; were perhaps expecting a little too much.</li>

            <li> My lips instantly turned a light red..and got slightly plumper.</li>
            <li> i dont even care about if it makes my lips appear larger than normal</li>
            <li> while i have pretty voluptuous lips already, i am always curious about these lip plumping glosses.</li>
            <li> Within two minutes of applying I developed a rash around my mouth and red streaks on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Your body&#x27;s natural response to this irritant is to send extra blood to the area of irritation to try to protect it from harm.</li>
            <li> The Benefit plump doesn&#x27;t plump your lips as much as it works more like a lipstick base... which will smooth out the little lines on your lips that we all have (especially in the winter months).</li>
            <li> I think those who felt that the effects were \\&quot;minimal\\&quot; were perhaps expecting a little too much.</li>
            <li> It doesnt last that long though..probably only about an hour or two &lt;br</li>
            <li> You may not realize you have tiny, dry cracks in your lips until this stuff gets in there.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;HINT: For those of you who gave up on the product completely here is a little hint to make your lips appear fuller: After you apply your lip liner, lip gloss or lipstick, use a lighter colored \\&quot;wet look\\&quot; gloss (I recommend Chanel&#x27;s, but if you have a clear gloss mix it with a pink shimmery one).</li>
            <li> My medium sized lips were only slightly plumper and the effect didnt seem to last long (maybe 1/2 an hour)</li>
            <li> The extra blood flow in the lip area, due to the irritation, is what makes your lips appear &#x27;fuller.&#x27;</li>
            <li> The feeling was something like having eaten some spicy mexican food, and the taste was fruity - not like other plumpers I have bought that were just disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; you will most certainly hate this product.</li>
            <li> the package says tingle a little, but it burns, but only for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> (whatever skin this product touches, it turns red--if it touches above or below your lips, it makes your mouth look a little clown-like).</li>
            <li> or the skin around your lips will get a little red.</li>
            <li> But be very careful to not go outside with your hair down and lip injection on while it&#x27;s windy.  </li>
            <li> Apply the \\&quot;wet look</li>
            <li> and she couldnt handle it and removed it after about 15 sec.</li>
            <li> I think the needle-prick sensation that it causes plus the glossiness makes my lips feel and appear fuller, but not actually be much fuller.</li>
            <li> An hour and an antihistamine later the redness started to soothe down, as did the slight swelling of my lips.</li>
            <li> I was slightly nervous to try this product after reading about the burning, but it only produced a slight tingling for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you feel an EXTREME stinging sensation, immediately discontinue the use of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other too faced one, the pout one, and teh du wop one, and this has by far been the worse.</li>
            <li> It tingles, yes, but I have never experienced \\&quot;burning\\&quot;, and I swim outdoors, so my lips are frequently chapped, and</li>
            <li> While they do work to make your lips look slightly fuller, don&#x27;t expect a miracle here,</li>
            <li> What this product does is create an allergic reaction in your lips so the blood rushes to the surface and the lips swell slightly.</li>
            <li> but there was a slight difference</li>
            <li> Just add a small ammount to the center of your lips, not all over.  </li>
            <li> often times a little sunburned.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as scary, or dangerous as it sounds, and the effect is natural and pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it!</li>
            <li> My lips BURNED, and although they got \\&quot;pouty\\&quot; the burning was a little too harsh for me to take.</li>
            <li> and I suppose it made my lips a little bigger, but that was too much a price to pay for the horrible red streaks that started to appear on my cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li> didnt want my 20 bucks to go to waste however, so</li>
            <li> And I should add that its seen me through a few make-out sessions, and I never heard any complaints.</li>
            <li> The feeling stops after a couple of minutes and you have slightly plumpes, pinker lips....very kissable!</li>
            <li> God forbid you get this stuff in a cold sore, split lip, sun burnt lip or any other open mouth wound</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is not very good.  </li>
            <li> No emolient quality, just irritating, slick, nasty tasting stuff that I am sad to have paid good money for.  </li>
            <li> Burns a little but nothing really uncomfortable and the burn goes away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The way this product works is the cinnamon oil contained in the ingredients is a common irritant to the skin.</li>
            <li> &quot; duh.</li>
            <li> It burned so badly and after a few minutes, I asked my boyfriend if my lips looked bigger</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, and from what I had read here I was worried that it would be painful, it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The swelling is very small, but you can notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> Reading other reviews of this product I was a little shocked.</li>
            <li> Stupidly, I wiped it off with the back of my hand and the gloss formed a welt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a worse lip plumping treatment.</li>
            <li> This product works by irritating your lips, so you&#x27;re going to feel it.</li>
            <li> My friend said it didnt hurt her so bad and that the feeling goes away after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> sorry lip injection</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> But some two hours afterwards my boyfriend got an even worse reaction on his face just because I kissed him and some of the gloss was still on!</li>
            <li> ITS SLIMY AND JUST PLAIN AWFUL..</li>
            <li> This is too expensive and hurts!</li>
            <li> This is one of the bad things about the product.  </li>
            <li> after trying a sample of two-faced lip injection from sephora, yes my lips tingled, but the pain was not as bad as the pain i endured after trying duwop lip venom.</li>
            <li> And I switched to this product from DuWop LipVenom which I found to be really painful.</li>
            <li> Tastes HORRIBLE, chemical nasty bitter stuff, and rather than plump my lips</li>
            <li> I find this especially irritating in the corners of the mouth.      </li>
            <li> A dreadful product that should come with a warning.  </li>
            <li> The texture is nasty, imagine smoothing vinyl on your lips, smell, taste and all</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was very excited about this product and considered it for a long time before I purchased it. My lips are not small but I wanted to have a fuller \\&quot;pouty\\&quot; look. When I received the item, I applied a generous coat on my lips as suggested ***BIG MISTAKE***. My lips BURNED, and although they got \\&quot;pouty\\&quot; the burning was a little too harsh for me to take. I was ready for a tingling sensation, but that much pain was too much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didnt want my 20 bucks to go to waste however, so this is my recommendation with this product: &lt;br /&gt;***Apply your (lip liner, lip gloss, lipstick), then lightly brush your lips with Lip Injection; make sure you wipe all excess gloss on the edge of the tube first, the brush should be nearly \\&quot;empty\\&quot;. You will feal a mild tingling for a minute or so but not to the point where your lips feel like they are about to fall off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HINT: For those of you who gave up on the product completely here is a little hint to make your lips appear fuller: After you apply your lip liner, lip gloss or lipstick, use a lighter colored \\&quot;wet look\\&quot; gloss (I recommend Chanel&#x27;s, but if you have a clear gloss mix it with a pink shimmery one). Apply the \\&quot;wet look gloss\\&quot; with a lip brush to the MIDDLE of your upper and lower lip, lightly blending towards the corner of your mouth. The lighter colored middle and darker corners will give your lips a fuller effect. Think of it as wearing black pants to conceal your toosh and white shirt to accent your chest :) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps</li>
            <li> This was rated one of the top lip plumpers.  I work in the beauty industry.  We had Lip Injection and another lip plumper that was overpriced for $40.  When customers were drawn to the $40 expecting results, I told them about this one instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product REALLY DOES temporarily plump.  But be very careful to not go outside with your hair down and lip injection on while it&#x27;s windy.  This is one of the bad things about the product.  If it gets on your face, it plumps that part as well.  When pulling the hair off of my sticky lips, I walked into work looking like I had been scratched in the face a million times by a cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If plump lips is what you&#x27;re looking for, GO FOR IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you feel an EXTREME stinging sensation, immediately discontinue the use of it.  You could very well be allergic to this product.</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is not very good.  It did not work for me and the one time it did it created a red ring around my mouth.  Lip venom did not do that as much as this one.  sorry lip injection you just didn&#x27;t cut i although the smell is great</li>
            <li> Yes, the gloss tingles a bit when you first put it on.  Just add a small ammount to the center of your lips, not all over.  Then press your lips together.  Too much gloss, or if you get it too close to the edges will give you a ring around your lips.  But just in the center will be just right.  The gloss is pretty, tastes great, and results in a pretty flush to your lips.  The swelling is very small, but you can notice a difference.  I&#x27;ve had a few friends try the gloss, and they&#x27;ve gone out and bought a tube for their own use.</li>
            <li> A dreadful product that should come with a warning.  Within two minutes of applying I developed a rash around my mouth and red streaks on my cheeks.  Who cares about plump lips (which did not happen by the way)when you are red and blotchy.  Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> okay i am a serious lip plumper junkie. i dont even care about if it makes my lips appear larger than normal, all i want is that tingle it gives you!!! and man does this one do it for me!!! i have tried almost every lip plumper known to man and i always come back to this one. this one is hardcore and really stings my lips. my husband HATES when i wear it because if i kiss him his skin swells up and turns red, and i NEVER kiss my toddler son with it on!!! i let my sister try it once and she couldnt handle it and removed it after about 15 sec. THIS IS NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN, but if you LOVE that lip plumper tingle you cant get any better than this. (as in a different review it is true that if you wear it and leave your hair down the wind can whip your hair into it and drag it across your face leaving you with a red line across your face, lol roll up the windows in the car ladies!!!)  i do believe my lips plump slightly but honestly that is not the reason i wear it. the techno glow is almost nude with like a gold glittery shimmer that looks great with every outfit and over any lip stain or lip stick. i cant recommend it enough for those who can handle it. (a lot of people say it \\&quot;burns\\&quot; but i would say its more of a prickly heat feeling).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a worse lip plumping treatment. I&#x27;ve tried the other too faced one, the pout one, and teh du wop one, and this has by far been the worse. Immediatly after use my lips didn&#x27;t even burn, but the entire area around my lips turned bright red and then my lips started to burn. I kept it on until the burning went away, but my lips didn&#x27;t plump. i put it on about 10 min ago and the redness still hasn&#x27;t left and my lips still burn after wiping it off because it didn&#x27;t work. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. i wouldve given it 0 stars if it was an option. Good thing it was only a sample though. My face is still red....</li>
            <li> while i have pretty voluptuous lips already, i am always curious about these lip plumping glosses. after trying a sample of two-faced lip injection from sephora, yes my lips tingled, but the pain was not as bad as the pain i endured after trying duwop lip venom. the pain with two faced is the same as getting your lips sunburned. i had an allergic reaction to a medication i was taking for eczema and my lips swelled up, this lip gloss created the same look and feel as that. good for girls that need a big boost, but not for already plump girls like me.</li>
            <li> One word... BURN!!!  I tried this gloss at a store and I had to run and look for a napkin to wipe it off within 10 seconds.  I didnt even have a chance to see if it worked because I could not take the burning!  My friend said it didnt hurt her so bad and that the feeling goes away after a few minutes.  I guess it all depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li> I have tried the clear frosty sample of this twice now. The first time I smeared it on thick right out to the edge of my lips and it did make the red blotchy ring around my mouth as others say. However, my lips really looked fuller. The second time, I applied it to only one side of my lips so I could compare, and much to my surprise, there was no difference in size.  The inside of my lips seemed a bit puffier but this did not force my lips outward.  But interestingly, when I filled in the other half of my lips, all of sudden they looked larger. I think the needle-prick sensation that it causes plus the glossiness makes my lips feel and appear fuller, but not actually be much fuller. It DOES create a wonderful rosy color though and it&#x27;s the most flattering lip product I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s long lasting, tastes fine and is not sticky. It&#x27;s probably the best shade of lip color possible for anyone b/c it is your completely natural lip, only flushed.  Buy it for a tinted gloss, plus any masochistic  tendencies you have!</li>
            <li> EEK.  This stuff only reddens your lips (and hurts!) when you apply it.  No plumping or softening occurs, only glossy red lips that are obviously covered in goopy gloss.  Get some regular tinted lip gloss and you&#x27;ll get the same result - my best friend in fact called me on the lip gloss, saying that he could tell I had gloss on - who wants that?  AVOID.  I fell for the Sephora &#x27;check out product&#x27; thing and bought it - meanwhile it&#x27;s tiny AND $18!  Don&#x27;t buy it for lip plumping, it just burns. (So obviously don&#x27;t get amourous with anyone, they&#x27;ll think something is up!)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I&#x27;m impressed. Tried this on and, yes, it tingles. Burns a little but nothing really uncomfortable and the burn goes away in a few minutes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not only did it plump out my limps and smoothe lines (I mean beautiful, magazine cover smoothe!) but they got a lovely rosy color that&#x27;s nicer than any of the hundreds of lipsticks I&#x27;ve bought and been disillusioned with. Fabulous!</li>
            <li> This liquid turns anything it touches into a defined, two-times-bigger, reddened version of its former self. For your lips, this is a good thing, but if you should happen to get it on anything else, say hello to the jelly mustache/giant popped whitehead look for the next two hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for a good plumper and so far, this one works the best.  I use Lip Venom, LipFusion, and Dr. Wexler&#x27;s lip plumper, but Lip injection outdoes them. Yes, it does irritate your lips, but that&#x27;s the whole point.  As long as you keep it within your lipline, it&#x27;s amazing.  The first time I used it, my lips became so red and luscious, I didn&#x27;t even want to put lipstick over it for fear of ruining the effect.  It&#x27;s moderately intense, but so worth it because when you feel the tingle, you know it&#x27;s working.  My tip...(if your lips aren&#x27;t too sensitive): apply a coat or 2 of this on completely bare lips (no balm!) for maximum effect.  They&#x27;ll tingle for about 10 minutes and then look gorgeous. Also, stick with the original...the colored plumpers don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I tried this as an alternative to lip venom.  MY BIG mistake!  ( They had flash but not the regular so I decided to try this one)  Tastes HORRIBLE, chemical nasty bitter stuff, and rather than plump my lips it just irritated the borders of my lips and made them splotchy and red.  The texture is nasty, imagine smoothing vinyl on your lips, smell, taste and all and you got it.  No emolient quality, just irritating, slick, nasty tasting stuff that I am sad to have paid good money for.  Back to venom, a MUCH better product all around.</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews of this product I was a little shocked. I think the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; factor is completely subjective because I have used this product for about a year now, and have given it numerous times as a gift to rousing thanks. It tingles, yes, but I have never experienced \\&quot;burning\\&quot;, and I swim outdoors, so my lips are frequently chapped, and often times a little sunburned. And I switched to this product from DuWop LipVenom which I found to be really painful. The best part about the lip injection is that it plumps and glosses, giving you a beautiful magazine cover look. And I should add that its seen me through a few make-out sessions, and I never heard any complaints.</li>
            <li> The way this product works is the cinnamon oil contained in the ingredients is a common irritant to the skin. This irritation is amplified when placed on one of the thinnest skinned, and most sensitive areas of your body -- your lips. The burning, stinging sensation you feel is your lip letting you know there is an irritant on your lips. Your body&#x27;s natural response to this irritant is to send extra blood to the area of irritation to try to protect it from harm. The extra blood flow in the lip area, due to the irritation, is what makes your lips appear &#x27;fuller.&#x27; Most lip plumpers on the market today work to &#x27;plump&#x27; your lips through this process of irritation.      The more cinnamon oil a lip plumper contains, the more irritated your lips will become and the fuller they will look. Because of the irritation and subsequent blood flow increase, your lips will also look darker.      While they do work to make your lips look slightly fuller, don&#x27;t expect a miracle here, lip plumpers containing cinnamon oil are not for everyone. If you have &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; you will most certainly hate this product. DO NOT put this product on a dry or sensitive lip or the sensation will move from irritation to pure pain. God forbid you get this stuff in a cold sore, split lip, sun burnt lip or any other open mouth wound or you will want to slice your lips off. You may not realize you have tiny, dry cracks in your lips until this stuff gets in there. Ouch! I find this especially irritating in the corners of the mouth.      If your new lip look generates some amorous advances and you find yourself kissed, you will transfer all this wonderful stuff, and all the irritating side effects, to your kissing partner. Whoops! Your gig is up! The illusion of sexy sensuality will all be shot as your kisser declares, \\&quot;What&#x27;s that!? Why are my lips on fire!?\\&quot; Angelina Jolie you are not.      The results are moderate and for some, the sensation is tolerable. It&#x27;s up to you to decide if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this lip gloss after trying duwop lip venom and liking it...but it was a bit too glossy for me. What this product does is create an allergic reaction in your lips so the blood rushes to the surface and the lips swell slightly. This isn&#x27;t as scary, or dangerous as it sounds, and the effect is natural and pretty. I liked the burn, as it makes it feel like it is working. The feeling stops after a couple of minutes and you have slightly plumpes, pinker lips....very kissable!</li>
            <li> I went to Sephora today..and i tried a sample of this product..to see if it really worked. After a minute..my lips started to tingle (it didnt hurt at all..it was just really really tingly). My lips instantly turned a light red..and got slightly plumper. It didnt plump alot..but there was a slight difference and it does make your lips a nice healthy redish color. It doesnt last that long though..probably only about an hour or two &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> MOVE OVER ANGELINA JOLIE HERE I COME LOL.THIS PRODUCT IS A GREAT PLUMPER!!!PROBABLY THE BEST IN THE MARKETS!! LIP VENOM IS NOT AS POWERFUL AS THIS IS,ALTHOUGH IT IS A TINY BIT INTENSE WHEN YOU TRY IT FOR THE FIRST 5 TIMES &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BUT THEN YOULL BE SURE TO GET USED TO IT!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AND YOURE POUT WILL NEVER LOOK SOOOO HUGE!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SO TRY IT!!</li>
            <li> THIS PLUMPER TASTES GROSS AND DOESNT WORK AT ALL .... ITS SLIMY AND JUST PLAIN AWFUL.. IF YOU WANT PLUMPER LIPS .. GO WITH LIP VENOM ... A MUCH BETTER PRODUCT OVER ALL!!!</li>
            <li> From reading the others reviews it may not be for everyone. I originally got this as a sample from Sephora. It does burn though. the package says tingle a little, but it burns, but only for a couple minutes. It is high shine, and does plump up your lips. I use the orginal, and then apply a sort of nude lipstick over it with a lip brush and it looks great. As far as kissing goes my hubby has never complained of burning lips, than again I do not kiss him right after I have put it on though either.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It really plumped up my lips (especially my top lip). I think those who felt that the effects were \\&quot;minimal\\&quot; were perhaps expecting a little too much. My lips were noticeably fuller but they certainly weren&#x27;t Angelia Jolie-style. When it comes to the \\&quot;jam mustache\\&quot; look, that simply happens if you get some of the product on the outside lines of your mouth (whatever skin this product touches, it turns red--if it touches above or below your lips, it makes your mouth look a little clown-like). But preventing this from happening is as simple as keeping your lipstick within the lines. &lt;br /&gt;The only issue some people may have is the tingling. This product works by irritating your lips, so you&#x27;re going to feel it. It certainly wasn&#x27;t unbearable for me (in fact, it just felt as if my lips had fallen asleep and were now waking up) but if you have sensitive or chapped lips, this product probably isn&#x27;t for you. But if you&#x27;ve never had any issues with lip sensitivity, I really think you&#x27;ll love it. I just started using it and have already made it part of my daily make-up routine!</li>
            <li> This is a good product and why are some people surprised that it stings a little, not much, I want MORE sting, thats how you get \\&quot;pout\\&quot; duh.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this product, but I did sample a tester at the mall. It burned so badly and after a few minutes, I asked my boyfriend if my lips looked bigger and he said no. I looked in the mirror and he was right! They looked no different. Stupidly, I wiped it off with the back of my hand and the gloss formed a welt! This is too expensive and hurts! Plus, it doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s not worth it! I would reccomend the \\&quot;Quickie Chronicles.\\&quot; I haven&#x27;t bought any of these either but I did see them at the mall and they looked really great.</li>
            <li> I was slightly nervous to try this product after reading about the burning, but it only produced a slight tingling for me and I really layered it on.  In fact, I actually enjoyed the tingling sensation because it felt like the lip gloss was working. My medium sized lips were only slightly plumper and the effect didnt seem to last long (maybe 1/2 an hour) but it did turn my lips a nice rosy shade (I used clear but because it brings blood to the lips they turn a natural pink).  I didnt find the scent that strong and liked the texture, it was thick enough for the shine to last on me but not sticky, and seemed to moisturize my lips. I will continue using it, but in the future plan to layer it on top of lip fusion gloss.  I have found the two combined give me the plumpest lips, though Im still not anywhere in Angelina territory and i dont know if the results warrant spending that much on lip gloss for the future when this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> First - this stuff actually tastes good while doing what it says it does - plumps up your lips. I was skeptical at first, and from what I had read here I was worried that it would be painful, it wasn&#x27;t. The feeling was something like having eaten some spicy mexican food, and the taste was fruity - not like other plumpers I have bought that were just disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does tingle and make your lips warm, but it is a very pleasant feeling. Try and keep the gloss within your lip line though or the skin around your lips will get a little red. The redness goes away in about 20 minutes, but if you are going to be wearing this under your lipstick - then put some foundation on over your lips before applying your lipstick and lip liner and you won&#x27;t see the redness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was totally amazed that it really plumped up my lips! They looked luscious and totally kissable. It looked great and I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone looking to get a plumper that works right away... I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend Benefit lip plump to wear over the too faced plumper and under your regular lipstick. The Benefit plump doesn&#x27;t plump your lips as much as it works more like a lipstick base... which will smooth out the little lines on your lips that we all have (especially in the winter months). It really gives your lipstick a more smooth, even surface in which to adhere and that allows for greater coverage and longer wear. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been forever dreaming of fuller lips and on a recent trip to Paris I purchased this product from a local Sephora. When I put the gloss on it did start to tingle as promised and I suppose it made my lips a little bigger, but that was too much a price to pay for the horrible red streaks that started to appear on my cheeks and neck. An hour and an antihistamine later the redness started to soothe down, as did the slight swelling of my lips. But some two hours afterwards my boyfriend got an even worse reaction on his face just because I kissed him and some of the gloss was still on! We both have very sensitive skin so that could be the reason, but I still would not recommend this product to anyone just because it doesn&#x27;t really work anyway.</li>
