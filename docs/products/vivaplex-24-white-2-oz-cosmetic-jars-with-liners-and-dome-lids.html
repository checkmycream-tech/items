            <li>Great quality and the caps are nice - easy on and off.</li>
            <li>These are nice and the product cover is nice.</li>
            <li>They are a perfect fit, securely snapping onto and into the tubs.  </li>
            <li>I started making my own beauty products because of all the chemicals in store bought.  </li>
            <li>The shape of the jar and the added liner makes your product look nice.  </li>
            <li>:) very pleased.</li>
            <li>These have worked out perfectly for my new projects in making hand and face lotions with coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed, thank you. :)</li>
            <li>Sturdy and cute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order more when needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered pretty labels that will fit on the lids and will be proud to hand them out.  </li>
            <li>Quality is fine.</li>
            <li>These little jars are perfect for my use.</li>
            <li>Having internal cove is great also.</li>
            <li>You cannot beat Amazon Prime free shipping and delivery time.</li>
            <li>Used for face mask so the inner linner is great at keeping it fresh and sanitary</li>
            <li>Fast shipping high quality good value</li>
            <li>I make and ship coconut oil products and these are excellent as the inner seal actually seals and makes the jar leak proof.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will find many uses for these cute little containers.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>They are not double walled but still nice.</li>
            <li>Good quality and love the thin lid that comes with every container.</li>
            <li>The edges are more sharp than smooth and I hope that does not become a problem as people remove the body butters from my tubs.  </li>
            <li>I personally find that this gives a better seal</li>
            <li>I also wanted to make sure the package I chose would be of equal quality.  </li>
            <li>Would buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Firstly, these include the liner which most containers do not and secondly, they are reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>The liners are thicker than I had expected and are very easy to lift and replace.</li>
            <li>I love that they have the little lid seal, it will make them even more classy.  </li>
            <li>I did not know if they were double walled or how easy they were to screw and unscrew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are very high quality cosmetic jars with protective insert.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Some of these bright white containers had lids that were screwed on so tightly that I was worried about breaking them while removing the lids.  </li>
            <li>But I overall I love it, only 4 stars because of the closing situation.</li>
            <li>Not as heavy duty as they look in picture but good enough for my uses.</li>
            <li>I like that they have the plastic protector under the main lid.</li>
            <li>These containers seal tight, won&#x27;t break and keep the light out.</li>
            <li>Allows potential customers a large enough sample to really know the product.  </li>
            <li>The lids seal very well, and there is just enough height on them for me to add my labels.</li>
            <li>When you put your homemade products in these containers it increases the professional look to your gifts.</li>
            <li>Most I&#x27;ve seen have been thin and flimsy, but that&#x27;s not the case with these.</li>
            <li>Needing small cosmetic jars, I gambled on the [[ASIN:B00Q9CQYCQ 24 New, High Quality, White, 2 oz Cosmetic Jars, with Liners and Dome Lids]] for two reasons.  </li>
            <li>I love these jars and the inner seal is fantastic, although they are a bit hard to close, I guess because the plastic is a little thin.</li>

            <li> These are just right, they&#x27;re a little smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s not a problem.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is hard enough to be sturdy when pouring in hot liquids.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For single walled cosmetic containers, I think these are terrific.  </li>
            <li> The container opening is wide enough and shallow enough to be very convenient for &amp;</li>
            <li> It does hold 2 fluid ounces of water, less of my product which is a whipped solid.</li>
            <li> These jars are thin walled, however they do hold up well to pouring in hot oils.  </li>
            <li> Overall a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Received as expected.  </li>
            <li> What I expected and needed.</li>
            <li> then i expected</li>
            <li> To my surprise, the threading is thin and extensive, so removing the lid takes several turns.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is them being a product of China and</li>
            <li> The screw on lid is water tight when you use the lid liner (not without).</li>
            <li> They spill even when you close them tight.</li>
            <li> I like that they come with the little disc liner.</li>
            <li> And maybe generate a little repeat business.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to make my organic raw body butter, (peppers and plums body confection) as little gifts.  </li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t seal, so I&#x27;m not sure what you could even store in them.</li>
            <li> Another surprise was that the gauge of the plastic is very thin, so thin that I was shocked to see my finger through it when held up to a distant light.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with these.</li>
            <li> These jars a poor quality and very thin.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed.</li>

            <li> These are great! The seal is perfect for my body scrubs, it helps the oil not spill out the sides. The lids seal very well, and there is just enough height on them for me to add my labels. :) very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love them! We are making all kinds of lotions to put in them!</li>
            <li> Absolutely PERFECT for what I need!</li>
            <li> Size is 1 1/2 OZ not 2 OZ. Every thing else its excelent!!!...</li>
            <li> The jars a thin and cheap feeling. But they come with a cover to put under the lid. So that&#x27;s a good bonus.</li>
            <li> Good price. Quality is fine. I like that they come with the little disc liner.</li>
            <li> These jars a poor quality and very thin. They also don&#x27;t seal, so I&#x27;m not sure what you could even store in them. Overall a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel, stays sealed, even in flight.</li>
            <li> Received as expected.  Perfect size for samples of scrubs, creams, etc.  Allows potential customers a large enough sample to really know the product.  Will probably order again soon.</li>

            <li> These make awesome containers for my salves. When you put your homemade products in these containers it increases the professional look to your gifts.</li>
            <li> Mine came in white.  Not as heavy duty as they look in picture but good enough for my uses.</li>
            <li> Started making my own lotion and these are perfect!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT! I love these containers! I make and ship coconut oil products and these are excellent as the inner seal actually seals and makes the jar leak proof.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed. It says 2oz but in reality it&#x27;s only a 1oz container. Don&#x27;t even waste your money</li>
            <li> Just as described. I like that they have the plastic protector under the main lid.</li>

            <li> What I expected and needed.</li>
            <li> Lids do not have inner seal so if that cover gets lost any liquid like product will leak.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and cute. I use these for sample sizes of my scrubs and body butters.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!! Perfect for my home made body butters!!</li>
            <li> Needing small cosmetic jars, I gambled on the [[ASIN:B00Q9CQYCQ 24 New, High Quality, White, 2 oz Cosmetic Jars, with Liners and Dome Lids]] for two reasons.  Firstly, these include the liner which most containers do not and secondly, they are reasonably priced.  I did not know if they were double walled or how easy they were to screw and unscrew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are packaged perfectly in a box with light plastic sheets separating each layer.  Some of these bright white containers had lids that were screwed on so tightly that I was worried about breaking them while removing the lids.  To my surprise, the threading is thin and extensive, so removing the lid takes several turns.  Another surprise was that the gauge of the plastic is very thin, so thin that I was shocked to see my finger through it when held up to a distant light.  There is no liner inside the lid and it&#x27;s the same gauge as the tub.  The edges are more sharp than smooth and I hope that does not become a problem as people remove the body butters from my tubs.  The liners are thicker than I had expected and are very easy to lift and replace. Most I&#x27;ve seen have been thin and flimsy, but that&#x27;s not the case with these. They are a perfect fit, securely snapping onto and into the tubs.  With the butters in the containers lubricating the threads, screwing and unscrewing the lid is smoother.  The lid fits as well without the liners, so if you don&#x27;t need them, it&#x27;s no problem.  I personally find that this gives a better seal so I use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For single walled cosmetic containers, I think these are terrific.  They hold up to labeling well and I intend to order them in the 4 ounce size.  The weight of the tub without product, liner or lid weighs around 9 grams.  It does hold 2 fluid ounces of water, less of my product which is a whipped solid.</li>
            <li> These worked great for my project.  I would definitely order them again if needed.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and very good quality. I&#x27;ll order more when needed.</li>
            <li> This is a product of China, because it is not in the product description I am taking away a star.  I purposefully looked for products made in the USA.  I started making my own beauty products because of all the chemicals in store bought.  I also wanted to make sure the package I chose would be of equal quality.  These jars are thin walled, however they do hold up well to pouring in hot oils.  The shape of the jar and the added liner makes your product look nice.  They are the perfect size for diaper ointment and body/face butters/moisturizers.  My only complaint is them being a product of China and it not stating that in the product details.</li>
            <li> Great jars for cosmetics. Used for face mask so the inner linner is great at keeping it fresh and sanitary</li>
            <li> Perfect size! Good quality and love the thin lid that comes with every container. Would buy more in the future. Excellent product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great buy, they work great for my homemade lotion.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping high quality good value</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Sturdy and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These have worked out perfectly for my new projects in making hand and face lotions with coconut oil. I also purchased the 2oz. containers&lt;br /&gt;and they are just as great! These containers seal tight, won&#x27;t break and keep the light out. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Great jars. They work perfect for storing the homemade body butters I make to sell. Great product quality.</li>
            <li> Great Bargain better then i expected</li>
            <li> I ordered these for shower gifts for my daughter&#x27;s baby shower.  I&#x27;m going to make my organic raw body butter, (peppers and plums body confection) as little gifts.  These are just right, they&#x27;re a little smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s not a problem.  I love that they have the little lid seal, it will make them even more classy.  I&#x27;ve ordered pretty labels that will fit on the lids and will be proud to hand them out.  And maybe generate a little repeat business. All in all they are perfect.</li>
            <li> These little jars are perfect for my use. I am making lip balm. The plastic is hard enough to be sturdy when pouring in hot liquids. The screw on lid is water tight when you use the lid liner (not without). The container opening is wide enough and shallow enough to be very convenient for &amp;#34;finger dipping.&amp;#34; I often use it without the screw on lid - just the liner, for ease of use. I&#x27;m sure I will find many uses for these cute little containers.</li>
            <li> Not happy with these. They spill even when you close them tight.</li>
            <li> These are very high quality cosmetic jars with protective insert. I needed something for an emergency order. You cannot beat Amazon Prime free shipping and delivery time. Will definitely order again!</li>
