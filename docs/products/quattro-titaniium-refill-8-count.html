            <li>When she gets around to using I&#x27;s sure she&amp;#34;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>they are very cheap, compare to the store prices.</li>
            <li>Great price and work very well</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>After trying virtually EVERY shaving blade and system, I have finally found the best!  </li>

            <li>the smooth close shave  </li>
            <li>blades cant be rinced and clog up quickly.</li>
            <li>I would pay 11 bucks at Walmart for just 4 razors I got double for a couple dollars more!</li>
            <li>I am surprised to find that for me, I greatly prefer the regular Quattro cartridges as opposed to the Quattro Titanium.</li>

            <li>Keeps you from having to replace the whole razor.</li>
            <li>The regular Quattro lubrication strip is below the blades allowing it to hit your skin before the blades do, resulting in a smooth shave.</li>

            <li>they last much longer than the cheaper blades</li>
            <li>I really like these razor heads because I get such a close shave.....</li>
            <li>The titanium blades last much longer than any other blade, and are well worth the extra buck.</li>
            <li>It takes me forever to really use up a single one of these.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and for less than I could have found elsewhere.  </li>

            <li> It even has a trimer on the back to get those pesky little hairs near your nose.  </li>
            <li> time with the Titanium blades, so will see how long &amp;</li>
            <li> These blades are so sharp and they last a long time because they are made out of titaniium  </li>
            <li> These titanium plated cartridges seem not to be as sharp as the regular -- non titanium -- ones.  </li>
            <li> I also note that I dry it off after each use.</li>
            <li> do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is mainly due to where the lubrication strip is placed.</li>
            <li> If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the regular Quattro blades seem at least equal, if not superior, to the Quattro Titanium blades.</li>
            <li> previous handle came apart after 24</li>
            <li> For some reason I seem to get less nicks from these blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with the titanium blades.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent.  Great price and work very well</li>
            <li> Very happy will order again</li>
            <li> These blades are so sharp and they last a long time because they are made out of titaniium  I love the smooth close shave  they last much longer than the cheaper blades</li>
            <li> These titanium plated cartridges seem not to be as sharp as the regular -- non titanium -- ones.  I think that the plating increases the thickness of the blade&#x27;s edge.  Even though we are dealing with an increase measured in molecular units, nevertheless the blade edge itself is only several molecules in thickness so that the plating does reduce its sharpness by a noticeable amount.</li>
            <li> Great razors. One lasts me for 4 to 6 weeks. I also note that I dry it off after each use.</li>
            <li> After trying virtually EVERY shaving blade and system, I have finally found the best!  The quatro titanium is superior to anything else.  It even has a trimer on the back to get those pesky little hairs near your nose.  The titanium blades last much longer than any other blade, and are well worth the extra buck.</li>
            <li> blades cant be rinced and clog up quickly. pass on these. Gillette fusion is the one!</li>
            <li> I have four problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) Product quality:&lt;br /&gt;My previous handle came apart after 24 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) Usability:&lt;br /&gt;The handles are entirely different shape and contour between models.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not come with a tray to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) Customer Service:&lt;br /&gt;I reported the problem to Shick, which is \\&quot;Energizer Personal Care\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks later, they responded with apology, and committment to send me a coupon to replace the handle.&lt;br /&gt;5 weeks after that email, I received the coupon in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D) The blades clog.  If I have stubble only, then the shaving goo and stubble bits pack into the razor.  It can&#x27;t be rinsed out except maybe by a pressure-washer.  If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go back to Gillette.  They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
            <li> good quality product, will recommend to others who likes to purchase this racers online.  they are very cheap, compare to the store prices.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with the titanium blades. Very, very good value for the money. Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> the product was quickly expedited and we&#x27;re happy with it!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and for less than I could have found elsewhere.  Keeps the hubby happy he loved his razor but had problems finding replacement blades. Keeps you from having to replace the whole razor.</li>
            <li> Very good blades, I like better than Gillette.  For some reason I seem to get less nicks from these blades.</li>
            <li> I really like these razor heads because I get such a close shave.....Great price for the number of blades you get.  Very fast shipping.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I would pay 11 bucks at Walmart for just 4 razors I got double for a couple dollars more! Why would I get them from walmart??</li>
            <li> Good blades.&lt;br /&gt;no issues.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to find that for me, I greatly prefer the regular Quattro cartridges as opposed to the Quattro Titanium. This is mainly due to where the lubrication strip is placed. The regular Quattro lubrication strip is below the blades allowing it to hit your skin before the blades do, resulting in a smooth shave. The Quattro Titanium cartridges are opposite, resulting in more friction.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the regular Quattro blades seem at least equal, if not superior, to the Quattro Titanium blades.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!(who&#x27;s going to find 16 words or more to describe their total&lt;br /&gt;happiness with this product?)here ! There&#x27;s 16,now what?</li>
            <li> These are great. It takes me forever to really use up a single one of these. The price was awesome because I cant get them for that amount, or the quantity, for this price. I was really happy with these.</li>
            <li> These were for my wife.  When she gets around to using I&#x27;s sure she&amp;#34;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> They do the job perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;Nice close shave, beards not very thick of quick growing though.&lt;br /&gt;First time with the Titanium blades, so will see how long &amp; well they last.</li>
            <li> Good price. I got my blades in good time. No complaints from the delivery. But da blades do da same job as a 2 bladed shaver would do.  It&#x27;s meh. Watever.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but these don&#x27;t seem as sharp &amp; don&#x27;t lasy as long as I am used too. Just saying....</li>
            <li> My husband loved them</li>
