            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>One of the best top coats Ive ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Best nail top coat creates a sparkling shine AND DRIES FAST!!!!</li>
            <li>the combo of Zoya plus this top coat...amazing!</li>
            <li>Once I stumbled upon this top coat, I haven&#x27;t used another brand since!</li>
            <li>Even OPI top coat isn&#x27;t as good as this one.</li>
            <li>This top-coat does a great job of making the polish super shiny which I like, but the polish still chops after just a day of wear</li>
            <li>I love this top coat!  </li>
            <li>I have used many top coats and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>If you use cheap polish, splurge on this top coat!</li>
            <li>So now, I don&#x27;t mind painting my nails real quick at night while I&#x27;m watching tv.</li>

            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Of course you have to allow each coat sufficient drying time, but I&#x27;m sure it would still work like magic.</li>
            <li>Its okay but gets &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I work in a nail salon, and my coworker recommended this top coat to me.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Mega Shine Nail Treatment Top Coat.  </li>
            <li>After applying the DFFD top coat,  I place my hands in my nail dryer for a while</li>
            <li>This top coat</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It is the fastest drying top coat</li>
            <li>I was using Sally Hansen &amp;#34;no chip&amp;#34; which I thought pretty good.</li>
            <li>I cant say enough good things about this one!  </li>
            <li>With the awesome shiny top coat on a bold, glossy polish, you can see any nicks pretty clearly.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and dries rapidly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll switch my nail color every couple of days because it&#x27;s that easy to get shiny, smooth nails.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really say whether she liked it or not, just that she picked it up at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>Its so shiny, dries so fast and just looks amazing.</li>
            <li>It is perfect - lasts long and really does help to protect against chipping</li>
            <li>So excited about it.</li>
            <li>This one keeps your nails super shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even started doing some cool nail art.</li>
            <li>I like the Mega shine (in the silver bottle with a blue top) better.</li>
            <li>Diamond Flash dries my polish quickly</li>
            <li>I make sure to be careful for an hour after though just to be sure.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my nail polish always seems to chip and peel right away.</li>
            <li>so I can apply a thick coat of my very favorite top coat --</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful, glossy, classy black.</li>
            <li>This top coat also makes my manicures last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Only top coat I will ever buy</li>
            <li>though this is a quick dry top coat, it really isn&#x27;t...</li>
            <li>This stuff makes your nails dry VERY quickly!</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and leaves a professional looking glossy finish.</li>
            <li>This top coat is supposed to dry in 60 seconds to touch but seems to take longer.  </li>
            <li>When I bought this, to really test it</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I found Seche Vite to be shrinking my polish too much.  </li>
            <li>I like the Sally Hansen Diamond Flash Fast Dry Top Coat and ALWAYS use it in conjunction with Sally Hansen Mega Shine Nail Treatment Top Coat that prevents chipping and has a LONG lasting shine.</li>
            <li>, my nails stayed chip free much longer than my previous top coat (which was actually just a clear nail polish).</li>
            <li>My favorite color to use this with is black.</li>
            <li>Have tried different coats, but this is THE fastest coat ever, my nails are shiny and great just second to dry!!!!</li>
            <li>The top coat might firm up, but the color underneath still takes time.</li>
            <li>It had a nice thick coating and lasted for about 4 days.</li>
            <li>After a while I decided to try something new, so I tried &amp;#34;seche vite&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t trust anything to dry that quickly.</li>
            <li>Most top coats I used dull out after a few days.</li>
            <li>I put them back under the dry after applying the second top coat -- Mega Shine Nail Treatment.  </li>
            <li>It also isnt a thick top coat, which helps to not smudge your nails.</li>
            <li>and I clean everyday and use my hands all day.</li>
            <li>And surprisingly, my favorite black is by wet n&#x27; wild.</li>
            <li>As soon as each finger has the top coat, I dip my fingers into a bowl of ice water and keep dipping them in and out for a few minutes, as long as I can stand the cold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make any polish high end or low end</li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean, bought this at a local drug store for around $6.50</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice thin, shiny coating that looks like my regular pedicures.</li>
            <li>I love nail polish but am really clumsy, which causes me to have to be extra careful when waiting for my  nails to dry.</li>
            <li>I use Sally Hansen Diamond Flash Fast Dry Top Coat after I have applied  Creative Nail  Design Stickey Base Coat,  Salon Science Instant Artificials (this is a nail strengthener),  another coat of  Creative Nail Design Stickey Base Coat and fingernail polish color.  </li>

            <li> As described and on time.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and leaves a professional looking glossy finish.</li>
            <li> I always hated doing my own nails because I thought it was a waste of time- here I would paint my nails, wait FOREVER to try to not smudge them, and then a day or two later, they would chip. I would end up walking around with chipped, ugly nails because I would dread having to waste the time to do it over again after only 5 days. So, here I was going to the salon every 2 1/2 weeks to get a gel/no chip manicure. Between manicures, pedicures, and eyebrow waxes, I was spending $$$ at the nail salon. So, a friend casually mentioned she used this- didn&#x27;t really say whether she liked it or not, just that she picked it up at the drugstore. So, I decided to give it a try. AMAZING! Seriously, I can paint my nails and have them dry to the touch within 30 mins or so. So now, I don&#x27;t mind painting my nails real quick at night while I&#x27;m watching tv. I&#x27;ll switch my nail color every couple of days because it&#x27;s that easy to get shiny, smooth nails. I&#x27;ve even started doing some cool nail art. I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting dressed, washing my face, whatever. This stuff makes your nails dry VERY quickly! And they even stay quite shiny too! I&#x27;ll continue to use this unless someone convinces me that something else is better.</li>
            <li> One of the best top coats Ive ever used. Its so shiny, dries so fast and just looks amazing. It lasts forever too, I didnt have any chipping for at least a week and I clean everyday and use my hands all day.</li>
            <li> I was using Sally Hansen &amp;#34;no chip&amp;#34; which I thought pretty good. It had a nice thick coating and lasted for about 4 days. After a while I decided to try something new, so I tried &amp;#34;seche vite&amp;#34; which I hated. It became so thick that you couldn&#x27;t use it after a while. Plus I had to apply two layers just for it not to chip for 4 days. After reading the reviews for Diamond Flash, I bought this at target for $6.49. I used it over my toes and they looked salon perfect. It&#x27;s a nice thin, shiny coating that looks like my regular pedicures. Just one coat does that job!</li>
            <li> I love nail polish but am really clumsy, which causes me to have to be extra careful when waiting for my  nails to dry. I found this top coat and it has really helped me keep great looking nails. So excited about it. It is very thick and the moment you paint the nail, you can see the shine...it makes nails look wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I thought I&#x27;d tell you my process for perfect nails:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I don&#x27;t use a base coat, just file and buff my nails.&lt;br /&gt;2) I carefully paint one very thin layer of polish on each nail of one hand.&lt;br /&gt;3) Repeat #2&lt;br /&gt;4) I paint one coat of the Sally Hansen Diamond Flash top coat on each  nail.&lt;br /&gt;5)  As soon as each finger has the top coat, I dip my fingers into a bowl of ice water and keep dipping them in and out for a few minutes, as long as I can stand the cold.&lt;br /&gt;6) Wait at least an hour before doing much of anything. This can be TV time or reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is a quick dry top coat, it really isn&#x27;t...I don&#x27;t trust anything to dry that quickly. The top coat might firm up, but the color underneath still takes time. With the awesome shiny top coat on a bold, glossy polish, you can see any nicks pretty clearly. My favorite color to use this with is black. It&#x27;s a beautiful, glossy, classy black. And surprisingly, my favorite black is by wet n&#x27; wild. If you use cheap polish, splurge on this top coat! This top coat also makes my manicures last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: my favorite brand is Zoya...the combo of Zoya plus this top coat...amazing!</li>
            <li> Best nail top coat creates a sparkling shine AND DRIES FAST!!!! Mega shine,fast drying, long lasting. Hooked</li>
            <li> I love this top coat!  I have ordered it so many times now.  It goes on easily and dries rapidly.  I get my nails manicured regularly and I use this to extend my manicure.  It is perfect - lasts long and really does help to protect against chipping</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever tried. I live in the Caribbean, bought this at a local drug store for around $6.50 and I absolutely love it. I painted my nails an hour before bed, base coat, two coats of polish and then this top coat, dried within a minute, and next morning there were absolutely no sheet marks on my nails. Of course you have to allow each coat sufficient drying time, but I&#x27;m sure it would still work like magic. Even my boyfriend said my polish was shiny like diamonds. Definitely worth every penny, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Have tried different coats, but this is THE fastest coat ever, my nails are shiny and great just second to dry!!!!</li>
            <li> Its okay but gets &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. I like the Mega shine (in the silver bottle with a blue top) better. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my nail polish always seems to chip and peel right away. This top-coat does a great job of making the polish super shiny which I like, but the polish still chops after just a day of wear so I don&#x27;t feel like this improved endurance of the polish at all.</li>
            <li> There was no usable polish in the bottle. It was so dry that the brush was rock-solid. I turned the bottle upside down and nothing came out.</li>
            <li> I have used many top coats and this one is by far the best. Most top coats I used dull out after a few days. This one stays just as shiny until you take off the polish. Even OPI top coat isn&#x27;t as good as this one. This one keeps your nails super shiny and smooth. It dries your nails to the touch almost instantly. I make sure to be careful for an hour after though just to be sure. It keeps your nails hard, which prolongs the manicure. It also isnt a thick top coat, which helps to not smudge your nails. I work in a nail salon, and my coworker recommended this top coat to me. Trust me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I use Sally Hansen Diamond Flash Fast Dry Top Coat after I have applied  Creative Nail  Design Stickey Base Coat,  Salon Science Instant Artificials (this is a nail strengthener),  another coat of  Creative Nail Design Stickey Base Coat and fingernail polish color.  Diamond Flash dries my polish quickly so I can apply a thick coat of my very favorite top coat -- Sally Hansen Mega Shine Nail Treatment Top Coat.  After applying the DFFD top coat,  I place my hands in my nail dryer for a while so I won&#x27;t have any smudges.  I put them back under the dry after applying the second top coat -- Mega Shine Nail Treatment.  This top coat is supposed to dry in 60 seconds to touch but seems to take longer.  The following day, I apply another thick coat of Sally Hansen Mega Shine Nail Treatment.  This makes my nails shine and extends manicure to 6 - 8 days.  I like the Sally Hansen Diamond Flash Fast Dry Top Coat and ALWAYS use it in conjunction with Sally Hansen Mega Shine Nail Treatment Top Coat that prevents chipping and has a LONG lasting shine.</li>
            <li> this is a great product!</li>
            <li> Last for Atleast five to seven days. Make any polish high end or low end almost gel,like. Only top coat I will ever buy</li>
            <li> I always had a problem before painting my nails within about 5 hours of bed time... I&#x27;d wake up the next morning with indentations of sheets on my nails.  When I bought this, to really test it I painted my nails at 8pm and to my surprise, the next day there were ZERO indentations in my nails.  This top coat rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my nails stayed chip free much longer than my previous top coat (which was actually just a clear nail polish).</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is the fastest drying top coat I&#x27;ve found.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge and dries very hard.  I cant say enough good things about this one!  I usually use the OPI top coat as my base coat, my nail polish and then this as my top coat.  It&#x27;s great.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Excellent Transaction--Great Product--Fast Shipping--A+A+A+</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I found Seche Vite to be shrinking my polish too much.  It is AWESOME!  It dried wonderfully fast and hard all the way through versus Seche Vite that can still slide the bottom coats after 15 or so minutes.  It also strengthens my nails making my manicure last longer!</li>
            <li> Once I stumbled upon this top coat, I haven&#x27;t used another brand since! I&#x27;ve told all of my friends about it and they call it &amp;#34;magic in a bottle!&amp;#34;</li>
