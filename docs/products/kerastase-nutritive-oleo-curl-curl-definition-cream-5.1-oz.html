            <li>After my first use of the oleo curl line I literally had people on the street telling me how beautiful my hair was and</li>
            <li>Awesome for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect for naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Best ever leave in conditioner and makes soft, shiny curls.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Kerastase, so was hoping this would be a good product for my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine with areas of curls that get fuzzy no matter the weather.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the last 2 decades and Kerastase Oleo-curl is one of the best products I have found that softens and tames my curly hair with no crunchy after feel and no foul smell.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many many years.  </li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>it leaves it soft, with nice curls and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big believer in salon products, however Treseme works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I love this curl cream.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I will for sure buy this product over and over again.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>so love it wanna</li>
            <li>It reinvigorates with water spritzed on hair, which is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I love Kerastase products.</li>
            <li>Works even better when you use a curling wand but will give your hair curl regardless.</li>
            <li>Love this product when I let my hair be its curly self.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use it when I&#x27;m going to heat style</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>liked very much a quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, it does make curly hair bouncy, however you will need to apply a TON, which is not very budget-friendly ($30+ per bottle)</li>
            <li>It smells like the sweet peach which is my favorite smell!I really enjoy it!</li>
            <li>When it did finally run out, I was happy to see it here for a better price than in Paris.</li>
            <li>when I use this alone, it looks good but not as good as when I combine it with the other products.  </li>
            <li>Best conditioner I have found for slightly curly / wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell and the feel... make my curls really pretty and is not crunchy at all!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years because it is light weight</li>
            <li>This leave-in cond. is light weight and yet moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny, styling is easy after using it.</li>
            <li>This product is for thick hair however, I have super fine hair and it makes the best curls.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and made my hair curly and gentle.</li>
            <li>Also I am quite fragrance sensitive and this has the most natural pleasant smell...not offensive at all.</li>
            <li>This product did nothing to prevent my hair from frizzing in the humidity and did nothing special for curl definition AND its crunchy.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the price is right on amazon!</li>
            <li>good thing for me was my hair is bright and soft not less too much anymore</li>
            <li>One day I noticed that a guy who sit beside me really enjoyed my hair smell too, haha...</li>
            <li>I cannot say much about it because my hair is not completely natural curly, but seems good!</li>
            <li>Love how this product smells, and it is nice at enhancing and preserving the loose waves of my body-wave perm.</li>
            <li>However, there are many other products out there just as effective for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Right before I get out I turn the water to luke warm to rinse (rinse well) and finally finish with a cool rinse to close the hair  follicle .</li>
            <li>Really great...leaves hair smooth, unlike a lot of curl enhancer.  </li>
            <li>It is light and really tames any frizz.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>It has the most bang for your buck as far as curl conditioning .</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricier than some, BUT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>The one from the store had a fresh odour.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>I have a curly dry hair and have been using many products which I am not sattisfied with, but this product worth every penny!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes the whole difference to my naturally curly hair which seems like straw most of the time til I use my Oleo curl.</li>
            <li>I first bought this in Paris on business when I forgot my own, and was happily surprised at how well this moisturizes my naturally curly hair and makes it shine.</li>
            <li>It helps define my lose curls, and paired with a little styling cream, I feel good to go.</li>
            <li>I have tried it&#x27;s oils at a local store and felt in love with it</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different lines for curly hair.</li>
            <li>If I buy it in the salon, it is almost ten dollars more.</li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>We all love it, we each have different hair types and it works wonders for all 3 of us.</li>
            <li>I recommend to all who want a first line product.</li>
            <li>I use this one first, and then whatever my second product is over the top.</li>
            <li>Defining the curl is exactly what Curl Definition Creme does.</li>
            <li>It lasted many months because only a dab was needed for my shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li>The directions say you only need to apply a tiny bit but most curly hair is very full.  </li>
            <li>The price may have you thinking I can&#x27;t believe I just paid that much for hair care .</li>
            <li>i bought this because the price was so reasonable.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li>Thankgod for Kerastase Intense oleo curl.</li>
            <li>It is also much cheaper to buy it online.  </li>
            <li>Decided to treat my hair with keratin instead and go straight.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much smoother.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, almost frizzy in spots (not all over) hair.  </li>
            <li>I have thick hair with some curl in it, and as it grows out between haircuts it seems the better part of wisdom to enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>I have type 2a/2b curly hair and live in the very humid state of GA.  </li>
            <li>This product really helped eliminate the fuzziness and accentuate her natural curls.</li>
            <li>I have curly long hair, this product is very gentle, makes my hair easy to comb, but once my hair is dry is like not having anything on it.</li>
            <li>I live in the mts with well water (drying) and 9,000 feet altitude.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li>It works the same as some much higher priced products so I am switching to it to save a bit of money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It even came 3 weeks early, what a service!</li>
            <li>.She&#x27;s 11 year old!</li>
            <li>but I feel they are worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>This one was fine but the smell was slightly softer.</li>
            <li>This leaves it soft!</li>
            <li>Use a white t-shirt or paper towels to gently squeeze water out of hair and put just drop of creme in your palms emulsify and run through hair .</li>
            <li>but I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and dries out, but this helps keep it soft and under control.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft.</li>
            <li>I use the Oleo intense curl masque in this same line.</li>
            <li>I helps hold my natural curls and prevents frizz.</li>
            <li>Like that it hold my natural curls longer and softer.  </li>
            <li>It takes away the frizz and with a puff of soft spray</li>
            <li>Hair remains naturally looking and controlled.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beware for those of you with sensitive noses.</li>
            <li>I am actually not sure of what all those ingredients are, and if they are not \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, I guess I don&#x27;t want to know! :-)</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, and tends to be coarse and frizzy without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on naturally curly/frizzy hair to acheive defined curls, and on a spiral perm with the same results.  </li>
            <li>I live in high altitude where my hair usually looks like I stuck it in a light socket everyday.</li>
            <li>Now it really didn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li>I never thought after 46 years of bad hair I would finally have a good hair day with one product.</li>

            <li> Right before I get out I turn the water to luke warm to rinse (rinse well) and finally finish with a cool rinse to close the hair  follicle .</li>
            <li> Really great...leaves hair smooth, unlike a lot of curl enhancer.  </li>
            <li> It is light and really tames any frizz.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> It has the most bang for your buck as far as curl conditioning .</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricier than some, BUT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> The one from the store had a fresh odour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> I have a curly dry hair and have been using many products which I am not sattisfied with, but this product worth every penny!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes the whole difference to my naturally curly hair which seems like straw most of the time til I use my Oleo curl.</li>
            <li> I first bought this in Paris on business when I forgot my own, and was happily surprised at how well this moisturizes my naturally curly hair and makes it shine.</li>
            <li> It helps define my lose curls, and paired with a little styling cream, I feel good to go.</li>
            <li> I have tried it&#x27;s oils at a local store and felt in love with it</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different lines for curly hair.</li>
            <li> If I buy it in the salon, it is almost ten dollars more.</li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> We all love it, we each have different hair types and it works wonders for all 3 of us.</li>
            <li> I recommend to all who want a first line product.</li>
            <li> I use this one first, and then whatever my second product is over the top.</li>
            <li> Defining the curl is exactly what Curl Definition Creme does.</li>
            <li> It lasted many months because only a dab was needed for my shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li> The directions say you only need to apply a tiny bit but most curly hair is very full.  </li>
            <li> The price may have you thinking I can&#x27;t believe I just paid that much for hair care .</li>
            <li> i bought this because the price was so reasonable.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li> Thankgod for Kerastase Intense oleo curl.</li>
            <li> It is also much cheaper to buy it online.  </li>
            <li> Decided to treat my hair with keratin instead and go straight.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much smoother.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, almost frizzy in spots (not all over) hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair with some curl in it, and as it grows out between haircuts it seems the better part of wisdom to enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> I have type 2a/2b curly hair and live in the very humid state of GA.  </li>
            <li> This product really helped eliminate the fuzziness and accentuate her natural curls.</li>
            <li> I have curly long hair, this product is very gentle, makes my hair easy to comb, but once my hair is dry is like not having anything on it.</li>
            <li> I live in the mts with well water (drying) and 9,000 feet altitude.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> It works the same as some much higher priced products so I am switching to it to save a bit of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It even came 3 weeks early, what a service!</li>
            <li> .She&#x27;s 11 year old!</li>
            <li> but I feel they are worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> This one was fine but the smell was slightly softer.</li>
            <li> This leaves it soft!</li>
            <li> Use a white t-shirt or paper towels to gently squeeze water out of hair and put just drop of creme in your palms emulsify and run through hair .</li>
            <li> but I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and dries out, but this helps keep it soft and under control.</li>
            <li> Leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Hair feels soft.</li>
            <li> I use the Oleo intense curl masque in this same line.</li>
            <li> I helps hold my natural curls and prevents frizz.</li>
            <li> Like that it hold my natural curls longer and softer.  </li>
            <li> It takes away the frizz and with a puff of soft spray</li>
            <li> Hair remains naturally looking and controlled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beware for those of you with sensitive noses.</li>
            <li> I am actually not sure of what all those ingredients are, and if they are not \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, I guess I don&#x27;t want to know! :-)</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, and tends to be coarse and frizzy without this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on naturally curly/frizzy hair to acheive defined curls, and on a spiral perm with the same results.  </li>
            <li> I live in high altitude where my hair usually looks like I stuck it in a light socket everyday.</li>
            <li> Now it really didn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li> I never thought after 46 years of bad hair I would finally have a good hair day with one product.</li>
            <li> This helps makes my hair very soft, but doesnt weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I had just a little left and realized I didn&#x27;t want to live without it.</li>
            <li> OMG, I love this product, My hair is thin and frizzy, Keratase Oleo  transforms my hair to smoother, less frizzy curls and shiny.</li>
            <li> only negative is that I really don&#x27;t like the smell when I am applying it to my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> every mornig and a little goes a long way and keeps my curly hair soft and in control!  </li>
            <li> I have long curly hair that tends to dryness.</li>
            <li> I want to try Kerastase hair care product for a long.</li>
            <li> After I apply it to my wet hair, I just let my hair air-dry whenever possible.  </li>
            <li> They may be a little bit more expensive</li>
            <li> My hair no longer feels dry at the ends like it used to.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is my hair or the product, but it did not tame my wavy hair - so I have to say not going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> and I use about a dime size amount on my wet hair and then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years, always bought a few at a time, and last price I paid was $23.36.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> non-hair washing days, wet the hair and apply.</li>
            <li> other curly girls asking me what I use ?</li>
            <li> No need for hairspray or other types of product.</li>
            <li> This line just is not right for my type of curl.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Instead of enhancing the curl, I found that it weighed it down.  </li>
            <li> Oleo Curl works well without weighing down my hair and does not look greasy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m reluctant to use it because the fragrance is very strong- an artificial floral cosmetic odor that lingers all day.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want crunchy hair, but I don&#x27;t want fluffy hair either.  </li>
            <li> tames frizziness and does not leave a heavy film on your hair</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff</li>
            <li> I bought Keratase Oleo Curl to define my curls and tame frizz after getting a perm.</li>
            <li> This past summer I was spending a month in Paris going to school and playing music (yes, at over 50).</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use with the kerastase spray a porter and I&#x27;m not sure it did anything at all.  </li>
            <li> Holds/defines my curls but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all!</li>
            <li> It makes my thin curly hair less frizzy in our humid Louisiana climate.  </li>
            <li> I know they market this for thick curly hair</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that it is to pricy for the amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pleasant; however, it does fade as the hair dries.</li>
            <li> This has been a god-send to me, as the chemical straightening was very hard on my hair, not to mention on my wallet.  </li>
            <li> was disappointed that it did not help my hair restore its condition in any way as other clients put in their reviews.</li>
            <li> and my hair had gotten brittle and sad.  </li>
            <li> but it is the same product I buy.&lt;br /&gt;Great for curly hair from getting to unruly or worst yet frizzy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> Sadly it&#x27;s time for me to search for a replacement.....</li>
            <li> Sadly this did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> It is also very expensive, so</li>

            <li> Best conditioner I have found for slightly curly / wavy hair. Well worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. My hair is very fine with areas of curls that get fuzzy no matter the weather. Kerastase Nutrive Oleo-curl Definition Creme left my hair with deep shiny curls; even the next morning. I know they market this for thick curly hair but it works great on fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick naturally curly hair.  My hair is not coloured.  I like their shampoo and conditioner.  However this does not do anything for my curls at all. There is no hold to it.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair that tends to dryness. This past summer I was spending a month in Paris going to school and playing music (yes, at over 50). I was out of the Curl Keeper product I brought from home and my hair had gotten brittle and sad.  I stopped into a salon. They said Ahhhh.  Then they trimmed and highlighted my hair and finally brought out a tube of this.  It made my hair soft, kept the curls, and smelled subtly delicious.  I bought a tube.  Loved it.  When I got back to California I had just a little left and realized I didn&#x27;t want to live without it. To my delight I found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this thing. Works great. Smells delicious.</li>
            <li> Kerastase products are awesome !! The price may have you thinking I can&#x27;t believe I just paid that much for hair care . When you use it you will be thanking yourself ! After my first use of the oleo curl line I literally had people on the street telling me how beautiful my hair was and other curly girls asking me what I use ? So obviously it works . I would say if you could have just one product from the line go for the Nutritive Creme Oleo-Curl. It has the most bang for your buck as far as curl conditioning . One thing I always do is put my conditioner in 1st thing when I get in the shower , pull up my hair , and put a shower cap on to hold the heat in and let the conditioner do it&#x27;s thing while I finish up the rest of the grooming process . Right before I get out I turn the water to luke warm to rinse (rinse well) and finally finish with a cool rinse to close the hair  follicle . Use a white t-shirt or paper towels to gently squeeze water out of hair and put just drop of creme in your palms emulsify and run through hair . Treat your curls with love and remember try not to touch !!!</li>
            <li> What a great product!</li>
            <li> I have type 2a/2b curly hair and live in the very humid state of GA.  This product did nothing to prevent my hair from frizzing in the humidity and did nothing special for curl definition AND its crunchy.  Yuck.  Waste of money</li>
            <li> Only $5 cheaper than in salons but it is the same product I buy.&lt;br /&gt;Great for curly hair from getting to unruly or worst yet frizzy!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the last 2 decades and Kerastase Oleo-curl is one of the best products I have found that softens and tames my curly hair with no crunchy after feel and no foul smell.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many many years.  Awesome for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> and once I had to go without it and I was like an addict looking for a fix.  Ok well almost that serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes the whole difference to my naturally curly hair which seems like straw most of the time til I use my Oleo curl. Also I am quite fragrance sensitive and this has the most natural pleasant smell...not offensive at all.I am actually not sure of what all those ingredients are, and if they are not \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, I guess I don&#x27;t want to know! :-)</li>
            <li> Really great...leaves hair smooth, unlike a lot of curl enhancer.  However, there are many other products out there just as effective for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> This leave-in was recommended by my stylist for my daughter&#x27;s curly, but fuzzy hair. This product really helped eliminate the fuzziness and accentuate her natural curls. I will definitely purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that I really don&#x27;t like the smell when I am applying it to my daughter&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s not pleasant; however, it does fade as the hair dries.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with some curl in it, and as it grows out between haircuts it seems the better part of wisdom to enjoy it.  This helps--it keeps my mop from being too big, and gives some definition to the curls.</li>
            <li> i bought this because the price was so reasonable. it is great for my processed, curly hair. it leaves it soft, with nice curls and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s expensive but I have pretty long hair and I use about a dime size amount on my wet hair and then blow dry.  It is light and really tames any frizz.</li>
            <li> OMG, I love this product, My hair is thin and frizzy, Keratase Oleo  transforms my hair to smoother, less frizzy curls and shiny. I never thought after 46 years of bad hair I would finally have a good hair day with one product.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful(oranges), but does not provide quite enough hold.  I don&#x27;t want crunchy hair, but I don&#x27;t want fluffy hair either.  I&#x27;m a big believer in salon products, however Treseme works wonderfully.  I wish Treseme smelled like this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use with the kerastase spray a porter and I&#x27;m not sure it did anything at all.  It does smell nice but that&#x27;s about all.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price. It works the same as some much higher priced products so I am switching to it to save a bit of money. My hair is naturally curly and dries out, but this helps keep it soft and under control.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it every mornig and a little goes a long way and keeps my curly hair soft and in control!  Update as of 10/30/16 Can someone explain to me why this product has doubled in price! I&#x27;ve used it for years, always bought a few at a time, and last price I paid was $23.36. Now it&#x27;s over $50 ?? Sadly it&#x27;s time for me to search for a replacement.....</li>
            <li> I love this curl cream. It helps define my lose curls, and paired with a little styling cream, I feel good to go.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell and the feel... make my curls really pretty and is not crunchy at all!</li>
            <li> Purchased with the shampoo.  Love this.  It&#x27;s a leave-in that helps manage my color treated and curly hair.  Leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your bussiness. The shipping was fast. I have a curly dry hair and have been using many products which I am not sattisfied with, but this product worth every penny! I have tried it&#x27;s oils at a local store and felt in love with it and that was the reason I bought this product specific for my hair. I will for sure buy this product over and over again.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Product... My hair feel so soft. I really recommend this product to anybody. The only bad thing is that it is to pricy for the amount.</li>
            <li> Overpriced in salon. Can now afford to buy online. This is the best curl cream and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Does great for unruly curly hair. Hair feels soft.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product ia amazing! Totally worth the money..&lt;br /&gt;It even came 3 weeks early, what a service!</li>
            <li> Love it! Holds/defines my curls but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all! Worth the money! Go get this product. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Great, but doesn&#x27;t give any hold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years because it is light weight and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff AT ALL.  It makes my thin curly hair less frizzy in our humid Louisiana climate.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, it does make curly hair bouncy, however you will need to apply a TON, which is not very budget-friendly ($30+ per bottle) The directions say you only need to apply a tiny bit but most curly hair is very full.  I do recommend it however.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my hair.  I gave it to my daughter</li>
            <li> great deal and product</li>
            <li> i will NEVER stop using this! My hair loves it! Best ever leave in conditioner and makes soft, shiny curls. I add Climate Control, over it, to control frizz, and voila! Perfect!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair! Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Was not at all like the product my hairstylist used!</li>
            <li> works great on my frizzzy hair</li>
            <li> This Kerastase is perfect fo my daughter &#x27;s hair .She&#x27;s 11 year old! Her her is curly and after she used the product her her is look more beautiful !!</li>
            <li> good thing for me was my hair is bright and soft not less too much anymore so love it wanna your know</li>
            <li> OH YEAH!!! Bring it on Kerastase!!!!! I live in high altitude where my hair usually looks like I stuck it in a light socket everyday. Thankgod for Kerastase Intense oleo curl. IT WORKS! I live in the mts with well water (drying) and 9,000 feet altitude. My hair wouldn&#x27;t curl for anything...UNTIL this product line by Kerastate. This leave-in cond. is light weight and yet moisturizing. It is great to use for styling or just for moisture. I can&#x27;t live without it now. It&#x27;s pricier than some, BUT WORTH IT. I have tried so many different lines for curly hair. Just do Kerastase. Save yourself the headache. Pay a bit more, but beautiful, lustrous, NO FRIZZ curls. YAY.  Also! I use the Oleo intense curl masque in this same line. They work GREAT together.</li>
            <li> It reinvigorates with water spritzed on hair, which is fabulous!  It smells nice.  I helps hold my natural curls and prevents frizz.</li>
            <li> effectively works immediately I applied. liked very much a quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This helps makes my hair very soft, but doesnt weigh it down.  My hair is naturally curly, and tends to be coarse and frizzy without this stuff.  I hope they never stop making this stuff!  It is also much cheaper to buy it online.  If I buy it in the salon, it is almost ten dollars more.</li>
            <li> I love Kerastase products. They may be a little bit more expensive but I feel they are worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> Yes yes and yes! Another great Kerastase product! It works really well! Plus, the price is right on amazon!</li>
            <li> This product is for thick hair however, I have super fine hair and it makes the best curls. I repeat, the BEST curls. Works even better when you use a curling wand but will give your hair curl regardless.</li>
            <li> Like that it hold my natural curls longer and softer.  Not oily.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo for luscious curls that I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s worth every penny, styling is easy after using it. It takes away the frizz and with a puff of soft spray you&#x27;re out the door. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Love how this product smells, and it is nice at enhancing and preserving the loose waves of my body-wave perm.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever for curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> Order came on time and the oleo is really nice for the hair.</li>
            <li> I compared this product with the same product bought at a store. The one from the store had a fresh odour.This one was fine but the smell was slightly softer. I liked it´s texture. I notice it&#x27;s repairing effect.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My sister turned me on to it and I in turn turned my mom on to it. We all love it, we each have different hair types and it works wonders for all 3 of us.</li>
            <li> Sadly this did not work for me.  I am a huge fan of Kerastase, so was hoping this would be a good product for my hair.  No luck.  Not sure if it is my hair or the product, but it did not tame my wavy hair - so I have to say not going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought for my wife, she always uses kerastase products. I recommend to all who want a first line product.</li>
            <li> Very good! I want to try Kerastase hair care product for a long. Now it really didn&#x27;t let me down! It is very smooth and made my hair curly and gentle. It smells like the sweet peach which is my favorite smell!I really enjoy it! One day I noticed that a guy who sit beside me really enjoyed my hair smell too, haha...</li>
            <li> Controls frizzyness, yes. But, it stops there. Decided to treat my hair with keratin instead and go straight.</li>
            <li> I cannot say much about it because my hair is not completely natural curly, but seems good!</li>
            <li> I have never found anything that defines my curls as well as this product.  I&#x27;ve used it on naturally curly/frizzy hair to acheive defined curls, and on a spiral perm with the same results.  I will say, I use this product along with either a gel or mouse to get my results, when I use this alone, it looks good but not as good as when I combine it with the other products.  I use this one first, and then whatever my second product is over the top.</li>
            <li> Like all the other review state, it smells great, reduces frizz by a very good amount, and is SO weightless! My hair is so much smoother. I love it! A great investment for those who have frizziness.</li>
            <li> Love this product when I let my hair be its curly self.  Leaves my curls well-defined, smells great and softens my hair.  Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Will buy this again it helps keep my hair from going frizzy</li>
            <li> Product is great &amp; smells good too. Curls are well defined &amp; texture is lovely!</li>
            <li> I have very curly, almost frizzy in spots (not all over) hair.  Since my hair stylist has been using this product before drying my hair along with the Kerastase Resistance Fibre Architecte before styling my hair, I no longer have to have my hair chemically straightened.  This has been a god-send to me, as the chemical straightening was very hard on my hair, not to mention on my wallet.  After I apply it to my wet hair, I just let my hair air-dry whenever possible.  My hair no longer feels dry at the ends like it used to.</li>
            <li> Defining the curl is exactly what Curl Definition Creme does. No need for hairspray or other types of product. Hair remains naturally looking and controlled.&lt;br /&gt;On non-hair washing days, wet the hair and apply.</li>
            <li> I have curly long hair, this product is very gentle, makes my hair easy to comb, but once my hair is dry is like not having anything on it.</li>
            <li> This line just is not right for my type of curl.  Instead of enhancing the curl, I found that it weighed it down.  It is also very expensive, so back I went to Walgreen&#x27;s to try some inexpensive brands.  My type of curl needs something with a holding factor in it so my curls are set as well as defined.  This might be good for curlier longer hair, but it costs a lot.</li>
            <li> tames frizziness and does not leave a heavy film on your hair</li>
            <li> was disappointed that it did not help my hair restore its condition in any way as other clients put in their reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought Keratase Oleo Curl to define my curls and tame frizz after getting a perm. The price was good and the product arrived on time in sealed packaging. Oleo Curl works well without weighing down my hair and does not look greasy. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m reluctant to use it because the fragrance is very strong- an artificial floral cosmetic odor that lingers all day. Beware for those of you with sensitive noses.</li>
            <li> I first bought this in Paris on business when I forgot my own, and was happily surprised at how well this moisturizes my naturally curly hair and makes it shine. It lasted many months because only a dab was needed for my shoulder-length hair. When it did finally run out, I was happy to see it here for a better price than in Paris. It&#x27;s worth the higher price. I mostly use it when I&#x27;m going to heat style my hair and don&#x27;t want any stiffness in it. This leaves it soft!</li>
            <li> Have wavy- curly hair. I have tried soooo many products, and this was the best. I added just a smidge of kinky curls to help get a stronger hold, but maybe just a quarter size. These two products combined were amazing! I&#x27;ve tried: kinky curls, jesse&#x27;s curls, deva curl, curl keeper, Design essentials (I could go on) and this stuff was great. I also love the smell.</li>
