    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful and</li>
            <li>Zum mist has a lot of good quality products.</li>
            <li>Indigo Wild Zum Mist has a lot of really great scents, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>the smell is amazing...</li>
            <li>This frankinense and lavender spray is so nice and relaxing, I put it on my pillow almost every night.</li>
            <li>It is a pleasant and enjoyable balance of two of the most intoxicating and powerful fragrances used through the millennia for health and happiness.</li>
            <li>so I took a chance on this having been previously satisfied with a Zum product.</li>
            <li>It lingers in a satisfying way, not an overbearing one.</li>
            <li>Not everyone will love this combination, but I recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and use spray as room spray</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I love the light fragrance!</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite Zum scent.</li>
            <li>I love Zum Mist.</li>
            <li>I plan to check out more from the line.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The other Zum I have purchased have been excellent</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is strong but that is what I like.  </li>
            <li>Another fine scent from Zuma.</li>
            <li>This is GREAT if you love Frankinscense, otherwise, the lavender is very hidden and the scent is EXTREMELY strong!</li>
            <li>It is a scent which is light but substantial and does not disappear.</li>
            <li>I like to spray this around the house when I want a clean, light scent that is also relaxing.</li>
            <li>enjoy the scent, which to me is a fresh scent and reminds me of a field of lavender.</li>
            <li>The seller was quick in getting it here.</li>
            <li>Good product the aroma lasts a long time..</li>
            <li>I was expecting something fresh.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The zum isn&#x27;t a cheap product but a few blasts and you get an all natural fragrance that is very nice.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this blended essential oil mix.</li>
            <li>So intoxicating and really clears my head and balances me when I feel scattered.</li>
            <li>Not the fresh inviting scent I imagined at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it a few times hoping I&#x27;d get used to it, but I dislike it more every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without now!</li>
            <li>This smells very heavy and woodsy, kind of like musk.</li>
            <li>Much better to have natural scents than the chemicals in the other sprays.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised by the high ratings.</li>
            <li>There is an earthy tone from the frankincense which is not heavy like musk tones, and the frankincense brings a richness to the lavender that grounds the astringent tone in the lavender.</li>
            <li>Require frequent misting to maintain aroma</li>
            <li>The Lavender makes the Frankincense not so masculine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and you just need a small amount to fill the room.</li>
            <li>These sprays last so much longer than other sprays, and you don&#x27;t have to use very much at a time.</li>
            <li>Barely any scent.</li>
            <li>This is lighter than some of the other Zuma scents and is very relaxing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I received soap as a gift and decided to get the rub and spray to go with it. Wonderful and the sent appears to last all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the high ratings. This stuff stinks to me. I&#x27;ve burned frankincense resin before and it has a slightly lemony scent, real lavender has a slightly astringent scent. I was expecting something fresh. This smells very heavy and woodsy, kind of like musk. Not the fresh inviting scent I imagined at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it a few times hoping I&#x27;d get used to it, but I dislike it more every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Barely any scent. The other Zum I have purchased have been excellent so I am wondering if this was defective.</li>
            <li> This stuff is heaven scent....pun intended. I like lavender so I took a chance on this having been previously satisfied with a Zum product. This surpassed my expectations. It is a scent which is light but substantial and does not disappear. It lingers in a satisfying way, not an overbearing one. There is an earthy tone from the frankincense which is not heavy like musk tones, and the frankincense brings a richness to the lavender that grounds the astringent tone in the lavender. It is a pleasant and enjoyable balance of two of the most intoxicating and powerful fragrances used through the millennia for health and happiness. Not everyone will love this combination, but I recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long.  Require frequent misting to maintain aroma</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is strong but that is what I like.  I actually use it as a perfume.  I do not spray a lot due to the strength of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the scent, which to me is a fresh scent and reminds me of a field of lavender.</li>
            <li> The zum isn&#x27;t a cheap product but a few blasts and you get an all natural fragrance that is very nice.</li>
            <li> No problems with delivery.  Love the smell and use spray as room spray and I also spray on me and my clothes.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...the smell is amazing...works wonders on my furbabies to calm them down for bad weather!</li>
            <li> I bought two different scents, and they both seem to smell the same.  I think the Frankincense is overpowering in both bottles.</li>
            <li> I love the light fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money. Non-toxic. Smells wonderful, and lasts a long time. The seller was quick in getting it here. It was packed well.</li>
            <li> I spray this stuff all over the place...including my hair...it doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol in it so it can be used anywhere on the body and also used as a room spray. The scent is very addictive.  I&#x27;ve used up 3 bottles in the past couple months. I will continue to use it</li>
            <li> Good product the aroma lasts a long time..I recommend this product. Zum mist has a lot of good quality products.</li>
            <li> Another fine scent from Zuma. This is lighter than some of the other Zuma scents and is very relaxing. I like to spray this around the house when I want a clean, light scent that is also relaxing. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite Zum scent. The Lavender makes the Frankincense not so masculine. It&#x27;s strong and you just need a small amount to fill the room. Much better to have natural scents than the chemicals in the other sprays.</li>
            <li> I love Zum Mist. This frankinense and lavender spray is so nice and relaxing, I put it on my pillow almost every night. These sprays last so much longer than other sprays, and you don&#x27;t have to use very much at a time.</li>
            <li> In a word, this spray IS da bomb! Can&#x27;t live without now!</li>
            <li> This is GREAT if you love Frankinscense, otherwise, the lavender is very hidden and the scent is EXTREMELY strong!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this blended essential oil mix. So intoxicating and really clears my head and balances me when I feel scattered. I plan to check out more from the line.</li>
            <li> Indigo Wild Zum Mist has a lot of really great scents, but this one is the best.</li>
