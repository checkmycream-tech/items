            <li>Fitness Fresh smells great.</li>
            <li>Aluminum Free and even works better than some Aluminum deodorants!</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Adidas Cotton Tech has a refreshing smell and doesn&#x27;t leave any stains on my clothing.</li>
            <li>The smell is refreshing.</li>
            <li>and I work out at a gym three or more times a week.</li>
            <li>I love the deodorant  but was ripped off by the seller.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Smelled wonderful, kept me dry.  </li>
            <li>I used it once in 24 hours, after shower,but with this one, if u wont use it every 8 hours I start to smell.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you be able to find better aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t find this product for quite some time, and am SO glad to see that it&#x27;s once again available - even at $12 and up</li>
            <li>Used this product for a while, like most thought it worked well for an aluminum free</li>
            <li>Best smelling, working deodorant without aluminum-  hands down.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for an aluminum free deodorant that works.  </li>
            <li>i like the fact that it is aluminum free.</li>
            <li>I search for Adidas Aluminum Free deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the Fitness Fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I love it, especially because it is aluminum free and work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many non-aluminum and non anti-perspirant deodorants on the market, and they don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit overwhelming, but the benefit of being the only aluminum free antiperspirant on the market makes it tolerable.</li>
            <li>My daughter needs the aluminum free deoderant and this adidas product works well for her.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work pretty good - wish it was a little stronger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried two different scents and this one is better than the fresh powder smell.</li>
            <li>If you want to use this, just make sure you don&#x27;t apply it right after you shave your underarms, especially if you have any nicks, scratches, or irritation.     </li>
            <li>And I am always willing to give products a try.</li>
            <li>This product works better used on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Did you know it&#x27;s illegal for farmers to mention how carrots are healthy for you and good for eyesight in advertisements?</li>
            <li>I have used this deodorant for more than 5 years and it is the only one that somewhat controls sweating and REALLY controls odor for me without plugging my sweat glands.</li>
            <li>First of all I love this deodorant but there are some problems as other reviewer have noted.</li>
            <li>Still trying to figure why Men&#x27;s ADIDAS is so much cheaper than the Women&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed some burning if I apply it straight out of the shower but nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I got this product because its aluminum free, I tried different brand like &amp;#34;Toms&amp;#34;, but they didn&#x27;t worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I really like that this is an aluminum-free product and the scent is decent but like another user stated, I have to apply this twice a day for it to keep the smell away.</li>
            <li>The scent is heavenly, really fresh and clean and last all day an into the next day for me.</li>
            <li>I think this a decent product</li>
            <li>Aside from the burning and irritation after a few days I love the product and the fact that you cannot find it in any stores.</li>
            <li>Sorry to hear that this product may become discontinued...love that it is aluminum free and will continue buying it until it is gone!!!</li>
            <li>Although I believed aluminum free deodorants were healthier for me, I became embarrassed by the constant wetness and smell while using them and decided to go back to using Aluminum deodorants.</li>
            <li>I really like it, but with such a high price tag I may keep shopping for something comparable.</li>
            <li>This Aluminum Free Deodorant not only prevents odor but keeps me dry.</li>
            <li>But maybe our skin is just sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>maybe it is too old and doesn&#x27;t work like deodorant.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve tried all the Tom&#x27;s of Maine scents and other natural deodorants and none of them worked for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>Upon leaving for work I noticed my new blue shirt had bleach marks all under the armpits.</li>
            <li>a pretty color is not worth increasing my risk of cancer.     </li>
            <li>There has to be an answer and this is the only one I have found so far.</li>
            <li>In the last few months, I have trialed multiple natural (Aluminum free) deodorants from several different companies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only deodorant I could find that actually works yet doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum nor clog pores which is finally becoming common knowledge regarding  antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t stop you from sweating 100 percent in the summer, but if you do sweat a little with it, it&#x27;ll dry quickly without staining.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the cost, however it is definitely worth it to have something that works!</li>
            <li>Other deodorants don&#x27;t do this, and actually stay wet when you&#x27;re no longer hot or sweating.     </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very long time ago I  bought  the &amp;#34;same &amp;#34; for  one for 5-th of the price at a store</li>
            <li> As a side note regarding the seller, I ordered the Powder version by accident, returned it to Limited Finds, got my refund immediately, placed an exchange order and promptly received it.</li>
            <li> BEWARE of vendor Limited Finds.  </li>
            <li> I wondered, does it have other problematic ingredients?</li>
            <li> You can google the other ingredients too.</li>
            <li> , I usually switch up and use other products and go back to it with no problem.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it will take the burns to heal but can&#x27;t apply anything until then.&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
            <li> her old Secret brand</li>
            <li> my old secret</li>
            <li> I have bought it here for s few years after I could not longer find it in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate paying taxes to keep the FDA in business when they are just selling out to the highest corporate bidder, in fact a lot of FDA employees are hired straight out of those corporations.</li>
            <li> However I noticed that after a few days I tend to get raw under the arm</li>
            <li> It really eliminates the bad sweat odors.</li>
            <li> it is hard.</li>
            <li> I never ever smell icky underarm odor when I use this.</li>
            <li> I seriously don&#x27;t know what I will do when it is gone!</li>
            <li> But after a few days my armpits were burning like crazy...and got a bad rash....</li>
            <li> The blaring ingredient is the vague \\&quot;parfum fragrance\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Yet the FDA has no problem with these kinds of mysteriously vague ingredients in products we put in and on our bodies.</li>
            <li> I used a different aluminum-free deodorant and it smelled awful.</li>
            <li> Product is a bit expensive, however, I understand it is not being made anymore.  </li>
            <li> this one is probably a fake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s up to us, the consumers to take time from our busy lives and research this boring, annoying, scientific stuff.</li>
            <li> I typically purchase adidas products but this deodorant was horrible (for me).  </li>
            <li> I am desperate.</li>
            <li> It burned my skin so bad, I just had to toss it.  </li>
            <li> i am very unhappy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I wish someone would come up with an antiperspirant/deodorant that wasn&#x27;t BAD for your health!</li>
            <li> They charge an outrageous shipping fee.</li>
            <li> For a non staining formula I was shocked!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was looking for an aluminum free deodorant that works.  This one does the trick.  I&#x27;ve tried two different scents and this one is better than the fresh powder smell.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. It won&#x27;t stop you from sweating 100 percent in the summer, but if you do sweat a little with it, it&#x27;ll dry quickly without staining. Other deodorants don&#x27;t do this, and actually stay wet when you&#x27;re no longer hot or sweating.     I bought a six year supply when Savers had them for $2 a piece.</li>
            <li> As a side note regarding the seller, I ordered the Powder version by accident, returned it to Limited Finds, got my refund immediately, placed an exchange order and promptly received it. Very pleased with their service.     --------------------------    Now for the product review. I really enjoy the Fitness Fresh scent. I give the scent and power of this product a solid five stars. I never ever smell icky underarm odor when I use this. I&#x27;m really impressed by this product. I&#x27;m so impressed that I became suspicious: Why can&#x27;t I find this product anywhere else? It&#x27;s the only deodorant I could find that actually works yet doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum nor clog pores which is finally becoming common knowledge regarding  antiperspirants. I wondered, does it have other problematic ingredients? Let&#x27;s have a look.     Ingredients:     Propylene Glycol, Aqua Water, Sodium Stearate, Sodium Palmitate, Sodium Arachidate, Parfum Fragrance, Sodium Behenate, Cyamopsis Tetragonoloba Gum Guar, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Sodium Magnesium Silicate, Sucrose Stearate, Xanthan Gum, Triclosan, Sodium Myristate, Sodium Laurate, Myristic Acid, Gossypium Herbaceum Powder Cotton, Sodium Citrate, Ext. D&amp;C Violet No. 2 Cl 60730      The blaring ingredient is the vague \\&quot;parfum fragrance\\&quot;. This could be anything. Did you know it&#x27;s illegal for farmers to mention how carrots are healthy for you and good for eyesight in advertisements? Yet the FDA has no problem with these kinds of mysteriously vague ingredients in products we put in and on our bodies. By the way, our skin isn&#x27;t hermetic, it absorbs some things.  It&#x27;s up to us, the consumers to take time from our busy lives and research this boring, annoying, scientific stuff. I hate paying taxes to keep the FDA in business when they are just selling out to the highest corporate bidder, in fact a lot of FDA employees are hired straight out of those corporations. But yeah, the scent smells really nice.     D&amp;C VIOLET 2 has been linked to Cancer. Why color deodorant anyway? a pretty color is not worth increasing my risk of cancer.     The list goes on and on. You can google the other ingredients too. I&#x27;ll probably update this later. I&#x27;m too annoyed right now.     I upset at myself for using this so long without researching the ingredients. But I&#x27;ve tried all the Tom&#x27;s of Maine scents and other natural deodorants and none of them worked for more than a few hours. If you want to use this, just make sure you don&#x27;t apply it right after you shave your underarms, especially if you have any nicks, scratches, or irritation.     If you know of any that are safer, non-toxic, that actually work, please comment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this product to be exceptional.  I have used it for a lot of years and have no complaints.  i like the fact that it is aluminum free.</li>
            <li> I used a different aluminum-free deodorant and it smelled awful. Adidas Cotton Tech has a refreshing smell and doesn&#x27;t leave any stains on my clothing. It works better than some of my non aluminum-free deodorants!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is it. It really eliminates the bad sweat odors. The smell is refreshing. I love it, especially because it is aluminum free and work.</li>
            <li> Smelled wonderful, kept me dry.  But after a few days my armpits were burning like crazy...and got a bad rash....ouch!!!  Gave one also to my sister and she had the same thing happen.  But maybe our skin is just sensitive.</li>
            <li> Still trying to figure why Men&#x27;s ADIDAS is so much cheaper than the Women&#x27;s.  I really like it, but with such a high price tag I may keep shopping for something comparable.</li>
            <li> This product works for me. I&#x27;m SO going to miss it when it&#x27;s gone. I wish someone would come up with an antiperspirant/deodorant that wasn&#x27;t BAD for your health!</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for more than 5 years and it is the only one that somewhat controls sweating and REALLY controls odor for me without plugging my sweat glands. It is my understanding that this product is discontinued. I have bought it here for s few years after I could not longer find it in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can someone PLEASE produce something similar or can we petition the manufacturer to start making this again? I am desperate. I recently tried \\&quot;regular\\&quot; antiperspirant/deodorant and am now in pain with red, swollen, plugged sweat glands. There has to be an answer and this is the only one I have found so far. I seriously don&#x27;t know what I will do when it is gone!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has been difficult to find aluminum free deodorant that works! One stick will last me about two to three months and I work out at a gym three or more times a week. I have sensitive skin and I have tried a variety of scents non of which have bothered me. My only complaint is the cost, however it is definitely worth it to have something that works!</li>
            <li> I love the deodorant  but was ripped off by the seller.  I ordered and paid for a 2.6 ounce and received a 1.6 ounce.&lt;br /&gt;I was totally out so couldn&#x27;t return and complain!!!!! Will look elsewhere to by product..</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great.  Fitness Fresh smells great. Product is a bit expensive, however, I understand it is not being made anymore.  BEWARE of vendor Limited Finds.  They charge an outrageous shipping fee.</li>
            <li> I was so excitied to try this product. I used it in the morning then got dressed. Upon leaving for work I noticed my new blue shirt had bleach marks all under the armpits. For a non staining formula I was shocked!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about how well this deodorant works. I&#x27;ve tried SO many non-aluminum and non anti-perspirant deodorants on the market, and they don&#x27;t work nearly as well. They don&#x27;t even come close. This is my favorite, as it works wonderfully for over 12 hours, smells fantastic, and goes on invisible and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find this product for quite some time, and am SO glad to see that it&#x27;s once again available - even at $12 and up, it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Best smelling, working deodorant without aluminum-  hands down.  Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I really like that this is an aluminum-free product and the scent is decent but like another user stated, I have to apply this twice a day for it to keep the smell away. I have also noticed some burning if I apply it straight out of the shower but nothing unbearable. All in all I think this a decent product</li>
            <li> leave it to Adidas to create the best available deodorant that does not contain aluminum. I can use this regardless of my job requirements from the day and still be good when I get home. The best thing is that the smell is not overpowering, so I can also work in my bee-yard while wearing deodorant (some people don&#x27;t!) and the bees don&#x27;t mind!</li>
            <li> Used this product for a while, like most thought it worked well for an aluminum free deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I now have severe burns under both armpits!  Will be contacting the company this week.  Not sure how long it will take the burns to heal but can&#x27;t apply anything until then.&lt;br /&gt;Please avoid using this product!!!  Could be the real reason why it&#x27;s not available in US anymore.</li>
            <li> In the last few months, I have trialed multiple natural (Aluminum free) deodorants from several different companies. None controlled my underarm odor. Although I believed aluminum free deodorants were healthier for me, I became embarrassed by the constant wetness and smell while using them and decided to go back to using Aluminum deodorants. Even some of those did not work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I purchased the Adidas Cotton Tech. I have been using it for a week now and am SOLD. This Aluminum Free Deodorant not only prevents odor but keeps me dry. Aluminum Free and even works better than some Aluminum deodorants! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> First of all I love this deodorant but there are some problems as other reviewer have noted. And I am always willing to give products a try. The scent is heavenly, really fresh and clean and last all day an into the next day for me. However I noticed that after a few days I tend to get raw under the arm or if I apply it immediately after a shower the product stings. Now forgive me if I am using this product incorrectly and if you know the correct way, please advise. Aside from the burning and irritation after a few days I love the product and the fact that you cannot find it in any stores. I love it and I will buy again, I usually switch up and use other products and go back to it with no problem.</li>
            <li> This product works better used on a regular basis. The scent is a bit overwhelming, but the benefit of being the only aluminum free antiperspirant on the market makes it tolerable.</li>
            <li> My wife lost a kidney to cancer and is suppose to refrain from deodarants with aluminum.  After giving up on finding a good alternative, I saw this product.  She gave it a try and it works just as well as her old Secret brand</li>
            <li> I got this product because its aluminum free, I tried different brand like &amp;#34;Toms&amp;#34;, but they didn&#x27;t worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant smell really nice, but I need to use it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;With my old secret I used it once in 24 hours, after shower,but with this one, if u wont use it every 8 hours I start to smell.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you be able to find better aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> So happy when I found this deo...I had been looking in stores for months! No Aluminum and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> It cost a fortune and it&#x27;s not working at all. Very long time ago I  bought  the &amp;#34;same &amp;#34; for  one for 5-th of the price at a store but it came in different packaging and it was great. I  already grew it away,useless.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend breaks out because of the aluminum. I found her something other than old spice so she doesn&#x27;t have to smell like a teenage boy.</li>
            <li> My daughter needs the aluminum free deoderant and this adidas product works well for her.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work pretty good - wish it was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for years and i keep buying them up because they are discontinued. this one is probably a fake. it doesnt go on your skin. it is hard. maybe it is too old and doesn&#x27;t work like deodorant. i am very unhappy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I typically purchase adidas products but this deodorant was horrible (for me).  It burned my skin so bad, I just had to toss it.  Its a shame because I ended up buying four!!!</li>
            <li> Sorry to hear that this product may become discontinued...love that it is aluminum free and will continue buying it until it is gone!!!</li>
            <li> I search for Adidas Aluminum Free deodorant.  Tom&#x27;s doesnt do the job, and this is the best!  I thought I had lost it on Amazon, but through perserverance I found it through an individual source.  Order 4 at a time!! Aluminum adds to breast cancer</li>
