            <li>Smells nice and does the job</li>

            <li>My girlfriend even commented she liked it better than her lotions because I don&#x27;t stink when I get out of the bed.  </li>
            <li>good!i would order this lotion again without hesitation!it is made for a man because the smell proves that lol</li>
            <li>Easy choice here!</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I liked how easy it was to apply which is a challenge with a hairy body.</li>
            <li>so getting it online is a better way to go.</li>
            <li>Recommend to buy more well known brands.</li>
            <li>I love the manly smell of this lotion</li>
            <li>I have referred to friends and they love it as well!!L</li>
            <li>Fast shipping good product</li>
            <li>This is designed for guys who don&#x27;t want a strong smelling bronzer, but do want a quality product that doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li>and I am now buying more here on Amazon after getting my first bottle at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I am excited that there&#x27;s no poofy smell to this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the lotion for two weeks now and have got great color and for the price I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time.</li>
            <li>I spent the first day of my holiday proudly parading around the camp, where many of my fellow travellers mistook me for a Brazilian football player!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is great and he&#x27;s only used it a few times and already getting a great tan.</li>
            <li>After using this lotion the very first time my hands turned a burnt orange color.</li>
            <li>I applied it liberally and was quite pleased with my newly bronzed skin.</li>
            <li>I thought it would smell more masculine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Had a hiccup in the transaction, but the seller made it right and was prompt in fixing it.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would have worked better given the moderate price and reviews.</li>
            <li>Had to make several more visits to the Tanning salon.</li>
            <li>This is thick and covers great.  </li>
            <li>cant really tell right now</li>
            <li>Exactly what we wanted, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be a repeat buyer of this.</li>
            <li>Purchased a more generic one from wal mart for less that works better</li>
            <li>and I have found that you stick to the bed if you use to much almost like a suction cup.</li>
            <li>bought this bronzer because its name was Domination and it had skulls on it, a very manly bottle that I wouldn&#x27;t be embarrassed to take to the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t get to tan much with his work schedule</li>
            <li>, I even used it a few times when I was out of my own lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I managed to scale a nearby baobab and sat shivering amongst its branches as the hungry pack circled below, occasionally pausing to howl at their mates and take turns jumping at me snapping their powerful jaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tan was not dark enough and I was looking more red than tan.</li>
            <li>Cool label, but it had absolutely no indoor tanning benefits whatsoever.</li>
            <li>If I were to attempt another tan, I think I would only apply one full bottle next time.</li>
            <li>Also found it to be too thick causing me to use more lotion than normal because it didn&#x27;t rub into my skin well.  </li>
            <li>The tan applied evenly without smearing, and my skin felt natural to the touch with no trace of stickiness or residue.</li>
            <li>but I will update later on after a few more applications.</li>
            <li>Initially, I thought my dark appearance was caused by the fading light, but I soon realised my mistake.</li>
            <li>Not a real heavy feminine scent to it.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because of the price but wasn&#x27;t a major fan of the scent.  </li>
            <li>Must say I am addicted now-works great...ordering more as soon as I run out.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Thankfully they left as the sun was rising, and before too long my group returned to try and locate what they presumed would be my remains.</li>
            <li> was money well spent.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and was hoping to get an idea of the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; but wasn&#x27;t as expected.  </li>
            <li> I ran for the trees just as a pack of wild dogs pounced from the brush, the thick scent of my man-tan in their nostrils.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to put it on before you go to tan, this allows your skin to absorb it, a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> It smells just like all the other tanning lotions, tropical/fruity.</li>
            <li> Gives a dark tan.</li>
            <li> it had a bronzer in it to give me a dark tan</li>
            <li> Would still recommend getting showered down after a tanning session.</li>
            <li> but I found little or no color change.  </li>
            <li> After using the product my skin is dominated with a bronze look just after a few times of use!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband after he bought an expensive brand of tanning lotion that didn&#x27;t last 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t complain because there are very few lotions out there that the smell doesn&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;tanning bed&amp;#34; after you&#x27;ve tanned.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t long before my group was frantically calling out my name in the darkness despite my being mere feet from them.</li>
            <li> Being a pale white Irishman, I purchased this product in advance of heading off to sunny South Africa to set down a base and reduce the glare off my milky skin.</li>
            <li> I found this out the hard way that evening when we went out for a bush walk.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I was brought back to the camp and had the worst of the tan scrubbed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Another bad thing is the smell.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Love love love! Went tanning once and got instant results. Must say I am addicted now-works great...ordering more as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I was skeptical.  I figured this would be some alpha-male-i-wear-too-much-old-spice kind of scent.  It was surprising pleasant.  My girlfriend even commented she liked it better than her lotions because I don&#x27;t stink when I get out of the bed.  It&#x27;s not overpowering from a smell standpoint and applies well on skin.  I will certainly be a repeat buyer of this.</li>
            <li> Being a pale white Irishman, I purchased this product in advance of heading off to sunny South Africa to set down a base and reduce the glare off my milky skin. Well, let me tell you, this product will work wonders for you. I applied it liberally and was quite pleased with my newly bronzed skin. The tan applied evenly without smearing, and my skin felt natural to the touch with no trace of stickiness or residue. I spent the first day of my holiday proudly parading around the camp, where many of my fellow travellers mistook me for a Brazilian football player!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, be warned, this tan does gradually darken the longer it&#x27;s on your skin. I found this out the hard way that evening when we went out for a bush walk. Initially, I thought my dark appearance was caused by the fading light, but I soon realised my mistake. It wasn&#x27;t long before my group was frantically calling out my name in the darkness despite my being mere feet from them. My cries fell on deaf ears and they eventually left in the jeep to search for me. Now I was alone and next to invisible in the Savannah dusk, with not-so-distant howls indicating that predators were around. I ran for the trees just as a pack of wild dogs pounced from the brush, the thick scent of my man-tan in their nostrils. I managed to scale a nearby baobab and sat shivering amongst its branches as the hungry pack circled below, occasionally pausing to howl at their mates and take turns jumping at me snapping their powerful jaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully they left as the sun was rising, and before too long my group returned to try and locate what they presumed would be my remains. I was brought back to the camp and had the worst of the tan scrubbed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an amazing expreince on my trip, but I would hesitate before applying this tan again. If I were to attempt another tan, I think I would only apply one full bottle next time. I hope this review will help somebody make the correct purchasing choice.</li>
            <li> Did the job. I liked how easy it was to apply which is a challenge with a hairy body.</li>
            <li> This is designed for guys who don&#x27;t want a strong smelling bronzer, but do want a quality product that doesn&#x27;t streak. It works, I have been using it for a couple weeks now and I am now buying more here on Amazon after getting my first bottle at the tanning salon. I think it cost me $36 at the salon so getting it online is a better way to go. I would recommend to put it on before you go to tan, this allows your skin to absorb it, a little bit goes a long way and I have found that you stick to the bed if you use to much almost like a suction cup.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money. I feel like buying this bronzer was money well spent. I&#x27;ll probably buy a shade darker next time.</li>
            <li> Cool label, but it had absolutely no indoor tanning benefits whatsoever. Might as well use regular lotion in place of this. Recommend to buy more well known brands.</li>
            <li> I like the product, has it helped in my tanning cant really tell right now but I will update later on after a few more applications.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very good for tanning bronzer work very good!i would order this lotion again without hesitation!it is made for a man because the smell proves that lol</li>
            <li> I only bought this lotion because the reviews said that it didnt turn their hands orange. After using this lotion the very first time my hands turned a burnt orange color. Another bad thing is the smell. This does not smell like a man&#x27;s tanning lotion. It smells just like all the other tanning lotions, tropical/fruity. I would avoid this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the manly smell of this lotion it works well and doesn&#x27;t stink after tanning good price as well</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Great price!</li>
            <li> I am excited that there&#x27;s no poofy smell to this product. Being a man... while tanning... you shouldn&#x27;t smell like a girl.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have worked better given the moderate price and reviews. Purchased a more generic one from wal mart for less that works better</li>
            <li> Smells like girl lotion to me. Never wore it, wife took it because she likes it. I thought it would smell more masculine but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Goes on and spreads easy, pleasant smell</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Gives a dark tan. You turn brown not red!!! I have referred to friends and they love it as well!!L</li>
            <li> Had to make several more visits to the Tanning salon. The tan was not dark enough and I was looking more red than tan.</li>
            <li> Did work as well as some cheaper products...</li>
            <li> Want to get a manly tan? Try DOMINATION!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this bronzer because its name was Domination and it had skulls on it, a very manly bottle that I wouldn&#x27;t be embarrassed to take to the tanning salon. After using the product my skin is dominated with a bronze look just after a few times of use!</li>
            <li> Smells good, but husband says it&#x27;s kinda greasy. He never uses it, didn&#x27;t rlly see a change in skin color. I wouldnt buy this again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted, fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Good tanning lotion for the guys.  Not a real heavy feminine scent to it.  Still smells like a tanning lotion.  Would still recommend getting showered down after a tanning session.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and he&#x27;s only used it a few times and already getting a great tan. He doesn&#x27;t get to tan much with his work schedule but what times he has used it tanning he has gotten results.</li>
            <li> Good price, descent lotion.  I read reviews and was hoping to get an idea of the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; but wasn&#x27;t as expected.  I won&#x27;t complain because there are very few lotions out there that the smell doesn&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;tanning bed&amp;#34; after you&#x27;ve tanned.  I gave it 4 stars because of the price but wasn&#x27;t a major fan of the scent.  It did however absorb quite well and I didn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy after tanning.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!! Out of stock and I was refunded my money!! Keep a better inventory!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you orange. No streaking and it doesn&#x27;t break out my skin. Has a nice smell for men so you can avoid the flowery stuff!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, doesn&#x27;t smell too fruity, give a nice color. I use it once a week to maintain my color. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband after he bought an expensive brand of tanning lotion that didn&#x27;t last 2 weeks.  This is thick and covers great.  Nice smell, I even used it a few times when I was out of my own lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had a hiccup in the transaction, but the seller made it right and was prompt in fixing it.  I would recommend this seller and product to my friends</li>
            <li> Smells nice and does the job</li>
            <li> Works great just make sure you clean it off of your hands and fingers before you tan</li>
            <li> Still my go-to lotion. I have used others, but this one gets me the darkest without a bronzer. Recommended for anyone tanning. And the smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it had a bronzer in it to give me a dark tan but I found little or no color change.  Also found it to be too thick causing me to use more lotion than normal because it didn&#x27;t rub into my skin well.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I went to my local gym and they wanted to charge me $47 for this same product that I got for a 3rd for a 3rd of the price from this seller.  Easy choice here!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the lotion for two weeks now and have got great color and for the price I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time. Fast shipping good product</li>
