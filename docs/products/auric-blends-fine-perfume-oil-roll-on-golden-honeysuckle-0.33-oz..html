    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I use it every day and sometimes mix it with another perfume like patchouli and the two smell wonderful together</li>
            <li>When I got it, I smelled it after I took off the cap and wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to find this.  </li>
            <li>Still, happy I found it.  </li>
            <li>Now if I can find Grass in a oil I will be a happy woman</li>
            <li>Would make a great gift for any woman.</li>
            <li>I put it on my wrists and it did not smell good at all.</li>
            <li>I love this scent!</li>
            <li>but it is nice.  </li>
            <li>Very strong smell, it doesn&#x27;t even smell floral at all.</li>
            <li>The Jasmine is beautiful, light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I love Auric Blends roll on perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I do like this brand though, and I will continue to search for a scent of theirs that better fits me.</li>
            <li>My sister loves egyptian goddess, I love the china rain......</li>
            <li>I love auric blends, just not this scent.....</li>
            <li>The packaging and viscosity is lovely.</li>
            <li>The seller suggests I let it sit for two weeks and over time even years it will smell better and better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I asked many people and they all agree it smelled like POWDER.</li>
            <li>Honeysuckle is my favorite scent</li>
            <li>this particular brand did not smell good at all</li>
            <li>While I was impressed by both the fast shipping and the general quality of this oil perfume, the scent just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>I am still looking for the perfect honeysuckle scent, this is a little too sweet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what this scent is, But it smells cheap, too sweet and nothing like honeysuckle.  </li>
            <li>So if you are looking for that clean sweet smell, don&#x27;t bother with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a true honeysuckle scent and this isn&#x27;t it at all.</li>
            <li>the smell is ok, but use it very sparingly.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like honeysuckles, and rolls on easily.</li>
            <li>The Golden Honeysuckle is too sweet for me.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they tell me that the product needs to &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; to smell good and that they usually hold it for this aging process unless they have too many orders</li>
            <li>I have a honeysuckle bush outside my front door and absolutely LOVE the scent!  </li>
            <li>The bottle appears to be the right one</li>
            <li>\\&quot;wow, that&#x27;s a strong baby powder scent.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This particular roll-on is very very strong, which is good, as it&#x27;ll last a long time in view of the fact that you don&#x27;t need to put much on.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t smell like honeysuckle very much.</li>
            <li>i was trying to experiment with different brands and love honeysuckle.</li>
            <li>A nice powder, yes, but that isn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this again, and I highly recommended it to anyone who wants something warm and floral at the same time.</li>
            <li>Seller does not guarantee the sale and says I need to take this up with the manufacturer who distributes &amp;#34;unfinished&amp;#34; products as ready to use with NO warnings.</li>
            <li>Guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected more considering the price, but one can always hope.  </li>
            <li>You can most certainly smell honeysuckle, but it is over powered by a smell I can only describe as similar to a cleaning product.</li>
            <li>Remarkably beautiful scent for casual and formal</li>
            <li>After being on my skin for a little while, it acquired a slightly more floral scent along with the powder, but still naught like honeysuckle.</li>
            <li>I recently tried the Jasmine and the Golden Honeysuckle fragrances.  </li>
            <li>if there are some batches that smell better than others, don&#x27;t waste your time with this.</li>
            <li>It has floral notes of honeysuckle in it, but the base scent is kind of warm and it works really well together.</li>
            <li>At first I offered to accept a different scent.</li>
            <li>Its not bad smelling, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money</li>
            <li>Thought it smelled like an old lady.</li>
            <li>Purchased honeysuckle and I love the scent; brings back childhood memories walking past honeysuckle bushes.</li>
            <li>Sorry I couldn&#x27;t be more positive.</li>
            <li>but as I have had no other issue with Amazon I will have to let that be...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be staying completely away from Auric Blends in the future if this is their interpretation of any one flower.</li>
            <li>what could possibly smell so bad then mystically smell good?  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The honeysuckle isn&#x27;t too overpowering, and the scent lasts a long time, too.</li>
            <li> What chemical reaction has to happen to fake this scent and why can they not use a natural real scent?</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a single flower fragrance:</li>
            <li> This has absolutely no honeysuckle scent to it at all.  </li>
            <li> Be careful, though.  </li>
            <li> i asked a few other people and they said the same thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I still like it, but it is not a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I thought this was gong to be a little sweeter smelling, but it has a powdery musk hint to it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> What kind of Frankenstein chemical cocktail goes from Nasty bug spray to HONEYSUCKLE of all things?</li>
            <li> but even Amazon calls it non returnable toxic waste and suggests I take it to toxic waste disposal...</li>
            <li> I would just use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if all Auric Blends are this bad, but I am sure afraid to try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with this purchase because I was really hoping for something that smelled somewhat like honeysuckle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but alas....</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this is one of the worst generic &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34; fragrances I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune of smelling.  </li>
            <li> why I merely dab a bit between my ladies, and that&#x27;s that.  </li>
            <li> But now I am afraid to use what I have if this is how they make it.</li>
            <li> what is in it is some horrible concoction that is near the worst thing I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I feel that as the seller gave me no warning they share responsibility for taking my money and sending me horrible unusable crap.</li>
            <li> Sickening and cloying.  </li>
            <li> i was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and i was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but this scent is awful!!!  </li>
            <li> NASTY.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in a timely manner, but the oil smells so disgusting!</li>

            <li> This is supposed to be a single flower fragrance: Honeysuckle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is one of the worst generic &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34; fragrances I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune of smelling.  Its like public bathroom air freshener.  Overpowering, cloying and headache inducing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the various links to get to XTREMEK to try and return it and it just takes me in a circle, Amazon can&#x27;t take it back as they weren&#x27;t the seller (I don&#x27;t blame them for this).  Glad it wasn&#x27;t a god-awfully expensive item because this is seconds from hitting the trash can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be staying completely away from Auric Blends in the future if this is their interpretation of any one flower.</li>
            <li> I love Auric Blends roll on perfumes.  I recently tried the Jasmine and the Golden Honeysuckle fragrances.  The Jasmine is beautiful, light and fresh.  Would buy again.  The Golden Honeysuckle is too sweet for me.  I don&#x27;t think it smells like the honeysuckle I grow here in California.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! It has floral notes of honeysuckle in it, but the base scent is kind of warm and it works really well together. The honeysuckle isn&#x27;t too overpowering, and the scent lasts a long time, too. I will be buying this again, and I highly recommended it to anyone who wants something warm and floral at the same time.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and sometimes mix it with another perfume like patchouli and the two smell wonderful together</li>
            <li> This has absolutely no honeysuckle scent to it at all.  So if you are looking for that clean sweet smell, don&#x27;t bother with this stuff.</li>
            <li> i was trying to experiment with different brands and love honeysuckle. but when i got this product , it smells like shampoo or soap. i was very disappointed.  i asked a few other people and they said the same thing.  nothing flowery about this scent at all. do not waste your money</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a true honeysuckle scent and this isn&#x27;t it at all. I guess you get what you pay for and I should have thought about it twice before purchasing it. When I got it, I smelled it after I took off the cap and wasn&#x27;t impressed. I put it on my wrists and it did not smell good at all. Waste of money. I wouldn&#x27;t even give it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Purchased honeysuckle and I love the scent; brings back childhood memories walking past honeysuckle bushes.</li>
            <li> I bought two different role on oils of the same scent and this particular brand did not smell good at all</li>
            <li> I thought this was gong to be a little sweeter smelling, but it has a powdery musk hint to it. I still like it, but it is not a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> it does not smell anything like honeysuckle. the smell is ok, but use it very sparingly.</li>
            <li> While I was impressed by both the fast shipping and the general quality of this oil perfume, the scent just isn&#x27;t for me. You can most certainly smell honeysuckle, but it is over powered by a smell I can only describe as similar to a cleaning product. Its not bad smelling, just not what I expected. I do like this brand though, and I will continue to search for a scent of theirs that better fits me.</li>
            <li> I have a honeysuckle bush outside my front door and absolutely LOVE the scent!  So I set out to buy it as a perfume.  This particular roll-on is very very strong, which is good, as it&#x27;ll last a long time in view of the fact that you don&#x27;t need to put much on. Be careful, though.  You have been warned.  It can be quite overpowering.  Which it why I merely dab a bit between my ladies, and that&#x27;s that.  Bob&#x27;s your uncle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this scent is, But it smells cheap, too sweet and nothing like honeysuckle.  Really disappointed. Wish I could return it. Probably will toss it. Too gross to even use as a room deodorizer.</li>
            <li> My sister loves egyptian goddess, I love the china rain......but this scent is awful!!!  It smells like soap....I don&#x27;t like it, and neither does my bf.....wish I had chose another!!!!  I love auric blends, just not this scent.....</li>
            <li> I  used to wear a honeysuckle all the time when I was younger but could never find it so I was happy to find this.  The scent is not quite the same as what I wore years ago but it is nice.  I would just use a small amount.  Still, happy I found it.  Now if I can find Grass in a oil I will be a happy woman</li>
            <li> The perfume is advertised as honeysuckle, and while it definitely smells floral, it doesn&#x27;t smell enough like honeysuckle for it to be labeled as such. The packaging and viscosity is lovely.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from a &amp;#34;licensed distributor...who called themselves &amp;#34;Heath Time&amp;#34;. It was shipped before the deadline. The bottle appears to be the right one but alas....what is in it is some horrible concoction that is near the worst thing I have ever smelled. NASTY. Like unscented bug spray...not one hint of floral. Absolutely horrible. I contacted the seller and they tell me that the product needs to &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; to smell good and that they usually hold it for this aging process unless they have too many orders then they just send it...no waring in the package...no warning on the sellers page. The seller suggests I let it sit for two weeks and over time even years it will smell better and better. What kind of Frankenstein chemical cocktail goes from Nasty bug spray to HONEYSUCKLE of all things? What chemical reaction has to happen to fake this scent and why can they not use a natural real scent? At first I offered to accept a different scent. But now I am afraid to use what I have if this is how they make it. Seller does not guarantee the sale and says I need to take this up with the manufacturer who distributes &amp;#34;unfinished&amp;#34; products as ready to use with NO warnings. Not even a backorder. I feel that as the seller gave me no warning they share responsibility for taking my money and sending me horrible unusable crap. I will not buy from this seller or this company ever again...plus I feel there could be a safety issue with the product....what could possibly smell so bad then mystically smell good?  I tried to return or exchange this but even Amazon calls it non returnable toxic waste and suggests I take it to toxic waste disposal...this is also a concern for me but as I have had no other issue with Amazon I will have to let that be...</li>
            <li> Smells are all jumbled up.  It doesn&#x27;t resemble honeysuckle at all. Very strong smell, it doesn&#x27;t even smell floral at all.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in a timely manner, but the oil smells so disgusting! Nothing like Honeysuckle at all. It smells like that generic gross dishsoap smell, and I can&#x27;t get it off me now. I&#x27;m so disappointed with this purchase because I was really hoping for something that smelled somewhat like honeysuckle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if there are some batches that smell better than others, don&#x27;t waste your time with this. It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like honeysuckle very much. Thought it smelled like an old lady. :/</li>
            <li> I am still looking for the perfect honeysuckle scent, this is a little too sweet. But purchasing fragrances online tricky</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Thank gawd it&#x27;s still around. I mix out with amber pachuli oil. Remarkably beautiful scent for casual and formal</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Smells exactly like honeysuckles, and rolls on easily. I will buy this again. Would make a great gift for any woman.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, but smelled nothing like honeysuckle. I asked many people and they all agree it smelled like POWDER. A nice powder, yes, but that isn&#x27;t what I expected. After being on my skin for a little while, it acquired a slightly more floral scent along with the powder, but still naught like honeysuckle.</li>
            <li> This perfume was advertised as honeysuckle, but in reality, you will receive a roll on baby powder scented perfume. It did not have any floral notes at all. Honeysuckle is my favorite scent and i was very disappointed.  I&#x27;ve had several people smell it and they all say the same thing. \\&quot;wow, that&#x27;s a strong baby powder scent.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected more considering the price, but one can always hope.  Sickening and cloying.  Don&#x27;t know if all Auric Blends are this bad, but I am sure afraid to try.  Sorry I couldn&#x27;t be more positive.</li>
