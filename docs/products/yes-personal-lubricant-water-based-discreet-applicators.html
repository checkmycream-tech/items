    <ol>
            <li> Works very well, makes everybody happy and comfortable and that&#x27;s the point.  wouldn&#x27;t hestitate to recommend, that is if people were asking me about that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> This yes product didn&#x27;t last like i expected.  nor did it lubricate as well as other products i have tried.</li>
            <li> Good lubricant for all ages cause my daughter who&#x27;s 29 and just gave birth so she used Yes.. Then I am going thru menopause and hurt like heck when making love. So she gave me a tube of Yes. I inserted right before making love and I Loved it and so did my husband. I am 53 and highly reccomend it!!</li>
            <li> Amazing lubricant for those in menopause. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I love the applicators to take on trips, easy to use and less messy.  I may be old but my husband and I aren&#x27;t dead, yet.  Great for mature lovemaking.</li>
            <li> Tried as a moisturizer before hand and had an immediate reaction followed by an UTI</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! No burning, no irritation, and no yeast infection. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not sold in stores in the USA.</li>
            <li> Yes products are amazing. I experienced unbearable pain with the onset of menopause and thought my love life was over. We use the oil based and the water based together and we are so grateful for the results. Another reviewer mentioned preservatives. The oil based product does not have preservatives. The water based product has a natural preservative that is safer than what you would find in commercial products. I am very concerned about what I use on and in my body and these products are just about as natural and as safe as you can get. I tried other natural lubricants and they never worked. I&#x27;m willing to tolerate a natural preservative to get my love life back and I feel very comfortable with the safety of these products. It&#x27;s better than taking hormones. The Yes website answered my questions and explained in detail each ingredient which made me feel confident in my purchase. For me and my husband the Yes products have been a blessing!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was as describe.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Yes water-based intimate lubricant\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to experiment but I care about my health. Anyone can enjoy some extra lubrication for certain things/occasions. There shouldn&#x27;t be any shame in this, discreet or not. It&#x27;s TERRIBLE that the company touts this product as \\&quot;pure and natural\\&quot; but it&#x27;s not. Among the ingredients listed on the BOX (not easily found online by the way and definitely not in the Amazon description here) is Phenoxyethanol. Try organic coconut oil or Aloe Vera gel instead or even a lot of saliva. Those are the only substances truly pure and natural.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that there is an applicator here which makes it easier to get the product where it needs to be. It did not cure my atrophic vaginitis, but it does help.</li>
            <li> Works as promoted- very natural.</li>
            <li> After a hysterectomy 18 years ago, this is the first and only product that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Clean, non-irritating, odorless. Does the best job of adding lubrication missing during any day of the month. easy convenient packaging perfect for travel as well. Won&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would provide more lubrication than the lubrications  purchased over the counter.  I didn&#x27;t find this product to be any better than the KY jelly products.</li>
            <li> Love the product snd applucator</li>
            <li> Apparently, the person I bought this for is not happy with it. She has post menopausal drying or (vaginitis) and needs it for relief and comfort. According to her, it&#x27;s too watery and runs down the leg. I provides no relief.  If that&#x27;s the case, then this is way too expensive for a tube full of water.</li>
            <li> Excellent... helps with dryness exceptionally well. Especially going through that wonderful season of live us women all go through.</li>
            <li> how are they allowed to get away with advertising this as natural...I just wasted my money as i dont use chemicals in or on my body.</li>
            <li> When intercourse becomes painful during menopause there is NOTHING better. We have tried virtually everything from natural oils and gels to any over the counter product we could find. We have a cabinet full. Natural or not when pain comes between you this product is a God send.</li>
            <li> Best product for this purpose. No sticky mess, easy applicator.&lt;br /&gt;Convenient. I really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Not always available, so get it when you can.</li>
            <li> I like all the products made by this company. I especially like the oil-based products, they work better for daily use by older women.</li>
            <li> The best lubricant that I have ever used---feels like normal lubrication that is necessary for sex to be comfortable, especially after menopause. I am so happy to have found this product. I will continue to use far as long as necessary.</li>
            <li> Great!! It works well also look at the other products this company sells they work</li>
