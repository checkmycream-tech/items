            <li>these are the best cones ever made.  </li>
            <li>Impressive shipping!</li>
            <li>this is a great incense.</li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>Smells great but doesn&#x27;t burn all.</li>
            <li>Great deal and great packaging.</li>
            <li>lol, tmi</li>
            <li>These are great, and come with two samples in them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I use it while meditating and it has a wonderful light scent.try</li>
            <li>good quality product.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent deal on my favorite incense:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>great product and awesome price quick and easy</li>
            <li>Some of the best incense that you can buy, it has a wonderful sweet and spicy smell, there is nothing else like it really.</li>
            <li>My favorite!</li>
            <li>, she was VERT pleased!</li>
            <li>Been through a couple boxes and all have burnt just fine and smell great.  </li>
            <li>Great aroma and the easiest to light of any of the cones I have.</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t get me started on how nice it is on a rainy day.</li>
            <li>You have to let it burn for quite some time before it will stay lit on its own.</li>
            <li>Great price plus two free samples:)</li>
            <li>However, once lit they do exactly what they are supposed to do, smell good!</li>
            <li>SuperHit is by far the smoothest burning incense it covers odors perfectly and allows one to relax in the scent as you either meditate set the mood or just relax with the chimes</li>
            <li>I have always liked this sent  better than Nag Champa.  </li>
            <li>The cones require more care with lighting, but once they are lit they are amazing.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the good service!</li>
            <li>So, first of all, I&#x27;m not a hippy or fortune teller or wacky tobaccy smoker (lol).</li>
            <li>They smell nice and strong, so they cover up all kinds of smells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of Super Hit for years and thought it would be a great idea to buy some in bulk...    </li>
            <li>Love the stick version of this scent, don&#x27;t know if maybe i got a counterfeit or</li>
            <li>Real Super Hits also burn</li>
            <li>Not my favorite incense.  </li>
            <li>After so many requests for it, I got some for me</li>
            <li>and now I understand why they love it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is one of the most appealing I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>perhaps they were defective to begin with and it made more sense to the company management to ditch them on unsuspecting online customers (most of whom I suspect, like myself, don&#x27;t want to pay return shipping on a $17 purchase, thus being stuck with the faulty product).    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed superhit.</li>
            <li>My favorite cone incense.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t blame the vendor I&#x27;m sure it is just differences in the production</li>
            <li>I love the way this stuff smells and it helps me get the smell of my cat&#x27;s litter box out.</li>
            <li>I love this incense.  </li>
            <li>High end quality product, quick to ship, great prices.</li>
            <li>pepper smell where these cones smell more sweet.</li>
            <li>Love super hit incense.</li>
            <li>Super Hit has a more, dare I say,</li>
            <li>One of them will fit any mood.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to the cone version just for a cleaner burn, it does light easy, stays burning, but burns quickly.</li>
            <li>Many of my customers love this particular brand of Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>Super Hit Incense lights easily and burns to the end - unlike some.  </li>
            <li>:) Thanks!</li>
            <li>Smells good enough.  </li>
            <li>The item is described as a box Incense Cones - SUPER HIT (12 BX OF 12 Cones).</li>
            <li>The super hit cones have a pointy peak where these are rounded.</li>
            <li>A+++ Stellar Dealer!</li>
            <li>The first order were true Super Hit where I bought from marketplace store, Tom&#x27;s Incense.</li>
            <li>Hopefully you still sell more Nag Champa Super Hit in the future!</li>
            <li>I know there are a lot of knock off Nag Champa and Super Hit cones, I&#x27;ve gotten them before, but these are the real deal.</li>
            <li>Came exactly as they described it.</li>
            <li>It is kinda smokey though, so if you light more than one in a closed room be ready for it to look like someone is burning something in the kitchen.</li>
            <li>All that being said, I do want to note positively that shipping was timely.  </li>
            <li>Ships fast too.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>The merchandise was delivered on time and very well packaged.</li>
            <li>this is the scent you smell in most shops in the Down town areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been burning Super Hit for the last five years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now unless Satya Sai Baba changed their recipe, I&#x27;m going to say that someone is distributing knock-off SUPER HIT and are being distributed by multiple stores.</li>
            <li>The reviews that say they have a problem lighting it, take an extra second, let it burn a bit, then it works just fine.</li>
            <li>The super hit cones burn to an ash grey where these burn to an ash red.</li>
            <li>but the last few times I ordered super hit sticks or cones they have all been very bitter/soapy smelling.</li>
            <li>The aroma is not very strong, nor did I find it personally like it as much as the higher quality products.</li>
            <li>It is not exactly like the sticks I like the sticks a little better but the scent is not bad at all, I will burn these once in a while to change it up a little.</li>
            <li>they burn all the way throught like no other cones that I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>They are hard to light.</li>
            <li>The incense quality is mediocre compared to some of the higher quality cones and incense sticks available in the market.</li>
            <li>Each box comes with a small holder for the cones, which is cool.</li>
            <li>I had been ordering super hit in the past because it had even a nicer sweetness than nag champa.</li>
            <li>The third order was again purchased from from marketplace store, Tom&#x27;s Incense (thinking I&#x27;d get the real deal) but they of course are not Super Hit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is with these cones, but they stop burning after just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I wish that I could give this review less than one star, but Amazon has stuck me with having at least one star.  </li>
            <li> At least they burn without interruption.    </li>
            <li> Get This you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> ill tell you this, mu mom despises incense!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> High end quality product, quick to ship, great prices. A+++ Stellar Dealer!</li>
            <li> Super Hit Incense lights easily and burns to the end - unlike some.  The fragrance is pleasing - not too sweet..reminds me of scents from my hippie days in the 70s.  I am an artist and like to crank up the music and burn SuperHit when I paint.  And don&#x27;t get me started on how nice it is on a rainy day.</li>
            <li> If you are expecting Nag Champa, look elsewhere.    This is Superhit, a scent in a class by itself.    This and Nag are my favorites.  One of them will fit any mood.  Sometimes I burn them togehter.  It&#x27;s intoxicating.</li>
            <li> SuperHit is by far the smoothest burning incense it covers odors perfectly and allows one to relax in the scent as you either meditate set the mood or just relax with the chimes this is the scent you smell in most shops in the Down town areas. Get This you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Love the stick version of this scent, don&#x27;t know if maybe i got a counterfeit or what but, this is not even close to the same scent as the stick version. I was looking forward to the cone version just for a cleaner burn, it does light easy, stays burning, but burns quickly. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love super hit incense. buy it</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> The item is described as a box Incense Cones - SUPER HIT (12 BX OF 12 Cones). You get 12 small boxes of the same cones with two samples so I&#x27;m not sure how people are getting confused. I&#x27;ve been burning Super Hit for the last five years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is. These are not Super Hit. Super Hit has a more, dare I say, pepper smell where these cones smell more sweet. The super hit cones have a pointy peak where these are rounded. The super hit cones burn to an ash grey where these burn to an ash red. Real Super Hits also burn longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third order from Amazon. The first order were true Super Hit where I bought from marketplace store, Tom&#x27;s Incense. The second order was from marketplace store Incense Garden, and they also were not Super Hit but I didn&#x27;t complain. The third order was again purchased from from marketplace store, Tom&#x27;s Incense (thinking I&#x27;d get the real deal) but they of course are not Super Hit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now unless Satya Sai Baba changed their recipe, I&#x27;m going to say that someone is distributing knock-off SUPER HIT and are being distributed by multiple stores. Hopefully Amazon will fix this problem. Until then, buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic. Great aroma and the easiest to light of any of the cones I have. Actually made me disappointed with some of the other cones I&#x27;ve bought because these were far superior.</li>
            <li> this is a great incense.I use it while meditating and it has a wonderful light scent.try it.</li>
            <li> Some of the best incense that you can buy, it has a wonderful sweet and spicy smell, there is nothing else like it really. Ships fast too. This is an excellent deal on my favorite incense:)</li>
            <li> Smells good enough.  Not my favorite incense.  But hey, it covers up the smell of some other smoke.</li>
            <li> Many of my customers love this particular brand of Nag Champa. After so many requests for it, I got some for me and now I understand why they love it.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this sent  better than Nag Champa.  I find it softer, less over-powering. Use for mediation &amp; reflection</li>
            <li> My favorite! Great price plus two free samples:)</li>
            <li> good quality product. fast shipping</li>
            <li> These are great. Each box comes with a small holder for the cones, which is cool. The fragrance is one of the most appealing I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Lots for what you pay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is with these cones, but they stop burning after just a few minutes.  Essentially they only burn about .25 inches before self-extinguishing.  I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of Super Hit for years and thought it would be a great idea to buy some in bulk...    Turns out, I probably should have just continued getting ripped-off for individual packets at my local crappy headshop.  At least they burn without interruption.    I wish that I could give this review less than one star, but Amazon has stuck me with having at least one star.  Whatever.    My assumption is that these were sitting on a shelf in a warehouse for years -or- perhaps they were defective to begin with and it made more sense to the company management to ditch them on unsuspecting online customers (most of whom I suspect, like myself, don&#x27;t want to pay return shipping on a $17 purchase, thus being stuck with the faulty product).    In addition, I&#x27;d like to note that the package itself was damaged, which reenforced my belief that this was a rather vintage box of incense or defective in some way.    All that being said, I do want to note positively that shipping was timely.  That is unfortunately the only positive thing I have to write about this purchase.    I suppose my only sensible recourse at this stage is to discard the product and count it as a total loss.  Sigh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed superhit. Kinda reminds me of chocolate mixed with baby powder. Came exactly as they described it.</li>
            <li> My favorite cone incense.</li>
            <li> It is what it should be, no more no less. The reviews that say they have a problem lighting it, take an extra second, let it burn a bit, then it works just fine.</li>
            <li> these are the best cones ever made.  they burn all the way throught like no other cones that I have ever tried.  I love them.</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t burn all. It stops just after the tip is gone. I went through three boxes and the same thing every time.  Very frustrated!!</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t ran out and I bought these months ago. They smell nice and strong, so they cover up all kinds of smells.</li>
            <li> Great deal and great packaging. Deffinitely going to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I literally bought this Saturday and received this today, which is Monday afternoon. Impressive shipping! I gotta say this scent smells anazig! ill tell you this, mu mom despises incense! wen i had her take a whiff of what came in the mail, she was VERT pleased! lol, tmi but i use incense to repel her from my alcohol! Although I&#x27;m spiritual as well! ^-^ Thank you so much for the good service! Hopefully you still sell more Nag Champa Super Hit in the future! :) Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of Nag Champa. These are great, and come with two samples in them. You can also not beat the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is not exactly like the sticks I like the sticks a little better but the scent is not bad at all, I will burn these once in a while to change it up a little.</li>
            <li> The merchandise was delivered on time and very well packaged. The incense quality is mediocre compared to some of the higher quality cones and incense sticks available in the market. The aroma is not very strong, nor did I find it personally like it as much as the higher quality products.</li>
            <li> great product and awesome price quick and easy</li>
            <li> I had been ordering super hit in the past because it had even a nicer sweetness than nag champa. but the last few times I ordered super hit sticks or cones they have all been very bitter/soapy smelling. can&#x27;t blame the vendor I&#x27;m sure it is just differences in the production</li>
            <li> So, first of all, I&#x27;m not a hippy or fortune teller or wacky tobaccy smoker (lol). I love the way this stuff smells and it helps me get the smell of my cat&#x27;s litter box out. It is kinda smokey though, so if you light more than one in a closed room be ready for it to look like someone is burning something in the kitchen. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this incense.  It always hits the spot to smell it. I would suggest it to anyone looking for a mellow incense.  I would have to pick the sticks over the cones for convenience.  The cones require more care with lighting, but once they are lit they are amazing.</li>
            <li> Been through a couple boxes and all have burnt just fine and smell great.  I know there are a lot of knock off Nag Champa and Super Hit cones, I&#x27;ve gotten them before, but these are the real deal.</li>
            <li> I got this instead of the sticks. They are hard to light. You have to let it burn for quite some time before it will stay lit on its own. However, once lit they do exactly what they are supposed to do, smell good!</li>
