            <li>Glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I got very excited to throw out all of my many boxes of mostly used up tea, and just use this to have one tea holder, will of my teas neatly organized.</li>

            <li>I liked it so much I have bought more for gifts!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for at a good price.</li>

            <li>I measured my purse before I made the purchase so it fit just fine.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t express how much I enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>I gave them to my nieces as gifts for Christmas filled with makeup</li>
            <li>so I was able to use it right away before christmas.  </li>
            <li>Some other reviews led me to believe the quality wouldn&#x27;t be very good</li>
            <li>but it is very useful</li>
            <li>SUPER easy way to change out purses with ease and speed.</li>
            <li>Bag looks plenty useful!</li>

            <li>The sides don&#x27;t stand up super well though like in the picture.</li>
            <li>The netting on the side pockets tore quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for keeping in your handbag to keep you better organized, especially if you carry a larger bag.</li>
            <li>The shipping is free, however please be aware that this is shipping from CHINA-</li>
            <li>I love this so far!</li>
            <li>the sides snap together for when you don&#x27;t need it fully expanded, and the little handles are great.</li>
            <li>And switching bags is super easy - you just grab this puppy out, and plop it into your new purse.</li>
            <li>Like I said looks useful.</li>
            <li>Turns all my bag purses into useful, organized bags.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>serves its purpose but it ripped pretty quickly</li>
            <li>I can find everything in my purse, right when I need it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect due to the price being very low; however, it&#x27;s beautiful and very well made.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with product and received it sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like picture.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more for my female co-workers.</li>
            <li>the inner (main) section is large enough to hold my multiple Altoids tins for additional organizing, and the outer pocket spaces are great for beauty items that would otherwise get lost on the bottom of my purse!</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the product is exactly what the description said it will be.</li>
            <li>takes up too much room in handbag to be of use.....</li>
            <li>I expected it to be able to stand.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t carry that much, therefore it flops around in my purse.</li>
            <li>The organizer was shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>The price of this purse organizer is very affordable.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>How much wear and tear can I place on this sort of item any way.</li>
            <li>The zippers are still intact, but just doesn&#x27;t keep much shape.</li>
            <li>The organizer  fits in most my satchel, and other hobo bags</li>
            <li>So many pockets I still have some empty ones!</li>
            <li>Pull out the purse insides by the handles, and throw it into a new bag!</li>
            <li>Not much money spent to learn a good leason.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t suggest them enough or any higher!</li>
            <li>Contemplating purchasing more as  small knitting bag and for travel.</li>
            <li>So if you are thinking of buying this product and are worried about it possibly being too large for your purse or something, just think of something else you could use it for.</li>
            <li>Amazing, I had bought at least 3 of this in different colors and you can literally put al your makeup in there.</li>
            <li>The material is a flimsy vinyl fabric and some soft padding inside.</li>
            <li>and I go directly to look for them, also</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I expected and the shipping was within the timeline you gave.  </li>
            <li>like all the other folks with bad reviews towards this seller...it was cheap &amp; good quality but not even close to the color shown in the ad..</li>
            <li>Very well made, but the orange color is such a deep color that it looks almost red.</li>
            <li>The delivery of this item is fast as I expected from the 10 -14 days</li>
            <li>so you can really see it inside a dark handbag or tote.</li>

            <li> Turns all my bag purses into useful, organized bags.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> serves its purpose but it ripped pretty quickly</li>
            <li> I can find everything in my purse, right when I need it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect due to the price being very low; however, it&#x27;s beautiful and very well made.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product and received it sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like picture.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more for my female co-workers.</li>
            <li> the inner (main) section is large enough to hold my multiple Altoids tins for additional organizing, and the outer pocket spaces are great for beauty items that would otherwise get lost on the bottom of my purse!</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the product is exactly what the description said it will be.</li>
            <li> takes up too much room in handbag to be of use.....</li>
            <li> I expected it to be able to stand.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t carry that much, therefore it flops around in my purse.</li>
            <li> The organizer was shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> The price of this purse organizer is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy.</li>
            <li> How much wear and tear can I place on this sort of item any way.</li>
            <li> The zippers are still intact, but just doesn&#x27;t keep much shape.</li>
            <li> The organizer  fits in most my satchel, and other hobo bags</li>
            <li> So many pockets I still have some empty ones!</li>
            <li> Pull out the purse insides by the handles, and throw it into a new bag!</li>
            <li> Not much money spent to learn a good leason.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t suggest them enough or any higher!</li>
            <li> Contemplating purchasing more as  small knitting bag and for travel.</li>
            <li> So if you are thinking of buying this product and are worried about it possibly being too large for your purse or something, just think of something else you could use it for.</li>
            <li> Amazing, I had bought at least 3 of this in different colors and you can literally put al your makeup in there.</li>
            <li> The material is a flimsy vinyl fabric and some soft padding inside.</li>
            <li> and I go directly to look for them, also</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected and the shipping was within the timeline you gave.  </li>
            <li> like all the other folks with bad reviews towards this seller...it was cheap &amp; good quality but not even close to the color shown in the ad..</li>
            <li> Very well made, but the orange color is such a deep color that it looks almost red.</li>
            <li> The delivery of this item is fast as I expected from the 10 -14 days</li>
            <li> so you can really see it inside a dark handbag or tote.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure how durable they will be so try not to zip my bag so much.</li>
            <li> Now, let&#x27;s see how long this will last.</li>
            <li> I loved the colors and the size, I only wished it had a stronger bottom base to help keep it standing.</li>
            <li> Pink for handbags, yellow for tote bags, and orange for my messenger bags!</li>
            <li> I received it 10 days earlier than the earliest expected date.</li>
            <li> I received product long  before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> Color is close enough to my purse that they look like they were made for each other.</li>
            <li> Complete junk, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty floppy which gets frustrating.</li>
            <li> Smaller that what I expected, it gets lost in my purse (turns upside down).</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that the bottom was  little flimsy -</li>
            <li> Waited closed to two month being shipped on Taiwan</li>
            <li> I have purchased handbag inserts before that were not very functional.  </li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a DULL FLAT RED....</li>
            <li> Not big at all, not sure the straps would hold any weight.</li>
            <li> They can be used for things other than purses.</li>
            <li> Helps keep cell phone and all the other stuff I carry organized!</li>
            <li> Lasted less then one month, unraveling, handles are falling off, seams are coming apart.  </li>
            <li> My winter purse is a hobo style with black lining.</li>
            <li> if I need to change purses I can save the mess and hassle</li>
            <li> I bought this product for just a few dollars intending to use it as a purse organizer (like it was advertised as.)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain for a few bucks though.</li>
            <li> Will be giving a few as gifts this Christmas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small for the things I needed it to hold.</li>
            <li> so I had to add a cut out hard cardboard bottom to slip inside.  </li>
            <li> thick padding should be eliminated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really tired of having a scavenger hunt in my purse every time I had to look for something, a friend had one</li>
            <li> It made it impossible to find small things like keys or lip balm at the bottom of the bag.</li>
            <li> I use it in the console of our family vehicle to store random items for my kids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed since it was meant to match another bag</li>
            <li> Buy these, you will not be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am in love with this organizer.  It fits almost all of my purses perfectly.  I love the color and it is durable.</li>
            <li> It is a great organizer, I wish it was sturdier, or that the four sides were stiffer so that it didn&#x27;t collapsed on itself. They could have designed an extra pockets on each of the ends, on the gray side where they have the snaps. I am going to saw some material and make pockets on the sides. Even though it has enough pockets it is easier to memorize the ends and reach for items without looking into the purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is perfect to reflect some light into the purse and the material is of very good quality. It is well crafted.</li>
            <li> takes up too much room in handbag to be of use.....thick padding should be eliminated.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be able to stand. If you fill it as pictured and then it is great. But I don&#x27;t carry that much, therefore it flops around in my purse. I don&#x27;t use it any more.  I loved the colors and the size, I only wished it had a stronger bottom base to help keep it standing. If you are not looking for a stand up one this will be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> Really great for travel which I do a lot of and the price is excellent</li>
            <li> Great organizer!  I keep it in my vehicle console.  Perfect to hold GPS, hand sanitizer, lotion, tire guage, flash light, etc.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Looks exactly like picture. Very satisfied with product and received it sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Nice ! it makes my life easier!</li>
            <li> Very well made, but the orange color is such a deep color that it looks almost red. I would buy again, just not in orange.</li>
            <li> Bag looks plenty useful! Oh it would of been cool for gardening , I ordered threeand then never got them after many attempts to even get a refund. Nothing . Like I said looks useful.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly in my purse and keeps everything organized, I am now able to find my keys right away. It also makes it easy to switch purses real fast. The shipping was fast and the product is exactly what the description said it will be. I love it!</li>
            <li> Very pleased happy with color and quality</li>
            <li> Order was received within promised timeframe, however it was not Orange as I ordered. It&#x27;s a DULL FLAT RED....like all the other folks with bad reviews towards this seller...it was cheap &amp; good quality but not even close to the color shown in the ad..I&#x27;m disappointed since it was meant to match another bag but whatever...I&#x27;ll keep it because I need it now....I won&#x27;t buy from seller again..&amp; would not recommend seller to anyone..</li>
            <li> Really love it.  Great for organizing everything in your purse.  Also good for craft supplies. Recommend this product for anyone who has to dig through their purse to find anything.</li>
            <li> This purchase was fine for the price.  However, I imagined it bigger.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it had I know the size.  I was using it to organize receipts etc. in my car.  It&#x27;s too small for the things I needed it to hold.</li>
            <li> I do use it in my purse, but it really isn&#x27;t that great.  It doesn&#x27;t hold the form like the picture shows and the middle part is open so things don&#x27;t stay put without a zipper.  It&#x27;s ok though.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected and the shipping was within the timeline you gave.  I use this product for art supplies and to work by the couch.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for keeping in your handbag to keep you better organized, especially if you carry a larger bag. It&#x27;s made well. If you change bags a lot, this is definitely a great to have, allowing you to change bags more conveniently.</li>
            <li> good quality, bought for Christmas presents and think it will really be enjoyed...received without any probems...would purchase again, very pleased</li>
            <li> I love the organizer....I love to switch bags all the time depending on my mood. The organizer  fits in most my satchel, and other hobo bags...love. I have 2 organizers, great accessory.</li>
            <li> In searching for inserts for knitting bags that I am making this fits for smaller ones but I am still hoping for something bigger.</li>
            <li> The organizer was shipped really fast. I love the colors and all the pockets. The handles make it so easy to grab out of my purse. I would prefer that it was stiffer in that it collapses easy, but for the price it was great.</li>
            <li> works perfect for my Couponing!</li>
            <li> Love the color of the bag and it&#x27;s price I paid for. Waited closed to two month being shipped on Taiwan but I didn&#x27;t mind it one bit. The material is a flimsy vinyl fabric and some soft padding inside. The zippers seem to be working fine at the moment but I am not sure how durable they will be so try not to zip my bag so much. I would recommend it to anyone who has tenancy to throw everything in their purse and when the time comes to look for your car key or a phone, you struggle to find among your stuff. This solves my problems and am now an organized mama on the go. Now, let&#x27;s see how long this will last. :-D</li>
            <li> Sadly I loved this organizer for two weeks then the handle tore off! I looked closely &amp; it was only sewn to the trim.</li>
            <li> I ordered this purse organizer and its good for all my stuffs inside my bag. The delivery of this item is fast as I expected from the 10 -14 days so I was able to use it right away before christmas.  The price of this purse organizer is very affordable. I really liked it!!</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given a five star but the handles need reinforcing. Altogether, I enjoyed the bright color and many pockets to organize everything</li>
            <li> Smaller that what I expected, it gets lost in my purse (turns upside down). Plus side, it does have many pockets and zippered storage compartments.</li>
            <li> Not big at all, not sure the straps would hold any weight. Very flimsy. Would not purchase another...ever....at all again!</li>
            <li> These things are AWESOME!!! Pull out the purse insides by the handles, and throw it into a new bag! LOVE these - they have many different pockets and they are padded a bit too! I got them in three colors for different bag usage types, Pink for handbags, yellow for tote bags, and orange for my messenger bags! Can&#x27;t suggest them enough or any higher!</li>
            <li> Lasted less then one month, unraveling, handles are falling off, seams are coming apart.  Complete junk, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for just a few dollars intending to use it as a purse organizer (like it was advertised as.) Well somehow I thought to see if tea would fit in the sides, and OMG! I got very excited to throw out all of my many boxes of mostly used up tea, and just use this to have one tea holder, will of my teas neatly organized. I love it! So if you are thinking of buying this product and are worried about it possibly being too large for your purse or something, just think of something else you could use it for. This could be great for kid&#x27;s art/crafting materials, nail polishes, really lots of things! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t express how much I enjoy this product.  I don&#x27;t have to keep anything seperated by baggies anymore.  Considering on buying some for gifts.</li>
            <li> I like this item, is help me keep my large handbag very clean and easy to find what I need.</li>
            <li> The bag came faster than predicted! It was bigger than I thought it would be too! Some other reviews led me to believe the quality wouldn&#x27;t be very good but it&#x27;s great!! I will definitely order again from this company.</li>
            <li> These were great quality bags for the price. I gave them to my nieces as gifts for Christmas filled with makeup so they could use them as makeup bags, perfect!</li>
            <li> This organizer fits my needs well. I use it in the console of our family vehicle to store random items for my kids.</li>
            <li> Convenient  way to organize purse. SUPER easy way to change out purses with ease and speed.</li>
            <li> I love how many pockets there are on this bag. I use it for all of my female things for my nails, hair, and even makeup. It&#x27;s absolutely PERFECT for traveling and I can even fit my Kindle in it :)</li>
            <li> excelente producto...</li>
            <li> Nice bright color so you can really see it inside a dark handbag or tote. Nice size and lots of pockets. Great price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect due to the price being very low; however, it&#x27;s beautiful and very well made. I received it 10 days earlier than the earliest expected date.</li>
            <li> This organizer is spectacular, I love it!!  My purse has never been so organized, and I can see and find everything. I will give as gifts. The colors are so bright and pretty. They can be used for things other than purses. I am going to use one on my office desk. Terrific seller!  I received product long  before the estimated delivery date. Buy these, you will not be disappointed. You will not believe how many items this great organizer can hold. It is fabulous!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for at a good price.</li>
            <li> It never came.I wrote to the shipper...I still don&#x27;t have it..So much for a good deal...If they do enough people like this they wiil make a lot of money...I will think twice before ordering something that sounds this good...Not much money spent to learn a good leason.</li>
            <li> I bought one for me and another as a gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really tired of having a scavenger hunt in my purse every time I had to look for something, a friend had one and she recommended it, I am very happy about this purchase, every item has their place and I go directly to look for them, also if I need to change purses I can save the mess and hassle you just have to grab the organizer by the handles and make the switch, its a time saver!...in all a must have for women on the go!</li>
            <li> Turns all my bag purses into useful, organized bags. I can easily find anything I need. It seems well made and sturdy. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of weeks. So many pockets I still have some empty ones! Love this. Don&#x27;t know what how I survived before it ;) Just kidding but it is very useful and I couldn&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> My winter purse is a hobo style with black lining. It made it impossible to find small things like keys or lip balm at the bottom of the bag. This is an inexpensive solution that has made my life easier. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I loved my tote bag before and now it is next to perfect because I can find everything.  Contemplating purchasing more as  small knitting bag and for travel.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase.  The quality was very good.  The only problem I had was that the bottom was  little flimsy - so I had to add a cut out hard cardboard bottom to slip inside.  It is well worth the price.  It is a good product and the quality was good.</li>
            <li> Cant zip it all the way. Love the idea of it. And would give it 5 stars if the zipper worked.  Have 2 of them and both are thr same</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet, but i love the way it looks and it seems to be great for organizing. the sides snap together for when you don&#x27;t need it fully expanded, and the little handles are great.</li>
            <li> If your purse is on the larger size without an inside divider this is an excellent choice.  It&#x27;s a bit too big for one of my purses that does have an inside divider - otherwise great for quick purse changes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s after the date they said it was to be deliveried and it&#x27;s still not here. I&#x27;ve waited almost a month now and it&#x27;s still not here</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my one compartment purse! the inner (main) section is large enough to hold my multiple Altoids tins for additional organizing, and the outer pocket spaces are great for beauty items that would otherwise get lost on the bottom of my purse! there are 2 zippered areas off to the side of the main that is perfect for paper storage. The shipping is free, however please be aware that this is shipping from CHINA- you won&#x27;t get 2 day ship. I plan to buy more for my female co-workers. What a great price!!!</li>
            <li> Great case with tons of storage. The sides don&#x27;t stand up super well though like in the picture. It&#x27;s pretty floppy which gets frustrating. Can&#x27;t complain for a few bucks though.</li>
            <li> serves its purpose but it ripped pretty quickly</li>
            <li> Helps organize big purses/bags. Color is close enough to my purse that they look like they were made for each other. Helps keep cell phone and all the other stuff I carry organized!</li>
            <li> I have purchased handbag inserts before that were not very functional.  This insert is roomy without being bulky and fits in most of my bags easily.  In a pinch I have actually carried it by itself.  Will be giving a few as gifts this Christmas.</li>
            <li> Easy to use ^^ love it !</li>
            <li> I like it!  It&#x27;s helping my purse to be more organized!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because i alread knew this item. Excelent product, excellent quality. I recomend this to everyone. \o/</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected. It looks like it was taken out of something else. It took about 2 months to get it.</li>
            <li> I love this organizer.  It fits into my purses and helps me to organize everything.  It is so easy to reach into my purses and find everything so easily.  Great purchase for the money, too.</li>
            <li> I measured my purse before I made the purchase so it fit just fine. The quality does equal the price so I did get what I paid for. How much wear and tear can I place on this sort of item any way. It does what it was intended to do and contains all of those items that a woman carries in her purse. Glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> este articulo nunca me llego y tampoco me reembolsaron y meti reclamo varias veces</li>
            <li> Amazing, I had bought at least 3 of this in different colors and you can literally put al your makeup in there. This is perfect for a gift to a friend or family member, I believe they&#x27;re going to love it like me.</li>
            <li> I think all purses need one of these... I love this so far! I can find everything in my purse, right when I need it. And switching bags is super easy - you just grab this puppy out, and plop it into your new purse. Done!</li>
            <li> I thought it was much bigger but over all I found use for it and its actually my new best friend I wish I had bought two.</li>
            <li> It was nice for about a week. The netting on the side pockets tore quickly. The zippers are still intact, but just doesn&#x27;t keep much shape.</li>
            <li> Just what my mom needed!</li>
            <li> I love how this has allowed my purse to stay organized! It has tons of pockets and places to put everything! I liked it so much I have bought more for gifts!</li>
