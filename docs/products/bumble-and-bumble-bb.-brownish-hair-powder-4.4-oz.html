            <li>This Product works really good even for the price it is.</li>
            <li>I had specks all over my face,( I&#x27;m fair skinned), on my clothes, and all over my counter/ bathroom.</li>
            <li>This is a good product</li>
            <li>some residue will come out onto the fabric (A pillow is a good example).</li>

            <li>And this product makes me feel more confident and beautiful, honestly.</li>
            <li>and was thrilled when his hairdresser used this in his hair.</li>
            <li>It can be a bit of a pain to deal with when applying (on your fingertips, on your face, etc), but it wipes off of those areas very easily</li>
            <li>Now he is more confident to not wear hats all the time!</li>
            <li>The nozzle on the spray tends to spurt rather than give a nice easy spray.  </li>
            <li>This is a very effective product, excellent at not only hiding your bald spot but your shame as well! ;-)</li>
            <li>I found an even better use though...covering my roots.  </li>
            <li>but I love that it has a color to it.  </li>
            <li>I recently discovered this product and when sprayed at the root line, the coverage is incredible!</li>
            <li>I used the white spray for a while and loved it so decided to try this color, must be great as well.</li>
            <li>, it is just that I have found another that works better without these drawbacks.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it gives my hair TONS of volume, soaks up the grease, and adds a lot of texture.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love for in between colors.</li>
            <li>also i love that it has no scent.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>His happiness is so worth it though.</li>
            <li>I have many complaints about this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>Just spray on my part, and like magic, no gray hair shows.  </li>
            <li>I love the white powder, easy to use and works awesome.</li>
            <li>A girlfriend of mine that keeps me up on the latest and greatest of products; shared this with me to use and cover up your grey roots in between hair colors.  </li>
            <li>Covers the grey wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This is the greatest dry shampoo if you have some roots you want to hide.</li>
            <li>The color concealing is excellent, however the spray gets everywhere and it has high alcohol content, so it really made my scalp itch.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is an easy application; shake bottle and spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Washes out easily and even brushes out</li>
            <li>This can be easily camouflaged though with nail polish.</li>
            <li>The areas, which have been touched up feel tacky, it is not greasy, and it is not sticky, I think tacky, would be the best description although my hair is not weighed down.  </li>
            <li>The way I use the spray: I use my teasing brush that has a fine end for seperating sections of hair.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use light pillowcases.  </li>
            <li>Makes me not hate myself when my gray hair is showing</li>
            <li>It is fabulous.</li>
            <li>My stylist sold it to me originally to help tease my hair for an updo.   </li>
            <li>I went over my root with a light quick spray and felt like I&#x27;d put glue in my hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean at all...  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To sum up my review, this is a good grey root cover up</li>
            <li>If you want something to cover grey roots, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>This is a good product to cover grey in between trips to the hair salon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy and buys me another couple of weeks between salon visits.</li>
            <li>Much more noticeable than this stuff, by FAR.</li>
            <li>Anyway, well worth the money for me.  </li>
            <li>Yes it changes the texture of your hair, and if you sleep on it at night after using it you might get some residue on your pillow, but for me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The color comes right off onto your fingers.  </li>
            <li>I think the stiffness gives me a little more volume on top.  </li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t like: it did leave a more noticeable haze on my roots, but didn&#x27;t notice as much later in the day.</li>
            <li>But the real issue with this version: the brown color gets EVERYwhere!</li>
            <li>To top it off, the brown color transfered all over my hands the next day.  </li>
            <li>I used the product exactly as explained by my stylist and the directions on the can.  </li>
            <li>But it does work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This light brown color I hoped would blend in a little better, but the white still worked fine, just wanted to try another version.   </li>
            <li>you pretty much can&#x27;t touch it for the rest of the day...</li>
            <li>I have to get my hair professionally colored every 3 weeks because I&#x27;m so gray and my roots are extremely noticeable at the part line though my color everywhere else still looks good at 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>However, I would not recommend spraying this product throughout your hair as it tends to make your hair feel dry BUT for even root coverage at the hairline it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>, I had to go take another shower and wash it, which was the whole purpose of using the product.  </li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t know why I paid so much for it.</li>
            <li>I have tried washing the nozzle off, but I think that is the nature of this spray nozzle, it just comes out too fast in a spurt.  </li>
            <li>My ladies who have to get their roots touched up frequently will also find it worth it.</li>
            <li>This is not the real Bumble and Bumble hair powder.  </li>
            <li>This powder doesn&#x27;t stay in place, the way the real Bumble and Bumble product does.</li>
            <li>splatter/sprays on your face, ears and neck&lt;br /&gt;-- is really drying and matte looking&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>This is not a perfect product, but I think women with thinning hair will agree with me when I say that, I&#x27;m willing to deal with some maintenance (wiping the excess off of my skin after initial application, leaving color on my finger tips when touched heavily, leaving color on my pillow at night) in order to feel more confident and beautiful.</li>
            <li>it was odd at first, but it did a good job covering some grey roots, and got me a couple days between shampoo&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>But it quickly covers the gray at your roots getting you through those last days before your real color.  </li>
            <li>Better than all of the other brands I have tried!</li>
            <li>I use that going along my crown from my face toward the back, separate it, and spray a quick line of the powder.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The second is that if I want to change color; a shade darker, lighter, or redder tones, the Bumble and Bumble brown spray powder easily blends to the slightly different shade of color.  </li>
            <li>This is my can&#x27;t live without product.</li>
            <li>Works great as a dry shampoo but it is very messy!</li>
            <li>My hair grows pretty fast and my grey hair would need covering every three weeks if it weren&#x27;t for this product.  </li>
            <li>Kind of weighs down the hair a bit but to cover the grey - who cares!</li>
            <li>I tried to do this routine just one time with this color and it was a huge mess.   </li>
            <li>Over the last thirty years, I have experimented with many different grey hair and root cover-up methods.  </li>
            <li>If you hold a rag or tissue to forehead will have better results, and less likely to stain clothing.</li>
            <li>You really  have to shake it extra vigorously</li>
            <li>it really helps that last week or 2 before getting colored.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased this at Sephora for a much lower price.</li>
            <li>Cool but not worth the price.</li>
            <li>this is really good for thin or  thinning hair, it makes it look 50% fuller!</li>
            <li>It does make hair feel a little \\&quot;weird\\&quot; (stiff) but it actually gives hair body and makes my hair look great.  </li>
            <li>It is a bummer because it actually does a good job of soaking up oil but not worth the mess.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only negative (which is also a positive) is the color that comes out really easy when I decide to scratch my head.</li>
            <li>No other way.</li>
            <li>I switched to this product after using Ojon Full Detox Dry Shampoo due to the nozzle clogging in 3 bottles.</li>
            <li>Not bad, comes out a little heavy, but good to fill in thin spots, or cowlick areas on scalp.</li>
            <li>Only downside is, I don&#x27;t really think this is a \\&quot;dry shampoo\\&quot;...  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I recently purchased this at Sephora for a much lower price.</li>
            <li> Cool but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> this is really good for thin or  thinning hair, it makes it look 50% fuller!</li>
            <li> It does make hair feel a little \\&quot;weird\\&quot; (stiff) but it actually gives hair body and makes my hair look great.  </li>
            <li> It is a bummer because it actually does a good job of soaking up oil but not worth the mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negative (which is also a positive) is the color that comes out really easy when I decide to scratch my head.</li>
            <li> No other way.</li>
            <li> I switched to this product after using Ojon Full Detox Dry Shampoo due to the nozzle clogging in 3 bottles.</li>
            <li> Not bad, comes out a little heavy, but good to fill in thin spots, or cowlick areas on scalp.</li>
            <li> Only downside is, I don&#x27;t really think this is a \\&quot;dry shampoo\\&quot;...  </li>
            <li> it is a little pricey but its worth the money, i have tried other products similar to this</li>
            <li> My hair is actually thinning some and in the back of my hair is a nice little bald spot unless I tease in the infamous back flip.</li>
            <li> My last concern is that there is a color transference, even when the spray has been completely dry, the color still transfers to fingers and clothing and this happens until it is finally washed</li>
            <li> The third advantage is that this grey cover-up lasts for a couple of days without needing another application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also works passably if you spray it only on your roots and not near the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And after it&#x27;s dry it will rub off on anything you put your head on (such as the couch or pillow).</li>
            <li> But as a dry shampoo it falls short.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you rub your hair against white fabric (who would do that to dry hair anyway)</li>
            <li> I have grey hair</li>
            <li> This product is a powder color spray to touch up those grey roots for those in-between hair colorings.  </li>
            <li> I used this product on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> (dry shampoos aren&#x27;t my thing)</li>
            <li> I am a hair product junky and thought I would see what all the hype is about the bumble and bumble dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I used this once and my hair felt sticky, brittle and horribly dry.  </li>
            <li> If you want to dry your hair out causing breakage, damage, dryness and lack of shine, buy this.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fade, but it did blend with my dark red hair.</li>
            <li> Be careful to not get it on clothes, though it will come out easily as long as it&#x27;s washed within a day or so.</li>
            <li> Definitely need to use sparingly, as a little goes A LONG way.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday, it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> It can be used as a dry shampoo, though I&#x27;ve never really done it</li>
            <li> If I put my sunglasses on my head, and then put them back  on, I end up with black streaks on my face.  </li>
            <li> It was on a rainy day, and my hair got wet.</li>
            <li> Once my hair was wet the product ran onto my clothing.</li>
            <li> ... was not what I expected it was going to be like at all</li>
            <li> The only draw back is it makes your hair a little hard to style</li>
            <li> Other than that one downer</li>
            <li> Not only does it help it stay, but it also covers my roots which are pretty much white at 35 :(  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Had to return product due to damaged can.</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands, but return to this one over and over.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- very hard to use near your roots</li>
            <li> /&gt;- too dark to be called brown (it should be called dark brown or</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-- paints your scalp dark brown</li>
            <li> I have dark, dark, almost black brown hair and opted for this over black.</li>
            <li> Other reviews cited problems with running and mess, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now</li>
            <li> The spray is brown and makes quite a mess.  </li>
            <li> It left  my hair super dry, matted and absolutely disgusting.  </li>
            <li> You will find little dots all over your face and sometimes your clothes...</li>
            <li> This spray does the job of keeping roots covered but its a little sticky.  </li>
            <li> This will destroy your hair.  </li>
            <li> and it can be messy unless you take precautions.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it anymore as it makes hair stiff</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s really expensive for a product that barely works!</li>
            <li> It has saved me hundreds of dollars during the past two years by enabling me to postpone appointments by a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb oil as well as some others I&#x27;ve tried, but far worse is that if you touch your hair at all (say, put it behind your ears, or move it out of your face)</li>
            <li> It is extremely upsetting to now see this every time I look at my bed!&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this terrible outcome of using the spray, I didnt enjoy using it at all.</li>
            <li> and I found it much too expensive, and when I have tried to use it, it is way too messy, the product gets all over my face and is very difficult to remove, will probably give to one of my kids for their dry shampoo use.</li>
            <li> This means that when I spray a small section, I have to stop and comb that area to blend the color.  </li>
            <li> I think this might be the worst dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, and it was also one of the most expensive.</li>
            <li> My hair has started thinning in the past few years but this product makes it look like my hair is thick again!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t count on your salon stylist recommending this product however, as it will mean few visits to him or her!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it negative stars.  </li>
            <li> This also makes it difficult to do the hairline around the face, as little flecks of the color need to be removed from the skin.  </li>
            <li> Not very happy!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that I part on the side.</li>
            <li> I have thin and oily brown hair.</li>
            <li> When I spray this in I usually end up with dirty looking fingernails by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I was so sad and vowed to never do that again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive though and am looking for cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> is what&#x27;s wrong with it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s your fingers get all dirty.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because, in a pinch, you can use it to either cover your roots or add volume to dirty greasy hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair came out gunky and just plain nasty!  </li>
            <li> but it is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-- impossible to remove without a thorough scrubbing</li>
            <li> no matter how bad your head itches.     </li>
            <li> It was so bad</li>
            <li> Bad product if you care about your hair.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> your hands and nails look filthy.  </li>
            <li> This has to be one of the worst products, if not the worst, I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Outrageous!</li>
            <li> Terrible stuff!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product but it is very expensive.  Will not leave home without it.  If you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday, it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this stuff. It can be a bit of a pain to deal with when applying (on your fingertips, on your face, etc), but it wipes off of those areas very easily so it&#x27;s not big deal to me. I&#x27;ve tried some of that keratin fiber powder stuff, and I still prefer this. The keratin/fiber stuff feels scaly and like coffee grounds on my scalp. Much more noticeable than this stuff, by FAR. This is not a perfect product, but I think women with thinning hair will agree with me when I say that, I&#x27;m willing to deal with some maintenance (wiping the excess off of my skin after initial application, leaving color on my finger tips when touched heavily, leaving color on my pillow at night) in order to feel more confident and beautiful. And this product makes me feel more confident and beautiful, honestly.</li>
            <li> This Product works really good even for the price it is. The only problem is that when you itch or rub your head where the product is in place it turns your fingers/finger nails brown. After you rub it in and wash your hands you pretty much can&#x27;t touch it for the rest of the day...no matter how bad your head itches.     However, this problem isn&#x27;t as obvious with the white and blonde powders...just the darker ones.    Other than that one downer the product works great!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my dry hair. It was on a rainy day, and my hair got wet. Once my hair was wet the product ran onto my clothing.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My stylist sold it to me originally to help tease my hair for an updo.   I found an even better use though...covering my roots.  My hair grows pretty fast and my grey hair would need covering every three weeks if it weren&#x27;t for this product.  I just spray it on my roots and comb it through a bit.  It has saved me hundreds of dollars during the past two years by enabling me to postpone appointments by a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is from the Environmental Working Group:  Health Effects related to aluminum starch octenylsuccinate: Birth or developmental effects, Brain and nervous system, Reproduction and fertility    Routes of Exposure related to aluminum starch octenylsuccinate:  * Personal care products</li>
            <li> Not bad, comes out a little heavy, but good to fill in thin spots, or cowlick areas on scalp. Practice spray on tissue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years and am very satisfied with it.  I have grey hair and it&#x27;s awesome for covering my roots when I&#x27;m in-between the dye jobs!    It can be used as a dry shampoo, though I&#x27;ve never really done it (dry shampoos aren&#x27;t my thing)...but I love that it has a color to it.  The only downside is that it WILL rub off even after it dries.  I recently had an issue with putting my sunglasses on my head and I kept getting brown stuff on my face - it was the powder!  Be careful to not get it on clothes, though it will come out easily as long as it&#x27;s washed within a day or so.</li>
            <li> I got this product because someone else said that it was awesome... I didn&#x27;t like how it felt on my head or the color of it... was not what I expected it was going to be like at all</li>
            <li> I am a hair product junky and thought I would see what all the hype is about the bumble and bumble dry shampoo.  This has to be one of the worst products, if not the worst, I have ever tried.  It left  my hair super dry, matted and absolutely disgusting.  This will destroy your hair.  It was so bad, I had to go take another shower and wash it, which was the whole purpose of using the product.  I wish I could give it negative stars.  I threw it out immediately.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to have found this product! I have very thick hair that I part on the side. I have to get my hair professionally colored every 3 weeks because I&#x27;m so gray and my roots are extremely noticeable at the part line though my color everywhere else still looks good at 3 weeks. I recently discovered this product and when sprayed at the root line, the coverage is incredible! I&#x27;ve tried everything, hair pens, hair mascara, root touch ups etc and nothing works like this product. It&#x27;s fast and easy and buys me another couple of weeks between salon visits. However, I would not recommend spraying this product throughout your hair as it tends to make your hair feel dry BUT for even root coverage at the hairline it is fantastic! Don&#x27;t count on your salon stylist recommending this product however, as it will mean few visits to him or her!</li>
            <li> I used the white spray for a while and loved it so decided to try this color, must be great as well. Not so much. I love the white powder, easy to use and works awesome. This light brown color I hoped would blend in a little better, but the white still worked fine, just wanted to try another version.   One use and I returned it. The way I use the spray: I use my teasing brush that has a fine end for seperating sections of hair. I use that going along my crown from my face toward the back, separate it, and spray a quick line of the powder. I go in 1-2 inch increments. I do something similar but horizontal in the back.  I&#x27;ve done this and gone through 3 cans over time. I&#x27;ve used a lot I would guess and think I&#x27;ve got enough knowledge of the product to know if I like it or not.  I tried to do this routine just one time with this color and it was a huge mess.   The color is brown. No other way. It doesn&#x27;t fade, but it did blend with my dark red hair. That was the only plus of this. What I didn&#x27;t like: it did leave a more noticeable haze on my roots, but didn&#x27;t notice as much later in the day. I also noticed my roots were oilier than with the white. I just couldn&#x27;t get the lift I get from the white. But the real issue with this version: the brown color gets EVERYwhere! I had specks all over my face,( I&#x27;m fair skinned), on my clothes, and all over my counter/ bathroom. I was so sad and vowed to never do that again. The white works, I trust it and recommend it. See my review there.  Do not recommend the colored versions at all.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d come across this product forever ago.  It has changed my life!!  I wear my hair up every day.  Not only does it help it stay, but it also covers my roots which are pretty much white at 35 :(  Also, all my hair stylists have always encouraged me to only wash my hair twice a week.  And, I can say, with this product I literally only wash my hair twice a week (maybe it helps that I wear it up every day...)  Anyway, well worth the money for me.  Just don&#x27;t use light pillowcases.  It WILL stain.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but it&#x27;s not so easy to use. You really  have to shake it extra vigorously and I wonder if I got a &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34; bottle. Also, I don&#x27;t know why I paid so much for it. The price should have been in the $30s, but instead I foolishly agreed to something like $70! Outrageous! Won&#x27;t make that mistake again. Not very happy!</li>
            <li> Covers the grey wonderfully. It does make hair feel a little \\&quot;weird\\&quot; (stiff) but it actually gives hair body and makes my hair look great.  Would def recommend.</li>
            <li> I used this once and my hair felt sticky, brittle and horribly dry.  The product also reeks of rubbing alcohol (after using it I checked the ingredients and alcohol was in there several times).  To top it off, the brown color transfered all over my hands the next day.  Every time I touched my hair at all I came away with brown grime all over my fingers.  I think this might be the worst dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, and it was also one of the most expensive.</li>
            <li> Cool but not worth the price. It stains your hands, so everytime you put your hands through your hair it&#x27;s your fingers get all dirty. Not forth it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  If you hold a rag or tissue to forehead will have better results, and less likely to stain clothing.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended in a magazine and I found it much too expensive, and when I have tried to use it, it is way too messy, the product gets all over my face and is very difficult to remove, will probably give to one of my kids for their dry shampoo use. I would not recommend for use for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Works great as a dry shampoo but it is very messy! I wish bumble and bumble would go back to the powder instead of this....when you spray it it goes everywhere ! You will find little dots all over your face and sometimes your clothes... I have tried holding it farther away , cleaning off the novel every time I use it , shaking well, holding it closer, everything u can possibly think of but it happens every time! It is a bummer because it actually does a good job of soaking up oil but not worth the mess.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a day, I woke up the following morning to find the product had ruined my beige upholstered headboard and white pillowcase!&lt;br /&gt;There are brown spray powder stains on both after sleeping in my bed for one night, twelve hours after applying this product. It is extremely upsetting to now see this every time I look at my bed!&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this terrible outcome of using the spray, I didnt enjoy using it at all. I went over my root with a light quick spray and felt like I&#x27;d put glue in my hair.</li>
            <li> it really helps that last week or 2 before getting colored.  I actually get compliments on my hair when I use it...I think the stiffness gives me a little more volume on top.  great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome for when you cannot make it to the salon for a touch up!  Kind of weighs down the hair a bit but to cover the grey - who cares!</li>
            <li> This is a very effective product, excellent at not only hiding your bald spot but your shame as well! ;-)</li>
            <li> Love this product!  My hair has started thinning in the past few years but this product makes it look like my hair is thick again!  The only draw back is it makes your hair a little hard to style and it can be messy unless you take precautions.  Other than that, it works great!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at my stylist&#x27;s advice as a refresher between shampoos.  I used the product exactly as explained by my stylist and the directions on the can.  My hair came out gunky and just plain nasty!  Wish I could get a refund.,</li>
            <li> If you want to dry your hair out causing breakage, damage, dryness and lack of shine, buy this.  Terrible stuff!  I used it twice.  Bad product if you care about your hair.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It was recommended to me by a friend and now I can&#x27;t do without it</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Blends in well with my color.</li>
            <li> Over the last thirty years, I have experimented with many different grey hair and root cover-up methods.  This product is a powder color spray to touch up those grey roots for those in-between hair colorings.  It is an easy application; shake bottle and spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three ways in that this spray powder excels.  The first and foremost, this product delivers excellent coverage.  The second is that if I want to change color; a shade darker, lighter, or redder tones, the Bumble and Bumble brown spray powder easily blends to the slightly different shade of color.  The third advantage is that this grey cover-up lasts for a couple of days without needing another application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there are three drawbacks for me.  The nozzle on the spray tends to spurt rather than give a nice easy spray.  This means that when I spray a small section, I have to stop and comb that area to blend the color.  I have tried washing the nozzle off, but I think that is the nature of this spray nozzle, it just comes out too fast in a spurt.  This also makes it difficult to do the hairline around the face, as little flecks of the color need to be removed from the skin.  Another issue that I have with this product is the way my hair feels after an application.  The areas, which have been touched up feel tacky, it is not greasy, and it is not sticky, I think tacky, would be the best description although my hair is not weighed down.  My last concern is that there is a color transference, even when the spray has been completely dry, the color still transfers to fingers and clothing and this happens until it is finally washed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up my review, this is a good grey root cover up, it is just that I have found another that works better without these drawbacks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two weeks now and I love the fact that it gives my hair TONS of volume, soaks up the grease, and adds a lot of texture.  Only downside is, I don&#x27;t really think this is a \\&quot;dry shampoo\\&quot;...  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean at all...  But it does work pretty well.  Definitely need to use sparingly, as a little goes A LONG way.  I switched to this product after using Ojon Full Detox Dry Shampoo due to the nozzle clogging in 3 bottles.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest dry shampoo if you have some roots you want to hide. Yes it changes the texture of your hair, and if you sleep on it at night after using it you might get some residue on your pillow, but for me it&#x27;s worth it. My ladies who have to get their roots touched up frequently will also find it worth it. Never let your roots be seen! Hah!</li>
            <li> This spray does the job of keeping roots covered but its a little sticky.  Washes out easily and even brushes out</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it anymore as it makes hair stiff</li>
            <li> The color concealing is excellent, however the spray gets everywhere and it has high alcohol content, so it really made my scalp itch. It also stains everything!</li>
            <li> Makes my life better!  Love it.  No problems. Better than all of the other brands I have tried!</li>
            <li> I could have saved tons of $$$ if I head realized how great this product works. Love for in between colors. Makes me not hate myself when my gray hair is showing and I have three weeks to go until my next appointment. I have dark, dark, almost black brown hair and opted for this over black. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> The spray is brown and makes quite a mess.  When spraying drops can pool on the counter or floor.  And after it&#x27;s dry it will rub off on anything you put your head on (such as the couch or pillow).</li>
            <li> this is really good for thin or  thinning hair, it makes it look 50% fuller! it is a little pricey but its worth the money, i have tried other products similar to this but they area not the same. also i love that it has no scent.</li>
            <li> A girlfriend of mine that keeps me up on the latest and greatest of products; shared this with me to use and cover up your grey roots in between hair colors.  Works great!</li>
            <li> This is not the real Bumble and Bumble hair powder.  If I put my sunglasses on my head, and then put them back  on, I end up with black streaks on my face.  This powder doesn&#x27;t stay in place, the way the real Bumble and Bumble product does.</li>
            <li> If you want something to cover grey roots, this is a good product. But as a dry shampoo it falls short.  It doesn&#x27;t absorb oil as well as some others I&#x27;ve tried, but far worse is that if you touch your hair at all (say, put it behind your ears, or move it out of your face) your hands and nails look filthy.  The color comes right off onto your fingers.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> it was odd at first, but it did a good job covering some grey roots, and got me a couple days between shampoo&#x27;s.  I do think it is over priced, and don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll purchase it again</li>
            <li> If you wish to cover your gray roots between colors this is a great solution.  The only problem with B&amp;B is the price.  But it quickly covers the gray at your roots getting you through those last days before your real color.  The bonus is that is adds some texture and height to your hair as well if you style with it.  Other reviews cited problems with running and mess, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with its use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this at Sephora for a much lower price. It is still pricey. I have to say, I LOVE this product. I have thin and oily brown hair. My hair is actually thinning some and in the back of my hair is a nice little bald spot unless I tease in the infamous back flip. This covers the gray roots, the bald spot, and helps my hair look thicker. It also dries it out so that it looks like I just washed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative (which is also a positive) is the color that comes out really easy when I decide to scratch my head. When I spray this in I usually end up with dirty looking fingernails by the end of the day. This can be easily camouflaged though with nail polish. Also, if you rub your hair against white fabric (who would do that to dry hair anyway) some residue will come out onto the fabric (A pillow is a good example). If this was cheaper it would definitely be my staple. It&#x27;s too expensive though and am looking for cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> My husband has alopecia (sp?) and was thrilled when his hairdresser used this in his hair. Now he is more confident to not wear hats all the time! The only thing I dislike about the product is if he doesn&#x27;t shower before bed, this stuff gets all over his pillow. His happiness is so worth it though.</li>
            <li> I received a tint of brown spray that did not provide the proper amount of coverage I anticipated. I was disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product the week or so before I have my color re-done to cover gray roots. It is fabulous. If your hair is thinning at the crown, it is a great spray to keep the scalp from shining because the hair separates.</li>
            <li> Had to return product due to damaged can.</li>
            <li> I have many complaints about this product.  I gave it two stars because, in a pinch, you can use it to either cover your roots or add volume to dirty greasy hair.  It also works passably if you spray it only on your roots and not near the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what&#x27;s wrong with it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- too dark to be called brown (it should be called dark brown or almost black)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- very hard to use near your roots&lt;br /&gt;-- paints your scalp dark brown&lt;br /&gt;-- splatter/sprays on your face, ears and neck&lt;br /&gt;-- is really drying and matte looking&lt;br /&gt;-- feels gross&lt;br /&gt;-- impossible to remove without a thorough scrubbing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- plus it&#x27;s really expensive for a product that barely works!</li>
            <li> This is a good product to cover grey in between trips to the hair salon. Best if you use it outdoors or in well ventilated area, or you will have brown stuff all over our bathroom. Have tried other brands, but return to this one over and over.</li>
            <li> You know those times when the roots start to show, OR these years when your part is getting a litter wider as our hair thins?  Well THIS is your answer.  Covers what you want it to, can lasts for years, does not flake off.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> i love this product. it hides my gray roots in between salon visits.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of gray and this product saves me between colors appointments. Just spray on my part, and like magic, no gray hair shows.  This is my can&#x27;t live without product.</li>
