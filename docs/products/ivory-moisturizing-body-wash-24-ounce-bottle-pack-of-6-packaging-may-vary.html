            <li>But the soap cleans well and is nice and sudsy.  </li>
            <li>great soap nice and clean.</li>
            <li>This one is great though - no skin irritation and a nice fresh scent (not overbearing)</li>
            <li>It smells nice and leaves me feeling very clean! :-)</li>

            <li>I do love this body wash.  </li>
            <li>Love ivory soap and body wash.</li>
            <li>Whats not to love about the &amp;#34;Ivory&amp;#34; brand.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to be able to use it at all.</li>
            <li>I love Ivory bodywash.  </li>
            <li>but I like this one ok.</li>
            <li>I just love the smell of this body wash.  </li>
            <li>Great scent really relaxing</li>
            <li>I love Ivory products</li>
            <li>I love lavender</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to review the aloe as well - that one I love</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Nice light scent to go with my Ivory clean!</li>
            <li>This has real lavender oil in it -- and a good one, too, if you like florals -- lavendula angustifolia.  </li>
            <li>-- I find that surprising since it contains sodium laureth sulfate AND sodium laurel sulfate which are both very drying.  </li>
            <li>Great price with subscribe and save, easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and you truly feel clean.  </li>
            <li>But this has a strong lavender/chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>really smells good with a light lavender fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I was worried the fragrance would be too strong.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is heavenly, not too strong, not too light.</li>
            <li>stuff smells (I cannot call it a fragrance) like gas station hand soap or maybe cheap shaving cream.</li>
            <li>So fresh and clean with the hint of lavender, what not to love.</li>
            <li>smells good and gentle, even my 10 year old daughter love it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it..</li>
            <li>I really just ordered this because Lavender soap is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Nice creamy lathering soft body soap.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful Ivory product as usual!</li>
            <li>I love the new Lavender scent.</li>
            <li>This one has become my new favorite of body soaps.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER sensitive skin and cannot tolerate most products on the market.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine but doesn&#x27;t smell much like lavender or anything.</li>
            <li>I loved this item so much that it rubbed off on my entire family.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the drive to Target.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve become more sensitive and discriminating when it comes to fragrances.</li>
            <li>You really feel clean after using Ivory.</li>
            <li>If I could afford a more fragrant lavender body wash, I would, but this brand is quite adequate for my daily showers.</li>
            <li>The original has a lovely, deep floral fragrance, and a very creamy texture.</li>
            <li>far as its intended purpose, this stuff lathers divinely and gets me super clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant and I don&#x27;t have a real problem with it</li>
            <li>This soap is very gentle</li>
            <li>8 year old daughter likes it just fine.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li>I first purchased the Ivory Lavender Body Wash (24oz Bottle, Pack of 6) on October 27, 2010 for $11.35 and again on December 28, 2010 for $17.85.  </li>
            <li>but it smells funny</li>
            <li>I love Ivory because it is simple!</li>
            <li>For that reason I give it 3 1/2 stars (but closer to 4  ;-).</li>
            <li>really like Ivory soap, in general, and love this fragrance of Lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>just seems funny.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product,this is the 3rd case i have purchased,i especilly like the Lavender scent it makes you skin feel soft refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li>It seemes to come out of the bottle in large clumps and then fall on the shower floor before you have a chance to start washing with it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for being the go to people to find the things that I need, when I can;t find them elsewhere..</li>
            <li>My whole family loves this product; Buying bulk is so convenient because we go through so much of this wash.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Delivery is fast.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like Lavender at all.  </li>
            <li>Really like this body soap.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t like it much, says it smells too girly.</li>
            <li>Nice everyday soap for shower</li>
            <li>Originally found a bottle of Ivory Lavender Body Wash in the marked down/clearance section of my local supermarket and after taking a wiff, felt it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Other liquid soaps I use were much more \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This one, while very cheap, was a let down.</li>
            <li>It became more and more difficult to find it in stores, so I have been ordering it online, six at a time, through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>for the price, it&#x27;s decent).  </li>
            <li>Maybe not, but either way, its strong and not very lavender&#x27;y.  </li>
            <li>This lavender one seems to leave the skin very dry - the aloe leaves it smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>We have boughtthe other scents butthis is strong.  </li>
            <li>Very lathery and soft for my skin.</li>
            <li>The green bottle (aloe) is better</li>
            <li>The box was labeled as if it was the original factory box just like the aloe, but no partitions - just the bottles rattling around standing up loose.  </li>
            <li>My husband works outdoors &amp; we live in a area well known for ticks.  </li>
            <li>Nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>The scent is very soft.     </li>
            <li>Ivory has made soap for a long time and hard to replace a good old product.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light hardly noticeable scent, which is pleasing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Ivory Soap and sometimes it is so hard to find the Body Wash in Lavender in the stores.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge, and a bit heavy, so you may want to transfer some to smaller container if you don&#x27;t have much shower space.</li>
            <li>Does what it says and is gentle enough to use on your face.</li>
            <li>Lavender is a natural healing element also.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft also.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than in local health &amp; beauty aide stores...</li>
            <li>This one also smells only lightly of lavender and actually very much like unscented ivory liquid soap - dish or body; I know this sounds funny and unfair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s worth a try, but I definitely recommend buying a single bottle before committing to a six pack.  </li>
            <li>without the excessive additive and chemicals I enjoy the quality and quantity we recieve.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough for a small child but \\&quot;strong\\&quot; enough to clean adult size smells.</li>
            <li>Usually body wash is so expensive, but this was such a great deal and we got six!</li>
            <li>Smells so soft and gently&lt;br /&gt;Great for entire family from newborn to middle age</li>

            <li> This one also smells only lightly of lavender and actually very much like unscented ivory liquid soap - dish or body; I know this sounds funny and unfair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s worth a try, but I definitely recommend buying a single bottle before committing to a six pack.  </li>
            <li> without the excessive additive and chemicals I enjoy the quality and quantity we recieve.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough for a small child but \\&quot;strong\\&quot; enough to clean adult size smells.</li>
            <li> Usually body wash is so expensive, but this was such a great deal and we got six!</li>
            <li> Smells so soft and gently&lt;br /&gt;Great for entire family from newborn to middle age</li>
            <li> I usually use plain Ivory wash but that wasn&#x27;t available</li>
            <li> In the long run it might just backfire and dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> my review is only in comparison to the same brand in the green aloe bottle.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried this body wash before and didn&#x27;t want to buy a six pack, but I couldn&#x27;t find a single bottle on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Am using it on the sinks in our bathrooms for hand washing --  </li>
            <li> No need for perfume due to the lavender..</li>
            <li> I recommend this over all other flavors from Ivory.</li>
            <li> On the downside, this body wash does contain some other fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d think they&#x27;d have partitions or some other packing to stop them from rattling around.  </li>
            <li> Not smooth and creamy like other body washes.</li>
            <li> Less mess in the shower.</li>
            <li> a little goes a loooonnnnnnggg way.</li>
            <li> except I think the perfume smell is stronger than the lavender, and I hate to say it, perhaps a little cheap smelling.</li>
            <li> A few drops</li>
            <li> and it would bubble up and foam nicely in a few seconds on my wash cloth.</li>
            <li> They have the plain one but not lavender.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d swear it is cut with plain ivory soap.  </li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t as fluffy as my usual Nivea.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where you would find anything else that works close for the money.</li>
            <li> The body wash is thick and creamy but has practically no scent.</li>
            <li> It is subtle though --</li>
            <li> Nothing too serious though!  </li>
            <li> Out of the bottle the scent is very subtle, but leaves a lingering perfumy scent on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It has become too expensive to purchase even though I like the product as indicated by 4 Stars.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, since it was being shipped on S&amp;S subscription, I have an overload of it.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with ivory, and when it comes to bathing, lavender is the relaxing scent.</li>
            <li> I would buy it here if I was desperate to find it.</li>
            <li> This is almost impossible to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> stuff is awful!</li>
            <li> Now the rash is gradually disappearing, and it was VERY annoying with all the itching..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do love this body wash.  I never like Ivory soap, but after trying this Ivory Body Wash, I won&#x27;t buy anything else in the future</li>
            <li> Love this product, not heavy on the skin and scent is awesome</li>
            <li> I really like this product,this is the 3rd case i have purchased,i especilly like the Lavender scent it makes you skin feel soft refreshing and clean.I have tried the aloe,it is good for the winter when your skin can get real dry from the cold weather.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap knowing that Ivory has good products. This was a hit. It smells great with a hint of lavender, not over powering like a lot of products on the market.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Ivory Soap and sometimes it is so hard to find the Body Wash in Lavender in the stores. It&#x27;s always a pleasure to know that I can go to Amazon and find it here. Thanks for being the go to people to find the things that I need, when I can;t find them elsewhere..</li>
            <li> Love ivory soap and body wash. The lavender scent is heavenly, not too strong, not too light. Will definitely be buying more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this product; Buying bulk is so convenient because we go through so much of this wash.  It lathers up great and rinses off beautifully.  The lavender is my favorite because of the nice hint of lavender instead of an overpowering flowery odor.........</li>
            <li> Does not smell like Lavender at all.  It just smells like soap.  I bought lavender body wash from 365 and it smells incredible.  This one, while very cheap, was a let down.</li>
            <li> I loved this item so much that it rubbed off on my entire family. So fresh and clean with the hint of lavender, what not to love. Gentle enough for a small child but \\&quot;strong\\&quot; enough to clean adult size smells. Leaves the skin feeling wonderful and smooth. No need for perfume due to the lavender.. Friends always ask what scent I am wearing when I wash with this product. a little goes a loooonnnnnnggg way. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.. Try it and you will see.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, and the scent is very pleasant. Does what it says and is gentle enough to use on your face.</li>
            <li> Whats not to love about the &amp;#34;Ivory&amp;#34; brand.  It&#x27;s gentle, effective and smells great.  without the excessive additive and chemicals I enjoy the quality and quantity we recieve.  The pricing and convenience of subscribe and save makes it a win-win!</li>
            <li> I have SUPER sensitive skin and cannot tolerate most products on the market. This one is great though - no skin irritation and a nice fresh scent (not overbearing)</li>
            <li> I first purchased the Ivory Lavender Body Wash (24oz Bottle, Pack of 6) on October 27, 2010 for $11.35 and again on December 28, 2010 for $17.85.  On August 27, 2011, my bill was $27.62 and as a result, I discontinued my Subscribe and Save orders because the price has almost tripled since October 2010 to the amount of $30.80 for the next shipment.   When I spoke with a representative on this matter I was told the website indicated that the price of an item may increase or decrease.  I am amazed that the price increased so drastically in last than a year.  It has become too expensive to purchase even though I like the product as indicated by 4 Stars.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Ivory has made soap for a long time and hard to replace a good old product.  Lavender is a natural healing element also.</li>
            <li> Nice everyday soap for shower</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. the fragrance is amazing.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It became more and more difficult to find it in stores, so I have been ordering it online, six at a time, through Amazon.com. The last order I received was different. I thought perhaps they had just updated the packaging, but, oh, was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awful! The original has a lovely, deep floral fragrance, and a very creamy texture. My granddaughters used to tell me how good I smelled.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells (I cannot call it a fragrance) like gas station hand soap or maybe cheap shaving cream. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to be able to use it at all. It has a glyceryl consistency that I would almost call slimy.&lt;br /&gt;Wow! What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> i definitely recommend this soap. smells good and gentle, even my 10 year old daughter love it. great for the budget too!</li>
            <li> The body wash meets all my criteria including my budget. If I could afford a more fragrant lavender body wash, I would, but this brand is quite adequate for my daily showers.</li>
            <li> I can really smell the lavender as I am bathing which is great!! Wonderful Ivory product as usual! I recommend this over all other flavors from Ivory.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. Very lathery and soft for my skin. The scent is very soft.     The price is reasonable. Delivery is fast. I received it within a week of purchase</li>
            <li> Great for the skin but it smells funny lol.  Nothing too serious though!  Next time I will stick with the regular Ivory or the Ivory with Aloe.</li>
            <li> I love Ivory bodywash.  But this has a strong lavender/chemical smell.  We have boughtthe other scents butthis is strong.  Not sure if I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like Lavender at all.  I really just ordered this because Lavender soap is my favorite.  I guess you get what you pay for.  The price is nice, but doesn&#x27;t deliver as promised.</li>
            <li> Excellent at reduced price</li>
            <li> This is almost impossible to find in the stores. They have the plain one but not lavender. I buy the six pack for my wife and she loves it. I&#x27;m not sure where you would find anything else that works close for the money. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Great price with subscribe and save, easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would buy it here if I was desperate to find it. But it&#x27;s $6.04 here versus $3.50 at Target.  It&#x27;s worth the drive to Target.</li>
            <li> The green bottle (aloe) is better but I like this one ok.</li>
            <li> What can I say, Ivory is timeless and it&#x27;s name recognition.  I love the new Lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of this body wash.  Leaves skin soft also.</li>
            <li> Will continue to purchase this item being that it is not sold in stores.  Great scent really relaxing</li>
            <li> Had to stop using it...I broke out in some kind of itchy rash. Did not know it was the soap until I quit using it. Now the rash is gradually disappearing, and it was VERY annoying with all the itching.. Unfortunately, since it was being shipped on S&amp;S subscription, I have an overload of it.</li>
            <li> Originally found a bottle of Ivory Lavender Body Wash in the marked down/clearance section of my local supermarket and after taking a wiff, felt it was worth a try.  Am using it on the sinks in our bathrooms for hand washing --  really smells good with a light lavender fragrance.  Much loved by my family and am happy to find it here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Other liquid soaps I use were much more \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot;. A few drops and it would bubble up and foam nicely in a few seconds on my wash cloth. This one isn&#x27;t as fluffy as my usual Nivea.</li>
            <li> I love Ivory products</li>
            <li> Love the smell and you truly feel clean.  Even my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with ivory, and when it comes to bathing, lavender is the relaxing scent. Usually body wash is so expensive, but this was such a great deal and we got six!</li>
            <li> Nice light scent to go with my Ivory clean!</li>
            <li> Does the job for  liquid body wash prefer it now over the ivory bar soap. Less mess in the shower.</li>
            <li> Smells so soft and gently&lt;br /&gt;Great for entire family from newborn to middle age</li>
            <li> The body wash is thick and creamy but has practically no scent. I love lavender I thought I found a gem when I got 6 of them at a great price. Not so good. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, good feel , large bottle. All good in my book</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine but doesn&#x27;t smell much like lavender or anything. Not smooth and creamy like other body washes. It seemes to come out of the bottle in large clumps and then fall on the shower floor before you have a chance to start washing with it.</li>
            <li> I love Ivory because it is simple!</li>
            <li> This has real lavender oil in it -- and a good one, too, if you like florals -- lavendula angustifolia.  This does not have any antiseptic or camphorous notes.  On the downside, this body wash does contain some other fragrance.  The type of fragrance is unspecified on the label -- I&#x27;m assuming a generic perfume scent.  It complements the lavender scent, though.  I hadn&#x27;t tried this body wash before and didn&#x27;t want to buy a six pack, but I couldn&#x27;t find a single bottle on Amazon.  I ended up buying one at drugstore[dot]com. Out of the bottle the scent is very subtle, but leaves a lingering perfumy scent on my skin.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant and I don&#x27;t have a real problem with it except I think the perfume smell is stronger than the lavender, and I hate to say it, perhaps a little cheap smelling. For that reason I give it 3 1/2 stars (but closer to 4  ;-). I&#x27;ve become more sensitive and discriminating when it comes to fragrances. It is subtle though -- I can&#x27;t smell it unless I put my nose to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as its intended purpose, this stuff lathers divinely and gets me super clean. It makes my skin oh-so-soft, too -- I find that surprising since it contains sodium laureth sulfate AND sodium laurel sulfate which are both very drying.  In the long run it might just backfire and dry my skin out.  Ah, well, it&#x27;s an inexpensive brand, and you get what you pay for (and for the price, it&#x27;s decent).  I took a picture of the ingredient list and uploaded it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s worth a try, but I definitely recommend buying a single bottle before committing to a six pack.  Sense of smell is a subjective and very individual thing.</li>
            <li> Really like this body soap. It has a very light hardly noticeable scent, which is pleasing. Nice creamy lathering soft body soap.  This one has become my new favorite of body soaps. We will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It smells nice and leaves me feeling very clean! :-)</li>
            <li> This soap is very gentle but I prefer the unscented version.  Next time I am going with the Ivory Unscented...</li>
            <li> The six pack is an excellent value. The bottle is huge, and a bit heavy, so you may want to transfer some to smaller container if you don&#x27;t have much shower space. Much cheaper than in local health &amp; beauty aide stores...even the big box chain stores.</li>
            <li> My husband works outdoors &amp; we live in a area well known for ticks.  Since using the body wash with lavender (the lavendar being the key ingredient) the percentage of ticks to remove is zero.  We would recommend this product if you work outdoors and would like to avoid ticks.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is pleasant and refreshing, thumbs up to Ivory!</li>
            <li> great soap nice and clean.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have order this bulk package and it saves me time gas and the effort of having to worry about running out of the scents I like and having to go to the store. Will  definitely continue to order.</li>
            <li> Great soap, it doesn&#x27;t make me itch and the scent is wonderful</li>
            <li> I usually use plain Ivory wash but that wasn&#x27;t available so I tried the lavender. I was worried the fragrance would be too strong. But it wasn&#x27;t. Nice and subtle. You really feel clean after using Ivory. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have found this body wash to be on the cheapest and best quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like Ivory soap, in general, and love this fragrance of Lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do tend to use a lot on my body poofy thingy because I like lots of bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husband doesn&#x27;t like it much, says it smells too girly. 8 year old daughter likes it just fine.</li>
            <li> my review is only in comparison to the same brand in the green aloe bottle.  This lavender one seems to leave the skin very dry - the aloe leaves it smooth and moisturized.  This one also smells only lightly of lavender and actually very much like unscented ivory liquid soap - dish or body; I know this sounds funny and unfair but I&#x27;d swear it is cut with plain ivory soap.  Maybe not, but either way, its strong and not very lavender&#x27;y.  The box was labeled as if it was the original factory box just like the aloe, but no partitions - just the bottles rattling around standing up loose.  I&#x27;d think they&#x27;d have partitions or some other packing to stop them from rattling around.  Don&#x27;t know  just seems funny.  But the soap cleans well and is nice and sudsy.  I&#x27;m going to review the aloe as well - that one I love</li>
            <li> this is one of the best body wash on the market . the smell is out of this world . very nice . love it</li>
