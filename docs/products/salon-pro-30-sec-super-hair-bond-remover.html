    <ol>
            <li>Product is great!  </li>
            <li>, this is the best thing ever for quick weave,,,,, keep your hair protected</li>
            <li>without taking your own hair.</li>
            <li>This has been a very easy purchase.  </li>
            <li>However having epilepsy I go through EEG tests 2 or more times a year and</li>
            <li>More safer than most product that I have used.</li>
            <li>okay if you leave it on for 5 min</li>
            <li>Easily removed.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t come off, to strong.</li>
            <li>Once they are all out apply some more and gently comb through your hair to remove any remaining glue.</li>
            <li>Worked quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest just using a conditioner, works a lot better.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine recommended this product to get the glue out after a recent test and this did an amazing job at getting rid of it all</li>
            <li>Very very very greasy</li>
            <li>it romove the track very fast.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>First of all it does NOT come off in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>I thought it would remove the remaining glue from my hair, but this product is only good for removing the actual hair from your head.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>It works fast and does not damage your hair.</li>
            <li>I get so much sticky stuff in my hair</li>
            <li>or so while working it in to the bond, and it works really well if you don&#x27;t wash it all the way out and let it soak in for a day.  </li>
            <li>Received in a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I always use the Salon Pro Super Hair Bonding Remover Lotion (that&#x27;s the one in the opaque white bottle) instead.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>A long process but the safest by far.</li>
            <li>Apply a generous amount along each track, rub in and soak for 15-20 minutes (patience is a virtue) and gently slide the tracks down and off your hair.</li>

            <li> I ended up cutting most of the extensions because they would just not fall off.</li>
            <li> Gave me long term breakage.</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because of how greasy it left my hair, and was hard to get some pieces out.</li>
            <li> I used almost half the bottle just on one weft.</li>
            <li> This product was a bit overexagerated in my opinion in its ability to remove hair bonds in thirty seconds and is quite oily and ,messy as well; however, this is a given, I suppose.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this, it does not work well and is messy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get off of hands and combs.</li>
            <li> Not a good product</li>
            <li> I would not say this product is a bad investment as it does work, but I would not rate this product as the bond remover out there.</li>
            <li> It was painful and don&#x27;t losen the glue at all.</li>

            <li> I give it 3 stars because of how greasy it left my hair, and was hard to get some pieces out. I used almost half the bottle just on one weft. Other than that, it was well worth the price. &amp; it was delivered within 3 days.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does, I struggled to take the glue out still. It was painful and don&#x27;t losen the glue at all. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> This product was a bit overexagerated in my opinion in its ability to remove hair bonds in thirty seconds and is quite oily and ,messy as well; however, this is a given, I suppose. I would not say this product is a bad investment as it does work, but I would not rate this product as the bond remover out there. Overall it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> First of all it does NOT come off in 30 seconds. I had to put a bulk of it on one weft and just let it soak for atleast 10-15 minutes then it came off. It is NOT a 30 second bond remover. I ended up cutting most of the extensions because they would just not fall off. The bond remover only wored on some of them NOT all. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> This has been a very easy purchase.  Received in a decent amount of time.  Product is great!  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works just the way it&#x27;s suppose to, this is the best thing ever for quick weave,,,,, keep your hair protected</li>
            <li> Very very very greasy and it&#x27;s hard to get off of hands and combs. I highly suggest just using a conditioner, works a lot better.</li>
            <li> Granted I don&#x27;t do weeves or hair extensions . However having epilepsy I go through EEG tests 2 or more times a year and the glue they put in your hair  to keep the wires in is impossable to get out.  A friend of mine recommended this product to get the glue out after a recent test and this did an amazing job at getting rid of it all and it didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp any! So I&#x27;m keeping this stuff around for the next time I have a EEG done..</li>
            <li> Gave me long term breakage. I thought it would remove the remaining glue from my hair, but this product is only good for removing the actual hair from your head. Don&#x27;t recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t come off, to strong. Skin comes off with glue. Not a good product</li>
            <li> I use to take my weave out that has been place in with glue , bye put on the track letting set  it romove the track very fast. without taking your own hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this, it does not work well and is messy. I always use the Salon Pro Super Hair Bonding Remover Lotion (that&#x27;s the one in the opaque white bottle) instead. Apply a generous amount along each track, rub in and soak for 15-20 minutes (patience is a virtue) and gently slide the tracks down and off your hair. Once they are all out apply some more and gently comb through your hair to remove any remaining glue. A long process but the safest by far.</li>
            <li> Worked quickly. Easily removed.</li>
            <li> More safer than most product that I have used. It works fast and does not damage your hair.</li>
            <li> works. just wish there was a removal that removes everything. I get so much sticky stuff in my hair</li>
            <li> It does not work in 30 seconds.  It works okay if you leave it on for 5 min or so while working it in to the bond, and it works really well if you don&#x27;t wash it all the way out and let it soak in for a day.  But don&#x27;t expect immediate results.</li>
            <li> Product somewhat does what it says.... Definately a big help in removing extensions! Would definately purchase again! Thanks so much!</li>
