            <li>Its amazing</li>
            <li>When I tried it, it was amazing.</li>
            <li>PherX Pheromones is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how effective</li>
            <li>All in all amazing product</li>
            <li>This product smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Pros: Has a sorta nice smell actually&lt;</li>
            <li>I honestly thought this s</li>
            <li>That thing is good, gave me a lot of self confedence, helps to start conversation and noticed that girls paying more attention to me now</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>but I often get comments as to how nice I smell with it on.....</li>
            <li>It smells like a nice deodorant.</li>
            <li>The service was excellent, and I really think this product is making a difference.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice scent to it, not overpowering, but not underwhelming.</li>
            <li>Excellent value and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>and then they would ask me what kind of cologne I am wearing.</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent also.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product and great delivery times.</li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>To be honest I just received this Saturday</li>
            <li>I drive limo &amp; pickup nice females all the time... wanted to try my luck with this</li>
            <li>But women that I know that give me hugs almost always mention that I smell nice.  </li>
            <li>I bought the products since while, and I believe these products are so nice and efefctive.</li>
            <li>I had to do my own research on pheromone applications as there are lack of viable informational directions on the web site or bottle.</li>
            <li>i love it, smells good</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, although not overpowering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Zyloo Labs (PherX) indicates that these products are effective for up to four hours.  </li>
            <li>If you use it to get the edge, don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re cheating; over the years, I learned that the most lovely person you&#x27;ll meet may not look attractive.</li>
            <li>This product is effective.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and blends nicely with my cologne.</li>
            <li>Bottle was safety sealed in nice padded box.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an oil-based product, so it will not evaporate off in a warm environment as some alcohol-based products can.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, and I notice increased interactions from women.</li>
            <li>It feels nice, the oil.  </li>
            <li>smells really nice just started using it</li>
            <li>I cannot yet say if the product is attracting women or not, but I can say the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m using it to make me feel confident and to have a good conversation with wonen.</li>
            <li>but the product smells nice and doest hurt ur chances.</li>
            <li>They complimented how the smell was so nice.  </li>
            <li>She told me she liked the way I smelled and within minutes</li>
            <li>Maybe has some kind of effect on your confidence and that&#x27;s what women like?</li>
            <li>kind of how I&#x27;ve always been.</li>
            <li>I suppose, but not someone who stands out in the looks department, and kind of an introvert.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, WHEN used correctly and expectations are reasonable.</li>
            <li>So when I use it I notice alot of ladies talking to me more, telling me I smell good, then I hear them talking when I walk away, things like &amp;#34;mmmm mmmm hmmmm&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34</li>
            <li>I get warm smiles everywhere</li>
            <li>&quot; it per say, but it has a nice smell, and others took notice of me immediately</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>Not overly impressed, no noticeable difference really.  </li>
            <li>When I give a Lady a warm hug</li>
            <li>I find that it works best when paired with your own natural chemistry.</li>
            <li>And I have tried many others, but PherX Pheromone oil for men really is the best.</li>
            <li>Has a light pleasant scent to it.</li>
            <li>Product is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>as i have more experiences i will update, thank u pherx for the free sample!!</li>
            <li>I notice that women agree more with what I say, women perceive sexual innuendos in my statementsthat don’t exist, and I even have women who are in relationships giving me attention that I don’t even want!</li>
            <li>This product smells pretty good!</li>
            <li>After Zyloo sent me this product to review, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with this oil as I was with the other products I have ordered from Zyloo labs, but this still worked great.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant added boost of confidence, had the price been more reasonable</li>
            <li>women tend to be more nice to me whenever i use this product</li>
            <li>More smiles and nice reactions.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think it was more that my spouse found the labels and packaging in the trash</li>
            <li>Best one I used so far.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the company updated with more information and history of pheromones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What makes this product even more amazing is the way that women interact with me now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using PherX Oil for Men with great success.</li>
            <li>Mind you, you still got to be a gentleman and have good hygiene, stay fit, and not act like a douche towards women</li>
            <li>nice smell, and women definitely more talkative</li>
            <li>More smiles and nice reactions from women.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good product  !  </li>
            <li>Sounds to good to be true...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel very fit for a review.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, and most importantly it makes you feel more confident.</li>
            <li>Its very light and blends with all perfumes!&lt;br /&gt;Overall i like the product.</li>
            <li>so far so good... will update once I am successful</li>
            <li>Since, some pheromones have a scent to them and not all are necessarily pleasant to everyone thus, undermining the success rate.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident and attractive when I have it on, and I find women are more interested in me.</li>
            <li>Women want to interact for longer periods of time, and find what I&#x27;m saying more interesting.</li>
            <li>This is much more concentrated than spray.  </li>
            <li>Will be interesting to see how this goes.  </li>
            <li>no I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the placebo affect! :)</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work if youre lucking for friends or girlfriend or something with more than a relationship with girls  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to experiment with this product over the weekends and if there is anything more to it then a placebo affect, I will report it here.  :)</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance</li>
            <li>but I am still using it because I love the smell.</li>
            <li>had never tried a product like this but, being a middle-age widower and having to start again, I&#x27;m glad to have this edge so the ladies come to me.</li>
            <li>There is definitely more attention towards me using this product I don&#x27;t know how it works</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied and grateful</li>
            <li>I bought this not only for me but also my best friends.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I have noticed my wife gets more attracted and have more passion when having sex, she also keeps smelling my neck.</li>
            <li>but I am sure it will work ...</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say for sure where or not wearing PherX is the reason.</li>
            <li>The thing I like most about this product is the scent.</li>
            <li>but if it makes my husband more confident...so be it.</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t snared the romance of the century, but I smell interestingly while trying.</li>
            <li>Use with your favorite cologne perfume.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>People that I come in contact with seem in a better mood and friendlier.</li>
            <li>Without telling her about PherX-Oil (I still haven&#x27;t told her), my girlfriend seemed more amorous and sexually responsive.</li>
            <li>but I felt the ladies were sitting closer and paying more attention to me.</li>
            <li>I think I like the oil more because I sweat a lot at work</li>
            <li>and it seems to have more staying power.</li>
            <li>What I can tell you for sure from my experience:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I kinda was expecting more from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Even my friends commented on how females seem to be more attracted to me.</li>
            <li>--I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I know most of the guys that have used it are trying out on the dating scene</li>
            <li>but i just aint had any money to order more the bottle</li>
            <li>but I can say the wife does appear to be more touchy feely when I wear this.</li>
            <li>I am going to combine this with  my favorite  cologne.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mostly girls at the office.</li>
            <li>I knew there will be many women....</li>
            <li>Light smell and lasts all day if you were wondering about it!</li>
            <li>women will talk to you more and get close to you.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff , my lady loves the way I smell ......</li>
            <li>The more women I talk to, the more chances to connect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works, but everyone is sure nicer to me when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>I will keep a supply on hand for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try another one of their products and see if I get better results.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells on him</li>
            <li>and I think it attracts me to him even more, so I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
            <li>Regardless, it opened us up to a conversation that had been many, many months overdue</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure</li>
            <li>The product is OK, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.  </li>
            <li>Attraction depends on many things, i,e, body language,  appearance, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works more like a lure where it attracts them to you and makes them relaxed around you</li>
            <li>Will be buying more</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li>Tried this on for my wife and she is like a teenager looking for love.</li>
            <li>That is the magic of the product.</li>
            <li>Smells ok as a standalone</li>
            <li>but I like mixing it with my favorite cologne...</li>
            <li>Even men seem to treat you with more respect.  </li>
            <li>keep buying more.</li>
            <li>The females do respond much more when I wear PherX Oil.</li>
            <li>But this was nothing more than &amp;#34;snake oil&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I am just trying to find a reputable company to purchase from.  </li>
            <li>Look around more.</li>
            <li>I think this product might make user more confident and also make people around relax.</li>
            <li>If it makes you more confident I&#x27;m all for it</li>
            <li>Granted there may be a placebo effect in which the user feels more self confident, but I&#x27;d like to think there is some science involved.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be more potent than the spray.</li>
            <li>Have had better results with the oil over the spray.</li>
            <li>Have noticed getting more looks.</li>
            <li>Its what I payed for but needs a better smell.</li>
            <li>You get more attention and more hugs.</li>
            <li>After trying it for a week I&#x27;ve noticed more attention and caught more looks.</li>
            <li>I have noticed more attention but not any flat-out aggressive suitors...</li>
            <li>Seems to work with most women, and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>If need this to makes you more confident, buy it.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was packed nicely and secure.</li>
            <li>I would say more like two to three hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more controllable on it&#x27;s application.</li>
            <li>My answer is truthfully, I don&#x27;t know yet.  </li>
            <li>I did however receive quite a bit more attention and flirtiness from the bartender..  </li>
            <li>Seeing so many</li>
            <li>Glances, and maybe smiles, is all it gives you, you&#x27;ll have to work your magic to get the girls to like you, and maybe love you.    </li>
            <li>And many may miss their chance to meet her/him and fall in love with them because of the way they look.    </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what the respond would be</li>
            <li>As I use the PHERX more it seems to have more of an affect.</li>
            <li>Women keep showing more interest in me.</li>
            <li>The effects of PherX seem to build up the more I use it, so I do not recommend washing it</li>
            <li>It can be used alone or in combination with your favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>I really love this product</li>
            <li>My wife is way more touchy feeley with me and always want me.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s put it this way, something magic will happen.</li>
            <li>There will be more touching, there will be more smiling.</li>
            <li>Her eyes seem to dilate a bit more while she&#x27;s standing close to me.  </li>
            <li>You still have to be confident in yourself and in your environment.  </li>
            <li>It makes women pay more attention for sure.</li>
            <li>but I will keep wearing it and pay more attention.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because while I have been pleased with the results</li>
            <li>Pheromone products will not make clothing magically melt off.  </li>
            <li>Pheromone products will not make clothing magically melt off.  </li>
            <li>noticed the change immediatly, it seems that this oil makes people trust me more, where as arouse rx is more of an aggressive arousal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is something I can wear day or night because it seems to create more of a relaxed arrousal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not the best reviewer because this is my second review ever, but my goal is to try many pheromones and give reviews of them all.</li>
            <li>I will up date this information as I try this oil out more, and make reviews as I learn how to better communicate on these reviews.</li>
            <li>It worked for me :)</li>
            <li>Talking to yourself in the mirror would have a greater influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure on the effects yet as I haven&#x27;t been out and about much, but this stuff smells great.</li>
            <li>Women love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using PherX Pheromone Oil for more than two years already</li>
            <li>This product has enhanced my interactions with women, since I have been using this product have have noticed that women are more chatty.</li>
            <li>do not want to say this is a scam, but it is for sure not as advertised.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Ladies notice me more and sometimes approach me.</li>
            <li>I was able to get the oil form a week ago today.  </li>
            <li>The girl ive been seeing was definitely more cuddly and eager, but more testing is needed to determine the degree</li>
            <li>Most of them just hit the weights and stay there.  </li>
            <li>hope to attract a better majority soon</li>
            <li>appears to have a effect as ladies seem more interactive.</li>
            <li>I can not wait to see what more this will</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash your hands/fingers after placing the oil on you.</li>
            <li>and you will be pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>I do feel more confident while wearing it tho</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the smell!</li>
            <li>dont know how many, may not&lt;br /&gt;be</li>
            <li>and i will say this that yes women will approach you and talk to you more</li>
            <li>so I cannot attest for sure</li>
            <li>I think it works, but you should not expect it to work magically.</li>
            <li>i love it..</li>
            <li>Noticed women being more talkative and lingering.  </li>
            <li>I have many tattoos and ride a Harley Davidson.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Another brand seemed to work better</li>
            <li>I will know for sure if it work this weekend</li>
            <li>Seem to be getting more smiles form the ladies.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wore it when I went out to dinner and ended up striking up a conversation with the waitress.</li>
            <li>What I experience is more attention from females period.</li>
            <li>I know many people won&#x27;t believe in this stuff..</li>
            <li>I was totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I love the attention my wife has been giving me.  </li>
            <li>love it.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>Most women  love the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>Though I will agree with one reviewer who says this gave him more confidence</li>
            <li>and it sure did.</li>
            <li>but wearing made me more confident</li>
            <li>Will do business again for sure :)</li>
            <li>and this stuff seemed to make me feel better, more confident.</li>
            <li>I am sure what a pheromones smell like</li>
            <li>I notice women checking me out more often</li>
            <li>For sure a confidence builder.</li>
            <li>I have noticed when I use this product that women do seem to pay more attention.  </li>
            <li>Make more eye contact and seem to be more at ease.  </li>
            <li>have been way more receptive since I started wearing this stuff.</li>
            <li>I also feel like I have been more &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I seem to be getting a lot more attention from the ladies.</li>
            <li>It does not have a fragrance that I am able to detect.  </li>
            <li>Try to balance it with your favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m handsome</li>
            <li>I notice that girls do look at me more than begore</li>
            <li>Okay, as for the smell.. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything</li>
            <li>Hope to receive this and love to try ....</li>
            <li>Smells really dang great.</li>
            <li>will re-order for sure.</li>
            <li>I got noticed a lot more and felt a lot more confident when going out.  </li>
            <li>and i have to say i get alot more tips from the ladies</li>
            <li>/&gt;Several of the office men were also more talkative during these tests as well, asking mostly about an opinion on something, or requesting help with what we do for the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and compliments my after shave without overpowering it nicely.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>Also notice women want to flirt more when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Its okay ...but doesn&#x27;t do any wonders ...</li>
            <li>When wearing this I have notice more attention from women.</li>
            <li>More smiles, friendlier conversations</li>
            <li>, more looks.</li>
            <li>You feel bolder and more confident during the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not gonna have women fawning over you, but you will notice people want to be around you more</li>
            <li>More so than when I don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>Woman are definitely more talkative and approachable.</li>
            <li>maybe I just feel more confident when I&#x27;m wearing it, but</li>
            <li>If he&#x27;s noticing a difference in the demeanor of the women around him just now, then it&#x27;s safe to assume it&#x27;s because of the pheromone he&#x27;s applying.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident when using this.</li>
            <li>I will surely purchase again.</li>
            <li>If so i will change my review.now on to a positive note shipping was very fast excellent</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty good right there.</li>
            <li>it seems like this makes men and women more apt to be friendly with me.</li>
            <li>and she seemed very friendly...</li>
            <li>And when i get to work and through out the day these women are suddenly friendly and talking to me without bitching lmao.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Nice clean smelling scent.</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>The best product of its kind hands down.</li>
            <li>However it has made women want be closer more flirty and and makes me more comfortable being confident.  </li>
            <li>hi,its very very great pheremone oil to attract woman.its great that mens also love this.its changes the mood in seconds.pherex has also other pheremones but its very powerfull.</li>
            <li>First of all, the delivery service from the seller was really good, they shipped on time and with the item as described.&lt;br /&gt;Second about the product, although the seller encourages for the customer to leave feedback</li>
            <li>I am a pretty good looking dude</li>
            <li>and I have always been pretty good at getting my foot in the door.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the way women act around me.  </li>
            <li>That works out to a pretty good investment.</li>
            <li>well first off it dosent have a scent which is good</li>
            <li>and they said that smell nice (nothing extraordinary).</li>
            <li>OK except smell strong</li>
            <li>While it does not attract women or their stares, it does boost up my self-esteem and helps me talk to girls more easily.</li>
            <li>I have to assume that if I used this product in the club scene that I&#x27;d probably get a good amount of attention there too, as the warm humid nature of clubs would naturally cause perspiration, which would release this product into the air around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably get a good amount of attention there too, as the warm humid nature of clubs would naturally cause perspiration, which would release this product into the air around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>An attractive blonde server for some reason gave me a lot of attention and was kind of touchy feely.  </li>
            <li>i recommend this is very special</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: 1/17/2016&lt;br /&gt;Definitely has a positive effect, my friends have all complimented me on smelling good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve honestly noticed that after I started using this that my wife became a lot more touchy feely and more like when we first were dating.</li>
            <li>but it is still up to you to project confidence, have good hygiene, clean clothing, good social skills if you want the interaction to lead to more.</li>
            <li>This is a very sweet smelling product.</li>
            <li>Many others do though, so hopefully its just me and anyone else that buys it will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>And they will send you for free one more product, after you ricieve this, but even for two of them - lost money.</li>
            <li>and I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>but when I wear the product it just gives me a more comfortable feeling..</li>
            <li>I see females are a lot more engaging with me.</li>
            <li>But since I have started wearing PHERX I have noticed lady&#x27;s are more comfortable being around me.</li>
            <li>I never noticed any women who were more comfortable around me or approached me.</li>
            <li>my advanced were rewarded with a lovely response.  </li>
            <li>Even the gals in classes have been more attentive and responsive.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my wife is more attentive to me and relaxed when I wear</li>
            <li>It does seem to have a &amp;#34;happy inducing effect&amp;#34; on yourself and women (and men) doesn&#x27;t really smell like cologne which is good because I don&#x27;t want to smell like I wear cologne.</li>
            <li>Good product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This was an easy one my aid gave me my shower this morning, I put some on and as she gave me my massage, it was a very special message</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell to it and it seems that I get more attention, girls feel more comfortable around me and want to linger near me longer, and are more touchy feely for sure.</li>
            <li>and im loving it right now.</li>
            <li>The stuff smells pretty good, although I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference in interactions with women.  </li>
            <li>but after I smell it I am pretty sure women will like it!</li>
            <li>It also seems like women are more friendly even when it is in a business situation.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly without any problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and not greasy.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll come out a winner easy.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to take around places.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m wearing the productI like how easy it is to make friends with women.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be a really strong smelling and oily but is not</li>
            <li>Not too strong.  </li>
            <li>As a biologist I had strong expectations for the pheromone.  </li>
            <li>So far smells good and arrived on time in safe packaging.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be a really strong smelling and oily but is not.</li>
            <li>I partnered it with lacoste noir which was a strong cologne a couple of times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that strong smelling though.</li>
            <li>After i re-entered the main office area the ladies loved me.  </li>
            <li>but I did note a major spike in confidence and is a great conversation starter.</li>
            <li>It will definitely take some more testing to say for sure, but as of now I have had a fairly good experience with this product.</li>
            <li>I kind of test it out first.</li>
            <li>I see several beautiful women there.</li>
            <li>The last time I went there, I saw a lot of beautiful women.  </li>
            <li>Without exaggeration, I can honestly say this stuff REALLY works like a charm!</li>
            <li>This product gives you some kind of confidence if you need it (exactly what I need) to talk to women.</li>
            <li>The smell of the product is not bad and I have noticed more affection from my spouse when I put it on.</li>
            <li>The results were great- Just about every new first date I went on, let&#x27;s just say I was given more than a kiss goodbye-</li>
            <li>I noticed my wife enjoyed the fragrance more when I applied it more consistently rather than just when we went out on special occasions.</li>
            <li>Does this work if you&#x27;re gay?</li>
            <li>it is important to put this in areas that you sweat easily.</li>
            <li>Women will be more interested in you, they will look at you more</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>They seem more excited and friendly around me.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and on time as well!</li>
            <li>and i think that it works a little lol!</li>
            <li>But every girl who catches wiff says I smell amazing and/or seems to show added interest and trust in me when I have this great little bottle of luck on.</li>
            <li>if you really have the balls to aproach (don&#x27;t  expect magic), it works very good when your very close to the person talking with and even more when you go physical,  it not just makes you feel confident but also turns women on.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a huge increase in the level of comfort women</li>
            <li>but i will say it gives u a huge boost of</li>
            <li>From the day I opened the package and began using I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>If your aim is to find an oil that attracts, then this WOULD fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Experienced lots of extra smiles from people.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a skeptic you&#x27;re probably not going to enjoy this purchase.</li>
            <li>I do like the light scent of PherX.</li>
            <li>enjoy the response you get</li>
            <li>I bought the spray version and they sent me this for free to review as well (before I even reviewed the spray).</li>
            <li>However, you need to spend great effort to open the bottle.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this purchase and I think it works.</li>
            <li>It smells great and actually works</li>
            <li>I honestly didnt think they valued me very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, how did I smell and she smiled and said i really like it.</li>
            <li>It definitely was a great investment.</li>
            <li>I have self confidence and have been told various times I am an attractive man.</li>
            <li>I do appreciate them giving me a chance to try it for free</li>
            <li>will enjoy what I bought</li>
            <li>I have Demo Twice at work last week,  Great results.</li>
            <li>It does something to the ladies to pay closer attention to you, to smile more and to approach you for conversation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 5 if it was not for the offer of free sample-for-review.  </li>
            <li>She is also a bit more inclined for some fun in non-standard locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This also means that you can over do it, so start off light and build up.  </li>
            <li>any questions, feel free to ask in the comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nothing different, have not scored yet, lol...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it is more effective in different environments.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much, but did have a nice muted scent.</li>
            <li>Draws women like a moth to light.</li>
            <li>Company sending me email to review them to get another free bottle of this</li>
            <li>I cursed and hollored at the offfice staff of women for not having the room available to tennants.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s sure worth a shot,</li>
            <li>thank you guys for making such a great product i will buy another one and another when they run out.</li>
            <li>ITS GOT THAT SEXY N FRESH SMELL</li>
            <li>Smells freaking great, and based on personal experience</li>
            <li>and I have noticed more women checking me out with a smile.</li>
            <li>so be cautioned, use lightly.</li>
            <li>You know, something that would get a laugh out of both of us, being relatively confident it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>but so far so good,</li>
            <li>Anyway, so far so good.</li>
            <li>I try this and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I tried the pheromone oil a couple of times and it does work, i noticed that I gain more attention from more women, thanks</li>
            <li>At the gym, I also noticed that some of the girls near me would be glancing over fairly often.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Just started using this product and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>It smells pretty good, and the first day I wore it</li>
            <li>At first sniff this seemed too floral for me, but after a little while on my skin the odor shifts to something more appropriate, more attractive.</li>
            <li>First off, the product didnt work!!</li>
            <li>i use this regularly and it is very effective</li>
            <li>Saving $50.00 off the original price is also a huge</li>
            <li>It makes you more confident around people and people start to like you more in general.</li>
            <li>Loving the new attention and experimenting with this product!</li>
            <li>It smells clean and light.  </li>
            <li>This stuff worked amazingly with this girl I&#x27;ve liked for a long time.</li>
            <li>Everyone is so warm, inviting, and striking up convos with people you desire to do it with is as easy as turning a key.</li>
            <li>My observations appear to include increased physical responsiveness and more enthusiastic and easily obtained indicators of interest.</li>
            <li>Smells good, not really sure how good it works...</li>
            <li>The first test I did just for fun was dinner with friends in a nice restaurant.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product, it smells so good, and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>and my wife was friendly and more sexual than normal.</li>
            <li>and my wife was friendly and more sexual than normal......</li>
            <li>Will try experimenting, it is important to me that my wife will always feel special about me.</li>
            <li>Smells very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Product is easy to use, haven&#x27;t rock solid results, but it does have a calming effect on my wife, which is a good thing</li>
            <li>, i did notice the women seem to be talking with me a lot more and were laughing at things i said that weren&#x27;t all that funny, i will put it to the test again and updated soon.</li>
            <li>Am interested in trying more of the product line, however.</li>
            <li>With the oil I but a ton of it on the first couple of days to make sure she would smell it</li>
            <li>I received this product and was excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>All in all its pretty worthwhile.</li>
            <li>It helps you get noticed, and helps you me a better first impression.</li>
            <li>Yes, this stuff is pretty damn potent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>have noticed that women are more interested -</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I do feel like women are more willing to talk and engage me in conversation when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>At first i wasn&#x27;t sure on buying this product or not</li>
            <li>because this stuff is powerful!</li>
            <li>Judging from their reaction to me ,the ladies I meet seem to like it and the closer we get the more interested they become.</li>
            <li>but they are much friendly.  </li>
            <li>My first test was a very light application after shaving and after putting on a sweet song and dancing with my wife she fell into my arms.  </li>
            <li>The way Women react when wearing this product ranges from Very Friendly to even Having Hot Flashes.</li>
            <li>Second day, I was the most popular dude at a Halloween party... and &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; happened.</li>
            <li>Think positive and approach as many women as you can think to have.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>I had positive results, be it my added self-confidence, or pheromonal attraction, doesn&#x27;t matter, i put it on, i get more glances, and that&#x27;s all i need.    </li>
            <li>I soon realized that the scent wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>I have tested the product now for some weeks, using it in special occasions, and I must say that I have found a difference in the way women interacted with me.</li>
            <li>I like to put it on then work up a little sweat to get my own pheromones mixed and that seems to work best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with Pherx Pheromone Oil, this is the second bottle I have ordered.</li>
            <li>Would be good to get some directions on this going into the future.  </li>
            <li>but it is still almost full.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it make you more confident, women just seem to be more interested in you.</li>
            <li>Last for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- shipping&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had a good time with the ladies in the last couple weeks</li>
            <li>but I have noticed that the wife wants to be closer and more touchy feely with me.</li>
            <li>all the reviews here aren&#x27;t true and</li>
            <li>Not necessarily immediately, but at a good conversation&#x27;s pace they would gravitate toward me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a sincere and straight forward review, I recommend you read</li>
            <li>It smells good, but I  wouldn&#x27;t say that I would purchase a similar product again.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the product in full.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product and thought that the smell was very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The oil seems to retain the pheromone better than straight liquid as well.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product to use.</li>
            <li>I,f your ready for a elevation in your sexual exploration then step 1</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a full range of response, and have IN FACT seen some results (&#x27;...</li>
            <li>They really turn their body towards you more and you can notice pupil dialation.  </li>
            <li>I have found it best works if you put at least two sprays on your neck and then ask a girl to dance with you.</li>
            <li>Somewhat like Cool Springs.</li>
            <li>I like the spray better because the oil comes out to fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting that pheromones can be responsible for all of this.</li>
            <li>this really work and ladies love it</li>
            <li>Nice smell, good for ordinary use&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have worn it several more times and have noticed that the ladies are much more friendly.</li>
            <li>Women sitting next to you will start noticing you more and act more friendly.</li>
            <li>It smells extremely pleasant and will go a long way.  </li>
            <li>but this is nice to apply to your pulse points easier and has a nice tight seal.  </li>
            <li>At first, it seems to have a strong musky scent, but it quickly fades away and the effects remain.</li>
            <li>I think the product has a really unique and rare smell.</li>
            <li>but I will certainly continue to use it !!  </li>
            <li>More recent purchase of your brand has been even better.</li>
            <li>will remain a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>Secondly, they offered me a free product of choice, which I thought was nice</li>
            <li>A worthy investment...</li>
            <li>I have used pheromone products for years, and like many of you I have purchased many products that were essentially perfumed snake oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just got it in the mail today and after going to the local bar I noticed that I was much more interesting to ladies.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident but people and girls treat me the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure to become a steady customer..</li>
            <li>Definitely made me feel more confident after applying.  </li>
            <li>This product is authentic and not only will attract Women but will make you feel youthful and elegant.</li>
            <li>My order showed up quickly and seems to work as advertised.</li>
            <li>Money better spent on a nice cologne in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The oil seems to to wear off somewhat quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The K9 test was positive every time, although the handler said the dog didn&#x27;t hit strong, and acted unsure about what it located.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did a bunch of research into reputable pheromone companies and decided to go with PherX, they&#x27;ve been around awhile and seem to have high standards for production.</li>
            <li>It does seem like they were more chatty than normal.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use my normal after-shave with it.</li>
            <li>they offered me a free product just for being a first time buyer.  </li>
            <li>a bit more in a \\&quot;familiar tone\\&quot; compared to the people before my turn and after, like if I was already a frequent customer,&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
            <li>and it is too early to say that works perfectly, but it has increased the attention of women when I go down the street.</li>
            <li>They will hit you with the free Pher x cologne spray just to get positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li>The very first bottle I got a lots of nice compliments from people of different sexes.  </li>
            <li>Since wearing this people in bars are nicer to me, they buy me drinks, they start conversations with me and generally seem to be more friendly.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t get the vibe like he was gay, but it was like he was sort of fawning on me), then a girl I was trying to explain something about the machine I was working on was very antagonistic towards me, like I was intimidating to her,</li>
            <li>and I noticed a little more attention from women, it seems like it just makes them kind of giddy though.</li>
            <li>So far, this product as worked rather well, I notice more women turning their heads my way..</li>
            <li>def worth the money.</li>
            <li>The placebo effect is powerful guys</li>
            <li>but I feel like I got my moneys worth out of it.  </li>
            <li>This product is NOT going to improve your odds with women, however, it does smell nice, which is the reason I gave it an extra star.</li>
            <li>Its worth the price just for that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a kinda cute woman in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Anything to tip the cards in my favor is worth it...</li>
            <li>Worth the try.</li>
            <li>The product itself worth the money.</li>
            <li>How could it possibly be worth it?&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>That alone is worth the 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>Has a nice aroma and definitely gives you a confidence boost</li>
            <li>It has a nice aroma and definitely gives you a confidence boost.</li>
            <li>I will notice females would actually say you smell really nice</li>
            <li>Been using this for almost a full week first time</li>
            <li>All the ladies are more chatty, and the young ones become stalkers.</li>
            <li>It may work and maybe I need to give it more time or maybe my natural ability to repel women is just too powerful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li>Before buying this product I was concerned about whether it was worth the cash.</li>
            <li>Is more psychological than the product itself, because you think you are attracting the opposite sex, makes you more confident and that self-assured makes you sexier.</li>
            <li>like the spray version because it delivers a nice solid burst which is plenty to apply.</li>
            <li>The times when I do not use PherX I can tell the difference, when I do use PherX women are more attentive towards me initiating eye contact and physical</li>
            <li>it is worth</li>
            <li>This product will get you the introduction, it won&#x27;t however get the female to rip your clothes off spontaneously and attack you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve personally sprayed it on my hand and ask a girl if she liked it</li>
            <li>its worth the money.</li>
            <li>Many products are heavily scented with perfumes that stand out on their own.  </li>
            <li>All in all its worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have found that while wearing this product women and men seem to be more open and engaging with me.  </li>
            <li>I hope everyone who buys this item has similiar success.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is just a fluke since I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but even if it doesn&#x27;t work, it still smells nice.</li>
            <li>I would need to have further testing to see if the product is really effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Which is rare luck for me.</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy Old Spice Swagger works much better.</li>
            <li>So, my approach will probably be to stand next to the lady looking at the art and ask for her honest opinion about it.</li>
            <li>Works as good as - or better than - more expensive pheromone colognes out there.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I will continue my own personal research.</li>
            <li>Many people look at me as the old fat biker dude.</li>
            <li>Has a very inviting smell, always good for a big night.</li>
            <li>Worth a shot.</li>
            <li>this stuff is pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>But there attention is the most important part in getting your freak on later on.</li>
            <li>I currently do not know how effective it is</li>
            <li>As for how well it works, I haven&#x27;t been able to go out too much, but the confidence boost that I have really seems to work.</li>
            <li>Has a nice aroma and definitely gives you a confidence boost.</li>
            <li>I got a very positive response.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know whether its efficacy is dependent upon one&#x27;s unique body chemistry, but I certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>No, she doesn&#x27;t automatically turn into a raving sex maniac but she does seem more enthused about cuddling which, more often than not, ends up leading to other things.  </li>
            <li>Women seemed more friendly  and open.</li>
            <li>also this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it, and definitely have noticed women looking at me longer, and other signs of interest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so this is definitely one more foot in the door if a special girl you wanna get involved with..</li>
            <li>I will keep trying maybe just not going to the right places</li>
            <li>I suppose it could under the right circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yeah, that&#x27;s right this company made some 13 amazon accounts</li>
            <li>When I wear this I feel like I&#x27;m in that movie where everything seems to go right for you</li>
            <li>And that right there is textbook attraction.</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>I have honestly gotten laid more in the past two weeks of using this product than in the preceding two years.</li>
            <li>sells fine and mixes well with my normal cologne.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was at a party could tell the ladies were giving me much more attention and seemed to enjoy my company more than usual.  </li>
            <li>I get more attention from females, they notice me right away; and the very first, sometimes the second thing they say is &amp;#34;You smell</li>
            <li>On the very first uses of this product I observed an immediate, and positive,  response from women.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>try more and give a more complete review later</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great additive to your usual cologne.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, but I didn&#x27;t find that it lasts too long.</li>
            <li>I will test it again shortly, but for now I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It is hard to be sure how effective this product is.</li>
            <li>It, at least in my case, makes ME feel more friendly and confident.</li>
            <li>Just started using it with my normal cologne and the females seem to be a bit more personable during normal conversations.</li>
            <li>As soon as I was near them, they all began laughing, smiling, talking about good times, and oddly enough one of my friends started running around and rolling on the floor.</li>
            <li>I went dancing and noticed that woman naturally leaned more toward me during dancing and keep talking to me throughout the whole songs making eye contact.  </li>
            <li>was talking loudly about how good someone smelled: I was next in line.  </li>
            <li>When I am at home, my wife will ask me to come here, and she will take deep sniffs lol, and say she likes it, (that is with only the pheromone oil on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first night I wore it women immediately noticed that my cologne smelled a little more appealing.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty robust smell and can easily be combined with many other colognes.</li>
            <li>ive also found when you wear it around women who aren&#x27;t whores they really want to talk to you and are very interested in you.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and fresh, and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Whether from its fragrant oil base or from its pheromone infusion, this product helps you to gain the right kind of attention, and if you&#x27;re completely honest with yourself, gaining the right kind of attention is why you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing this product in the first</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was very fast and arrived in two days with my prime account.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>The product appears to provide the desired effect as advertised, but I didn&#x27;t care for the oil mixture very much.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest when dancing close with that special someone or on dates</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried similar products before, and can say this one is light years beyond in terms of success rate!</li>
            <li>so I can have a smart and fun conversation at all times.  </li>
            <li>There were waves where she wouldnt even make eye contact and avoided me, but then other times she would walk over to me, look me right in the eyes, have a nice conversation, then lean up against me and talk nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product seems to really work!  </li>
            <li>If you need a bit more extra &amp;#34;persuasion&amp;#34; power, then give this a try.  </li>
            <li>I first tried the oil</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Like the first product I tried I can&#x27;t say women swooned when I walked by or engaged them in conversation.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed more smiles from the females, and a couple actually initiated conversations with me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thought maybe it might get me hot and bothered for the hubby.</li>
            <li>If I notice anything more I&#x27;ll come back and note it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been receiving more physical contact, like a flirtatious shove or a hand on my shoulder.</li>
            <li>and i will say I like the oil a lot better as it seems to last longer than the spray now it&#x27;s not going to &amp;</li>
            <li>Pher X is a aphrodisiac for the consumer, for after you experience the responses you can&#x27;t help but keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>Within 24 hours, she initiated intimacy for the first time in weeks.</li>
            <li>, I wouldve rated this product higher..</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Regular Cologne and see how many complements or attention</li>
            <li>I have noticed a more female attention when I wear this product.</li>
            <li>(and I don&#x27;t want them to as I&#x27;m happily married)</li>
            <li>from first using it</li>
            <li>Another thing to keep in mind is to start on a lower &amp;#34;dose.&amp;#34; I used 2 drops the first time and varied that from 2 to 4.</li>
            <li>I noticed girls were inclined to enter my office regularly and seemed confident around me making it easier to speak with them and make a connection.</li>
            <li>This product has ruined my life , when I first bought the product I assumed it would help me earn the affection of the office hottie .</li>
            <li>IT IS LIQUID CURSE IN AN ADORABLE BLUE JAR .</li>
            <li>it smelled funny.</li>
            <li>but it will definitely make you more approachable.  </li>
            <li>my first review I received an offer from the manufacturer stating that if I promised to review it, they would send me another product of my choice at no cost.</li>
            <li>but I am interested in buying some pheromones.  </li>
            <li>Some are just this product like the big one at the top that 27 people found helpful.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, so far I didn&#x27;t feel anything dramatically happened but the relationship between people around me got smooth.</li>
            <li>I was asked too lunch by a woman I have be interested in.</li>
            <li>It definitely causes you to get more attention</li>
            <li>First day it worked.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t over apply the product as it may overpower and intimidate some with the physical, sexual emotions triggered.</li>
            <li>In my first try it seemed to work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not shy, I have no problem talking with women.  </li>
            <li>These are the first I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>They also indicate that it can be expected to be effective at a distance of three to five feet.  </li>
            <li>and I actually like it better than the spray.</li>
            <li>Got laid first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I love playing and mixing essential oils, so I thought it might be interesting to add PherX into my personal mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was like she noticed me for the first time or something.  </li>
            <li>If pheromones remove the bias we have towards pretty faces / bodies, this may level the playing field for both men and women.    </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product.</li>
            <li>First time using the oil of PherX</li>
            <li>I felt was interested in me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>what you will notice during a conversation is that they are more willing to open up to you.</li>
            <li>, I had hoped for a somewhat more obvious response.</li>
            <li>The first day wearing this, a woman struck up conversation with me, and we now have a date set for tomorrow.</li>
            <li>The first night I put it on and made no advances to her.</li>
            <li>First time wearing it ended up grabbing a girl I&#x27;ve been trying to holler at for a while.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time today and everyone I interacted with seemed to be more talkative especially the women.</li>
            <li>But this product gives me consistent results in a close proximity setting.</li>
            <li>I sense if they are interested or not based on their responses.  </li>
            <li>And the first time I used it</li>
            <li>The first time I put this on I noticed the effects.</li>
            <li>Spoke with a woman in a department store and already have a date with her after the first try.</li>
            <li>and I will most likely purchase again.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>This product definitely gets you more looks and attention.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post more later after i use it a while</li>
            <li>Wonder if they try to get you the first time do you will get hook</li>
            <li>hell one lady even bought me a drink that&#x27;s a first for</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t gotten any stares but one girl is starting to be around me more.</li>
            <li>I first used this product on a day that I was flying.  </li>
            <li>I actually felt like I was getting more attention when I was first used this product.</li>
            <li>I do tend to feel very uplifted when I wear it, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t used it for that being married and all.</li>
            <li>However, while giving you confidence on the day you&#x27;re wearing it, your confidence in the day you&#x27;re not will drop to-9000 so my only advice is considering this before you buy it :)</li>
            <li>The first day wearing it</li>
            <li>I finally was able to get to my mailbox to obtain my package(mail room was locked).  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying this product.  </li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Definitely noticing a difference:)</li>
            <li>Shipping was on time, exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>Smells exactly like tea tree oil and doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>This is a lot more viscus than the spray version, but has the same effect.</li>
            <li>i received many different compliments about me.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mind, it is fun and flattering.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from the actual smell of this (musk?</li>
            <li>It MAY give you a slight edge to get them interested, but you still have to able to talk to them comfortably to close the deal so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Had only one positive experience w/ wife being more affectionate.</li>
            <li>Have noticed more positive female attention when wearing.</li>
            <li>Maybe because it doesnt have the nice smell the other has.</li>
            <li>I have bought my 2nd bottle and it last pretty good.</li>
            <li>I liked the way the PherX mixes with other fragrances.</li>
            <li>First time I used it I got some unusual attention from my female friend (touching, hugging,and kissing)</li>
            <li>Product came earlier than expected and was in great packaging.</li>
            <li>You also might want to mix it with your favorite cologne to make it less concentrated and give it a smell thats more natural for you.</li>
            <li>: As it&#x27;s oil based, initially it&#x27;s a bit greasy feeling, but than it remain only a good smell and no stains or anything else...</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty nice but for the price it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li>ok so i get this tiny little bottle of overpriced goop and put some on the places I would imagine it might be effective while in reality not having a clue.</li>
            <li>The very first time I tried this I got a very unexpected Kiss, I have to tell you that Yes this works.  </li>
            <li>neither have I received any positive remarks.  </li>
            <li>and I have had positive results with people around me.</li>
            <li>but it definitely positively influences your psychology, which attracts women.</li>
            <li>Though I have a girlfriend and do not go out looking for stray women, I did notice positive attention after wearing this product.</li>
            <li>Not any type of holy grail, but it appears to have a positive effect on any women nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I kept a positive attitude, but nothing at all</li>
            <li>(let&#x27;s call them) positive results.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on positive reviews on youtube.</li>
            <li>I encountered \\&quot;positive</li>
            <li>I found this product to have positive effect on females.</li>
            <li>This stuff definitely gets you noticed, it doesn&#x27;t make you Hugh Hefner but definitely makes women more comfortable around you.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;It has a very settle smell, but smells really nice\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>First day, every girl at the office seemed much nicer.</li>
            <li>Definitely need more tries to know for sure.</li>
            <li>This the first thing to attract women absolutely.</li>
            <li>But this stuff to be honest smells like sour ass with a squeeze of lemon.</li>
            <li>The stuffs smells pretty good but doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long.</li>
            <li>Addendum:  Purchased a small bottle with a roller ball head, this made for a good applicator.  </li>
            <li>(she&#x27;s a young hot bartender, who wouldn&#x27;t!), but last night she paid a lot more attention to me, and I wasn&#x27;t tipping exceptionally well or anything out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li>Not to come off as cocky or condescending to anyone, but logically speaking the best candidates would be those with less confidence, etc, to begin with.  </li>
            <li>If you use this stuff and think it works, you&#x27;re being fooled by placebo effect, which means your feeling that the product works is imaginary, not due to the product actually being effective.</li>
            <li>: The product has a gentle smell that I personally like, and I assume the women also like it as much, but I definitely gives a lot of self confidence as you are good smelling fella.</li>
            <li>Not sure that i really notice any real effects when wearing this oil, but it does smell pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The most important thing was the smell really created a calm environment for everyone that I deal with or being close to, I mean proximity.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it several times on clean skin and regular colognes better</li>
            <li>A very decent purchase.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this company, especially since their customer service is very reliable and respectful.  </li>
            <li>This snake oil should be called Pure Placebo for Men</li>
            <li>I have been using it for certain occasions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nexus pheromones, pherlure, ice breaker, and pure instinct.</li>
            <li>, however I certainly can&#x27;t complain about the results (whether they were driven by the product or not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It certainly seems to work.</li>
            <li>I bartend so have been able to see a lot more women than your average guy in a short amount of time and women of all ages, shapes, marital status, etc.</li>
            <li>This product is totally different and you will notice that from the first time use through a lot of smiles, speaking softly, laughing and getting more close to you.</li>
            <li>I put a small amount on and couldn&#x27;t even smell it, but had several women comment on the nice smell from a distance of more than 6 feet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure it works yet, but I shall continue to try in hopes that I&#x27;m jumped by women as they loose their minds and give into their primal instincts.</li>
            <li>In less than a week is working good so far</li>
            <li>Considering Thallium costs half as much and REALLY smells amazing, I do not think I will repurchase the cologne.</li>
            <li>Like I said before, be realistic and be the one that says &amp;#34;hello&amp;#34; first.</li>
            <li>From her reaction with it the first time I applied it to the points, this ought to have a decent effect on others as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just put a little bit on and you will smell amazing.</li>
            <li>This was a nice little experiment of mine.</li>
            <li>Many other reviews claim a sweet aroma, but as far as I can tell there is no smell to it.    </li>
            <li>They get very friendly and don&#x27;t want to turn loose.</li>
            <li>If it would \\&quot;spice things up\\&quot; a little more with my wife and (2) since I&#x27;m in sales, to see if it would make my female customers buy more.  </li>
            <li>so I could maybe give the product a second shot, but after promising me a free product THEY NEVER SENT IT OUT.</li>
            <li>Actually ahd a co worker that went out of her way to lean into me and take a huge smell.</li>
            <li>I waited until I finished using the whole bottle to write this review.</li>
            <li>This item really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This product was something I wanted to test out on my wife and to see if it would really work.  </li>
            <li>I contacted amazon they gave me an instant refund and a free return shipping.</li>
            <li>To see if it really works I let my brother use it for a date, keep in mind</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very observant, and looking for something to stand out as a noticeable change from women.</li>
            <li>Is it really a pheromones ?</li>
            <li>Really like this.....</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t seal the deal, but I did seem to have women interested in me that normally I would think they wouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li>Maybe there is really something about this.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t really need to apply too much.</li>
            <li>really works</li>
            <li>Absolutely impressive!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she want to spent more time with me.</li>
            <li>: Cheap presentation (Label/Plastic bottle and initial protective wrap).</li>
            <li>Its probably an oil based solution mixed with a cheap fragrance.</li>
            <li>but it look promising.</li>
            <li>I had ordered a bottle of the spray PherX and the company contacted me saying I could try out a different product of theirs free of charge</li>
            <li>(I might have had to keep reapplying it), but it served its purpose very well for me.</li>
            <li>This product really does work - don&#x27;t expect it to do all the work, but I&#x27;ve noticed a substantial increase in playful touches, attention and interest from girls,</li>
            <li>But I have no game</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased real pheromones before</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the oil application compared to the spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Really attracts attention.</li>
            <li>The oil itself has a very distinctive smell that I like as a cologne, though I do use body spray as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from the product in the beginning</li>
            <li>This product makes initiating conversation a bit easier and is so far worth what it costs.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me and my skin type who knows but this product really did not  do anything for me</li>
            <li>Oil dispenses very well.</li>
            <li>and I believe it is working really well.</li>
            <li>This product really works for me .</li>
            <li>Works very well as advertised.</li>
            <li>I was really close to, they did not notice, either.  </li>
            <li>It really really works I&#x27;m buying it again</li>
            <li>It really didnt do anything for me,  </li>
            <li>I am yet to find that product that really works in thT dept.</li>
            <li>Really need the help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I think it really works ?</li>
            <li>testing the chemical to see if it really works</li>
            <li>The applicator on the oil bottle is poorly designed and if you put your fingertip on the top of the bottle then use it like you would any cologne you will get almost nothing out of the bottle, you have to be a bit creative and aggressive with the oil bottle to get any reasonable amount out.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>She was unusually flirty with me - even to the point of staying and buying me shots after her shift was over.</li>
            <li>Depending on the use and how much you put on.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>He has also noticed a real difference at work.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My girlfriend absolutely loves the smell and always asks me what cologne I wear.</li>
            <li>but it really does.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>product doesn&#x27;t really have much of a scent, per se.  </li>
            <li>I really like the results this oil gave me.</li>
            <li>Will update if any real changes are noticed.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>Looks like Pherox really knows what they are doing.</li>
            <li>this product is a straight out lie.  </li>
            <li>Overall however I do enjoy wearing the product.</li>
            <li>The shipping from Zyloo Labs was fast.  </li>
            <li>the representative is very considerate and helpful.</li>
            <li>It worked really well the the cologne I bought.</li>
            <li>And often, I don&#x27;t get any real interest from them.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really tell if it works yet</li>
            <li>She said \\&quot;don&#x27;t know what it is, I was really in the mood.</li>
            <li>It is very helpful with my wife..</li>
            <li>i feel her very dfferent since i  started to use this product..</li>
            <li>I think a person has to be really close over an extended period for the effects to really be noticeable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from women telling me I smell very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>lady&#x27;s really don&#x27;t pay attention to me.</li>
            <li>It is really intense on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So they may come very close to you like hypnotized</li>
            <li>My girlfriend wasn&#x27;t a terribly big fan of the smell (at least in the bottle), but she liked it a lot better when it was on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s cheap enough, give it a try..</li>
            <li>I really WANTED this to work...</li>
            <li>Too much seems to cancel the response you are looking for.</li>
            <li>this product worked very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Too much cologne can effect it.</li>
            <li>But after that day, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in how people react to me...</li>
            <li>This Product really does work.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really comment on getting dates or anything</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re ready</li>
            <li>Either way, thanks.</li>
            <li>because getting women has never been a real challenge.</li>
            <li>and i dont see much difference using it or not using it</li>
            <li>Whether that is from the scent or the confidence boost is really up in the air, but either way it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>It really seems to work.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t got the chance to really \\&quot;use\\</li>
            <li>This product has an ok/pleasant smell until you get really close.</li>
            <li>But I really didn&#x27;t expect too much.  </li>
            <li>I am adding a few drops to an unscented stick deodorant, The first drop came out fine, then about 6 or 7 drops ran out quickly.  </li>
            <li>I will have to wait a day or two for the oil to soak into the deodorant as this was too much.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put on too much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain too much</li>
            <li>you so much.</li>
            <li>I will be testing this frequently and will report back as I accumulate more &amp;#34;data.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Women sit up straighter when I come near them, and even men are more talkative and open to what I&#x27;m saying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so that seemed nice, an hour later another female co worker asked for my help</li>
            <li>At least, it smells good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not sure if these kind of products really function like they should!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really about using their sense of smell, drawing them in and making them more curious about you.  </li>
            <li>This is the second pheromone oil I have used, as by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>When used with my regular cologne, it seemed to blend nice enough.</li>
            <li>It has a subtle , pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>I was willing to try a new scent.</li>
            <li>It seemed like I was getting a few more second looks than normal, and conversations seemed to be started more by the women I would run into rather than me having to initiate it.</li>
            <li>When asked about it, the majority of them said even though they &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; a curious reaction about us at that particular time, they knew it was a test, but that they also notice a difference from time to time in most men.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes by as many as 30 women at a time (The others had murdered each other in an effort to get a turn)</li>
            <li>I felt a significant difference after starting to use this product.</li>
            <li>I wore it yesterday, and had a better overall confidence and general reaction from women seemed to be very favorable and receptive.</li>
            <li>but it does make other see myself as more intimidating</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I used a similar one in the past and was also happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I usually cannot stand regular cologne, this one is great.</li>
            <li>In my opinion I think it works, it helps women talk and be more active with you in person</li>
            <li>At least the first bottle did smell nice when I smell it.  </li>
            <li>I have given this product a 5 out of 5, based upon my success while using the product and no other factors.</li>
            <li>All of them had decent and some better than other results.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping - Came not to my house, but to my po box which surprised me as I used my house address for shipping.  </li>
            <li>Certainly women don&#x27;t drop their pants, but you definitely receive more attention and physical contact.</li>
            <li>The product arrived promptly and although I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days, I seem to notice favorable results, and find the smell pleasant.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised to find this work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I will add this, today i sprayed a bit more then usual on and the girls at the office were a bit more friendly then usual, complementing me on how i dress, etc...</li>
            <li>Oh and as for the smell, its a nice and not overwhelming like a lot of colognes.</li>
            <li>the time of use is pretty early to tell whether or not this works.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fairly subtle smell that my girlfriend likes, but I have not noticed more attraction from her or any other woman so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it is the product or my own bump in confidence, but it seems to help.</li>
            <li>Usually women like to attract men by showing their beauty and their nice body and let men burn</li>
            <li>I highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;this to anyone that needs a extra boost in their confidence.&lt;br /&gt;it really does open the guys more, and girls seem to react&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have even purposely put a fresh spray on before going to speak with certain folks (female) and they seem to perk up after I get close.</li>
            <li>After opening noticed that more than half of the bottle leaked out during shipping.</li>
            <li>a handsome fellow as is with slight confidence issues, and no effect.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible product,&lt;br /&gt;Misleading label.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li>Smells slightly floral with a.. Sophisticated undertone.</li>
            <li>Nothing more nothing less.</li>
            <li>Using the oil seems more discreet and less smelly than a spray.</li>
            <li>and then you will buy more that is when they send you the less quality ones?</li>
            <li>She is somewhat less resistant to my advances and she is eager to spend more time with me.</li>
            <li>Have realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li>I had a female coworker I had been trying to date start hitting on me a lot more after starting to use this.</li>
            <li>And does a decent job boosting confidence too.</li>
            <li>as i kept explaining what was wrong with her laptop, she just kept asking more and more questions, like she wanted to keep smelling me</li>
            <li>I particularly like this one, it lasts longer than the spray form and the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>One woman in particular.</li>
            <li>I was not too sure if this product would work, but it definitely attracts the opposite sex.</li>
            <li>It came in a big yellow envelope and was wrapped in packaging bubbles, which did the job as it arrived safely..</li>
            <li>Seems to be a decent product.  </li>
            <li>This is only day one, I&#x27;ll come back and update this after some more experience.</li>
            <li>Not only do more women notice me, but they actually seem compelled to start a conversation with me as well.</li>
            <li>alright and the price is decent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just received the product but, so far the results have been better than expected.</li>
            <li>My purpose for getting this is because I&#x27;m older and Wanted something to pick up my spirits.  </li>
            <li>If so, I better start acting like a badass, because I obviously am or I wouldn&#x27;t produce those chemicals&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li>so I may come back and change my review if I get better results in the future.</li>
            <li>Our jobs take us into office buildings routinely, so that was our main test.  </li>
            <li>Im choosing 5 stars because this actually works.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my boyfriend the very first night i</li>
            <li>Price is too high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend PherX.</li>
            <li>Not that the attention is at all &amp;#34;naughty&amp;#34; in nature, rather, I seem to be garnering high esteem from colleagues, acquaintances, and management.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>my high recommendation.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>they were highly upset with me.  </li>
            <li>This product smells good and would probably last a very long time even with regular use.</li>
            <li>I invite you to try PherX a way to earn a little more attention.</li>
            <li>they are a little more receptive.</li>
            <li>i love this little bottle</li>
            <li>Most of the time I wave my hand a little to catch their attention.</li>
            <li>and it seems to add to her pleasure, bringing out a little more desire for her part.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an interesting little scenario, using this stuff.</li>
            <li>Just trying to get my wife to be a little more responsive.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it as an enhancing additive to your normal cologne.</li>
            <li>I easily meet other people so my nature might have something to do with the way others relate to me.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t strong, but goes well with my other colognes.</li>
            <li>Other brands I have tried either smell too strong or have no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wish the oil had a dropper for better application other than that it works!!</li>
            <li>work, people dont mention it anymore, but one person (female) in particular, asked me right away about what&lt;br /&gt;cologne</li>
            <li>18 year old son wants to start using it.</li>
            <li>behavior at the gym was nothing beyond my normal behavior.</li>
            <li>Not sure which will be good or if they even actually work yet.  </li>
            <li>Did get a few more hellos than normal.</li>
            <li>Sometimes yes they will come up to you, but when you have to go up to the women, it will make the success rate as close to 100% as possible.</li>
            <li>This stuff works, so too much will have the exact opposite effect from what you&#x27;re looking for and will make you seem too aggressive and daunting.  </li>
            <li>They normally respond.  </li>
            <li>Even though the smell doesn&#x27;t last a long time, (about an hour or two) it does give me more confidence.</li>
            <li>I worn it a few times, and notice a more relaxed and talkative demeanor from some women.</li>
            <li>It is better for the man to keep away from women and let them do the first step or at least a sign.</li>
            <li>but I was just to edgy for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>I had some success with members of the opposite sex</li>
            <li>I got more then kissing results on the first date, and get another second date with a different girl the next night!!!</li>
            <li>and you will get a few more glances and touches.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s claimed that since he started using it women have been approaching him more frequently, with the majority acting coquettishly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a semi-above average attractive guy I&#x27;ve been told multiple times, but have been on team single for quite some time now.</li>
            <li>At work, I did notice that one of the girls I work with was much more talkative than usual (not usually the case) and she would stand really close to me.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s only if you put your nose right there.</li>
            <li>have used it four times since I got it , and not only have I not noticed absolutely any positive impact, but twice it has made me dizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The oil by itself has a very light smell, so I use some expensive imported oil as my primary scent.</li>
            <li>its cool knowing you have a secret upper hand on the women where they dont even know why they are more attracted and interested in you.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the product, my wife out of the blue became more aggressive and actually apologized for neglecting me for so long.  </li>
            <li>I was promised a free bottle  of something or other for writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put a couple of drops on my neck and wrist, add some of the regular cologne I normally wear, and I&#x27;m ready to go; and I really can tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;this one make a  new issue to my look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my new aroma (oil).</li>
            <li>I will say that it does give a sense of new confidence which makes it easier to break the ice with new people.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to Pheromone products.  </li>
            <li>well i believe they live on another planet.</li>
            <li>Even after a stressful day moving and unloading into our new house, she was eager to jump on me and \\&quot;get it on\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s new and I like it</li>
            <li>Thank you for creating this product,it seems like a new me</li>
            <li>It is less oily and easy to apply, but a bit watery</li>
            <li>It lasts a few hours, so be sure to apply before you go out, and not too early in the day, or reapply as needed.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit on the subtle side, but I suppose that is kind of the</li>
            <li>i went into a Marshalls and some Carribean older lady from Brooklyn damn near gave me her panties.  </li>
            <li>You still need to be sharp and clean as well as have the right lines to keep them engaged in the conversation to move further.</li>
            <li>I have not seen my wife be this sexy in a long, long time!</li>
            <li>This oil-based formula has the same fragrance but a little lighter (maybe less volatile), so you could probably use more of it if you&#x27;re looking for more effect, without smelling like you bathe in cologne.</li>
            <li>I mean, I like to think i&#x27;m a good enough looking dude</li>
            <li>I had a young lady walk up to me and stand right next to me and seemed to wait for my command.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I’m not very sure about the “power of attraction” toward women as it really varies depending on the situation and circumstances, and that’s the reason I want to try it one more time!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was working at first, but as soon as everyone left the elevator she lunged at me.</li>
            <li>Also the woman in the office like to chat more time than the usual when I am using this, it is not like they are going to be over you</li>
            <li>first and foremost, it definitely gave me confidence.</li>
            <li>I just finished the first bottle and decided to order a second one as I would like to give it another try.</li>
            <li>Definitely not something if wear while on a night out with a significant other simply due to the amount of &amp;#34;googly eyes&amp;#34; just my opinion :) hope this helps</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure it has been getting him any more noticed by women at all.</li>
            <li>My first use of it was in a heavily female oriented environment.</li>
            <li>Much better price than other similar products I have used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;;) I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Well first off the hole in the spout is big</li>
            <li>I went out tonight and seemed to attact much more attention than I have in the past..</li>
            <li>Wonder why the first purchase always work but not the later.  </li>
            <li>and I usually end up with more than I need.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it enough to really determine it&#x27;s effectiveness!</li>
            <li>But when I start seeing more of a difference I will add on to this review to let other possible buyers know.</li>
            <li>I wrote a review for the water-based cologne version of this product recently, so you if you&#x27;re interested you can read my fuller response to PherX products there.</li>
            <li>but then exactly the same day that i used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a short balding little troll who will never be confused with George Clooney, but with this product, I get more than my fair share of attention in the workplace.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very mild and I can&#x27;t say that I personally notice it after the first few minutes of applying it.  </li>
            <li>Instructions on the bottle were pretty clear and I started using it in the very same day.  </li>
            <li>Women that you usually don&#x27;t talk to actually show interest and all nice to you.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have been married over 25 years and with of us both having busy jobs and lives and after droping weight over the last two years and hitting the gym 5 days a week wasn&#x27;t getting her interest peaking again</li>
            <li>So far this is my second time receiving this product, the first time it was given to me as a gift for me to try out.</li>
            <li>So far I have been wearing it at the office which is usually where I deal with the most women during the day.</li>
            <li>I have recently purchased this product and have already had positive results.</li>
            <li>I can only surmise that from the positive comments on here that the guys that bought this BELIEVE it works.</li>
            <li>Never really had that happen to me in the past dealing with attractive female servers from restaurants before using this product.  </li>
            <li>It got their attention, but after that it was up to us to keep them interested.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to single out one particular woman didn&#x27;t do much, andworked better when a small group was gathered for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not usually lack for much attention from females, but I have definitely seen an increase in interest.</li>
            <li>This is a simple math, easy to test with the opposite sex in an open conversation, ask your sisters or brothers someone that it won’t have any interest in you, and ask them is the smell makes them fill attracted to you.</li>
            <li>did seem to help she said i smelled good and little by little as night went on</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t say for certain if it is just the fact that my confidence is a bit improved wearing it or if it actually draws females in, but something about it works.</li>
            <li>It is designed, as pure pheromone solutions should be, to be detected subconsciously.</li>
            <li>I may even say women seem less friendly while wearing this stuff.</li>
            <li>If her mind is elsewhere, thinking of more stressful thinking, the last thing she&#x27;s going to think about is a little hanky-panky.  </li>
            <li>Had more glances and longer held looks from my spouse, but hard to say whether this would be on account of the oil or the layered scent over.</li>
            <li>The effect usually can be noticed on older women more than younger ones.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product if your normal romantic endevors haven&#x27;t been working with your partner.</li>
            <li>Have yet to try it in a different setting ie bar or club or other more social setting to see a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Small amounts usually work better huge amounts...</li>
            <li>My fiancé loves this stuff but he doesn&#x27;t use it to attract women clearly but for the testerone.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tested the product for variety of conditions yet, but I have seen a clear effect on my girl-friend.</li>
            <li>but it only works if you REALLY believe.</li>
            <li>I think as far as &amp;#34;attracting women&amp;#34;, you don&#x27;t get women gravitating towards you or anything like that.  </li>
            <li>lightly spritzed it on and also heavily applied</li>
            <li>I used this product in public places which I never knew before the women and approached gently, spoke politely,offered some drinks</li>
            <li>, is scented oil do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve gone out with a girl in two occasions one with the product applied and another with out, so far I have seen no change.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the scent itself does anything to me directly, but</li>
            <li>but as far as I am concerned at the end of the day...</li>
            <li>but my reasoning was trying to get that old spark going again in my marriage</li>
            <li>I must admit that I have always gotten attention from women through the years, but lately the flirting has been a lot more unapologetic and deliberate.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised by how &#x27;motivated&#x27; my girlfriend seemed to be when I had put some on.</li>
            <li>and the pharmacist was acting like a schoolgirl being really flirty</li>
            <li>BUT at close rage I have noticed a considerable amount of women do ask about it and do get close</li>
            <li>but i do feel better about my chances when i use it so at least that part of things helps.</li>
            <li>I cannot smell anything even with my nose near the opened bottle.</li>
            <li>As far as this product making me irresistible to woman; well, I still seem to be quite resistible which is in no way a reflection of this company.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>As far as smell goes, I couldn&#x27;t detect any fragrance just as advertised.</li>
            <li>Unless you count the 4 dogs that would try to mount me whenever I&#x27;d wear this stuff - ALL MALE and VERY DETERMINED.&lt;br /&gt;I used the remaining on Sadie, my dog -</li>
            <li>I place a drop or two on my finger and rub it directly on my skin in areas of my body that “stink”, and by that</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband, and wow.</li>
            <li>So far, I have seen a difference on how my wife looks at me.  </li>
            <li>I sneaked it on without telling my wife and noticed a wild look in her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its scent is the same as \\&quot;normal\\&quot; Pherx, but the effect lasts and lasts, and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quite simply, it does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Would not waste my money on this product.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Whether the pheromones are actually working</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe pheromones out of a bottle would work vs the pheromone we naturally produce.</li>
            <li>From my experience the oil seems to last much longer than spray pheromones.</li>
            <li>so far i am not seeing the results i was hoping for</li>
            <li>and I am not reviewing as such, however I was much more&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;That is what I can tell so far.  </li>
            <li>and i was very pleasantly surprised with the outcome.</li>
            <li>I tell you what I am a 50 year old 20lbs.</li>
            <li>so the conscious mind still in control.</li>
            <li>Also know that women learnt since they were young to suppress their feelings and suppress their unconscious mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It last longer on you and you don&#x27;t go through the bottle as fast.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old and have had not-so-active time with my spouse.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far it seems to have worked 4 out of the 5 times I have used it with my wife of 40 years.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>And with having kids under 6 years old, well, you get the picture.  </li>
            <li>Seems like a far fetched idea on paper, but thought I would give it a shot based on the posted reviews.  </li>
            <li>got this product out of curiosity, 2 friends of mine have used it and said they couldn&#x27;t tell the difference as far drawing the ladies attention/interest to themselves.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to make females notice you as far as i can tell so far</li>
            <li>received the product earlier than estimated delivery date (thanks).</li>
            <li>I just received the oil and tried it today when I went to the store and it must work because every woman in the store that I was near was smiling at me.this stuff</li>
            <li>worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>It must be mixed with your favorilte lotion or cologne, just a  few drops will do it, make sure you use ite 2 hours beacuse</li>
            <li>far as efficacy, I seem to get more lovin lately from the Mrs.</li>
            <li>I have only worn this product out a few times, and it seems to get me more attention from women.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other pheromones,  this one is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>especially anyone you are sitting right next to.</li>
            <li>The oil by itself is quite mild, I am not sure how much of an affect it would have by itself.</li>
            <li>As long as your expectations are realistic and not ridiculous, I would recommend trying this.</li>
            <li>I use other pheromone based oils and colognes, and I think those are better, but also more expensive.  </li>
            <li>As other users reported, ladies would not jump over you but the substance did made them to be more open to conversation and be closer to you with constant smiles.  </li>
            <li>but you know what I mean:)))</li>
            <li>I really like the way this stuff smells and it pairs really well with other fragrances.</li>
            <li>Small package, easy to carry in pocket etc.</li>
            <li>I attribute my getting a new job, getting laid, and making a bunch of new friends in the last couple of weeks to the effects of this product and the affect it has on me.</li>
            <li>I actually like this much better because it draws people in easier, rather then just making them highly aroused wich can accutally backfire because they are afraid of loosing control and avoid me more in daytime social situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is not worth it for the price; I won’t pay more than $10.00 as a simple regular perfume, nothing else.</li>
            <li>I tried it another time out in public and noticed more stares than usual...</li>
            <li>Both give off a decent scent, but the oil definitely smells a bit stronger then the spray.</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t noticed the more extreme reactions described by some other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s best to wear it with cologne as I guess it would be difficult to smell or sense the pheromones.</li>
            <li>I tried this product being a little sceptical, but after trying it i&#x27;m a true believer.  </li>
            <li>next morning, my wife was definitely more &amp;#34;friendly&amp;#34;, maybe partly because my attitude was a little different, also.  </li>
            <li>Actually smells better than my regular cologne, leaves hands feeling a little greasy however</li>
            <li>Have used product only 3 days &amp; noticed a positive difference in the amount of conversation I receive from different women.</li>
            <li>and she really warmed up even during a very stressful time when I would have expected the opposite.</li>
            <li>( normally this specific co worker never talks)</li>
            <li>The third night I put some on and made advances which she eagerly accepted, but that is normal.</li>
            <li>My results are not any different than my normal night out  that i can tell .</li>
            <li>I tried before a similar product, but only this gave me the results that I expected, thanks!!!.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; version is best used for dabbing a little behind the ears or any other location where you want precision in placing it.  </li>
            <li>may ask the spouse to go with me to a club sometime in order to test reaction of other females in the room (purely scientific, of course!).  </li>
            <li>After using it for only a few days, I&#x27;ve noticed that my female co-workers seem to be more friendly than usual.</li>
            <li>Very poor and very watery the spray is far better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once on New years eve and forgot I had even put it on.</li>
            <li>They will also not make up for lack of grooming, lack of hygiene or a complete lack of social skills.  </li>
            <li>They will also not make up for lack of grooming, lack of hygiene or a complete lack of social skills.  </li>
            <li>The third bottle I just recently purchased can&#x27;t be compared to my very bottle because I did not smell anything.  </li>
            <li>nothing beats the gym and maintenance to how you look ...though this product is light especially when you don&#x27;t wanna over do it with a heavy cologne...</li>
            <li>A female acquaintance kept leaning against me, doing one of those &amp;#34;i&#x27;m tired, support me&amp;#34; kind of deals.</li>
            <li>During our evening, my fiancé seemed to be a little bit friskier and when we went to bed that night she was a more passionate than she had been recently.  </li>
            <li>Its works a little on the first try and may use in the future to really see what it can do.</li>
            <li>I went to meet up with a very old female friend of mine and her friend</li>
            <li>several days I noticed female friends, co-workers, dance partners and even acquaintances were finding reasons to be near me or stay longer than normal to chat.</li>
            <li>This is the second pheromone oil I have tried recently, the first being Arouse RX extra stregnth which I love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as other women around me and in my life, coworkers seem to be just as friendly as usual, although I have to admit that I&#x27;m not paying very close attention to them as I do my spouse</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple weeks now and have used it in various situations, both social and a little more personal, and it has definitely made a difference.</li>
            <li>Not even the slight scent that is present upon putting it on but quickly disappears.  </li>
            <li>The pheromone is subtle at first but after using it a few times I have noticed a pattern and that I&#x27;m getting a lot more attention.</li>
            <li>The evenings were also tested, in restaurants and bars/clubs.&lt;br /&gt;We also had access to a K9 trained to locate missing people.&lt;br /&gt;Our individual notes, showed a little over half of the women, both in the offices and in clubs, reacted more friendly when we had the attractant on.&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li>Wore it to office the other day and could feel the positive effects immideatley.</li>
            <li>I put this on and I can clearly notice the extra attention I get.</li>
            <li>So far I asked my female coworkers what they thought of the smell</li>
            <li>I have used it only a couple of times so far and works as advertised.</li>
            <li>I have only had this for two days.so far nothing</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell the only noticeable effect is darn near &amp;#34;point blank&amp;#34; (about one foot or less).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Response may depend a lot on the female inhaling the pheromones.  </li>
            <li>Now, my brother is a college student, so he&#x27;s around young ladies constantly.</li>
            <li>that don&#x27;t normally speak to me at work are now coming around and starting conversations out of the blue.</li>
            <li>I like this product..because it is subtle in application but strong on responsiveness from women.</li>
            <li>I like the oil application much better than the spray because I can control the amount and place it on a pulse point like behind my ear.</li>
            <li>(i.e., this isn&#x27;t going to be traumatic for anyone you share an elevator with, even if you were a bit more liberal than dabbing it behind your ears).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It boosted my confidence&lt;br /&gt;I seemed to have better luck with women, false perception or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When my romancing options seemed to be eliciting a weak response I ordered this to see if I could get my wife a little more &#x27;interested&#x27; in me.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived right on time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days</li>
            <li>I have not had much luck with getting all the attention as claimed by other users however,  </li>
            <li>but it really does not work other than that.</li>
            <li>Smells good, science is behind it, and does seem to work a little.</li>
            <li>just to be clear, there is no actual smell of this product, I simply apply with my cologne.</li>
            <li>The academic literature regarding human pheromones doesn&#x27;t say that that you&#x27;ll be swimming in men/women; rather, the effects are more subtle and subconscious (and aren&#x27;t all about having sex; calming effects, etc).</li>
            <li>the social network.</li>
            <li>there are fake reviews floating around, but in my experience this oil works to make women much more relaxed inviting and slightly sexually aroused.</li>
            <li>it isnt a miracle item though, you still have to possess social skills to develop a relationship with someone.</li>
            <li>It could simply be the confidence of my &#x27;secret weapon&#x27;, but in any case, I&#x27;m highly satisfied with my experience in using this product.</li>
            <li>I am sorry to say but as far as I was able to tell this product has no effect on women.</li>
            <li>Black, brown hair women usually have more effect on them than blonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been interested in trying a pheromone product for several years now after watching a show on tv where they used hidden cameras and demonstrated in a scientific experiment that pheromones can increase your attractiveness to women or men depending on your preference.</li>
            <li>I believe this product was made to help a husband give his wife that little extra, and in my case anyway, it certainly did!  </li>
            <li>However as far as an &amp;#34;attractant&amp;#34; as the product is pitched, only one female (out of about 50 test subjects) actually responded with what you&#x27;d indicate as &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>But she could barely walk when she left.</li>
            <li>but I am not sure it is worth the cost they are charging.</li>
            <li>Received  product  few days ago  waiting for something to happen been married 30yrs.</li>
            <li>i like that people are now a little more friendlier then usual.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it does anything at all, but doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell so can be worn with other cologne.</li>
            <li>This has a really subtle and clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I find it really has a slight easing quality to it.</li>
            <li>I like it so far, only wore it once, but strange women stopped to talk to me at the grocery store and the hardware store.</li>
            <li>Oil-base means that it&#x27;s around for the full day and at least my nose can detect it over 24 hours later.  </li>
            <li>It usually works, but if it doesn&#x27;t work for you in some situations, at least you smell nice.</li>
            <li>However it seemed to be noticed by only that particular person, no change in the other three individuals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really raises a red flag when all the negative reviewers have a long history of reviews both good and bad from unrelated products while the positive ones are this product and</li>
            <li>its very subtle yet very stimulating,  it was delivered very fast..</li>
            <li>This product has a subtle sweet smell, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t even try, it&#x27;s really cool, and I&#x27;m being serious now...</li>
            <li>I tried to be exact pick-up-artist and my targets are average beauty,normal people not high class.</li>
            <li>Just a little contact seems to release it again, which can be a real plus if you use it wisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very sceptic about use anything like this, but when I do put it on I see a little of a different reaction from women</li>
            <li>I usually try it before things like job interviews, work social events, etc., and it seems to have a net positive effect.</li>
            <li>The little bottle may release to much oil at one time if you don&#x27;t cover the opening with a finger, tip the bottle over and tip it back up, while keeping your finger on the opening until the fluid is back to the bottom.</li>
            <li>Which only made things worse because now my penis is huge .</li>
            <li>It is a bit less overpowering, in scent, than the spray, so the effect is still present, just more subtle.</li>

            <li> Who knows whether this helped or not, but having this may boost your confidence and make you feel more attractive.</li>
            <li> product is great and more development on it will make a revolution no doupt....</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never felt more attractive</li>
            <li> Some days more attractive then others, and it was rather normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just stick to good hygiene and a nice cologne as I have been.</li>
            <li> Great product, mild smell but attractive.</li>
            <li> So, here I am leaving a a good review because it actually smells good! :D</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with this product, and plan to buy more soon!!</li>
            <li> Has a very light but pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to think that it was just me, but it probably had more to do with the PherX-Oil!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this stuff works if you believe in it!</li>
            <li> some women seem more prone to responding to this product than others!</li>
            <li> I ordered some more and need it now!</li>
            <li> I do not know for sure!</li>
            <li> Ok so I rated the product a one star!</li>
            <li> Just bought this, love the scent, and so do women!</li>

            <li> you know it&#x27;s also great that you get a free sample for an honest  review ^^</li>

            <li> Amazingly to my surprise.</li>
            <li> Its amazing</li>
            <li> When I tried it, it was amazing.</li>
            <li> PherX Pheromones is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how effective</li>
            <li> All in all amazing product</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Pros: Has a sorta nice smell actually&lt;</li>
            <li> I honestly thought this s</li>
            <li> That thing is good, gave me a lot of self confedence, helps to start conversation and noticed that girls paying more attention to me now</li>
            <li> Nice scent.</li>
            <li> but I often get comments as to how nice I smell with it on.....</li>
            <li> It smells like a nice deodorant.</li>
            <li> The service was excellent, and I really think this product is making a difference.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice scent to it, not overpowering, but not underwhelming.</li>
            <li> Excellent value and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> and then they would ask me what kind of cologne I am wearing.</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent also.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product and great delivery times.</li>
            <li> It smells nice</li>
            <li> To be honest I just received this Saturday</li>
            <li> I drive limo &amp; pickup nice females all the time... wanted to try my luck with this</li>
            <li> But women that I know that give me hugs almost always mention that I smell nice.  </li>
            <li> I bought the products since while, and I believe these products are so nice and efefctive.</li>
            <li> I had to do my own research on pheromone applications as there are lack of viable informational directions on the web site or bottle.</li>
            <li> i love it, smells good</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, although not overpowering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Zyloo Labs (PherX) indicates that these products are effective for up to four hours.  </li>
            <li> If you use it to get the edge, don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re cheating; over the years, I learned that the most lovely person you&#x27;ll meet may not look attractive.</li>
            <li> This product is effective.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and blends nicely with my cologne.</li>
            <li> Bottle was safety sealed in nice padded box.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an oil-based product, so it will not evaporate off in a warm environment as some alcohol-based products can.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, and I notice increased interactions from women.</li>
            <li> It feels nice, the oil.  </li>
            <li> smells really nice just started using it</li>
            <li> I cannot yet say if the product is attracting women or not, but I can say the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m using it to make me feel confident and to have a good conversation with wonen.</li>
            <li> but the product smells nice and doest hurt ur chances.</li>
            <li> They complimented how the smell was so nice.  </li>
            <li> She told me she liked the way I smelled and within minutes</li>
            <li> Maybe has some kind of effect on your confidence and that&#x27;s what women like?</li>
            <li> kind of how I&#x27;ve always been.</li>
            <li> I suppose, but not someone who stands out in the looks department, and kind of an introvert.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, WHEN used correctly and expectations are reasonable.</li>
            <li> So when I use it I notice alot of ladies talking to me more, telling me I smell good, then I hear them talking when I walk away, things like &amp;#34;mmmm mmmm hmmmm&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34</li>
            <li> I get warm smiles everywhere</li>
            <li> &quot; it per say, but it has a nice smell, and others took notice of me immediately</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> Not overly impressed, no noticeable difference really.  </li>
            <li> When I give a Lady a warm hug</li>
            <li> I find that it works best when paired with your own natural chemistry.</li>
            <li> And I have tried many others, but PherX Pheromone oil for men really is the best.</li>
            <li> Has a light pleasant scent to it.</li>
            <li> Product is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> as i have more experiences i will update, thank u pherx for the free sample!!</li>
            <li> I notice that women agree more with what I say, women perceive sexual innuendos in my statementsthat don’t exist, and I even have women who are in relationships giving me attention that I don’t even want!</li>
            <li> This product smells pretty good!</li>
            <li> After Zyloo sent me this product to review, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with this oil as I was with the other products I have ordered from Zyloo labs, but this still worked great.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant added boost of confidence, had the price been more reasonable</li>
            <li> women tend to be more nice to me whenever i use this product</li>
            <li> More smiles and nice reactions.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think it was more that my spouse found the labels and packaging in the trash</li>
            <li> Best one I used so far.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the company updated with more information and history of pheromones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What makes this product even more amazing is the way that women interact with me now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using PherX Oil for Men with great success.</li>
            <li> Mind you, you still got to be a gentleman and have good hygiene, stay fit, and not act like a douche towards women</li>
            <li> nice smell, and women definitely more talkative</li>
            <li> More smiles and nice reactions from women.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good product  !  </li>
            <li> Sounds to good to be true...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel very fit for a review.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, and most importantly it makes you feel more confident.</li>
            <li> Its very light and blends with all perfumes!&lt;br /&gt;Overall i like the product.</li>
            <li> so far so good... will update once I am successful</li>
            <li> Since, some pheromones have a scent to them and not all are necessarily pleasant to everyone thus, undermining the success rate.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident and attractive when I have it on, and I find women are more interested in me.</li>
            <li> Women want to interact for longer periods of time, and find what I&#x27;m saying more interesting.</li>
            <li> This is much more concentrated than spray.  </li>
            <li> Will be interesting to see how this goes.  </li>
            <li> no I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the placebo affect! :)</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work if youre lucking for friends or girlfriend or something with more than a relationship with girls  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to experiment with this product over the weekends and if there is anything more to it then a placebo affect, I will report it here.  :)</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance</li>
            <li> but I am still using it because I love the smell.</li>
            <li> had never tried a product like this but, being a middle-age widower and having to start again, I&#x27;m glad to have this edge so the ladies come to me.</li>
            <li> There is definitely more attention towards me using this product I don&#x27;t know how it works</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied and grateful</li>
            <li> I bought this not only for me but also my best friends.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I have noticed my wife gets more attracted and have more passion when having sex, she also keeps smelling my neck.</li>
            <li> but I am sure it will work ...</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say for sure where or not wearing PherX is the reason.</li>
            <li> The thing I like most about this product is the scent.</li>
            <li> but if it makes my husband more confident...so be it.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t snared the romance of the century, but I smell interestingly while trying.</li>
            <li> Use with your favorite cologne perfume.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> People that I come in contact with seem in a better mood and friendlier.</li>
            <li> Without telling her about PherX-Oil (I still haven&#x27;t told her), my girlfriend seemed more amorous and sexually responsive.</li>
            <li> but I felt the ladies were sitting closer and paying more attention to me.</li>
            <li> I think I like the oil more because I sweat a lot at work</li>
            <li> and it seems to have more staying power.</li>
            <li> What I can tell you for sure from my experience:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I kinda was expecting more from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Even my friends commented on how females seem to be more attracted to me.</li>
            <li> --I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know most of the guys that have used it are trying out on the dating scene</li>
            <li> but i just aint had any money to order more the bottle</li>
            <li> but I can say the wife does appear to be more touchy feely when I wear this.</li>
            <li> I am going to combine this with  my favorite  cologne.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mostly girls at the office.</li>
            <li> I knew there will be many women....</li>
            <li> Light smell and lasts all day if you were wondering about it!</li>
            <li> women will talk to you more and get close to you.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff , my lady loves the way I smell ......</li>
            <li> The more women I talk to, the more chances to connect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works, but everyone is sure nicer to me when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> I will keep a supply on hand for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try another one of their products and see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells on him</li>
            <li> and I think it attracts me to him even more, so I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
            <li> Regardless, it opened us up to a conversation that had been many, many months overdue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure</li>
            <li> The product is OK, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.  </li>
            <li> Attraction depends on many things, i,e, body language,  appearance, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works more like a lure where it attracts them to you and makes them relaxed around you</li>
            <li> Will be buying more</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li> Tried this on for my wife and she is like a teenager looking for love.</li>
            <li> That is the magic of the product.</li>
            <li> Smells ok as a standalone</li>
            <li> but I like mixing it with my favorite cologne...</li>
            <li> Even men seem to treat you with more respect.  </li>
            <li> keep buying more.</li>
            <li> The females do respond much more when I wear PherX Oil.</li>
            <li> But this was nothing more than &amp;#34;snake oil&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I am just trying to find a reputable company to purchase from.  </li>
            <li> Look around more.</li>
            <li> I think this product might make user more confident and also make people around relax.</li>
            <li> If it makes you more confident I&#x27;m all for it</li>
            <li> Granted there may be a placebo effect in which the user feels more self confident, but I&#x27;d like to think there is some science involved.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be more potent than the spray.</li>
            <li> Have had better results with the oil over the spray.</li>
            <li> Have noticed getting more looks.</li>
            <li> Its what I payed for but needs a better smell.</li>
            <li> You get more attention and more hugs.</li>
            <li> After trying it for a week I&#x27;ve noticed more attention and caught more looks.</li>
            <li> I have noticed more attention but not any flat-out aggressive suitors...</li>
            <li> Seems to work with most women, and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> If need this to makes you more confident, buy it.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was packed nicely and secure.</li>
            <li> I would say more like two to three hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more controllable on it&#x27;s application.</li>
            <li> My answer is truthfully, I don&#x27;t know yet.  </li>
            <li> I did however receive quite a bit more attention and flirtiness from the bartender..  </li>
            <li> Seeing so many</li>
            <li> Glances, and maybe smiles, is all it gives you, you&#x27;ll have to work your magic to get the girls to like you, and maybe love you.    </li>
            <li> And many may miss their chance to meet her/him and fall in love with them because of the way they look.    </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what the respond would be</li>
            <li> As I use the PHERX more it seems to have more of an affect.</li>
            <li> Women keep showing more interest in me.</li>
            <li> The effects of PherX seem to build up the more I use it, so I do not recommend washing it</li>
            <li> It can be used alone or in combination with your favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> I really love this product</li>
            <li> My wife is way more touchy feeley with me and always want me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s put it this way, something magic will happen.</li>
            <li> There will be more touching, there will be more smiling.</li>
            <li> Her eyes seem to dilate a bit more while she&#x27;s standing close to me.  </li>
            <li> You still have to be confident in yourself and in your environment.  </li>
            <li> It makes women pay more attention for sure.</li>
            <li> but I will keep wearing it and pay more attention.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because while I have been pleased with the results</li>
            <li> Pheromone products will not make clothing magically melt off.  </li>
            <li> Pheromone products will not make clothing magically melt off.  </li>
            <li> noticed the change immediatly, it seems that this oil makes people trust me more, where as arouse rx is more of an aggressive arousal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is something I can wear day or night because it seems to create more of a relaxed arrousal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not the best reviewer because this is my second review ever, but my goal is to try many pheromones and give reviews of them all.</li>
            <li> I will up date this information as I try this oil out more, and make reviews as I learn how to better communicate on these reviews.</li>
            <li> It worked for me :)</li>
            <li> Talking to yourself in the mirror would have a greater influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure on the effects yet as I haven&#x27;t been out and about much, but this stuff smells great.</li>
            <li> Women love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using PherX Pheromone Oil for more than two years already</li>
            <li> This product has enhanced my interactions with women, since I have been using this product have have noticed that women are more chatty.</li>
            <li> do not want to say this is a scam, but it is for sure not as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Ladies notice me more and sometimes approach me.</li>
            <li> I was able to get the oil form a week ago today.  </li>
            <li> The girl ive been seeing was definitely more cuddly and eager, but more testing is needed to determine the degree</li>
            <li> Most of them just hit the weights and stay there.  </li>
            <li> hope to attract a better majority soon</li>
            <li> appears to have a effect as ladies seem more interactive.</li>
            <li> I can not wait to see what more this will</li>
            <li> Be sure to wash your hands/fingers after placing the oil on you.</li>
            <li> and you will be pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I do feel more confident while wearing it tho</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the smell!</li>
            <li> dont know how many, may not&lt;br /&gt;be</li>
            <li> and i will say this that yes women will approach you and talk to you more</li>
            <li> so I cannot attest for sure</li>
            <li> I think it works, but you should not expect it to work magically.</li>
            <li> i love it..</li>
            <li> Noticed women being more talkative and lingering.  </li>
            <li> I have many tattoos and ride a Harley Davidson.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Another brand seemed to work better</li>
            <li> I will know for sure if it work this weekend</li>
            <li> Seem to be getting more smiles form the ladies.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wore it when I went out to dinner and ended up striking up a conversation with the waitress.</li>
            <li> What I experience is more attention from females period.</li>
            <li> I know many people won&#x27;t believe in this stuff..</li>
            <li> I was totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I love the attention my wife has been giving me.  </li>
            <li> love it.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> Most women  love the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> Though I will agree with one reviewer who says this gave him more confidence</li>
            <li> and it sure did.</li>
            <li> but wearing made me more confident</li>
            <li> Will do business again for sure :)</li>
            <li> and this stuff seemed to make me feel better, more confident.</li>
            <li> I am sure what a pheromones smell like</li>
            <li> I notice women checking me out more often</li>
            <li> For sure a confidence builder.</li>
            <li> I have noticed when I use this product that women do seem to pay more attention.  </li>
            <li> Make more eye contact and seem to be more at ease.  </li>
            <li> have been way more receptive since I started wearing this stuff.</li>
            <li> I also feel like I have been more &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I seem to be getting a lot more attention from the ladies.</li>
            <li> It does not have a fragrance that I am able to detect.  </li>
            <li> Try to balance it with your favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m handsome</li>
            <li> I notice that girls do look at me more than begore</li>
            <li> Okay, as for the smell.. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything</li>
            <li> Hope to receive this and love to try ....</li>
            <li> Smells really dang great.</li>
            <li> will re-order for sure.</li>
            <li> I got noticed a lot more and felt a lot more confident when going out.  </li>
            <li> and i have to say i get alot more tips from the ladies</li>
            <li> /&gt;Several of the office men were also more talkative during these tests as well, asking mostly about an opinion on something, or requesting help with what we do for the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and compliments my after shave without overpowering it nicely.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> Also notice women want to flirt more when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Its okay ...but doesn&#x27;t do any wonders ...</li>
            <li> When wearing this I have notice more attention from women.</li>
            <li> More smiles, friendlier conversations</li>
            <li> , more looks.</li>
            <li> You feel bolder and more confident during the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gonna have women fawning over you, but you will notice people want to be around you more</li>
            <li> More so than when I don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> Woman are definitely more talkative and approachable.</li>
            <li> maybe I just feel more confident when I&#x27;m wearing it, but</li>
            <li> If he&#x27;s noticing a difference in the demeanor of the women around him just now, then it&#x27;s safe to assume it&#x27;s because of the pheromone he&#x27;s applying.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident when using this.</li>
            <li> I will surely purchase again.</li>
            <li> If so i will change my review.now on to a positive note shipping was very fast excellent</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty good right there.</li>
            <li> it seems like this makes men and women more apt to be friendly with me.</li>
            <li> and she seemed very friendly...</li>
            <li> And when i get to work and through out the day these women are suddenly friendly and talking to me without bitching lmao.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smelling scent.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> The best product of its kind hands down.</li>
            <li> However it has made women want be closer more flirty and and makes me more comfortable being confident.  </li>
            <li> hi,its very very great pheremone oil to attract woman.its great that mens also love this.its changes the mood in seconds.pherex has also other pheremones but its very powerfull.</li>
            <li> First of all, the delivery service from the seller was really good, they shipped on time and with the item as described.&lt;br /&gt;Second about the product, although the seller encourages for the customer to leave feedback</li>
            <li> I am a pretty good looking dude</li>
            <li> and I have always been pretty good at getting my foot in the door.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the way women act around me.  </li>
            <li> That works out to a pretty good investment.</li>
            <li> well first off it dosent have a scent which is good</li>
            <li> and they said that smell nice (nothing extraordinary).</li>
            <li> OK except smell strong</li>
            <li> While it does not attract women or their stares, it does boost up my self-esteem and helps me talk to girls more easily.</li>
            <li> I have to assume that if I used this product in the club scene that I&#x27;d probably get a good amount of attention there too, as the warm humid nature of clubs would naturally cause perspiration, which would release this product into the air around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably get a good amount of attention there too, as the warm humid nature of clubs would naturally cause perspiration, which would release this product into the air around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> An attractive blonde server for some reason gave me a lot of attention and was kind of touchy feely.  </li>
            <li> i recommend this is very special</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: 1/17/2016&lt;br /&gt;Definitely has a positive effect, my friends have all complimented me on smelling good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly noticed that after I started using this that my wife became a lot more touchy feely and more like when we first were dating.</li>
            <li> but it is still up to you to project confidence, have good hygiene, clean clothing, good social skills if you want the interaction to lead to more.</li>
            <li> This is a very sweet smelling product.</li>
            <li> Many others do though, so hopefully its just me and anyone else that buys it will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> And they will send you for free one more product, after you ricieve this, but even for two of them - lost money.</li>
            <li> and I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> but when I wear the product it just gives me a more comfortable feeling..</li>
            <li> I see females are a lot more engaging with me.</li>
            <li> But since I have started wearing PHERX I have noticed lady&#x27;s are more comfortable being around me.</li>
            <li> I never noticed any women who were more comfortable around me or approached me.</li>
            <li> my advanced were rewarded with a lovely response.  </li>
            <li> Even the gals in classes have been more attentive and responsive.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my wife is more attentive to me and relaxed when I wear</li>
            <li> It does seem to have a &amp;#34;happy inducing effect&amp;#34; on yourself and women (and men) doesn&#x27;t really smell like cologne which is good because I don&#x27;t want to smell like I wear cologne.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This was an easy one my aid gave me my shower this morning, I put some on and as she gave me my massage, it was a very special message</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell to it and it seems that I get more attention, girls feel more comfortable around me and want to linger near me longer, and are more touchy feely for sure.</li>
            <li> and im loving it right now.</li>
            <li> The stuff smells pretty good, although I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference in interactions with women.  </li>
            <li> but after I smell it I am pretty sure women will like it!</li>
            <li> It also seems like women are more friendly even when it is in a business situation.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly without any problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and not greasy.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll come out a winner easy.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s easy to take around places.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m wearing the productI like how easy it is to make friends with women.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a really strong smelling and oily but is not</li>
            <li> Not too strong.  </li>
            <li> As a biologist I had strong expectations for the pheromone.  </li>
            <li> So far smells good and arrived on time in safe packaging.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a really strong smelling and oily but is not.</li>
            <li> I partnered it with lacoste noir which was a strong cologne a couple of times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that strong smelling though.</li>
            <li> After i re-entered the main office area the ladies loved me.  </li>
            <li> but I did note a major spike in confidence and is a great conversation starter.</li>
            <li> It will definitely take some more testing to say for sure, but as of now I have had a fairly good experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I kind of test it out first.</li>
            <li> I see several beautiful women there.</li>
            <li> The last time I went there, I saw a lot of beautiful women.  </li>
            <li> Without exaggeration, I can honestly say this stuff REALLY works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This product gives you some kind of confidence if you need it (exactly what I need) to talk to women.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product is not bad and I have noticed more affection from my spouse when I put it on.</li>
            <li> The results were great- Just about every new first date I went on, let&#x27;s just say I was given more than a kiss goodbye-</li>
            <li> I noticed my wife enjoyed the fragrance more when I applied it more consistently rather than just when we went out on special occasions.</li>
            <li> Does this work if you&#x27;re gay?</li>
            <li> it is important to put this in areas that you sweat easily.</li>
            <li> Women will be more interested in you, they will look at you more</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> They seem more excited and friendly around me.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and on time as well!</li>
            <li> and i think that it works a little lol!</li>
            <li> But every girl who catches wiff says I smell amazing and/or seems to show added interest and trust in me when I have this great little bottle of luck on.</li>
            <li> if you really have the balls to aproach (don&#x27;t  expect magic), it works very good when your very close to the person talking with and even more when you go physical,  it not just makes you feel confident but also turns women on.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a huge increase in the level of comfort women</li>
            <li> but i will say it gives u a huge boost of</li>
            <li> From the day I opened the package and began using I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> If your aim is to find an oil that attracts, then this WOULD fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Experienced lots of extra smiles from people.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a skeptic you&#x27;re probably not going to enjoy this purchase.</li>
            <li> I do like the light scent of PherX.</li>
            <li> enjoy the response you get</li>
            <li> I bought the spray version and they sent me this for free to review as well (before I even reviewed the spray).</li>
            <li> However, you need to spend great effort to open the bottle.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with this purchase and I think it works.</li>
            <li> It smells great and actually works</li>
            <li> I honestly didnt think they valued me very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , how did I smell and she smiled and said i really like it.</li>
            <li> It definitely was a great investment.</li>
            <li> I have self confidence and have been told various times I am an attractive man.</li>
            <li> I do appreciate them giving me a chance to try it for free</li>
            <li> will enjoy what I bought</li>
            <li> I have Demo Twice at work last week,  Great results.</li>
            <li> It does something to the ladies to pay closer attention to you, to smile more and to approach you for conversation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 if it was not for the offer of free sample-for-review.  </li>
            <li> She is also a bit more inclined for some fun in non-standard locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This also means that you can over do it, so start off light and build up.  </li>
            <li> any questions, feel free to ask in the comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nothing different, have not scored yet, lol...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it is more effective in different environments.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much, but did have a nice muted scent.</li>
            <li> Draws women like a moth to light.</li>
            <li> Company sending me email to review them to get another free bottle of this</li>
            <li> I cursed and hollored at the offfice staff of women for not having the room available to tennants.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s sure worth a shot,</li>
            <li> thank you guys for making such a great product i will buy another one and another when they run out.</li>
            <li> ITS GOT THAT SEXY N FRESH SMELL</li>
            <li> Smells freaking great, and based on personal experience</li>
            <li> and I have noticed more women checking me out with a smile.</li>
            <li> so be cautioned, use lightly.</li>
            <li> You know, something that would get a laugh out of both of us, being relatively confident it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> but so far so good,</li>
            <li> Anyway, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I try this and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I tried the pheromone oil a couple of times and it does work, i noticed that I gain more attention from more women, thanks</li>
            <li> At the gym, I also noticed that some of the girls near me would be glancing over fairly often.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> It smells pretty good, and the first day I wore it</li>
            <li> At first sniff this seemed too floral for me, but after a little while on my skin the odor shifts to something more appropriate, more attractive.</li>
            <li> First off, the product didnt work!!</li>
            <li> i use this regularly and it is very effective</li>
            <li> Saving $50.00 off the original price is also a huge</li>
            <li> It makes you more confident around people and people start to like you more in general.</li>
            <li> Loving the new attention and experimenting with this product!</li>
            <li> It smells clean and light.  </li>
            <li> This stuff worked amazingly with this girl I&#x27;ve liked for a long time.</li>
            <li> Everyone is so warm, inviting, and striking up convos with people you desire to do it with is as easy as turning a key.</li>
            <li> My observations appear to include increased physical responsiveness and more enthusiastic and easily obtained indicators of interest.</li>
            <li> Smells good, not really sure how good it works...</li>
            <li> The first test I did just for fun was dinner with friends in a nice restaurant.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product, it smells so good, and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> and my wife was friendly and more sexual than normal.</li>
            <li> and my wife was friendly and more sexual than normal......</li>
            <li> Will try experimenting, it is important to me that my wife will always feel special about me.</li>
            <li> Smells very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Product is easy to use, haven&#x27;t rock solid results, but it does have a calming effect on my wife, which is a good thing</li>
            <li> , i did notice the women seem to be talking with me a lot more and were laughing at things i said that weren&#x27;t all that funny, i will put it to the test again and updated soon.</li>
            <li> Am interested in trying more of the product line, however.</li>
            <li> With the oil I but a ton of it on the first couple of days to make sure she would smell it</li>
            <li> I received this product and was excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li> All in all its pretty worthwhile.</li>
            <li> It helps you get noticed, and helps you me a better first impression.</li>
            <li> Yes, this stuff is pretty damn potent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> have noticed that women are more interested -</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I do feel like women are more willing to talk and engage me in conversation when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> At first i wasn&#x27;t sure on buying this product or not</li>
            <li> because this stuff is powerful!</li>
            <li> Judging from their reaction to me ,the ladies I meet seem to like it and the closer we get the more interested they become.</li>
            <li> but they are much friendly.  </li>
            <li> My first test was a very light application after shaving and after putting on a sweet song and dancing with my wife she fell into my arms.  </li>
            <li> The way Women react when wearing this product ranges from Very Friendly to even Having Hot Flashes.</li>
            <li> Second day, I was the most popular dude at a Halloween party... and &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; happened.</li>
            <li> Think positive and approach as many women as you can think to have.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> I had positive results, be it my added self-confidence, or pheromonal attraction, doesn&#x27;t matter, i put it on, i get more glances, and that&#x27;s all i need.    </li>
            <li> I soon realized that the scent wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> I have tested the product now for some weeks, using it in special occasions, and I must say that I have found a difference in the way women interacted with me.</li>
            <li> I like to put it on then work up a little sweat to get my own pheromones mixed and that seems to work best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with Pherx Pheromone Oil, this is the second bottle I have ordered.</li>
            <li> Would be good to get some directions on this going into the future.  </li>
            <li> but it is still almost full.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it make you more confident, women just seem to be more interested in you.</li>
            <li> Last for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- shipping&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had a good time with the ladies in the last couple weeks</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that the wife wants to be closer and more touchy feely with me.</li>
            <li> all the reviews here aren&#x27;t true and</li>
            <li> Not necessarily immediately, but at a good conversation&#x27;s pace they would gravitate toward me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a sincere and straight forward review, I recommend you read</li>
            <li> It smells good, but I  wouldn&#x27;t say that I would purchase a similar product again.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the product in full.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product and thought that the smell was very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The oil seems to retain the pheromone better than straight liquid as well.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product to use.</li>
            <li> I,f your ready for a elevation in your sexual exploration then step 1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a full range of response, and have IN FACT seen some results (&#x27;...</li>
            <li> They really turn their body towards you more and you can notice pupil dialation.  </li>
            <li> I have found it best works if you put at least two sprays on your neck and then ask a girl to dance with you.</li>
            <li> Somewhat like Cool Springs.</li>
            <li> I like the spray better because the oil comes out to fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting that pheromones can be responsible for all of this.</li>
            <li> this really work and ladies love it</li>
            <li> Nice smell, good for ordinary use&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have worn it several more times and have noticed that the ladies are much more friendly.</li>
            <li> Women sitting next to you will start noticing you more and act more friendly.</li>
            <li> It smells extremely pleasant and will go a long way.  </li>
            <li> but this is nice to apply to your pulse points easier and has a nice tight seal.  </li>
            <li> At first, it seems to have a strong musky scent, but it quickly fades away and the effects remain.</li>
            <li> I think the product has a really unique and rare smell.</li>
            <li> but I will certainly continue to use it !!  </li>
            <li> More recent purchase of your brand has been even better.</li>
            <li> will remain a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Secondly, they offered me a free product of choice, which I thought was nice</li>
            <li> A worthy investment...</li>
            <li> I have used pheromone products for years, and like many of you I have purchased many products that were essentially perfumed snake oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail today and after going to the local bar I noticed that I was much more interesting to ladies.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident but people and girls treat me the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure to become a steady customer..</li>
            <li> Definitely made me feel more confident after applying.  </li>
            <li> This product is authentic and not only will attract Women but will make you feel youthful and elegant.</li>
            <li> My order showed up quickly and seems to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Money better spent on a nice cologne in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The oil seems to to wear off somewhat quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The K9 test was positive every time, although the handler said the dog didn&#x27;t hit strong, and acted unsure about what it located.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did a bunch of research into reputable pheromone companies and decided to go with PherX, they&#x27;ve been around awhile and seem to have high standards for production.</li>
            <li> It does seem like they were more chatty than normal.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use my normal after-shave with it.</li>
            <li> they offered me a free product just for being a first time buyer.  </li>
            <li> a bit more in a \\&quot;familiar tone\\&quot; compared to the people before my turn and after, like if I was already a frequent customer,&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
            <li> and it is too early to say that works perfectly, but it has increased the attention of women when I go down the street.</li>
            <li> They will hit you with the free Pher x cologne spray just to get positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> The very first bottle I got a lots of nice compliments from people of different sexes.  </li>
            <li> Since wearing this people in bars are nicer to me, they buy me drinks, they start conversations with me and generally seem to be more friendly.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t get the vibe like he was gay, but it was like he was sort of fawning on me), then a girl I was trying to explain something about the machine I was working on was very antagonistic towards me, like I was intimidating to her,</li>
            <li> and I noticed a little more attention from women, it seems like it just makes them kind of giddy though.</li>
            <li> So far, this product as worked rather well, I notice more women turning their heads my way..</li>
            <li> def worth the money.</li>
            <li> The placebo effect is powerful guys</li>
            <li> but I feel like I got my moneys worth out of it.  </li>
            <li> This product is NOT going to improve your odds with women, however, it does smell nice, which is the reason I gave it an extra star.</li>
            <li> Its worth the price just for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a kinda cute woman in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Anything to tip the cards in my favor is worth it...</li>
            <li> Worth the try.</li>
            <li> The product itself worth the money.</li>
            <li> How could it possibly be worth it?&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> That alone is worth the 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Has a nice aroma and definitely gives you a confidence boost</li>
            <li> It has a nice aroma and definitely gives you a confidence boost.</li>
            <li> I will notice females would actually say you smell really nice</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost a full week first time</li>
            <li> All the ladies are more chatty, and the young ones become stalkers.</li>
            <li> It may work and maybe I need to give it more time or maybe my natural ability to repel women is just too powerful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product I was concerned about whether it was worth the cash.</li>
            <li> Is more psychological than the product itself, because you think you are attracting the opposite sex, makes you more confident and that self-assured makes you sexier.</li>
            <li> like the spray version because it delivers a nice solid burst which is plenty to apply.</li>
            <li> The times when I do not use PherX I can tell the difference, when I do use PherX women are more attentive towards me initiating eye contact and physical</li>
            <li> it is worth</li>
            <li> This product will get you the introduction, it won&#x27;t however get the female to rip your clothes off spontaneously and attack you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally sprayed it on my hand and ask a girl if she liked it</li>
            <li> its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Many products are heavily scented with perfumes that stand out on their own.  </li>
            <li> All in all its worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have found that while wearing this product women and men seem to be more open and engaging with me.  </li>
            <li> I hope everyone who buys this item has similiar success.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is just a fluke since I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but even if it doesn&#x27;t work, it still smells nice.</li>
            <li> I would need to have further testing to see if the product is really effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Which is rare luck for me.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy Old Spice Swagger works much better.</li>
            <li> So, my approach will probably be to stand next to the lady looking at the art and ask for her honest opinion about it.</li>
            <li> Works as good as - or better than - more expensive pheromone colognes out there.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I will continue my own personal research.</li>
            <li> Many people look at me as the old fat biker dude.</li>
            <li> Has a very inviting smell, always good for a big night.</li>
            <li> Worth a shot.</li>
            <li> this stuff is pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> But there attention is the most important part in getting your freak on later on.</li>
            <li> I currently do not know how effective it is</li>
            <li> As for how well it works, I haven&#x27;t been able to go out too much, but the confidence boost that I have really seems to work.</li>
            <li> Has a nice aroma and definitely gives you a confidence boost.</li>
            <li> I got a very positive response.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know whether its efficacy is dependent upon one&#x27;s unique body chemistry, but I certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> No, she doesn&#x27;t automatically turn into a raving sex maniac but she does seem more enthused about cuddling which, more often than not, ends up leading to other things.  </li>
            <li> Women seemed more friendly  and open.</li>
            <li> also this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it, and definitely have noticed women looking at me longer, and other signs of interest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so this is definitely one more foot in the door if a special girl you wanna get involved with..</li>
            <li> I will keep trying maybe just not going to the right places</li>
            <li> I suppose it could under the right circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yeah, that&#x27;s right this company made some 13 amazon accounts</li>
            <li> When I wear this I feel like I&#x27;m in that movie where everything seems to go right for you</li>
            <li> And that right there is textbook attraction.</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> I have honestly gotten laid more in the past two weeks of using this product than in the preceding two years.</li>
            <li> sells fine and mixes well with my normal cologne.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was at a party could tell the ladies were giving me much more attention and seemed to enjoy my company more than usual.  </li>
            <li> I get more attention from females, they notice me right away; and the very first, sometimes the second thing they say is &amp;#34;You smell</li>
            <li> On the very first uses of this product I observed an immediate, and positive,  response from women.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> try more and give a more complete review later</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great additive to your usual cologne.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I didn&#x27;t find that it lasts too long.</li>
            <li> I will test it again shortly, but for now I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is hard to be sure how effective this product is.</li>
            <li> It, at least in my case, makes ME feel more friendly and confident.</li>
            <li> Just started using it with my normal cologne and the females seem to be a bit more personable during normal conversations.</li>
            <li> As soon as I was near them, they all began laughing, smiling, talking about good times, and oddly enough one of my friends started running around and rolling on the floor.</li>
            <li> I went dancing and noticed that woman naturally leaned more toward me during dancing and keep talking to me throughout the whole songs making eye contact.  </li>
            <li> was talking loudly about how good someone smelled: I was next in line.  </li>
            <li> When I am at home, my wife will ask me to come here, and she will take deep sniffs lol, and say she likes it, (that is with only the pheromone oil on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first night I wore it women immediately noticed that my cologne smelled a little more appealing.</li>
            <li> It has a pretty robust smell and can easily be combined with many other colognes.</li>
            <li> ive also found when you wear it around women who aren&#x27;t whores they really want to talk to you and are very interested in you.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and fresh, and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Whether from its fragrant oil base or from its pheromone infusion, this product helps you to gain the right kind of attention, and if you&#x27;re completely honest with yourself, gaining the right kind of attention is why you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing this product in the first</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was very fast and arrived in two days with my prime account.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> The product appears to provide the desired effect as advertised, but I didn&#x27;t care for the oil mixture very much.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest when dancing close with that special someone or on dates</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried similar products before, and can say this one is light years beyond in terms of success rate!</li>
            <li> so I can have a smart and fun conversation at all times.  </li>
            <li> There were waves where she wouldnt even make eye contact and avoided me, but then other times she would walk over to me, look me right in the eyes, have a nice conversation, then lean up against me and talk nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product seems to really work!  </li>
            <li> If you need a bit more extra &amp;#34;persuasion&amp;#34; power, then give this a try.  </li>
            <li> I first tried the oil</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Like the first product I tried I can&#x27;t say women swooned when I walked by or engaged them in conversation.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed more smiles from the females, and a couple actually initiated conversations with me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thought maybe it might get me hot and bothered for the hubby.</li>
            <li> If I notice anything more I&#x27;ll come back and note it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been receiving more physical contact, like a flirtatious shove or a hand on my shoulder.</li>
            <li> and i will say I like the oil a lot better as it seems to last longer than the spray now it&#x27;s not going to &amp;</li>
            <li> Pher X is a aphrodisiac for the consumer, for after you experience the responses you can&#x27;t help but keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Within 24 hours, she initiated intimacy for the first time in weeks.</li>
            <li> , I wouldve rated this product higher..</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Regular Cologne and see how many complements or attention</li>
            <li> I have noticed a more female attention when I wear this product.</li>
            <li> (and I don&#x27;t want them to as I&#x27;m happily married)</li>
            <li> from first using it</li>
            <li> Another thing to keep in mind is to start on a lower &amp;#34;dose.&amp;#34; I used 2 drops the first time and varied that from 2 to 4.</li>
            <li> I noticed girls were inclined to enter my office regularly and seemed confident around me making it easier to speak with them and make a connection.</li>
            <li> This product has ruined my life , when I first bought the product I assumed it would help me earn the affection of the office hottie .</li>
            <li> IT IS LIQUID CURSE IN AN ADORABLE BLUE JAR .</li>
            <li> it smelled funny.</li>
            <li> but it will definitely make you more approachable.  </li>
            <li> my first review I received an offer from the manufacturer stating that if I promised to review it, they would send me another product of my choice at no cost.</li>
            <li> but I am interested in buying some pheromones.  </li>
            <li> Some are just this product like the big one at the top that 27 people found helpful.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, so far I didn&#x27;t feel anything dramatically happened but the relationship between people around me got smooth.</li>
            <li> I was asked too lunch by a woman I have be interested in.</li>
            <li> It definitely causes you to get more attention</li>
            <li> First day it worked.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over apply the product as it may overpower and intimidate some with the physical, sexual emotions triggered.</li>
            <li> In my first try it seemed to work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not shy, I have no problem talking with women.  </li>
            <li> These are the first I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> They also indicate that it can be expected to be effective at a distance of three to five feet.  </li>
            <li> and I actually like it better than the spray.</li>
            <li> Got laid first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I love playing and mixing essential oils, so I thought it might be interesting to add PherX into my personal mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was like she noticed me for the first time or something.  </li>
            <li> If pheromones remove the bias we have towards pretty faces / bodies, this may level the playing field for both men and women.    </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product.</li>
            <li> First time using the oil of PherX</li>
            <li> I felt was interested in me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> what you will notice during a conversation is that they are more willing to open up to you.</li>
            <li> , I had hoped for a somewhat more obvious response.</li>
            <li> The first day wearing this, a woman struck up conversation with me, and we now have a date set for tomorrow.</li>
            <li> The first night I put it on and made no advances to her.</li>
            <li> First time wearing it ended up grabbing a girl I&#x27;ve been trying to holler at for a while.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time today and everyone I interacted with seemed to be more talkative especially the women.</li>
            <li> But this product gives me consistent results in a close proximity setting.</li>
            <li> I sense if they are interested or not based on their responses.  </li>
            <li> And the first time I used it</li>
            <li> The first time I put this on I noticed the effects.</li>
            <li> Spoke with a woman in a department store and already have a date with her after the first try.</li>
            <li> and I will most likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This product definitely gets you more looks and attention.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post more later after i use it a while</li>
            <li> Wonder if they try to get you the first time do you will get hook</li>
            <li> hell one lady even bought me a drink that&#x27;s a first for</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten any stares but one girl is starting to be around me more.</li>
            <li> I first used this product on a day that I was flying.  </li>
            <li> I actually felt like I was getting more attention when I was first used this product.</li>
            <li> I do tend to feel very uplifted when I wear it, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t used it for that being married and all.</li>
            <li> However, while giving you confidence on the day you&#x27;re wearing it, your confidence in the day you&#x27;re not will drop to-9000 so my only advice is considering this before you buy it :)</li>
            <li> The first day wearing it</li>
            <li> I finally was able to get to my mailbox to obtain my package(mail room was locked).  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying this product.  </li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Definitely noticing a difference:)</li>
            <li> Shipping was on time, exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> Smells exactly like tea tree oil and doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> This is a lot more viscus than the spray version, but has the same effect.</li>
            <li> i received many different compliments about me.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind, it is fun and flattering.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from the actual smell of this (musk?</li>
            <li> It MAY give you a slight edge to get them interested, but you still have to able to talk to them comfortably to close the deal so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Had only one positive experience w/ wife being more affectionate.</li>
            <li> Have noticed more positive female attention when wearing.</li>
            <li> Maybe because it doesnt have the nice smell the other has.</li>
            <li> I have bought my 2nd bottle and it last pretty good.</li>
            <li> I liked the way the PherX mixes with other fragrances.</li>
            <li> First time I used it I got some unusual attention from my female friend (touching, hugging,and kissing)</li>
            <li> Product came earlier than expected and was in great packaging.</li>
            <li> You also might want to mix it with your favorite cologne to make it less concentrated and give it a smell thats more natural for you.</li>
            <li> : As it&#x27;s oil based, initially it&#x27;s a bit greasy feeling, but than it remain only a good smell and no stains or anything else...</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty nice but for the price it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> ok so i get this tiny little bottle of overpriced goop and put some on the places I would imagine it might be effective while in reality not having a clue.</li>
            <li> The very first time I tried this I got a very unexpected Kiss, I have to tell you that Yes this works.  </li>
            <li> neither have I received any positive remarks.  </li>
            <li> and I have had positive results with people around me.</li>
            <li> but it definitely positively influences your psychology, which attracts women.</li>
            <li> Though I have a girlfriend and do not go out looking for stray women, I did notice positive attention after wearing this product.</li>
            <li> Not any type of holy grail, but it appears to have a positive effect on any women nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kept a positive attitude, but nothing at all</li>
            <li> (let&#x27;s call them) positive results.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on positive reviews on youtube.</li>
            <li> I encountered \\&quot;positive</li>
            <li> I found this product to have positive effect on females.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely gets you noticed, it doesn&#x27;t make you Hugh Hefner but definitely makes women more comfortable around you.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;It has a very settle smell, but smells really nice\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> First day, every girl at the office seemed much nicer.</li>
            <li> Definitely need more tries to know for sure.</li>
            <li> This the first thing to attract women absolutely.</li>
            <li> But this stuff to be honest smells like sour ass with a squeeze of lemon.</li>
            <li> The stuffs smells pretty good but doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long.</li>
            <li> Addendum:  Purchased a small bottle with a roller ball head, this made for a good applicator.  </li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s a young hot bartender, who wouldn&#x27;t!), but last night she paid a lot more attention to me, and I wasn&#x27;t tipping exceptionally well or anything out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> Not to come off as cocky or condescending to anyone, but logically speaking the best candidates would be those with less confidence, etc, to begin with.  </li>
            <li> If you use this stuff and think it works, you&#x27;re being fooled by placebo effect, which means your feeling that the product works is imaginary, not due to the product actually being effective.</li>
            <li> : The product has a gentle smell that I personally like, and I assume the women also like it as much, but I definitely gives a lot of self confidence as you are good smelling fella.</li>
            <li> Not sure that i really notice any real effects when wearing this oil, but it does smell pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The most important thing was the smell really created a calm environment for everyone that I deal with or being close to, I mean proximity.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it several times on clean skin and regular colognes better</li>
            <li> A very decent purchase.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this company, especially since their customer service is very reliable and respectful.  </li>
            <li> This snake oil should be called Pure Placebo for Men</li>
            <li> I have been using it for certain occasions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nexus pheromones, pherlure, ice breaker, and pure instinct.</li>
            <li> , however I certainly can&#x27;t complain about the results (whether they were driven by the product or not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It certainly seems to work.</li>
            <li> I bartend so have been able to see a lot more women than your average guy in a short amount of time and women of all ages, shapes, marital status, etc.</li>
            <li> This product is totally different and you will notice that from the first time use through a lot of smiles, speaking softly, laughing and getting more close to you.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on and couldn&#x27;t even smell it, but had several women comment on the nice smell from a distance of more than 6 feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure it works yet, but I shall continue to try in hopes that I&#x27;m jumped by women as they loose their minds and give into their primal instincts.</li>
            <li> In less than a week is working good so far</li>
            <li> Considering Thallium costs half as much and REALLY smells amazing, I do not think I will repurchase the cologne.</li>
            <li> Like I said before, be realistic and be the one that says &amp;#34;hello&amp;#34; first.</li>
            <li> From her reaction with it the first time I applied it to the points, this ought to have a decent effect on others as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just put a little bit on and you will smell amazing.</li>
            <li> This was a nice little experiment of mine.</li>
            <li> Many other reviews claim a sweet aroma, but as far as I can tell there is no smell to it.    </li>
            <li> They get very friendly and don&#x27;t want to turn loose.</li>
            <li> If it would \\&quot;spice things up\\&quot; a little more with my wife and (2) since I&#x27;m in sales, to see if it would make my female customers buy more.  </li>
            <li> so I could maybe give the product a second shot, but after promising me a free product THEY NEVER SENT IT OUT.</li>
            <li> Actually ahd a co worker that went out of her way to lean into me and take a huge smell.</li>
            <li> I waited until I finished using the whole bottle to write this review.</li>
            <li> This item really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product was something I wanted to test out on my wife and to see if it would really work.  </li>
            <li> I contacted amazon they gave me an instant refund and a free return shipping.</li>
            <li> To see if it really works I let my brother use it for a date, keep in mind</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very observant, and looking for something to stand out as a noticeable change from women.</li>
            <li> Is it really a pheromones ?</li>
            <li> Really like this.....</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t seal the deal, but I did seem to have women interested in me that normally I would think they wouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> Maybe there is really something about this.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t really need to apply too much.</li>
            <li> really works</li>
            <li> Absolutely impressive!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she want to spent more time with me.</li>
            <li> : Cheap presentation (Label/Plastic bottle and initial protective wrap).</li>
            <li> Its probably an oil based solution mixed with a cheap fragrance.</li>
            <li> but it look promising.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a bottle of the spray PherX and the company contacted me saying I could try out a different product of theirs free of charge</li>
            <li> (I might have had to keep reapplying it), but it served its purpose very well for me.</li>
            <li> This product really does work - don&#x27;t expect it to do all the work, but I&#x27;ve noticed a substantial increase in playful touches, attention and interest from girls,</li>
            <li> But I have no game</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased real pheromones before</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the oil application compared to the spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Really attracts attention.</li>
            <li> The oil itself has a very distinctive smell that I like as a cologne, though I do use body spray as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from the product in the beginning</li>
            <li> This product makes initiating conversation a bit easier and is so far worth what it costs.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me and my skin type who knows but this product really did not  do anything for me</li>
            <li> Oil dispenses very well.</li>
            <li> and I believe it is working really well.</li>
            <li> This product really works for me .</li>
            <li> Works very well as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was really close to, they did not notice, either.  </li>
            <li> It really really works I&#x27;m buying it again</li>
            <li> It really didnt do anything for me,  </li>
            <li> I am yet to find that product that really works in thT dept.</li>
            <li> Really need the help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I think it really works ?</li>
            <li> testing the chemical to see if it really works</li>
            <li> The applicator on the oil bottle is poorly designed and if you put your fingertip on the top of the bottle then use it like you would any cologne you will get almost nothing out of the bottle, you have to be a bit creative and aggressive with the oil bottle to get any reasonable amount out.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> She was unusually flirty with me - even to the point of staying and buying me shots after her shift was over.</li>
            <li> Depending on the use and how much you put on.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> He has also noticed a real difference at work.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend absolutely loves the smell and always asks me what cologne I wear.</li>
            <li> but it really does.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> product doesn&#x27;t really have much of a scent, per se.  </li>
            <li> I really like the results this oil gave me.</li>
            <li> Will update if any real changes are noticed.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> Looks like Pherox really knows what they are doing.</li>
            <li> this product is a straight out lie.  </li>
            <li> Overall however I do enjoy wearing the product.</li>
            <li> The shipping from Zyloo Labs was fast.  </li>
            <li> the representative is very considerate and helpful.</li>
            <li> It worked really well the the cologne I bought.</li>
            <li> And often, I don&#x27;t get any real interest from them.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really tell if it works yet</li>
            <li> She said \\&quot;don&#x27;t know what it is, I was really in the mood.</li>
            <li> It is very helpful with my wife..</li>
            <li> i feel her very dfferent since i  started to use this product..</li>
            <li> I think a person has to be really close over an extended period for the effects to really be noticeable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from women telling me I smell very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> lady&#x27;s really don&#x27;t pay attention to me.</li>
            <li> It is really intense on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So they may come very close to you like hypnotized</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wasn&#x27;t a terribly big fan of the smell (at least in the bottle), but she liked it a lot better when it was on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s cheap enough, give it a try..</li>
            <li> I really WANTED this to work...</li>
            <li> Too much seems to cancel the response you are looking for.</li>
            <li> this product worked very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Too much cologne can effect it.</li>
            <li> But after that day, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in how people react to me...</li>
            <li> This Product really does work.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really comment on getting dates or anything</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re ready</li>
            <li> Either way, thanks.</li>
            <li> because getting women has never been a real challenge.</li>
            <li> and i dont see much difference using it or not using it</li>
            <li> Whether that is from the scent or the confidence boost is really up in the air, but either way it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> It really seems to work.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t got the chance to really \\&quot;use\\</li>
            <li> This product has an ok/pleasant smell until you get really close.</li>
            <li> But I really didn&#x27;t expect too much.  </li>
            <li> I am adding a few drops to an unscented stick deodorant, The first drop came out fine, then about 6 or 7 drops ran out quickly.  </li>
            <li> I will have to wait a day or two for the oil to soak into the deodorant as this was too much.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put on too much.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain too much</li>
            <li> you so much.</li>
            <li> I will be testing this frequently and will report back as I accumulate more &amp;#34;data.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Women sit up straighter when I come near them, and even men are more talkative and open to what I&#x27;m saying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so that seemed nice, an hour later another female co worker asked for my help</li>
            <li> At least, it smells good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure if these kind of products really function like they should!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really about using their sense of smell, drawing them in and making them more curious about you.  </li>
            <li> This is the second pheromone oil I have used, as by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> When used with my regular cologne, it seemed to blend nice enough.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle , pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was willing to try a new scent.</li>
            <li> It seemed like I was getting a few more second looks than normal, and conversations seemed to be started more by the women I would run into rather than me having to initiate it.</li>
            <li> When asked about it, the majority of them said even though they &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; a curious reaction about us at that particular time, they knew it was a test, but that they also notice a difference from time to time in most men.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes by as many as 30 women at a time (The others had murdered each other in an effort to get a turn)</li>
            <li> I felt a significant difference after starting to use this product.</li>
            <li> I wore it yesterday, and had a better overall confidence and general reaction from women seemed to be very favorable and receptive.</li>
            <li> but it does make other see myself as more intimidating</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I used a similar one in the past and was also happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> I usually cannot stand regular cologne, this one is great.</li>
            <li> In my opinion I think it works, it helps women talk and be more active with you in person</li>
            <li> At least the first bottle did smell nice when I smell it.  </li>
            <li> I have given this product a 5 out of 5, based upon my success while using the product and no other factors.</li>
            <li> All of them had decent and some better than other results.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping - Came not to my house, but to my po box which surprised me as I used my house address for shipping.  </li>
            <li> Certainly women don&#x27;t drop their pants, but you definitely receive more attention and physical contact.</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly and although I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days, I seem to notice favorable results, and find the smell pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised to find this work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I will add this, today i sprayed a bit more then usual on and the girls at the office were a bit more friendly then usual, complementing me on how i dress, etc...</li>
            <li> Oh and as for the smell, its a nice and not overwhelming like a lot of colognes.</li>
            <li> the time of use is pretty early to tell whether or not this works.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant fairly subtle smell that my girlfriend likes, but I have not noticed more attraction from her or any other woman so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the product or my own bump in confidence, but it seems to help.</li>
            <li> Usually women like to attract men by showing their beauty and their nice body and let men burn</li>
            <li> I highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;this to anyone that needs a extra boost in their confidence.&lt;br /&gt;it really does open the guys more, and girls seem to react&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have even purposely put a fresh spray on before going to speak with certain folks (female) and they seem to perk up after I get close.</li>
            <li> After opening noticed that more than half of the bottle leaked out during shipping.</li>
            <li> a handsome fellow as is with slight confidence issues, and no effect.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible product,&lt;br /&gt;Misleading label.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Smells slightly floral with a.. Sophisticated undertone.</li>
            <li> Nothing more nothing less.</li>
            <li> Using the oil seems more discreet and less smelly than a spray.</li>
            <li> and then you will buy more that is when they send you the less quality ones?</li>
            <li> She is somewhat less resistant to my advances and she is eager to spend more time with me.</li>
            <li> Have realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li> I had a female coworker I had been trying to date start hitting on me a lot more after starting to use this.</li>
            <li> And does a decent job boosting confidence too.</li>
            <li> as i kept explaining what was wrong with her laptop, she just kept asking more and more questions, like she wanted to keep smelling me</li>
            <li> I particularly like this one, it lasts longer than the spray form and the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li> One woman in particular.</li>
            <li> I was not too sure if this product would work, but it definitely attracts the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> It came in a big yellow envelope and was wrapped in packaging bubbles, which did the job as it arrived safely..</li>
            <li> Seems to be a decent product.  </li>
            <li> This is only day one, I&#x27;ll come back and update this after some more experience.</li>
            <li> Not only do more women notice me, but they actually seem compelled to start a conversation with me as well.</li>
            <li> alright and the price is decent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just received the product but, so far the results have been better than expected.</li>
            <li> My purpose for getting this is because I&#x27;m older and Wanted something to pick up my spirits.  </li>
            <li> If so, I better start acting like a badass, because I obviously am or I wouldn&#x27;t produce those chemicals&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> so I may come back and change my review if I get better results in the future.</li>
            <li> Our jobs take us into office buildings routinely, so that was our main test.  </li>
            <li> Im choosing 5 stars because this actually works.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my boyfriend the very first night i</li>
            <li> Price is too high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend PherX.</li>
            <li> Not that the attention is at all &amp;#34;naughty&amp;#34; in nature, rather, I seem to be garnering high esteem from colleagues, acquaintances, and management.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> my high recommendation.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> they were highly upset with me.  </li>
            <li> This product smells good and would probably last a very long time even with regular use.</li>
            <li> I invite you to try PherX a way to earn a little more attention.</li>
            <li> they are a little more receptive.</li>
            <li> i love this little bottle</li>
            <li> Most of the time I wave my hand a little to catch their attention.</li>
            <li> and it seems to add to her pleasure, bringing out a little more desire for her part.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an interesting little scenario, using this stuff.</li>
            <li> Just trying to get my wife to be a little more responsive.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it as an enhancing additive to your normal cologne.</li>
            <li> I easily meet other people so my nature might have something to do with the way others relate to me.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t strong, but goes well with my other colognes.</li>
            <li> Other brands I have tried either smell too strong or have no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wish the oil had a dropper for better application other than that it works!!</li>
            <li> work, people dont mention it anymore, but one person (female) in particular, asked me right away about what&lt;br /&gt;cologne</li>
            <li> 18 year old son wants to start using it.</li>
            <li> behavior at the gym was nothing beyond my normal behavior.</li>
            <li> Not sure which will be good or if they even actually work yet.  </li>
            <li> Did get a few more hellos than normal.</li>
            <li> Sometimes yes they will come up to you, but when you have to go up to the women, it will make the success rate as close to 100% as possible.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, so too much will have the exact opposite effect from what you&#x27;re looking for and will make you seem too aggressive and daunting.  </li>
            <li> They normally respond.  </li>
            <li> Even though the smell doesn&#x27;t last a long time, (about an hour or two) it does give me more confidence.</li>
            <li> I worn it a few times, and notice a more relaxed and talkative demeanor from some women.</li>
            <li> It is better for the man to keep away from women and let them do the first step or at least a sign.</li>
            <li> but I was just to edgy for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I had some success with members of the opposite sex</li>
            <li> I got more then kissing results on the first date, and get another second date with a different girl the next night!!!</li>
            <li> and you will get a few more glances and touches.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s claimed that since he started using it women have been approaching him more frequently, with the majority acting coquettishly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a semi-above average attractive guy I&#x27;ve been told multiple times, but have been on team single for quite some time now.</li>
            <li> At work, I did notice that one of the girls I work with was much more talkative than usual (not usually the case) and she would stand really close to me.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s only if you put your nose right there.</li>
            <li> have used it four times since I got it , and not only have I not noticed absolutely any positive impact, but twice it has made me dizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oil by itself has a very light smell, so I use some expensive imported oil as my primary scent.</li>
            <li> its cool knowing you have a secret upper hand on the women where they dont even know why they are more attracted and interested in you.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried the product, my wife out of the blue became more aggressive and actually apologized for neglecting me for so long.  </li>
            <li> I was promised a free bottle  of something or other for writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a couple of drops on my neck and wrist, add some of the regular cologne I normally wear, and I&#x27;m ready to go; and I really can tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;this one make a  new issue to my look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my new aroma (oil).</li>
            <li> I will say that it does give a sense of new confidence which makes it easier to break the ice with new people.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Pheromone products.  </li>
            <li> well i believe they live on another planet.</li>
            <li> Even after a stressful day moving and unloading into our new house, she was eager to jump on me and \\&quot;get it on\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s new and I like it</li>
            <li> Thank you for creating this product,it seems like a new me</li>
            <li> It is less oily and easy to apply, but a bit watery</li>
            <li> It lasts a few hours, so be sure to apply before you go out, and not too early in the day, or reapply as needed.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit on the subtle side, but I suppose that is kind of the</li>
            <li> i went into a Marshalls and some Carribean older lady from Brooklyn damn near gave me her panties.  </li>
            <li> You still need to be sharp and clean as well as have the right lines to keep them engaged in the conversation to move further.</li>
            <li> I have not seen my wife be this sexy in a long, long time!</li>
            <li> This oil-based formula has the same fragrance but a little lighter (maybe less volatile), so you could probably use more of it if you&#x27;re looking for more effect, without smelling like you bathe in cologne.</li>
            <li> I mean, I like to think i&#x27;m a good enough looking dude</li>
            <li> I had a young lady walk up to me and stand right next to me and seemed to wait for my command.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I’m not very sure about the “power of attraction” toward women as it really varies depending on the situation and circumstances, and that’s the reason I want to try it one more time!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was working at first, but as soon as everyone left the elevator she lunged at me.</li>
            <li> Also the woman in the office like to chat more time than the usual when I am using this, it is not like they are going to be over you</li>
            <li> first and foremost, it definitely gave me confidence.</li>
            <li> I just finished the first bottle and decided to order a second one as I would like to give it another try.</li>
            <li> Definitely not something if wear while on a night out with a significant other simply due to the amount of &amp;#34;googly eyes&amp;#34; just my opinion :) hope this helps</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure it has been getting him any more noticed by women at all.</li>
            <li> My first use of it was in a heavily female oriented environment.</li>
            <li> Much better price than other similar products I have used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;;) I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Well first off the hole in the spout is big</li>
            <li> I went out tonight and seemed to attact much more attention than I have in the past..</li>
            <li> Wonder why the first purchase always work but not the later.  </li>
            <li> and I usually end up with more than I need.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough to really determine it&#x27;s effectiveness!</li>
            <li> But when I start seeing more of a difference I will add on to this review to let other possible buyers know.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review for the water-based cologne version of this product recently, so you if you&#x27;re interested you can read my fuller response to PherX products there.</li>
            <li> but then exactly the same day that i used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a short balding little troll who will never be confused with George Clooney, but with this product, I get more than my fair share of attention in the workplace.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very mild and I can&#x27;t say that I personally notice it after the first few minutes of applying it.  </li>
            <li> Instructions on the bottle were pretty clear and I started using it in the very same day.  </li>
            <li> Women that you usually don&#x27;t talk to actually show interest and all nice to you.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been married over 25 years and with of us both having busy jobs and lives and after droping weight over the last two years and hitting the gym 5 days a week wasn&#x27;t getting her interest peaking again</li>
            <li> So far this is my second time receiving this product, the first time it was given to me as a gift for me to try out.</li>
            <li> So far I have been wearing it at the office which is usually where I deal with the most women during the day.</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased this product and have already had positive results.</li>
            <li> I can only surmise that from the positive comments on here that the guys that bought this BELIEVE it works.</li>
            <li> Never really had that happen to me in the past dealing with attractive female servers from restaurants before using this product.  </li>
            <li> It got their attention, but after that it was up to us to keep them interested.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to single out one particular woman didn&#x27;t do much, andworked better when a small group was gathered for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not usually lack for much attention from females, but I have definitely seen an increase in interest.</li>
            <li> This is a simple math, easy to test with the opposite sex in an open conversation, ask your sisters or brothers someone that it won’t have any interest in you, and ask them is the smell makes them fill attracted to you.</li>
            <li> did seem to help she said i smelled good and little by little as night went on</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t say for certain if it is just the fact that my confidence is a bit improved wearing it or if it actually draws females in, but something about it works.</li>
            <li> It is designed, as pure pheromone solutions should be, to be detected subconsciously.</li>
            <li> I may even say women seem less friendly while wearing this stuff.</li>
            <li> If her mind is elsewhere, thinking of more stressful thinking, the last thing she&#x27;s going to think about is a little hanky-panky.  </li>
            <li> Had more glances and longer held looks from my spouse, but hard to say whether this would be on account of the oil or the layered scent over.</li>
            <li> The effect usually can be noticed on older women more than younger ones.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product if your normal romantic endevors haven&#x27;t been working with your partner.</li>
            <li> Have yet to try it in a different setting ie bar or club or other more social setting to see a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small amounts usually work better huge amounts...</li>
            <li> My fiancé loves this stuff but he doesn&#x27;t use it to attract women clearly but for the testerone.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested the product for variety of conditions yet, but I have seen a clear effect on my girl-friend.</li>
            <li> but it only works if you REALLY believe.</li>
            <li> I think as far as &amp;#34;attracting women&amp;#34;, you don&#x27;t get women gravitating towards you or anything like that.  </li>
            <li> lightly spritzed it on and also heavily applied</li>
            <li> I used this product in public places which I never knew before the women and approached gently, spoke politely,offered some drinks</li>
            <li> , is scented oil do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve gone out with a girl in two occasions one with the product applied and another with out, so far I have seen no change.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the scent itself does anything to me directly, but</li>
            <li> but as far as I am concerned at the end of the day...</li>
            <li> but my reasoning was trying to get that old spark going again in my marriage</li>
            <li> I must admit that I have always gotten attention from women through the years, but lately the flirting has been a lot more unapologetic and deliberate.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised by how &#x27;motivated&#x27; my girlfriend seemed to be when I had put some on.</li>
            <li> and the pharmacist was acting like a schoolgirl being really flirty</li>
            <li> BUT at close rage I have noticed a considerable amount of women do ask about it and do get close</li>
            <li> but i do feel better about my chances when i use it so at least that part of things helps.</li>
            <li> I cannot smell anything even with my nose near the opened bottle.</li>
            <li> As far as this product making me irresistible to woman; well, I still seem to be quite resistible which is in no way a reflection of this company.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> As far as smell goes, I couldn&#x27;t detect any fragrance just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Unless you count the 4 dogs that would try to mount me whenever I&#x27;d wear this stuff - ALL MALE and VERY DETERMINED.&lt;br /&gt;I used the remaining on Sadie, my dog -</li>
            <li> I place a drop or two on my finger and rub it directly on my skin in areas of my body that “stink”, and by that</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, and wow.</li>
            <li> So far, I have seen a difference on how my wife looks at me.  </li>
            <li> I sneaked it on without telling my wife and noticed a wild look in her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its scent is the same as \\&quot;normal\\&quot; Pherx, but the effect lasts and lasts, and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite simply, it does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Would not waste my money on this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Whether the pheromones are actually working</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe pheromones out of a bottle would work vs the pheromone we naturally produce.</li>
            <li> From my experience the oil seems to last much longer than spray pheromones.</li>
            <li> so far i am not seeing the results i was hoping for</li>
            <li> and I am not reviewing as such, however I was much more&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is what I can tell so far.  </li>
            <li> and i was very pleasantly surprised with the outcome.</li>
            <li> I tell you what I am a 50 year old 20lbs.</li>
            <li> so the conscious mind still in control.</li>
            <li> Also know that women learnt since they were young to suppress their feelings and suppress their unconscious mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It last longer on you and you don&#x27;t go through the bottle as fast.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old and have had not-so-active time with my spouse.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far it seems to have worked 4 out of the 5 times I have used it with my wife of 40 years.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> And with having kids under 6 years old, well, you get the picture.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a far fetched idea on paper, but thought I would give it a shot based on the posted reviews.  </li>
            <li> got this product out of curiosity, 2 friends of mine have used it and said they couldn&#x27;t tell the difference as far drawing the ladies attention/interest to themselves.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to make females notice you as far as i can tell so far</li>
            <li> received the product earlier than estimated delivery date (thanks).</li>
            <li> I just received the oil and tried it today when I went to the store and it must work because every woman in the store that I was near was smiling at me.this stuff</li>
            <li> worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> It must be mixed with your favorilte lotion or cologne, just a  few drops will do it, make sure you use ite 2 hours beacuse</li>
            <li> far as efficacy, I seem to get more lovin lately from the Mrs.</li>
            <li> I have only worn this product out a few times, and it seems to get me more attention from women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other pheromones,  this one is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> especially anyone you are sitting right next to.</li>
            <li> The oil by itself is quite mild, I am not sure how much of an affect it would have by itself.</li>
            <li> As long as your expectations are realistic and not ridiculous, I would recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> I use other pheromone based oils and colognes, and I think those are better, but also more expensive.  </li>
            <li> As other users reported, ladies would not jump over you but the substance did made them to be more open to conversation and be closer to you with constant smiles.  </li>
            <li> but you know what I mean:)))</li>
            <li> I really like the way this stuff smells and it pairs really well with other fragrances.</li>
            <li> Small package, easy to carry in pocket etc.</li>
            <li> I attribute my getting a new job, getting laid, and making a bunch of new friends in the last couple of weeks to the effects of this product and the affect it has on me.</li>
            <li> I actually like this much better because it draws people in easier, rather then just making them highly aroused wich can accutally backfire because they are afraid of loosing control and avoid me more in daytime social situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is not worth it for the price; I won’t pay more than $10.00 as a simple regular perfume, nothing else.</li>
            <li> I tried it another time out in public and noticed more stares than usual...</li>
            <li> Both give off a decent scent, but the oil definitely smells a bit stronger then the spray.</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t noticed the more extreme reactions described by some other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s best to wear it with cologne as I guess it would be difficult to smell or sense the pheromones.</li>
            <li> I tried this product being a little sceptical, but after trying it i&#x27;m a true believer.  </li>
            <li> next morning, my wife was definitely more &amp;#34;friendly&amp;#34;, maybe partly because my attitude was a little different, also.  </li>
            <li> Actually smells better than my regular cologne, leaves hands feeling a little greasy however</li>
            <li> Have used product only 3 days &amp; noticed a positive difference in the amount of conversation I receive from different women.</li>
            <li> and she really warmed up even during a very stressful time when I would have expected the opposite.</li>
            <li> ( normally this specific co worker never talks)</li>
            <li> The third night I put some on and made advances which she eagerly accepted, but that is normal.</li>
            <li> My results are not any different than my normal night out  that i can tell .</li>
            <li> I tried before a similar product, but only this gave me the results that I expected, thanks!!!.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; version is best used for dabbing a little behind the ears or any other location where you want precision in placing it.  </li>
            <li> may ask the spouse to go with me to a club sometime in order to test reaction of other females in the room (purely scientific, of course!).  </li>
            <li> After using it for only a few days, I&#x27;ve noticed that my female co-workers seem to be more friendly than usual.</li>
            <li> Very poor and very watery the spray is far better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once on New years eve and forgot I had even put it on.</li>
            <li> They will also not make up for lack of grooming, lack of hygiene or a complete lack of social skills.  </li>
            <li> They will also not make up for lack of grooming, lack of hygiene or a complete lack of social skills.  </li>
            <li> The third bottle I just recently purchased can&#x27;t be compared to my very bottle because I did not smell anything.  </li>
            <li> nothing beats the gym and maintenance to how you look ...though this product is light especially when you don&#x27;t wanna over do it with a heavy cologne...</li>
            <li> A female acquaintance kept leaning against me, doing one of those &amp;#34;i&#x27;m tired, support me&amp;#34; kind of deals.</li>
            <li> During our evening, my fiancé seemed to be a little bit friskier and when we went to bed that night she was a more passionate than she had been recently.  </li>
            <li> Its works a little on the first try and may use in the future to really see what it can do.</li>
            <li> I went to meet up with a very old female friend of mine and her friend</li>
            <li> several days I noticed female friends, co-workers, dance partners and even acquaintances were finding reasons to be near me or stay longer than normal to chat.</li>
            <li> This is the second pheromone oil I have tried recently, the first being Arouse RX extra stregnth which I love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as other women around me and in my life, coworkers seem to be just as friendly as usual, although I have to admit that I&#x27;m not paying very close attention to them as I do my spouse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple weeks now and have used it in various situations, both social and a little more personal, and it has definitely made a difference.</li>
            <li> Not even the slight scent that is present upon putting it on but quickly disappears.  </li>
            <li> The pheromone is subtle at first but after using it a few times I have noticed a pattern and that I&#x27;m getting a lot more attention.</li>
            <li> The evenings were also tested, in restaurants and bars/clubs.&lt;br /&gt;We also had access to a K9 trained to locate missing people.&lt;br /&gt;Our individual notes, showed a little over half of the women, both in the offices and in clubs, reacted more friendly when we had the attractant on.&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li> Wore it to office the other day and could feel the positive effects immideatley.</li>
            <li> I put this on and I can clearly notice the extra attention I get.</li>
            <li> So far I asked my female coworkers what they thought of the smell</li>
            <li> I have used it only a couple of times so far and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for two days.so far nothing</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell the only noticeable effect is darn near &amp;#34;point blank&amp;#34; (about one foot or less).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Response may depend a lot on the female inhaling the pheromones.  </li>
            <li> Now, my brother is a college student, so he&#x27;s around young ladies constantly.</li>
            <li> that don&#x27;t normally speak to me at work are now coming around and starting conversations out of the blue.</li>
            <li> I like this product..because it is subtle in application but strong on responsiveness from women.</li>
            <li> I like the oil application much better than the spray because I can control the amount and place it on a pulse point like behind my ear.</li>
            <li> (i.e., this isn&#x27;t going to be traumatic for anyone you share an elevator with, even if you were a bit more liberal than dabbing it behind your ears).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It boosted my confidence&lt;br /&gt;I seemed to have better luck with women, false perception or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When my romancing options seemed to be eliciting a weak response I ordered this to see if I could get my wife a little more &#x27;interested&#x27; in me.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived right on time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> I have not had much luck with getting all the attention as claimed by other users however,  </li>
            <li> but it really does not work other than that.</li>
            <li> Smells good, science is behind it, and does seem to work a little.</li>
            <li> just to be clear, there is no actual smell of this product, I simply apply with my cologne.</li>
            <li> The academic literature regarding human pheromones doesn&#x27;t say that that you&#x27;ll be swimming in men/women; rather, the effects are more subtle and subconscious (and aren&#x27;t all about having sex; calming effects, etc).</li>
            <li> the social network.</li>
            <li> there are fake reviews floating around, but in my experience this oil works to make women much more relaxed inviting and slightly sexually aroused.</li>
            <li> it isnt a miracle item though, you still have to possess social skills to develop a relationship with someone.</li>
            <li> It could simply be the confidence of my &#x27;secret weapon&#x27;, but in any case, I&#x27;m highly satisfied with my experience in using this product.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say but as far as I was able to tell this product has no effect on women.</li>
            <li> Black, brown hair women usually have more effect on them than blonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in trying a pheromone product for several years now after watching a show on tv where they used hidden cameras and demonstrated in a scientific experiment that pheromones can increase your attractiveness to women or men depending on your preference.</li>
            <li> I believe this product was made to help a husband give his wife that little extra, and in my case anyway, it certainly did!  </li>
            <li> However as far as an &amp;#34;attractant&amp;#34; as the product is pitched, only one female (out of about 50 test subjects) actually responded with what you&#x27;d indicate as &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But she could barely walk when she left.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure it is worth the cost they are charging.</li>
            <li> Received  product  few days ago  waiting for something to happen been married 30yrs.</li>
            <li> i like that people are now a little more friendlier then usual.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it does anything at all, but doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell so can be worn with other cologne.</li>
            <li> This has a really subtle and clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I find it really has a slight easing quality to it.</li>
            <li> I like it so far, only wore it once, but strange women stopped to talk to me at the grocery store and the hardware store.</li>
            <li> Oil-base means that it&#x27;s around for the full day and at least my nose can detect it over 24 hours later.  </li>
            <li> It usually works, but if it doesn&#x27;t work for you in some situations, at least you smell nice.</li>
            <li> However it seemed to be noticed by only that particular person, no change in the other three individuals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really raises a red flag when all the negative reviewers have a long history of reviews both good and bad from unrelated products while the positive ones are this product and</li>
            <li> its very subtle yet very stimulating,  it was delivered very fast..</li>
            <li> This product has a subtle sweet smell, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t even try, it&#x27;s really cool, and I&#x27;m being serious now...</li>
            <li> I tried to be exact pick-up-artist and my targets are average beauty,normal people not high class.</li>
            <li> Just a little contact seems to release it again, which can be a real plus if you use it wisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very sceptic about use anything like this, but when I do put it on I see a little of a different reaction from women</li>
            <li> I usually try it before things like job interviews, work social events, etc., and it seems to have a net positive effect.</li>
            <li> The little bottle may release to much oil at one time if you don&#x27;t cover the opening with a finger, tip the bottle over and tip it back up, while keeping your finger on the opening until the fluid is back to the bottom.</li>
            <li> Which only made things worse because now my penis is huge .</li>
            <li> It is a bit less overpowering, in scent, than the spray, so the effect is still present, just more subtle.</li>
            <li> I was at a warehouse store a few days ago, and honest to god the woman behind the counter</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent but very subtle.</li>
            <li> I consider myself somewhat a stylish dresser but only for casual,semi casual.</li>
            <li> major change thus far, however I can mention a few details, a couple happened at retailers, and it happened with&lt;br /&gt;both a male and a female, being observant of the customers before me and after me, I noticed that these people,&lt;br /&gt;chatted</li>
            <li> intuition after two months of research and observing reactions is that the response is extremely variable (unpredictable), generally minor (might get an extra smile or two), and overall other factors (self confidence) will be far stronger influences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, when I combined it with my normal cologne it definitely seem to garner a little extra attention from the ladies.</li>
            <li> This lightweight, clear oil has a subtle, very pleasing fragrance - women seem to be attracted to something about it - whether it&#x27;s the pheromones, the fragrance, or both.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d work very well in a crowded bar but on small dates, it&#x27;s done wonders.</li>
            <li> It does indeed have a subtle but powerful effect.</li>
            <li> You must get close enough for long enough and it will work.</li>
            <li> I use it but not really in a social atmosphere.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet, if it is working, but it did arrive fast.</li>
            <li> for me to review, the reason is because I would have said that I didnt really notice any change if it was not&lt;br /&gt;because of a couple of details, note that this is not magic</li>
            <li> I tried it couple of times before going out, not sure if it really works or not.</li>
            <li> The smell does not seem to last that long.</li>
            <li> The smell does not last as long.</li>
            <li> She hung out at our table for a long while before she left.  </li>
            <li> and doesn&#x27;t even last the long.</li>
            <li> i like ihe long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> If you put your nose to where you sprayed it (your wrist for example), the smell is pretty strong, bitter, kinda like bad B.O.</li>
            <li> attentive lately, so I dabbed a little bit on my pulse points.</li>
            <li> doesnt last very long when you use it every day</li>
            <li> and I only used it a few times so far</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe this actually works definitely recommend buying for people who are curious about it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether ladies are going to be throwing themselves at me, but at least I will be smelling cool if they do!</li>
            <li> Even though I was assured that this product had no scent other than the faint pheromone fragrance, the bottle I received had a strong odor reminiscent of Irish Spring bath soap.</li>
            <li> put it on while I was peeing and the effect of this product has made me miss the toilet !&lt;</li>
            <li> Ive used other pheremones in the past but none have shown results on the first day wearing the cologne.  </li>
            <li> (At this point only for basic needs essential to survival) I am chased and held down by the onslaught of soaking wet women and publicly raped .</li>
            <li> I wear it whenever I know I may need a little boost in my aura and so far it has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle but very inviting for the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> When you have high concentration, women usually suspect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a musky masculine scent- remember a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to other social settings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, actually to spice things up a bit with my wife, and I could definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> My package actually arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> This product is strange because you can&#x27;t tell you have anything on, well it is unscented.</li>
            <li> My only problem, is not knowing the expected results.</li>
            <li> method: few drop on your wrists or just directly to your neck</li>
            <li> how well it would work if I had been out looking for Strange</li>
            <li> but I have not had it long.</li>
            <li> I was only curious to see if my date would notice.</li>
            <li> They sent me this bottle at no charge as long as I promised to review another product I purchased and</li>
            <li> I use it  for no so long but seems to work</li>
            <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t seem to get annoyed with me like usual and is more affectionate.</li>
            <li> I expected nothing, and I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m a good looking guy to begin with, but the results were dramatic to say the least!</li>
            <li> The extreme one he&#x27;s a little sensitive to but the regular one he recommends!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a definite &amp;#34;ice breaker&amp;#34; effect, especially with women who had previously been aloof.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is a little hard to use the oil from the bottle - better get the spray that&#x27;s why 4 stars.</li>
            <li> It gives a confidence I don&#x27;t usually have, and that whether it&#x27;s the new attitude or the scent, it does work.</li>
            <li> I cannot definitively claim that this product resulted in the attraction of my wife or any other women whom I encountered in public.</li>
            <li> I got mine the other day... slip it on with your regular cologne</li>
            <li> It only fools you into thinking you have an advantage over other people.</li>
            <li> Example when I step into the elevator for a brief ride and there are several members of the opposite sex inside and just me it seems to work to make them notice and even engage me when in the past this has not happened.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at 1st, but have to say that after trying the product, woman seem to be more engaged.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my wrists, forearm crease, behind my ears and along my jawline and the back of my neck because I have long hair and can really waft it out into the atmosphere that way.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m usually a little hot and sweaty so not sure if this decrease</li>
            <li> We tested this and one other similar attractant over the course of a week.  </li>
            <li> I find a couple sprays/drops applied once or twice a day is enough to pique interest, and at that rate a small bottle will likely last two to three months or longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of random small talk from people in general, but women have been extra friendly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to any other single male.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it in a lot of different settings and have only received a few comments on the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;ts the only Pheromone product, after trying a few, that I can recommend.</li>
            <li> Had a particular odor late in the day after using it, that was not pleasent.</li>
            <li> Did not live up to my expectations</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an above average looking guy.  </li>
            <li> , especially the price is not worth it, I experiment with some of my close women friends</li>
            <li> only not worth the money for myself</li>
            <li> No it will not instantly have them come straight to you wanting to do the nasty, but it will for sure do it&#x27;s job in getting their attention.</li>
            <li> I’m kind of disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> That protective force field that women put up at first DOES drop so use that opportunity to turn your game on.  </li>
            <li> It has a faint sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li> I wear it on my hot spots( wrist, kneck, behind ear) as well as cologne and its not over whelming or to musky.</li>
            <li> Only down side is size of bottle and no sprayer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to experiment in different environments to see if I can obtain my initial results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product in public, so I don&#x27;t know if it attracts women, but I can say that my wife is considerably less irritable when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I believe the trick is to only use a slight amount.</li>
            <li> Just be carefull because the effects seems to lessen if you wear this every single day, you have to give it a little break and the results go back</li>
            <li> After man-ing up and deciding to try dating a lot of girls in a short amount of time with this new secret weapon to experiment with, I embarked to see how it measured up.</li>
            <li> Worthless and not worthy of anyones good earned money.  </li>
            <li> It is obvious that all the positive reviews are fake.  </li>
            <li> But wearing this stuff makes me more aggressive around everyone and in a bad way.</li>
            <li> No effect at all and the bottle is so small and won&#x27;t last for long.</li>
            <li> I know that pheromones can have different reactions with people and apparently its not good with me.</li>
            <li> I guess theres no real way to tell 100%..</li>
            <li> This has a hint of citronella scent in it but the mosquitos don&#x27;t seem to mind and the ladies have not really taken notice.</li>
            <li> No one has literally thrown themselves at me since I started using this stuff, but I&#x27;ve worn it out a couple of times and it seems to make a definite difference in everyday interactions.</li>
            <li> My former girlfriend returned home and we hung out a few times</li>
            <li> Careful as the oil may soak and leave a mark spot on clothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday since and still have a lot left.</li>
            <li> A couple of ladies in the train also looked at me curiously.</li>
            <li> Had absolutely no luck or see any difference using the product.</li>
            <li> I received the item broken, since it made with glass, why cant it be made with plastic, so much cheaper and easier to ship</li>
            <li> total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The oil is a bit runny, so be careful to prevent spills.</li>
            <li> I was curious about whether pheromones worked</li>
            <li> Note that I&#x27;m a wide reader</li>
            <li> The oil seems to last longer than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I was curious about the stuff</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a few weeks off and on</li>
            <li> I spent almost $100 dollars.  </li>
            <li> and after a month or so update my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After trying it for a few weeks I found that there has been no change in interest of the opposite sex.  </li>
            <li> Did not really notice a change on how anyone behavior change when I was wearing it will continue to use it to see if my luck changes</li>
            <li> Ive been trying this product in a few different variations and</li>
            <li> A few women were told about the test ahead of time to see if they could recognize any noticeable differences, and give us a different perspective.  </li>
            <li> it is harder to get away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the product for a few days, so I can&#x27;t offer any in depth review, I am curious to see how well it works.</li>
            <li> (despite having to rely on gimmicks like this)  I&#x27;d say yeah, this stuff works as long as you continue to put down the suave.  </li>
            <li> it does not work just plain and simple</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> This may be a flawed bottle, but it is suppose to give you a single drop at a time, instead it pours out of the spout so I am not sure if I am using it properly... or the right amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I was a bit discouraged about this because right after I placed the order on this product, I noticed that the reviews did in fact seem fake.</li>
            <li> I hope they improve the formula and make it more efficient, I read other people&#x27;s comments, but I think they do it with bad intention to encourage them to buy the product is recommended ..</li>
            <li> Its not a strong scent and probably lasts only like 5-6 hours or so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10, 230 pounds with long black hair and an a-hole personality.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little of this oil goes a long way - just apply a small amount to wrists and neck and it almost instantly gives you a boost of confidence.</li>
            <li> Is there any other Pheromone that I can try</li>
            <li> I tried to keep from changing anything other than the addition of the pheromone oil.  </li>
            <li> Be warned though as they say- careful what you wish for!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try other pheromones too</li>
            <li> I am going to try to mask the smell with some other colonge to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> Other women seem friendlier too.</li>
            <li> Eat a little celery, dab a tiny little bit of this product on your wrists and your neck, and...</li>
            <li> went to a party the other night.</li>
            <li> and she thought I might have had other thoughts in mind.</li>
            <li> I have used other pheromones before that</li>
            <li> About 15 minutes for pheromones to reach the small receptor and trigger an emotional response.</li>
            <li> i will use continusly in future.i have recomended it for those they have use other phermones and not get any response.</li>
            <li> The Science of Attraction-15ml Bottle]]Just got this the other day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other companies&#x27; pheromone oils and have never encountered a problem like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars, because like other reviewers, it did give me an added boost of confidence.. whether placebo or not, it can&#x27;t hurt anything.</li>
            <li> stars\\&quot; in the review, makes me doubt other reviews.    </li>
            <li> and I was not sure if there was going to be any thing different around me.</li>
            <li> I got tons of looks from other women even her friend who was with her.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my wife or other ladies yet</li>
            <li> Not much happen!</li>
            <li> if it makes a difference with other women</li>
            <li> Giving credit where it&#x27;s due.</li>
            <li> I put some of this on the other night when I went clubbing.</li>
            <li> And the other one, at work, I usually wear a tiny bit of cologne every day&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I would like to let you guys know that this product helps you out when having to talk to other gender.</li>
            <li> , I was actually getting attention from girls that usually don&#x27;t notice me.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when buying this product to see if it would work or not</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I put on a little of this product on my neck when my wife and I had our little \\&quot;date nite\\&quot; last weekend.  </li>
            <li> i used the other night</li>
            <li> Blends well with other colognes.</li>
            <li> And that is without wearing any other type of cologne.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really that desperate then invests in some roofies instead, those actually have been proven scientifically to work!</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s all you need, it&#x27;s worth a try, if you&#x27;re shy, and would let a chance run you by, don&#x27;t waste your hopes on this.    </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> The cap is locked and hard to open.</li>
            <li> I can say that when I do where it she if a lot calmer person doesn&#x27;t get as angry and that I feel that she wants to be closer to me.  </li>
            <li> Sorry Guys, it really does not work.</li>
            <li> Do no buy not worth it all it is</li>
            <li> smelling it faintly at least gave it a &amp;#34;placebo effect&amp;#34; to inspire my personal confidence to talk to women.&lt;br /&gt;Ive got no reason to lie to anyone reading this..</li>
            <li> I walked out into the common area of my apartment (college dorm style, 3 room mates) where my room mates and friends had just got back from soccer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 5 star review in advance because it smells like pussy to me, so it will definitely work on at least one of us, and hopefully both....</li>
            <li> To start off this is a difficult product to assess if its really works.  </li>
            <li> Its not worth it.</li>
            <li> I am just an average guy, but slim.</li>
            <li> I look at myself as average looking man.</li>
            <li> so I will give it an average score for now...</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical before I bought it, but this product really seems to work.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical before I bought it, but this product really seems to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early in this stage of the game to decide whether or not this product works.</li>
            <li> so sh***s bound to go down anyway.</li>
            <li> Girls not put down pants for you but you will fill they like to be with you.</li>
            <li> But when it comes down to the promise of attraction women.</li>
            <li> I have never met a woman I was attracted to and after three hours of talking to her, she rights her number down before I asked for it.</li>
            <li> Other pheromones cost as little as fifty dollars.</li>
            <li> I give it a chance after reading other reviews on here what a waste of money</li>
            <li> and I already saw a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> With both orders I received packages in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I blew 30 odd bucks on it because of that.</li>
            <li> would say I am not really lucky with women.  </li>
            <li> not sure if there are environments for maximum effectiveness or not because i usually work in and outside</li>
            <li> Its only been a few days but already noticing a few small changes!</li>
            <li> It also failed to live up to expectations that the ad raised.</li>
            <li> I place a bit just behind the ears tracing down the front neck along the arteries, and the pulse points in the inner elbow joint.  </li>
            <li> Oil could be a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Found this little bottle in my hubby&#x27;s medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> It seems like it takes a little time to build up depending on the person but something happened.</li>
            <li> I mix it with a little colonge and I am set for the day.</li>
            <li> there was no significant change in her demeanor.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work not even a little.</li>
            <li> but it makes things a little easier.</li>
            <li> Just a little oil on pulsating areas i.e. wrist, under jawbone on neck did it for her.</li>
            <li> The problem was with this product, my eyes stung a little after putting it on.</li>
            <li> After obtaining my package i immediately dabbled a little on.  </li>
            <li> The competition is tough out there, and why not have an extra edge?</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Youdont really need anty artificial product to attract the women.</li>
            <li> , i have been using this and doesn&#x27;t change anything,  i just wasted my time and money..</li>
            <li> NOTICING SOME ATTENTION AFTER USING THIS FOR A FEW DAYS.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a few smiles and laughs sent towards you and might get a few women to go along with your idea of drinks or lunch.  </li>
            <li> I ask few girls did they like smell...</li>
            <li> I kept smelling my arm every few minutes or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few times to try it out.</li>
            <li> Have worn this for a few days and it meets my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy something like this, but I had a gift card, was on my way to vegas in a few weeks</li>
            <li> will continue to use, and update in a few months to see how things go</li>
            <li> Each time, we started off as buddies just hanging out, but within a few minutes her demeanor would change and so would the nature of our relationship.</li>
            <li> Well, next day I took the bottle with me, I put a lot behind my ears, neck etc:.....</li>
            <li> By the time you read this I will be dead .</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have been testing them for a few days and can not give a definitive answer on the effectiveness of the pheromones.</li>
            <li> put a few dabs on at bedtime,</li>
            <li> money wasted i feel like i got punched in the gut</li>
            <li> you are looking for the ladies to be falling all over you instantly, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday..</li>
            <li> A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, a few years ago I started using PherX</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing the oil for a few days now, I put it on my neck and wrists.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve order this product and been using it for a few days now.</li>
            <li> Combined with an extra-strong dose of pheromones, this product sits firmly in the \\&quot;win\\&quot; category.  </li>
            <li> A few women I&#x27;ve tried to approach myself have not seemed to be affected by it, which makes sense.</li>
            <li> Came in cracked what a joke don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Received the product promptly in a few days.</li>
            <li> Ive used it a few times</li>
            <li> this stuff does not work, save your money and dont waste on this stuff.</li>
            <li> And as i said dont waste your money for this S</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I purchased the PherX Pheromone Oil for Men (Attract Women)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now and the response I have</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all waste of money</li>
            <li> I will update in a few weeks after I have had time to try it.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few days now</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work waste of money.</li>
            <li> This third one looks like very diluted, water base of some sort.  </li>
            <li> Women seem to be less anxious or nervous when I wear it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly subtle smell that dabbed behind your ears shouldn&#x27;t freak anyone out who is sensitive to colognes and perfumes</li>
            <li> The other girl there was a bit confusing.</li>
            <li> It has no strong smell.</li>
            <li> As usual I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It seems that in Vegas, every dude has a 6-pack, dresses in the finest suits/vests/clothes, and models for Jcrew or some crap, probably would consider myself &amp;#34;not one of the cool</li>
            <li> I usually get women staring a little longer than usual when I have this on.</li>
            <li> With that being said I would like it to be a little stronger tho!</li>
            <li> The girl was all over me and everything seemed a bit easier than usually.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this should be refrigerated, or how often to re-apply.  </li>
            <li> However i am not entirely sure of the effectiveness of the pheromone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a magic potion</li>
            <li> I tried pheromones in the past</li>
            <li> Bottle is shockingly small for $34.</li>
            <li> The bottle may be small, but...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it attracts women</li>
            <li> People dont usually say my name in conversation</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s this product or it just me</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> but I am not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Seems to work, not sure if its the product or a confidence booster.</li>
            <li> I had girls coming up to me, and getting closer than usual..  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic, but you&#x27;ll notice that females will start wanting to talk to you or forget about time when you&#x27;re around.</li>
            <li> Just remember that this is not a magical product.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I can&#x27;t give you a solid answer myself.    </li>
            <li> Needless to say she is finally coming around after our night out.</li>
            <li> not sure I notice any difference</li>
            <li> It dose seem to get the attention of some that usually dont notice.</li>
            <li> I have to say, Im not sure</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s working or not.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on my neck and wrist.</li>
            <li> The difficult part is approaching them.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it has made any difference or not.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I have just started using it over the past week, so the verdict is still out, but I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> not sure yet, but will update.</li>
            <li> The effect is usually on the unconscious mind.  </li>
            <li> I am usually timid when taking orders at the place I work</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it worked it not.</li>
            <li> This is not a magical product that is going to have you fighting women off of you as if you were a One Direction member.</li>
            <li> Have not yet seen any &amp;#34;takers&amp;#34; or any attraction out of the ordinary.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if my opinion is valid.</li>
            <li> I tried on a friend and she sensed something but not sure what.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> But is not a magic potion.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS DEFINITLEY A WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the product works or not.</li>
            <li> Tried it today at the gym, worked up a little sweat while lifting weights, noticed some serious looks from the women.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical in the beginning about using an oil based Pheromone product, however, it delivered just what I needed, no scent in the oil just strong Pheromone base and can add any fragrance of my choice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s up to me from there, but this gets the hard part out of the way.</li>
            <li> As for the attract women part its really hard to tell</li>
            <li> It is hard to say with precision....</li>
            <li> I used serval times IT DOES NOT WORK at all,RIP OFF, do not west  your hard earn money.</li>
            <li> did not help attract any woman for me, at least not as of yet.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve worn this, I&#x27;ve had at least one girl come up to me in the bar (even if I&#x27;m sitting off by myself not talking to anyone).</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t to late for you DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> But it was too late</li>
            <li> It seems to make me edgy and prone to giving an attitude to people.</li>
            <li> At least in the way I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
            <li> (at least not for me...</li>
            <li> Aging sucks.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to test it out, so I dabbed some on my wrists and behind my ears before going to hang out with a friend a few times.  </li>
            <li> and I agreed to take things slow.</li>
            <li> I mean the areas that produce odor (crotch, ears, armpits, etc.).</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on my neck, wrists, and behind the ears(as the bottle suggests) before getting into bed with my wife.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an addition to the game, not a magic juice that will have women clamoring over you.</li>
            <li> Although impossible to do this scientifically, wearing this product definitely seemed to make a difference!</li>
            <li> subtle</li>
            <li> Subtle</li>
            <li> Women subtly  become nicer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s subtle, guys.  </li>
            <li> The effects are subtle but noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I like the subtle smell it puts off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious, use it and see if all the women turn their heads towards you...</li>
            <li> Cost about half of price of expensive Cologne.</li>
            <li> There does seem to be a subtle change in the way some people respond to me when using the product.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say....don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> but this product is not good.</li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted my money on it</li>
            <li> Smells not pleasant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m looking at PherX as a secret, but subtle weapon - another tool in the tool belt.  </li>
            <li> Scent is very weak as compared to the PherX I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> and I played dumb.  </li>
            <li> I have women who used to HATE me now smiling and vying for my attention when less than a week ago they wanted little to nothing to do with me.</li>
            <li> Its tough to fully know how</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to put in some work and be playful, or whatever game you have going on.  </li>
            <li> Might as well place some canola oil behind your ear.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed a bit on my wrists&lt;br /&gt;and dabbed it behind the ears.</li>
            <li> I have been applying it to my wrists and behind my ears as suggested by the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Use it when you know she&#x27;s going to want to sit with you, watching the game or a movie.  </li>
            <li> I immediately applied it behind my ears.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Terrible product and the people who sell it should be taken for false advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again it could just be false confidence thinking the product was helping.  </li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> well spent:-(</li>
            <li> This is a very subtle product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried their other products and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write bad reviews</li>
            <li> OVERALL BAD SERVICE AND POOR PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> This was the sad part.</li>
            <li> * was just for weird dudes who couldn&#x27;t ever get any</li>
            <li> Gave me a terrible instant headache.</li>
            <li> Well ive purchased this product because i work with a bunch of angry women</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I have had to start arming myself to scare of angry Fathers , Brothers , Boyfriends , and Husbands .</li>
            <li> As well as buy an extremely expensive home security system and bar off my windows as there is now a horde of women scratching and moaning at my doors and windows like the undead .</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> maybe one of two others for meaningless items.  </li>
            <li> My wife say it smells weird but to me</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product.</li>
            <li> Idk why people think the review are fake</li>
            <li> , I recommend this product  if you are not a very good lokking guy!!!!</li>

            <li> Please don&#x27;t be stupid and naive as I was.</li>
            <li> bad product, are lies that attracts women, not recommended, unfortunately it is a scam for money ..</li>
            <li> Dont think to get failed!</li>
            <li> I was WRONG!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, and read through a bunch of reviews before I bought it..</li>
            <li> I brought this product because a friend recommended it may help with spicing up my relationship, it&#x27;s a odorless oil very thin, and water base my opinion</li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all..  </li>
            <li> I had read that some pheromone products smells bad, but not the case with this product.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> Bad design.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I have to say it does not. :(  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> In wearing this, I&#x27;ve found that talking to women just seems to go smoother. Women want to interact for longer periods of time, and find what I&#x27;m saying more interesting. It could simply be the confidence of my &#x27;secret weapon&#x27;, but in any case, I&#x27;m highly satisfied with my experience in using this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money on this junk</li>
            <li> This is much more concentrated than spray.  Pleasant smell would get again</li>
            <li> Product came earlier than expected and was in great packaging. i tried it as soon as i got it and went to home depot to get some materials, i did notice the women seem to be talking with me a lot more and were laughing at things i said that weren&#x27;t all that funny, i will put it to the test again and updated soon.</li>
            <li> It is very good, we love so much !!!!!!!!!!11</li>
            <li> bad product, are lies that attracts women, not recommended, unfortunately it is a scam for money .. I hope they improve the formula and make it more efficient, I read other people&#x27;s comments, but I think they do it with bad intention to encourage them to buy the product is recommended .. asesorse well with some scientific or organic chemist to buy any product ... I feel cheated .....</li>
            <li> The reviews I read were helpful, however, the product has done nothing for me. neither have I received any positive remarks.  Is there any other Pheromone that I can try I tried both the oil and cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this product last night and I already saw a slight improvement. The girl was all over me and everything seemed a bit easier than usually. I&#x27;ll let you know how things develop further.</li>
            <li> So far, this product as worked rather well, I notice more women turning their heads my way..maybe it&#x27;s the confidence I acquired by using the product, whatever it is, it&#x27;s working...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect ladies to jump on you but they will definitely hang around you.</li>
            <li> If your aim is to find an oil that attracts, then this WOULD fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Had more glances and longer held looks from my spouse, but hard to say whether this would be on account of the oil or the layered scent over. (Creed Aventus).  Will be interesting to see how this goes.  I put a dab on my wrist and rubbed over my temples.  Not sure if this should be refrigerated, or how often to re-apply.  Would be good to get some directions on this going into the future.  Am interested in trying more of the product line, however.</li>
            <li> Does this work if you&#x27;re gay? lol.</li>
            <li> The product it good. However i am not entirely sure of the effectiveness of the pheromone. It has a pretty robust smell and can easily be combined with many other colognes.</li>
            <li> I waited until I finished using the whole bottle to write this review. Great fragrance that lasted quite awhile. Experienced lots of extra smiles from people. Oil could be a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I used a similar one in the past and was also happy with the results.  After doing research this product seemed to have the best reviews on amazon so I pulled the trigger and purchased it.  The first time I used it I was at a party could tell the ladies were giving me much more attention and seemed to enjoy my company more than usual.  I tried it another time out in public and noticed more stares than usual...no I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the placebo affect! :)&lt;br /&gt;Try it out, def worth the money.</li>
            <li> This item really doesn&#x27;t work.Is a waiste of money.</li>
            <li> The cheaper price notwithstanding, it seems to me that this product works just as well as the others, which I tried.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Didn&#x27;t even notice a difference. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Pros: Has a sorta nice smell actually&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t do anything. I may even say women seem less friendly while wearing this stuff. The placebo effect is powerful guys but it only works if you REALLY believe. If you&#x27;re a skeptic you&#x27;re probably not going to enjoy this purchase.</li>
            <li> Item as described,  excellent product!!</li>
            <li> The best product of its kind hands down.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work if youre lucking for friends or girlfriend or something with more than a relationship with girls  this doesn&#x27;t change anything in your life, this is only oil that&#x27;s it, i have been using this and doesn&#x27;t change anything,  i just wasted my time and money..</li>
            <li> I was promised a free bottle  of something or other for writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this only once, but I know it works already.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on while I was peeing and the effect of this product has made me miss the toilet !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to experiment with this product over the weekends and if there is anything more to it then a placebo affect, I will report it here.  :)</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised to find this work pretty well. Certainly women don&#x27;t drop their pants, but you definitely receive more attention and physical contact.</li>
            <li> This product was something I wanted to test out on my wife and to see if it would really work.  I can say that when I do where it she if a lot calmer person doesn&#x27;t get as angry and that I feel that she wants to be closer to me.  Now all these could be coincidences and it might not work for you but I feel like I got my moneys worth out of it.  It does have a scent that is very pleasant also.  With the oil I but a ton of it on the first couple of days to make sure she would smell it and I thought I was going to fly through the stuff but it is still almost full.  So I think it will last a while.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described, but didn&#x27;t notice any difference upon it&#x27;d use on multiple occasions.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly! You definitely notice a difference when you put this on. Not only does it make you more confident, women just seem to be more interested in you. 10/10 would buy again</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance but  I wasn&#x27;t noticed by any ladies. This was the sad part. I used it for 2 weeks and I tried to get close to all of the  ladies I like and nobody told me anything or give me any complement or have any sudden  reaction or change of behavior for 2 weeks but I am still using it because I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Pros- Smells great&lt;br /&gt;  Works&lt;br /&gt;  Last for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- shipping&lt;br /&gt;  price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When box cam in notices a oily spot in the corner. After opening noticed that more than half of the bottle leaked out during shipping. I contacted amazon they gave me an instant refund and a free return shipping. The box sure smelled really good and A++ for amazons customer care!</li>
            <li> STARTED USING THIS ITEM AND IT HAS A GREAT FRAGRANCE.  NOTICING SOME ATTENTION AFTER USING THIS FOR A FEW DAYS.</li>
            <li> A couple of nights ago, I used a drop of this along with my regular cologne.  I tried to keep from changing anything other than the addition of the pheromone oil.  During our evening, my fiancé seemed to be a little bit friskier and when we went to bed that night she was a more passionate than she had been recently.  I will be testing this frequently and will report back as I accumulate more &amp;#34;data.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product seems to really work!  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, actually to spice things up a bit with my wife, and I could definitely see a difference. At first, it seems to have a strong musky scent, but it quickly fades away and the effects remain.</li>
            <li> Packaging and shipping of this product has been perfect both times I&#x27;ve ordered.  With both orders I received packages in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;This product does attracts the ladies and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to any guy who enjoys female company and conversation.&lt;br /&gt;I had never tried a product like this but, being a middle-age widower and having to start again, I&#x27;m glad to have this edge so the ladies come to me. It has given me the confidence to converse and have surprising results.</li>
            <li> It worked after the second time I used it. I thought it was going to be a really strong smelling and oily but is not</li>
            <li> There is definitely more attention towards me using this product I don&#x27;t know how it works but it does I&#x27;m satisfied!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and clean. No women swooning over me, but definitely boosts confidence. All people respond to confidence.</li>
            <li> I think its alright and probably as good as the spray version (which I also have).  Its not a strong scent and probably lasts only like 5-6 hours or so.  I think as far as &amp;#34;attracting women&amp;#34;, you don&#x27;t get women gravitating towards you or anything like that.  You&#x27;ll have to put in some work and be playful, or whatever game you have going on.  You&#x27;ll get a few smiles and laughs sent towards you and might get a few women to go along with your idea of drinks or lunch.  Have realistic expectations.  I use other pheromone based oils and colognes, and I think those are better, but also more expensive.  If you need a bit more extra &amp;#34;persuasion&amp;#34; power, then give this a try.  Like I said before, be realistic and be the one that says &amp;#34;hello&amp;#34; first.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT going to improve your odds with women, however, it does smell nice, which is the reason I gave it an extra star. I would recommend hitting the gym and taking showers before trying this product.</li>
            <li> The very first time I tried this I got a very unexpected Kiss, I have to tell you that Yes this works.  I have worn it several more times and have noticed that the ladies are much more friendly. I first tried the oil but I prefere the spray because it is easier to use!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!! Definitely will purchase again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> To answer your question, yes, it works. Not like metal to a magnet but this product has proven itself well with my personal experience using it. Be warned though as they say- careful what you wish for! I&#x27;m a semi-above average attractive guy I&#x27;ve been told multiple times, but have been on team single for quite some time now. After man-ing up and deciding to try dating a lot of girls in a short amount of time with this new secret weapon to experiment with, I embarked to see how it measured up. The results were great- Just about every new first date I went on, let&#x27;s just say I was given more than a kiss goodbye- and I wasn&#x27;t even expecting or trying at all. It has a musky masculine scent- remember a little goes a long way. But every girl who catches wiff says I smell amazing and/or seems to show added interest and trust in me when I have this great little bottle of luck on. If you&#x27;re debating to buy it- I say do it because I took a chance and I&#x27;m satisfied and grateful I did so.</li>
            <li> 5 stars why? Because it actually does work! I used it at work just to test the waters. My opinion apply your cologne as well. With just the cologne nothing happens but... when you add PherX crap! Different story! I feel like im in a axe commercial! Women that you usually don&#x27;t talk to actually show interest and all nice to you. To see if it really works I let my brother use it for a date, keep in mind he&#x27;s a virgin.. Later that night, he became a man!</li>
            <li> I honestly thought this s*** was just for weird dudes who couldn&#x27;t ever get any but I wore this and went to a party and literally had woman all over me. ending up sealing the deal with a girl I had just met. I recommend you wear this with Hollister so Cal cologneas I do. instant pussy. ive also found when you wear it around women who aren&#x27;t whores they really want to talk to you and are very interested in you. Science defiantly won this one. buy this s***</li>
            <li> I received this product and was excited to try it out.  I have had a good time with the ladies in the last couple weeks but it&#x27;s summer after all, so the woman are all horny.  I&#x27;m experienced and adequately attractive so sh***s bound to go down anyway. But in the last 10-14 days since I got the product, I have been tearing it up.     I don&#x27;t feel very fit for a review.  Not to come off as cocky or condescending to anyone, but logically speaking the best candidates would be those with less confidence, etc, to begin with.  I have given this product a 5 out of 5, based upon my success while using the product and no other factors.</li>
            <li> Zero effect.&lt;br /&gt;I lightly spritzed it on and also heavily applied it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a handsome fellow as is with slight confidence issues, and no effect.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible product,&lt;br /&gt;Misleading label.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this not only for me but also my best friends.&lt;br /&gt;It simply works, what else do you want?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was working at first, but as soon as everyone left the elevator she lunged at me.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product a year ago, I used couple of times and it did not work for me.After then, I threw somewhere in my drawer.&lt;br /&gt;People are saying here, yes it worked for him with his wife ,ex-girlfriend,in a bar with a group of mixed friends both girls and guys.&lt;br /&gt;Any how, if you have a wife , it will work.if you go to a bar  or cinema with your ex , it will work.if she accepts your invitation  for movie or bar, she is intended to to get laid! it is not the pheromone, its her.I used this product in public places which I never knew before the women and approached gently, spoke politely,offered some drinks but it did not work.I tried to be exact pick-up-artist and my targets are average beauty,normal people not high class.Sorry Guys, it really does not work.Youdont really need anty artificial product to attract the women.The power ,the essence is in your body.Use it.Dont think to get failed! Think positive and approach as many women as you can think to have.&lt;br /&gt;Use the social network.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and would probably last a very long time even with regular use. I didn&#x27;t notice anything working or any difference when using this product. Many others do though, so hopefully its just me and anyone else that buys it will enjoy it. It just didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my wife gets more attracted and have more passion when having sex, she also keeps smelling my neck. Also the woman in the office like to chat more time than the usual when I am using this, it is not like they are going to be over you but you can notice the difference, I have not tried it in a bar but I am sure it will work ...</li>
            <li> PherX Pheromone Oil for Men was the 2nd pheromone product I purchased. I have only worn it to work so I can&#x27;t speak to other social settings. Like the first product I tried I can&#x27;t say women swooned when I walked by or engaged them in conversation. I do like the light scent of PherX. It&#x27;s not overpowering - you won&#x27;t have to worry about it turning anyone off. I have had several women engage me in conversations while wearing this but I can&#x27;t say for sure where or not wearing PherX is the reason. Pheromone products seem to work differently on different people. I would say try this one for yourself to find out if it&#x27;s one that works for you or not.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely gets you noticed, it doesn&#x27;t make you Hugh Hefner but definitely makes women more comfortable around you. I&#x27;ll try other pheromones too but this is a solid product.</li>
            <li> Do no buy not worth it all it is, is scented oil do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> That thing is good, gave me a lot of self confedence, helps to start conversation and noticed that girls paying more attention to me now</li>
            <li> Smells not pleasant. I ask few girls did they like smell...all say NO. Price is too high. And they will send you for free one more product, after you ricieve this, but even for two of them - lost money. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I applied PherX Pheromone oil before a routine morning workout at the gym. I immediately noticed more smiles from the females, and a couple actually initiated conversations with me!&lt;br /&gt;My behavior at the gym was nothing beyond my normal behavior. The only thing different was the oil.....I must report, tho, that the effect seemed to subside after the initial application. I&#x27;m anxious to experiment in different environments to see if I can obtain my initial results. I believe the product to be affective!</li>
            <li> It smells great and I have had positive results with people around me. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> The thing I like most about this product is the scent. Its different from any cologne Ive ever purchased. Its not too perfumey, and not too musky either..Its worth the price just for that.</li>
            <li> Just started using it with my normal cologne and the females seem to be a bit more personable during normal conversations. There may be something to the science of scent!  Will continue using it to see just how personable the ladies will get!</li>
            <li> It seems to me that it&#x27;s just from a placebo effect telling you you&#x27;re awesome so you feel awesome. I never noticed any comments or different actions from any females and my girlfriend didn&#x27;t even notice it on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a kinda cute woman in my early 30&#x27;s. Found this little bottle in my hubby&#x27;s medicine cabinet. Put a dab on after reading the reviews. Thought maybe it might get me hot and bothered for the hubby. I kept smelling my arm every few minutes or so. Gave me a terrible instant headache. No excitement at all. I&#x27;m not believing it works but if it makes my husband more confident...so be it. I&#x27;m not going to tell him I found it because no point....not like it actually works. Lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few times to try it out. It seemed like I was getting a few more second looks than normal, and conversations seemed to be started more by the women I would run into rather than me having to initiate it. It will definitely take some more testing to say for sure, but as of now I have had a fairly good experience with this product. If I notice anything more I&#x27;ll come back and note it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly noticed that after I started using this that my wife became a lot more touchy feely and more like when we first were dating. No kidding it was a change for no reason, we both work a lot of hours and she really warmed up even during a very stressful time when I would have expected the opposite. Anything to tip the cards in my favor is worth it... It seems like it takes a little time to build up depending on the person but something happened.</li>
            <li> Well ive purchased this product because i work with a bunch of angry women lol. So i applied this to my neck and wrist area once i finished showering. And when i get to work and through out the day these women are suddenly friendly and talking to me without bitching lmao. Anyways this is my 2nd bottle and this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind regards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jr</li>
            <li> Great product, mild smell but attractive. I usually cannot stand regular cologne, this one is great. My husband likes it too.</li>
            <li> Product arrived right on time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and I think I can tell a difference. Women sit up straighter when I come near them, and even men are more talkative and open to what I&#x27;m saying.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a definite winner.</li>
            <li> At first sniff this seemed too floral for me, but after a little while on my skin the odor shifts to something more appropriate, more attractive. I still haven&#x27;t snared the romance of the century, but I smell interestingly while trying.</li>
            <li> Used this once before.  NO ONE has attacked me and wanted me on the spot. So don&#x27;t look for that. However it has made women want be closer more flirty and and makes me more comfortable being confident.  I mix it with a little colonge and I am set for the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just say that this product is great if you really have the balls to aproach (don&#x27;t  expect magic), it works very good when your very close to the person talking with and even more when you go physical,  it not just makes you feel confident but also turns women on. Use with your favorite cologne perfume.&lt;br /&gt;And you know it&#x27;s also great that you get a free sample for an honest  review ^^</li>
            <li> Not sure yet, if it is working, but it did arrive fast. I&#x27;m very observant, and looking for something to stand out as a noticeable change from women. Will continue to use &amp; decide if it is working.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if the product works..  So far I&#x27;ve gone out with a girl in two occasions one with the product applied and another with out, so far I have seen no change.</li>
            <li> Have worn this for a few days and it meets my expectations.  Smells very fresh and clean.  Not too strong.  People that I come in contact with seem in a better mood and friendlier.</li>
            <li> This product does work, Everyone&#x27;s body temp is different and it appears once you get moving about, the Pheromone oil starts to kick in.I have had numerous uninitiated hugs and pecks from ladies and all say ummm. Worth the try.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. I noticed my wife enjoyed the fragrance more when I applied it more consistently rather than just when we went out on special occasions.</li>
            <li> I used this product as well as their cologne, together and by themselves several times since receiving the product.  To date, I have seen no difference with or without.</li>
            <li> So far I asked my female coworkers what they thought of the smell all of them loved the smell and I cannot wait to put on the stuff while I am out and about.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether ladies are going to be throwing themselves at me, but at least I will be smelling cool if they do!</li>
            <li> I have used it only a couple of times so far and works as advertised. Product has a pleasant fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> After Zyloo sent me this product to review, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with this oil as I was with the other products I have ordered from Zyloo labs, but this still worked great. It gives a confidence I don&#x27;t usually have, and that whether it&#x27;s the new attitude or the scent, it does work. I had a female coworker I had been trying to date start hitting on me a lot more after starting to use this. Good product, will buy from Zyloo again.</li>
            <li> Is it really a pheromones ?</li>
            <li> I have used something like it before, and have found it to be successful. More recent purchase of your brand has been even better. Without telling her about PherX-Oil (I still haven&#x27;t told her), my girlfriend seemed more amorous and sexually responsive. I&#x27;d like to think that it was just me, but it probably had more to do with the PherX-Oil!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Although impossible to do this scientifically, wearing this product definitely seemed to make a difference! It may be a placebo effect and it just improved my confidence but I felt the ladies were sitting closer and paying more attention to me. I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Very poor and very watery the spray is far better. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Really like this.....subtle but I often get comments as to how nice I smell with it on.....very good value....enjoy the response you get</li>
            <li> I bought the spray version and they sent me this for free to review as well (before I even reviewed the spray). It does seem to have a &amp;#34;happy inducing effect&amp;#34; on yourself and women (and men) doesn&#x27;t really smell like cologne which is good because I don&#x27;t want to smell like I wear cologne. It smells like a nice deodorant. I think I like the oil more because I sweat a lot at work and it seems to have more staying power. All in all its pretty worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> I like it so far, only wore it once, but strange women stopped to talk to me at the grocery store and the hardware store.</li>
            <li> Smells good, science is behind it, and does seem to work a little. And does a decent job boosting confidence too.</li>
            <li> It really works!  Used the spray also but this is nice to apply to your pulse points easier and has a nice tight seal.  You can carry it with you when you go out and don&#x27;t have to worry about it leaking in your pocket.</li>
            <li> So far so good I can definitely see a deference in the way that women I don&#x27;t know interact with me when I&#x27;m out in public</li>
            <li> Smells good and attractive. However, you need to spend great effort to open the bottle. The cap is locked and hard to open. The product itself worth the money.</li>
            <li> My package actually arrived sooner than expected. The service was excellent, and I really think this product is making a difference. After using it for only a few days, I&#x27;ve noticed that my female co-workers seem to be more friendly than usual. I&#x27;ve been receiving more physical contact, like a flirtatious shove or a hand on my shoulder. It&#x27;s not a magic potion but I&#x27;m starting to become a believer! Overall, I am happy with this purchase and I think it works.</li>
            <li> I like it. It does have a nice scent to it, not overpowering, but not underwhelming. I was hesitant to buy something like this, but I had a gift card, was on my way to vegas in a few weeks so I figured why not. Its tough to fully know how or if a product like this works. What I can tell you for sure from my experience:&lt;br /&gt;I am 6ft about 230 lbs, def not in the best shape. I consider myself somewhat a stylish dresser but only for casual,semi casual. It seems that in Vegas, every dude has a 6-pack, dresses in the finest suits/vests/clothes, and models for Jcrew or some crap, probably would consider myself &amp;#34;not one of the cool guys&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, when I put this on before we went out.. first and foremost, it definitely gave me confidence. I don&#x27;t think the scent itself does anything to me directly, but smelling it faintly at least gave it a &amp;#34;placebo effect&amp;#34; to inspire my personal confidence to talk to women.&lt;br /&gt;Ive got no reason to lie to anyone reading this.. I didn&#x27;t seal the deal, but I did seem to have women interested in me that normally I would think they wouldn&#x27;t be. I guess theres no real way to tell 100%.. but as far as I am concerned at the end of the day...&lt;br /&gt;It smells good&lt;br /&gt;It boosted my confidence&lt;br /&gt;I seemed to have better luck with women, false perception or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use, and update in a few months to see how things go</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was skeptical. But I did see a difference with how people react to me. Maybe there is really something about this.Will order again soon.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that it worked. Can&#x27;t confirm that it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this stuff works if you believe in it! I tried pheromones in the past and I just feel like a total slime-ball for being so underhanded. If you&#x27;re really that desperate then invests in some roofies instead, those actually have been proven scientifically to work!</li>
            <li> I have only had this for two days.so far nothing impressive.pheromones do work I have tried Athena 10x for men with great  results. But this stuff to be honest smells like sour ass with a squeeze of lemon. I am going to try to mask the smell with some other colonge to see if that helps. If so i will change my review.now on to a positive note shipping was very fast excellent no complaints there.that is why I gave it two stars.</li>
            <li> Its only been a few days but already noticing a few small changes! Hope this continues and I believe it will.</li>
            <li> Excellent value and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the spray and i will say I like the oil a lot better as it seems to last longer than the spray now it&#x27;s not going to &amp;#34;get u laid&amp;#34; every time you put it on but I have noticed that the wife wants to be closer and more touchy feely with me. I will buy again</li>
            <li> I have only tried it on three different occasions, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Perhaps, I am one of those people that this product doesn&#x27;t work on.&lt;br /&gt;PherX Pheromone Oil for Men (Attract Women) - The Science of Attraction - 20mg of Human Pheromones&lt;br /&gt;by PherX&lt;br /&gt;This did not help attract any woman for me, at least not as of yet.[[ASIN:B004SO2SVI PherX Pheromone Oil for Men (Attract Women) - The Science of Attraction - 20mg of Human Pheromones]]</li>
            <li> Pher X is a aphrodisiac for the consumer, for after you experience the responses you can&#x27;t help but keep coming back for more. This product is strange because you can&#x27;t tell you have anything on, well it is unscented. lol</li>
            <li> just received this oil from amazon for free in return for a review, i wore the oil on my neck, behind ears and chest like the sticker says, as i walked into the work kitchen a female co worker started to speak to me ( normally this specific co worker never talks) so that seemed nice, an hour later another female co worker asked for my help ( im in i.t) as i kept explaining what was wrong with her laptop, she just kept asking more and more questions, like she wanted to keep smelling me i guess lol, im finding that as the more i sweat the better results i get, nothing amazing yet but so far so good, as i have more experiences i will update, thank u pherx for the free sample!!</li>
            <li> This has a hint of citronella scent in it but the mosquitos don&#x27;t seem to mind and the ladies have not really taken notice. I will keep trying maybe just not going to the right places</li>
            <li> Con : Bottle is shockingly small for $34. How could it possibly be worth it?&lt;br /&gt;Pros : Well my wife hadn&#x27;t been too...attentive lately, so I dabbed a little bit on my pulse points. Within 24 hours, she initiated intimacy for the first time in weeks. Coincidence? Placebo effect? Who knows? Other women seem friendlier too. Just my imagination? Does it matter? Confidence is an elusive thing. I&#x27;m pleased with the results. The bottle may be small, but...you don&#x27;t really need to apply too much. Eat a little celery, dab a tiny little bit of this product on your wrists and your neck, and...</li>
            <li> The oil by itself is quite mild, I am not sure how much of an affect it would have by itself. However, when I combined it with my normal cologne it definitely seem to garner a little extra attention from the ladies. I would highly recommend it as an enhancing additive to your normal cologne.</li>
            <li> This stuff was crap. I kinda was expecting more from Amazon. Who does quality control?</li>
            <li> I use it for my arm pits and chest. Smells good, and most importantly it makes you feel more confident. I&#x27;m not sure if it attracts women but it definitely positively influences your psychology, which attracts women.</li>
            <li> On the very first uses of this product I observed an immediate, and positive,  response from women.&lt;br /&gt;Over several days I noticed female friends, co-workers, dance partners and even acquaintances were finding reasons to be near me or stay longer than normal to chat. Even my friends commented on how females seem to be more attracted to me. I am convinced that the PherX Pheromon Oil for Men helped open doors with women for me. It smells great and actually works--I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!&lt;br /&gt;I will remain a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> It has a very light, woodsy scent and smells very good. I haven&#x27;t used the product in public, so I don&#x27;t know if it attracts women, but I can say that my wife is considerably less irritable when I wear it. That alone is worth the 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> The pheromone oil in my opinion, was a fairly good product. Very pleasant added boost of confidence, had the price been more reasonable, I wouldve rated this product higher..</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. It isn&#x27;t a miracle oil. It helps you get noticed, and helps you me a better first impression. Every time I&#x27;ve worn this, I&#x27;ve had at least one girl come up to me in the bar (even if I&#x27;m sitting off by myself not talking to anyone). It&#x27;s up to me from there, but this gets the hard part out of the way.</li>
            <li> this product does not work.  The only thing this product did was suck the money out of my wallet.  I would not buy this product again, but they already got my money.  boo on me</li>
            <li> I tried this product after reading some of the reviews and said why not. My wife and I have been married over 25 years and with of us both having busy jobs and lives and after droping weight over the last two years and hitting the gym 5 days a week wasn&#x27;t getting her interest peaking again I was willing to try a new scent. The smell of the product is not bad and I have noticed more affection from my spouse when I put it on. I know most of the guys that have used it are trying out on the dating scene but my reasoning was trying to get that old spark going again in my marriage and I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Sounds to good to be true...it doesn&#x27;t work ..it doesn&#x27;t work ..it doesn&#x27;t work...all the reviews here aren&#x27;t true and</li>
            <li> women tend to be more nice to me whenever i use this product</li>
            <li> So, here I am leaving a a good review because it actually smells good! :D This product actually works. Amazingly to my surprise. I kind of test it out first. 1.) Regular Cologne and see how many complements or attention I get. 2.) Wearing this product by itself. 3.) Mixing this product with the cologne. Results are. This is in a span of a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular cologne by it self.&lt;br /&gt;Compliments - 6&lt;br /&gt;Attention - 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pher X by itself&lt;br /&gt;Compliments - 2&lt;br /&gt;Attention - 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pher X mix with cologne&lt;br /&gt;Compliments - 7&lt;br /&gt;Attention - 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good right there. The Ratios of both :D</li>
            <li> A friend has used this product and said it efectivo.Estoy waiting to get me to use it and see the results.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a more female attention when I wear this product. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of these pheromone colognes now and I&#x27;ve gotta say, I like them all.  I particularly like this one, it lasts longer than the spray form and the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering.  I wanted to test it out, so I dabbed some on my wrists and behind my ears before going to hang out with a friend a few times.  Each time, we started off as buddies just hanging out, but within a few minutes her demeanor would change and so would the nature of our relationship.</li>
            <li> I just finished the first bottle and decided to order a second one as I would like to give it another try. On one hand, I like the scent of the oil as interacts well when applied with my regular cologne and enhance its essence. On the other hand, I’m not very sure about the “power of attraction” toward women as it really varies depending on the situation and circumstances, and that’s the reason I want to try it one more time!</li>
            <li> really works but i just aint had any money to order more the bottle doesnt last very long when you use it every day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once on New years eve and forgot I had even put it on. I guess I didn&#x27;t set any expectations before using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product sells fine and mixes well with my normal cologne. My only problem, is not knowing the expected results. i.e. I take an Aspirin; headache goes away. How does someone know when it&#x27;s working?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 18 year old son wants to start using it. I might need to upgrade my rating, based upon his results.</li>
            <li> Had to say, this girl I was dating for a while was an animal and she was all about the smell!  Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> I have tried the oil and the spray. I can&#x27;t say I had women falling over to get me (and I don&#x27;t want them to as I&#x27;m happily married) but I can say the wife does appear to be more touchy feely when I wear this. Placebo affect, I don&#x27;t think so but who knows - however I will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> from first using it&lt;br /&gt;this one make a  new issue to my look&lt;br /&gt;and Has a nice aroma and definitely gives you a confidence boost</li>
            <li> Male, 19 years old.&lt;br /&gt;I put one drop on each of my wrists, sprayed cologne on each wrist, then dabbed my wrists on my neck. I walked out into the common area of my apartment (college dorm style, 3 room mates) where my room mates and friends had just got back from soccer. As soon as I was near them, they all began laughing, smiling, talking about good times, and oddly enough one of my friends started running around and rolling on the floor. I have never seen him this hyperactive before. One of my room mate&#x27;s lady friends couldn&#x27;t keep herself away from me. She always had to be standing close and followed me around. People dont usually say my name in conversation but they all kept asking me my opinion and talking about me. Absolutely impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later at night when only my room mate and friend were around we decided to move around the furniture and just talk about life. Even if I walked over to the fridge or my room they tended to follow me. Not necessarily immediately, but at a good conversation&#x27;s pace they would gravitate toward me. This would never happen before. I honestly didnt think they valued me very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a party the other night. I knew 2 people there out of about a dozen. They ALL at some point wanted to have a one on one convo with me. They would start to chat, then say &amp;#34;hey, lets go out for a smoke!&amp;#34; The smoke deal happened with 3 different people. A female acquaintance kept leaning against me, doing one of those &amp;#34;i&#x27;m tired, support me&amp;#34; kind of deals. The other girl there was a bit confusing. There were waves where she wouldnt even make eye contact and avoided me, but then other times she would walk over to me, look me right in the eyes, have a nice conversation, then lean up against me and talk nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A warning with any pheromone products:&lt;br /&gt;Do your research. They do NOT work the same for everyone. Some people will come across a product such as this that works like gold, but for another person it might not work at all. Another thing to keep in mind is to start on a lower &amp;#34;dose.&amp;#34; I used 2 drops the first time and varied that from 2 to 4. I am still experimenting. see what works for you!</li>
            <li> No one has literally thrown themselves at me since I started using this stuff, but I&#x27;ve worn it out a couple of times and it seems to make a definite difference in everyday interactions. I usually try it before things like job interviews, work social events, etc., and it seems to have a net positive effect.</li>
            <li> 60% of the time, it works Everytime. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great. I am going to combine this with  my favorite  cologne.</li>
            <li> I like the product. I am not sure if it&#x27;s this product or it just me but I think that my neighbor when I wear the oil she becomes touch and she want to spent more time with me. I just put it twice, I will keep you posted</li>
            <li> I recently started wearing PherX at work since I work in the medical field it&#x27;s mostly girls at the office. I noticed girls were inclined to enter my office regularly and seemed confident around me making it easier to speak with them and make a connection.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t meet  claims made in promotional verbiage.  It also failed to live up to expectations that the ad raised.</li>
            <li> I was eagerly anticipating the product. The same day I wore it and went to a place were I knew there will be many women.... Nothing. Well, next day I took the bottle with me, I put a lot behind my ears, neck etc:.....NOTHING, even a FLY came to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry. change the formula!!!</li>
            <li> Worked for me just like they said it would! Light smell and lasts all day if you were wondering about it!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004SO2SVI PherX Pheromone Oil for Men (Attract Women) - The Science of Attraction - 20mg of Human Pheromones]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sincere and straight forward review, I recommend you read it&#x27;s entirety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Cheap presentation (Label/Plastic bottle and initial protective wrap). But do you need anything else?&lt;br /&gt;Delivery method: few drop on your wrists or just directly to your neck&lt;br /&gt;Pheromones: Seems to work, but I can&#x27;t definitely say whether the product works or it&#x27;s \\&quot;placebo\\&quot; effect, but definitely I would prefer that product works.&lt;br /&gt;Product: As it&#x27;s oil based, initially it&#x27;s a bit greasy feeling, but than it remain only a good smell and no stains or anything else...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Assessment: The product has a gentle smell that I personally like, and I assume the women also like it as much, but I definitely gives a lot of self confidence as you are good smelling fella.</li>
            <li> It Work.!!! women will talk to you more and get close to you. I Will Buy It Again.For The lady let me have an advantage</li>
            <li> PherX is great...I put it on and my wife was friendly and more sexual than normal.More smiles and nice reactions. I thought it was my imagination but I had on the PherX. It has a nice aroma and definitely gives you a confidence boost.</li>
            <li> First off, the product didnt work!! Its probably an oil based solution mixed with a cheap fragrance. Secondly, they offered me a free product of choice, which I thought was nice so I could maybe give the product a second shot, but after promising me a free product THEY NEVER SENT IT OUT. I tried contacting them twice, but not response. OVERALL BAD SERVICE AND POOR PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff , my lady loves the way I smell ......gives you confidence I guarantee you. Fellas will love this product!!</li>
            <li> I have a couple of days testing the product and it is too early to say that works perfectly, but it has increased the attention of women when I go down the street. I invite you to try PherX a way to earn a little more attention.</li>
            <li> It is hard to be sure how effective this product is. I can tell it definitely turns heads and gets attention. That gives me a opportunity to open a conversation easier. The more women I talk to, the more chances to connect.</li>
            <li> This product has ruined my life , when I first bought the product I assumed it would help me earn the affection of the office hottie . I was gravely mistaken ... The product worked ... oh believe me it worked . But that&#x27;s the problem , IT WORKED TOO WELL . I can no longer go to work or even outside of my house without being chased by massive hordes of women . Every time I do leave the house (At this point only for basic needs essential to survival) I am chased and held down by the onslaught of soaking wet women and publicly raped . Sometimes by as many as 30 women at a time (The others had murdered each other in an effort to get a turn) My penis has become shriveled and useless and I had no choice but to buy a penis pump to be able to get an erection . Which only made things worse because now my penis is huge . I have had to start arming myself to scare of angry Fathers , Brothers , Boyfriends , and Husbands . As well as buy an extremely expensive home security system and bar off my windows as there is now a horde of women scratching and moaning at my doors and windows like the undead . My life has been ruined and there is nothing that I can do at this point but it isn&#x27;t to late for you DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS LIQUID CURSE IN AN ADORABLE BLUE JAR . By the time you read this I will be dead . There&#x27;s only one way out . Goodbye world . Sincerely - Nobody The greatest sex god whom ever lived .</li>
            <li> Not sure if it does anything at all, but doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell so can be worn with other cologne.</li>
            <li> Smells horrid and does not help attracting women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible product and the people who sell it should be taken for false advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not work!</li>
            <li> i just started using the product but it look promising.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. The five stars says it all.</li>
            <li> I felt a significant difference after starting to use this product. Girls not put down pants for you but you will fill they like to be with you. Good luck with this.</li>
            <li> So far this is my second time receiving this product, the first time it was given to me as a gift for me to try out. Since I have been trying it I would randomly go outside and put some on. I will notice females would actually say you smell really nice and then they would ask me what kind of cologne I am wearing. Just recently I asked my boss who is a female, how did I smell and she smiled and said i really like it. \\&quot;It has a very settle smell, but smells really nice\\&quot;! I recommend this product for all men to try!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works, but everyone is sure nicer to me when I wear it.  I will keep a supply on hand for sure.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  No effect at all and the bottle is so small and won&#x27;t last for long. I would rather spend the money at something else.</li>
            <li> Have used product only 3 days &amp; noticed a positive difference in the amount of conversation I receive from different women. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the wall about this product. It smells good but I can&#x27;t tell yet if its working but I&#x27;ve been only using it for a week. I&#x27;m going to try another one of their products and see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> First day, every girl at the office seemed much nicer. Second day, I was the most popular dude at a Halloween party... and &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; happened. Yes, this stuff is pretty damn potent.</li>
            <li> ...but my husband and I&#x27;s sex life has never been lacking. I love the way it smells on him and I think it attracts me to him even more, so I&#x27;d recommend this. **Note: it is important to put this in areas that you sweat easily. For example a dab in armpits...otherwise it won&#x27;t mix your scent with it to create your pheromone).</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about 3 days. I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of random small talk from people in general, but women have been extra friendly. I must admit that I have always gotten attention from women through the years, but lately the flirting has been a lot more unapologetic and deliberate. The smell isn&#x27;t strong, but goes well with my other colognes. Anyway, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt say I have experienced any noticeable difference in the way women treat me, but I can imagine it might make a difference for some people.  There is definitely something about the scent that almost makes you have clouded thoughts and a calming relax feeling.  I&#x27;ve worn this for a couple weeks and it hasn&#x27;t changed my slim to no chances with my wife of 21 years, but there&#x27;s still something about it that makes me not want to give up hope yet.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but decided to give it a try. I was quite surprised by how &#x27;motivated&#x27; my girlfriend seemed to be when I had put some on. I will definitely keep using it, hoping it will continue to work so well. I wonder what impact it might have on others who I may interact with. I don&#x27;t want to attract or repel any of my male friends!!!</li>
            <li> It is great product and you just feel better when you have the product on.  It definitely was a great investment.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a bottle of the spray PherX and the company contacted me saying I could try out a different product of theirs free of charge so I figured I&#x27;d try the oil as well. I have been trying to rekindle a spark that I thought was lost. It may or may not have been the actual product that caused the reaction. Honestly, I think it was more that my spouse found the labels and packaging in the trash and she thought I might have had other thoughts in mind. Regardless, it opened us up to a conversation that had been many, many months overdue and I was ultimately very happy with the results. The product may or may not be for everyone. It smells nice, but I didn&#x27;t find that it lasts too long. I&#x27;m not too sure how well it would work if I had been out looking for Strange (I might have had to keep reapplying it), but it served its purpose very well for me.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying it works. Its not a guaranteed ahhem &amp;#34;lay&amp;#34; by any means but I did note a major spike in confidence and is a great conversation starter. Smells slightly floral with a.. Sophisticated undertone. I would recommend to any other single male. Definitely not something if wear while on a night out with a significant other simply due to the amount of &amp;#34;googly eyes&amp;#34; just my opinion :) hope this helps</li>
            <li> Very satisfied! This stuff makes women do things  they don&#x27;t even realize they&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item as well as the PherX Spray cologne. Both give off a decent scent, but the oil definitely smells a bit stronger then the spray. I have been testing them for a few days and can not give a definitive answer on the effectiveness of the pheromones. I will add this, today i sprayed a bit more then usual on and the girls at the office were a bit more friendly then usual, complementing me on how i dress, etc...</li>
            <li> The product is OK, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.  Attraction depends on many things, i,e, body language,  appearance, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a few dabs on at bedtime, next morning, my wife was definitely more &amp;#34;friendly&amp;#34;, maybe partly because my attitude was a little different, also.  I think the product had some effect.</li>
            <li> I used this product as a test and it worked instantly where ever I went. It works more like a lure where it attracts them to you and makes them relaxed around you but the rest is up to you. This product sets everything up for you but it is on you to make the close.</li>
            <li> There were not any noticeable results. It smells good, but I  wouldn&#x27;t say that I would purchase a similar product again.</li>
            <li> This product doesnt work quite as well as the cologne one (also from Zyloo lab). I noticed some mixed results upon wearing it. Maybe because it doesnt have the nice smell the other has. Definitely need more tries to know for sure.</li>
            <li> I dont know if I would get this pheromone oil again.  I mean, I like to think i&#x27;m a good enough looking dude (despite having to rely on gimmicks like this)  I&#x27;d say yeah, this stuff works as long as you continue to put down the suave.  Can you dig it?</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased this product and have already had positive results. Has a nice scent also. I would recommend giving this product a try.</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost a full week first time I used it I was at a pharmacy and the pharmacist was acting like a schoolgirl being really flirty some women seem more prone to responding to this product than others! i&#x27;ve been spring my cologne then put dabs of this on afterwards great combo. Will be buying more</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference wearing or not. I have self confidence and have been told various times I am an attractive man. I chose various times and experimented with women both wearing it and not. One woman in particular. I did this for a total of two months. there was no significant change in her demeanor. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for use. Save your money.</li>
            <li> This was a nice little experiment of mine. I soon realized that the scent wasn&#x27;t anything special. In fact, the scent&#x27;s rose-like smell that reminded me of my Grandma&#x27;s perfume. So smelling like my Grandma is the ticket? Idk, I wouldn&#x27;t bet this oil specifically attracts women.</li>
            <li> this and the cologne product sucked. girl tld me it smelled funny. :/ money wasted i feel like i got punched in the gut</li>
            <li> All the ladies are more chatty, and the young ones become stalkers.</li>
            <li> My former girlfriend returned home and we hung out a few times and I agreed to take things slow. I ordered this product and put it on and suddenly things sped up in a hurry.........coincidence ??  Don&#x27;t know for sure but I will certainly continue to use it !!  Only down side is size of bottle and no sprayer. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent but very subtle. Put a dab or two on your neck below your ears and on your chest, give her a hug and see the results for yourself.</li>
            <li> This product really does work - don&#x27;t expect it to do all the work, but I&#x27;ve noticed a substantial increase in playful touches, attention and interest from girls, especially anyone you are sitting right next to. The scent is pleasant and fresh, and not overwhelming. It lasts a few hours, so be sure to apply before you go out, and not too early in the day, or reapply as needed. I expected nothing, and I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m a good looking guy to begin with, but the results were dramatic to say the least!</li>
            <li> Tried this on for my wife and she is like a teenager looking for love. Thanks for the great product and great delivery times. I ordered some more and need it now!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any response to this product as of yet. But I have no game so can&#x27;t blame the product</li>
            <li> This snake oil should be called Pure Placebo for Men (Guaranteed NOT to attract women, only your hard-earned cash). If you use this stuff and think it works, you&#x27;re being fooled by placebo effect, which means your feeling that the product works is imaginary, not due to the product actually being effective. This is the well-documented &amp;#34;sugar pill&amp;#34; effect, that has to be controlled for when testing the effectiveness of any drug, supplement, or procedure if you want to know if the thing actually works.</li>
            <li> This review is for the PherX Pheromone Oil for Men (Attract Women) product. As a biologist I had strong expectations for the pheromone.  Instructions on the bottle were pretty clear and I started using it in the very same day.  I went dancing and noticed that woman naturally leaned more toward me during dancing and keep talking to me throughout the whole songs making eye contact.  As today, I had the opportunity to repeat the testing for a third time with similar results. As other users reported, ladies would not jump over you but the substance did made them to be more open to conversation and be closer to you with constant smiles.  That is the magic of the product. You still need to be sharp and clean as well as have the right lines to keep them engaged in the conversation to move further.</li>
            <li> In all honesty it won&#x27;t attract girls like you imagine in your mind BUT at close rage I have noticed a considerable amount of women do ask about it and do get close/want to sniff you.  Women won&#x27;t go nuts for you but it will definitely make you more approachable.  It smells nice and I do believe it gives you a confidence boost.  I have been using it for certain occasions and I must admit it definitely does get a women&#x27;s attention.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the product in full. I will go and check it out at a bar or something and update this review. So far smells good and arrived on time in safe packaging.</li>
            <li> To be honest I just received this Saturday and I&#x27;ve worn it three times wit no results. May be later</li>
            <li> Women will follow you in the grocery store or anywhere else they smell you.  It works.  Give it  a try</li>
            <li> Smells ok as a standalone but I like mixing it with my favorite cologne...seems to make it last a lot longer. As for the attract women part its really hard to tell but i do feel better about my chances when i use it so at least that part of things helps.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say....don&#x27;t waste your time. I&#x27;ve purchased real pheromones before and I have to say this product falls completely short</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!! Please don&#x27;t be stupid and naive as I was. Does not work. Does not work. Does not work.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product and thought that the smell was very pleasing.  This is obviously not going to be the thing that makes the girls fall all over you but it will definitely help. The rest is all up to who you are and how you act.  Even men seem to treat you with more respect.  I would recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li> ok so i get this tiny little bottle of overpriced goop and put some on the places I would imagine it might be effective while in reality not having a clue. I cannot smell anything even with my nose near the opened bottle. It may work and maybe I need to give it more time or maybe my natural ability to repel women is just too powerful. Will keep you posted.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:07092015&lt;br /&gt;After my first review I received an offer from the manufacturer stating that if I promised to review it, they would send me another product of my choice at no cost. I chose the cologne version of this stuff. I must admit it smells quite good and lasts for a good while but I am not sure it is worth the cost they are charging. Considering Thallium costs half as much and REALLY smells amazing, I do not think I will repurchase the cologne. I do appreciate them giving me a chance to try it for free and I will wear it as an alternative to Thallium and Nautica Voyage. As far as this product making me irresistible to woman; well, I still seem to be quite resistible which is in no way a reflection of this company.</li>
            <li> Best buy, great product, I recommend it 100%.&lt;br /&gt;I keep buying more. Good buy and good experience.&lt;br /&gt;I will enjoy what I bought</li>
            <li> Tried it..it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> WOW! The females do respond much more when I wear PherX Oil. They just start talking to you out of the Blue!!! It&#x27;s like I cam pick and Choose! Love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I tried several pheromones as I deal with a lot of female clients and I see no difference in behavior with this product as I have with others. Not a deal breaker as all pheromones don&#x27;t work on every individual but I am not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Meh! I saw no difference at all.  I have used other pheromones before that have given me great results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl and I use this for my GF. Not sure if it works, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt ;)</li>
            <li> Great product. The first night I wore it women immediately noticed that my cologne smelled a little more appealing. This woman was at the bar with her husband and couldn&#x27;t keep her hands of me.  Works well when applied with cologne.</li>
            <li> I tried this over the weekend with my wife.  I did not tell her I used the product.  I did not notice any difference in her response to me.  The smell does not seem to last that long.</li>
            <li> Very effective! I&#x27;ve tried similar products before, and can say this one is light years beyond in terms of success rate!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in it. Did not live up to my expectations</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My girl LOVES when I wear it</li>
            <li> Product smells very good. Not over-powering.  As for attracting women....I suppose it could under the right circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have females chasing me or anything like that.</li>
            <li> Just got it last week. Had only one positive experience w/ wife being more affectionate. But it only happened once so....</li>
            <li> Does not work AT ALL. Do not buy this. They will hit you with the free Pher x cologne spray just to get positive reviews. Hey i almost fell for it but this product is not good. The smell does not last as long. No effects at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop buying this, too good.</li>
            <li> will leave oil spots on clothes if not rubbed in. does nothing else..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very fair person and will always give the benefit of the doubt.  But this was nothing more than &amp;#34;snake oil&amp;#34;.  Worthless and not worthy of anyones good earned money.  Do not waste your money.  Might as well place some canola oil behind your ear.  Do not be fooled by this product.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it on the ladies swarmed all over me</li>
            <li> works great the best on the market</li>
            <li> I was very sceptic about use anything like this, but when I do put it on I see a little of a different reaction from women they are a little more receptive. With that being said I would like it to be a little stronger tho!</li>
            <li> The smell is musky and I have been complimented on it.  I have seen even work colleagues lean in closer when I have it on!  Give it a rip!</li>
            <li> It is obvious that all the positive reviews are fake.  Check the profiles out.  This product is a scam.  I don&#x27;t usually write bad reviews but I am interested in buying some pheromones.  Not sure which will be good or if they even actually work yet.  I am just trying to find a reputable company to purchase from.  It really raises a red flag when all the negative reviewers have a long history of reviews both good and bad from unrelated products while the positive ones are this product and maybe one of two others for meaningless items.  Some are just this product like the big one at the top that 27 people found helpful.  My suggestion is don&#x27;t take the risk.  Look around more.</li>
            <li> This is a very sweet smelling product. Though I have a girlfriend and do not go out looking for stray women, I did notice positive attention after wearing this product.</li>
            <li> I think this product might make user more confident and also make people around relax. Honestly, so far I didn&#x27;t feel anything dramatically happened but the relationship between people around me got smooth. I will keep observing and hope there are something surprising when I use this product! At least, it smells good.</li>
            <li> I think this is a scam cuz, the truth there&#x27;s nothing that will atract a women. I think you guyS need classes and how to aproach women . That&#x27;s what they should have.</li>
            <li> I gotta say this Cologne works. I put this on and I can clearly notice the extra attention I get. Its amazing</li>
            <li> The stuff smells pretty good, although I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference in interactions with women.  I didn&#x27;t really like the oil application compared to the spray bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s didn&#x27;t work for me! I drive limo &amp; pickup nice females all the time... wanted to try my luck with this but I didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Hmmmm, i dnt c any change in my sex life.</li>
            <li> I have Demo Twice at work last week,  Great results. Really attracts attention. I was asked too lunch by a woman I have be interested in. which was a total surprise. We are going out sunday night. Another surprise. I will post a follow up</li>
            <li> I do not usually lack for much attention from females, but I have definitely seen an increase in interest. The oil itself has a very distinctive smell that I like as a cologne, though I do use body spray as well. All in all, I will buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the ladies to be falling all over you instantly, don&#x27;t waste your money. I couldn&#x27;t say for certain if it is just the fact that my confidence is a bit improved wearing it or if it actually draws females in, but something about it works.</li>
            <li> I like this product.....its very subtle yet very stimulating,  it was delivered very fast..I knew it was working when I was with a group of friends and someones girlfriend became touchy at the bar...give it a try</li>
            <li> A great product, I like the smell of it. My wife say it smells weird but to me I think shes getting jealous..it does work im a quiet guy but when I wear the product it just gives me a more comfortable feeling..great product.</li>
            <li> The scent is suttle and I combine it with my cologne. I usually get women staring a little longer than usual when I have this on. I will definetly pickup another bottle!</li>
            <li> Good product. I didn&#x27;t expect much from the product in the beginning but i must say it does what it says it will</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work . Also what don&#x27;t buy it is to be lair that&#x27;s function . please do not to be lucer.</li>
            <li> good  product, i like it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product. After reading some of the reviews I was on the fence. I ordered it and to my surprise, it works. I even forgot I had put it on under my cologne and one day i was getting these looks and smiles from women throughout the day. It dawned on me later in the afternoon that I had put this product on. So I did it again, and again I was like the flavor of the day. I like this product..because it is subtle in application but strong on responsiveness from women. Good stuff. I ordered two bottles.</li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t that bad but it doesn&#x27;t work not even a little. Don try these products trust me. !</li>
            <li> This is a very subtle product.  It definitely causes you to get more attention but it doesn&#x27;t have a overpowering smell.  But women that I know that give me hugs almost always mention that I smell nice.  There is definitely a trigger in their brain chemistry when they smell it.  Also, I work as a server in a restaurant and I have noticed an increase in my customer appreciation and satisfaction while I wear this smell at work.</li>
            <li> I try this and so far so good. i like that people are now a little more friendlier then usual. Very potent stuff. Wore it at church btw.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early in this stage of the game to decide whether or not this product works. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my new aroma (oil). Follow instructions on the back regarding where the recommended areas to apply on the body.</li>
            <li> Its works a little on the first try and may use in the future to really see what it can do.</li>
            <li> Women will be more interested in you, they will look at you more but it is still up to you to project confidence, have good hygiene, clean clothing, good social skills if you want the interaction to lead to more.</li>
            <li> i use this regularly and it is very effective</li>
            <li> This product makes initiating conversation a bit easier and is so far worth what it costs.  I use between 2-3 drops, based on that it should last a couple of months.</li>
            <li> It smells good but I have not had it long. Did get a few more hellos than normal. To be continued...</li>
            <li> Been wearing this since I got it and there have been NO changes with the way women interact with me. I&#x27;ve tried it in a lot of different settings and have only received a few comments on the smell of it. I can only surmise that from the positive comments on here that the guys that bought this BELIEVE it works. And that&#x27;s fine. If it makes you more confident I&#x27;m all for it but you could get the same confidence a lot cheaper lol. So as to all of you who are thinking of buying this product, you are buying scented oil, with a misleading name. Nothing more nothing less. Oh and as for the smell, its a nice and not overwhelming like a lot of colognes.</li>
            <li> This product has a pleasant aroma.  I&#x27;m still attempting to determine the correct amount to apply as I use it in various trials.  Granted there may be a placebo effect in which the user feels more self confident, but I&#x27;d like to think there is some science involved.  I&#x27;m not 100% sure it works yet, but I shall continue to try in hopes that I&#x27;m jumped by women as they loose their minds and give into their primal instincts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it once; at work. No added interest yet, but we&#x27;ll see. I do also work with some very big exhaust fans that suck the air out of my work space.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me and my skin type who knows but this product really did not  do anything for me I&#x27;ve worn it several times on clean skin and regular colognes better</li>
            <li> All I can say is that it works for me. It makes them pay attention to you, where before you were not even noticed.</li>
            <li> I wore this and went to a bar/lounge.  When I got to the bar to order a drink, the ladies who were also waiting started a chat with me.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this stuff smells and it pairs really well with other fragrances. I have not had much luck with getting all the attention as claimed by other users however,  the time of use is pretty early to tell whether or not this works. I will say that it does give a sense of new confidence which makes it easier to break the ice with new people.  I recommend for the smell and confidence booster.</li>
            <li> These it&#x27;s not good too ,smel bad ,no woman like ,I don&#x27;t speck any good think ,I trow in to the garbage</li>
            <li> Im choosing 5 stars because this actually works.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my boyfriend the very first night i&lt;br /&gt;received this package, and the way he reacted&lt;br /&gt;was worth the money spent. I sprayed a bit on my wrists&lt;br /&gt;and dabbed it behind the ears. He just sniffled and&lt;br /&gt;rubbed his face in my neck when he gave a hug.&lt;br /&gt;We also cuddled and watched a movie in bed, but&lt;br /&gt;all he wanted to do was talk and hug. I highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;this to anyone that needs a extra boost in their confidence.&lt;br /&gt;it really does open the guys more, and girls seem to react&lt;br /&gt;to it as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product,out of all the pheromones I like this one this best because it works. Best one I used so far. First day it worked.</li>
            <li> I bought the products since while, and I believe these products are so nice and efefctive. I have been using these and suggested my friends to use this.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> You must get close enough for long enough and it will work. About 15 minutes for pheromones to reach the small receptor and trigger an emotional response. Subtle but it&#x27;s noticeable. Don&#x27;t over apply the product as it may overpower and intimidate some with the physical, sexual emotions triggered. The little bottle may release to much oil at one time if you don&#x27;t cover the opening with a finger, tip the bottle over and tip it back up, while keeping your finger on the opening until the fluid is back to the bottom. Then just enough, one dab, on your pulse points, or maybe the collar of shirt. Careful as the oil may soak and leave a mark spot on clothing. I had to do my own research on pheromone applications as there are lack of viable informational directions on the web site or bottle. It would be nice if the company updated with more information and history of pheromones. Thus, I only gave the four stars.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product on a Tuesday night and received it on Thursday. Oil dispenses very well. I&#x27;ve used it everyday since and still have a lot left.</li>
            <li> Seems to work, not sure if its the product or a confidence booster. Has a very light but pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I wore it yesterday, and had a better overall confidence and general reaction from women seemed to be very favorable and receptive.</li>
            <li> No it will not instantly have them come straight to you wanting to do the nasty, but it will for sure do it&#x27;s job in getting their attention. Sometimes yes they will come up to you, but when you have to go up to the women, it will make the success rate as close to 100% as possible.</li>
            <li> I like this product. The spray makes it easier to apply then oil bottle.</li>
            <li> In my first try it seemed to work.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a placebo effect or I was looking for attention.  I&#x27;m an above average looking guy.  I&#x27;m not shy, I have no problem talking with women.  It does seem like they were more chatty than normal.  Again it could just be false confidence thinking the product was helping.  I&#x27;m new to Pheromone products.  These are the first I&#x27;ve tried.  It may help get you noticed but you do have to have some personality to go with it.</li>
            <li> It works. Women subtly  become nicer. You have to play your part still but it makes things a little easier.</li>
            <li> For nothing and can&#x27;t attract women.</li>
            <li> hi,its very very great pheremone oil to attract woman.its great that mens also love this.its changes the mood in seconds.pherex has also other pheremones but its very powerfull. i will use continusly in future.i have recomended it for those they have use other phermones and not get any response.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004SO2SVI PherX Pheromone Oil for Men (Attract Women) - The Science of Attraction-15ml Bottle]]Just got this the other day and I only used it a few times so far and I believe it is working really well. Women sitting next to you will start noticing you more and act more friendly. Definitely going to keep using this spray.</li>
            <li> Try this product, and to my amazement I had girls coming up to me, and getting closer than usual..  Doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all..  I use it everyday..</li>
            <li> It smells really good! Haven&#x27;t had a lot of occasions to use it yet to fully test it but it smells great.</li>
            <li> I could not believe that there&#x27;s such a product. When I tried it, it was amazing. It&#x27;s not magic, but you&#x27;ll notice that females will start wanting to talk to you or forget about time when you&#x27;re around.</li>
            <li> Seems to be more potent than the spray. Have had better results with the oil over the spray. Have noticed getting more looks.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on my neck, wrists, and behind the ears(as the bottle suggests) before getting into bed with my wife.  No, she doesn&#x27;t automatically turn into a raving sex maniac but she does seem more enthused about cuddling which, more often than not, ends up leading to other things.  I&#x27;d say this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li> This product really works for me . I don&#x27;t want to go to the details but you know what I mean:)))</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. Works very well as advertised. Wore it to office the other day and could feel the positive effects immideatley. A couple of ladies in the train also looked at me curiously. Walked into a Jamba juice and the girl on the counter asked me what cologne I was wearing.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 3 star because it smells good for the price but I did not see any change in  female attraction even with my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Its what I payed for but needs a better smell. If u ask me you should try it bad smell or not it works!</li>
            <li> This did not work for me. Wore it around my wife for a day, thinking she would notice, but no luck. Wore it around some females that  I was really close to, they did not notice, either.  not</li>
            <li> Smells good, not really sure how good it works... Idk why people think the review are fake I like it even if it doesn&#x27;t help attract women</li>
            <li> I had read that some pheromone products smells bad, but not the case with this product. Just remember that this is not a magical product. but help, so good luck.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe this actually works definitely recommend buying for people who are curious about it. Trust me I was very skeptical but I just had to try it. It really really works I&#x27;m buying it again layer on this week.</li>
            <li> It really didnt do anything for me,  I am yet to find that product that really works in thT dept. For me. Really need the help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the smell is nasty and it didnt work a bit.  A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This works. You get more attention and more hugs.</li>
            <li> is very good&lt;br /&gt;john porras</li>
            <li> Even though I was assured that this product had no scent other than the faint pheromone fragrance, the bottle I received had a strong odor reminiscent of Irish Spring bath soap. Like Irish Spring, the perfume in this pheromone oil triggered an asthma attack the moment I sniffed it. I&#x27;ve used other companies&#x27; pheromone oils and have never encountered a problem like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately returned the product for a refund.</li>
            <li> Scent is very weak as compared to the PherX I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product I was concerned about whether it was worth the cash. After trying it for a week I&#x27;ve noticed more attention and caught more looks. I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> As reported, this has no smell that will interfear with any colonge that you are wearing.  I have been using this product for 5-days and are still waiting for any type of response from my wife.</li>
            <li> awesome it boost my confidence because it works, I recommend this product  if you are not a very good lokking guy!!!! thanks</li>
            <li> PherX Pheromones is an amazing product. I loved it.i suggest u to go for it n get all what u deserve.</li>
            <li> i love it, smells good and i think that it works a little lol!</li>
            <li> I have noticed more attention but not any flat-out aggressive suitors...I will keep trying this product, though.  I recommend it....if you buy, place on areas where you sweat and on your pulse points...they don&#x27;t tell you this in the instructions....</li>
            <li> Of course self confidence is the best pheromone -but this product can help get her to notice your self confidence.</li>
            <li> Product is very easy to apply. It has a nice smell, although not overpowering. Seems to work with most women, and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working. My wife doesn&#x27;t seem to get annoyed with me like usual and is more affectionate.</li>
            <li> I was not too sure if this product would work, but it definitely attracts the opposite sex. Women seemed more friendly  and open.</li>
            <li> I’m kind of disappointed with this product, especially the price is not worth it, I experiment with some of my close women friends and they said that smell nice (nothing extraordinary). Is more psychological than the product itself, because you think you are attracting the opposite sex, makes you more confident and that self-assured makes you sexier. But is not the smell! This is a simple math, easy to test with the opposite sex in an open conversation, ask your sisters or brothers someone that it won’t have any interest in you, and ask them is the smell makes them fill attracted to you. Now that I know the fragrance I smell it anywhere. I think that I’m going to change business; this is like taking a child a candy. This product is not worth it for the price; I won’t pay more than $10.00 as a simple regular perfume, nothing else. If need this to makes you more confident, buy it.</li>
            <li> It does something to the ladies to pay closer attention to you, to smile more and to approach you for conversation.  They wont rip your clothes off but the best way I can explain it is that it opens the door for you. That protective force field that women put up at first DOES drop so use that opportunity to turn your game on.  It is up to you after that. I recommend this product. BUT in my next order I will order the spray instead of the oil. I just prefer the spray. Only my preference. Product works in either form. Good luck!</li>
            <li> It seems no use at all.</li>
            <li> I love it... Smell great&lt;br /&gt;It was packed nicely and secure. It arrived very quickly without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;Already seen some attraction</li>
            <li> This lightweight, clear oil has a subtle, very pleasing fragrance - women seem to be attracted to something about it - whether it&#x27;s the pheromones, the fragrance, or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether its efficacy is dependent upon one&#x27;s unique body chemistry, but I certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, good for ordinary use&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as room aroma</li>
            <li> I think it really works ? It seems to work on men also ... sheeze !</li>
            <li> testing the chemical to see if it really works</li>
            <li> Do pheromone products work?  Perhaps, but the strongest effect is probably placebo effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zyloo Labs (PherX) indicates that these products are effective for up to four hours.  I would say more like two to three hours. They also indicate that it can be expected to be effective at a distance of three to five feet.  As far as I can tell the only noticeable effect is darn near &amp;#34;point blank&amp;#34; (about one foot or less).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Response may depend a lot on the female inhaling the pheromones.  I have been conducting research and every female has indicated she likes the smell.  However as far as an &amp;#34;attractant&amp;#34; as the product is pitched, only one female (out of about 50 test subjects) actually responded with what you&#x27;d indicate as &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My intuition after two months of research and observing reactions is that the response is extremely variable (unpredictable), generally minor (might get an extra smile or two), and overall other factors (self confidence) will be far stronger influences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the spray version because it delivers a nice solid burst which is plenty to apply. The &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; version is best used for dabbing a little behind the ears or any other location where you want precision in placing it.  The applicator on the oil bottle is poorly designed and if you put your fingertip on the top of the bottle then use it like you would any cologne you will get almost nothing out of the bottle, you have to be a bit creative and aggressive with the oil bottle to get any reasonable amount out.  Thus I prefer the spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I wife gets loves it when I add it to my cologne!</li>
            <li> I cannot definitively claim that this product resulted in the attraction of my wife or any other women whom I encountered in public. I easily meet other people so my nature might have something to do with the way others relate to me. Will try experimenting, it is important to me that my wife will always feel special about me.</li>
            <li> I got mine the other day... slip it on with your regular cologne and you&#x27;re ready to go. It&#x27;s not an over powering aroma and I actually like it better than the spray. It&#x27;s more controllable on it&#x27;s application.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this has no scent and can be dropped onto a burning candle.  That is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion I think it works, it helps women talk and be more active with you in person</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this product for a couple years now this is a great product I would recommend it to anyone. it pairs well with any cologne that you might want to wear with</li>
            <li> I have giving this some time to try it out. I find it really has a slight easing quality to it. Women seem to be less anxious or nervous when I wear it. Doesn&#x27;t make anyone chase after you! I think it is calming but not hypnotic. Great for anyone who has clients!</li>
            <li> Got laid first time I used it. A++</li>
            <li> Pherx works well. It has a nice smell to it and it seems that I get more attention, girls feel more comfortable around me and want to linger near me longer, and are more touchy feely for sure. I like it and its cool knowing you have a secret upper hand on the women where they dont even know why they are more attracted and interested in you. Try it out !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different product but bought this out of curiosity.  It smells extremely pleasant and will go a long way.  Tried it today at the gym, worked up a little sweat while lifting weights, noticed some serious looks from the women.  I am very pleased.  Saving $50.00 off the original price is also a huge plus so I definitely will be purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to help boost his self esteem. It smells weird and I&#x27;m not sure it has been getting him any more noticed by women at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure if these kind of products really function like they should! I do not know for sure!</li>
            <li> I love playing and mixing essential oils, so I thought it might be interesting to add PherX into my personal mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a mild, pleasant scent that&#x27;s perfect for laying underneath your existing colognes/smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that women are more interested - it&#x27;s subtle, guys.  Women won&#x27;t throw themselves on you just because of how you smell. It&#x27;s really about using their sense of smell, drawing them in and making them more curious about you.  What you do with it after that is up to you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m looking at PherX as a secret, but subtle weapon - another tool in the tool belt.  A worthy investment...</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping - Came not to my house, but to my po box which surprised me as I used my house address for shipping.  It came in a big yellow envelope and was wrapped in packaging bubbles, which did the job as it arrived safely.. I was worried after reading some reviews that it may leak in transit, but that was not the case thankfully.  Now, the big question.. does it work as advertised? My answer is truthfully, I don&#x27;t know yet.  Probably not what you wanted to hear after reading through these reviews.  I was very skeptical, and read through a bunch of reviews before I bought it.. unfortunately I can&#x27;t give you a solid answer myself.    As far as smell goes, I couldn&#x27;t detect any fragrance just as advertised. Many other reviews claim a sweet aroma, but as far as I can tell there is no smell to it.    I put some on and went out to my local watering hole to see what, if any results I would have.  I would say I had an average night, and talked with the same amount of people (men and women) as I normally do.  I did however receive quite a bit more attention and flirtiness from the bartender..  She has been working there ever since I&#x27;ve been a patron, and I&#x27;ve always been flirty and talkative with her (she&#x27;s a young hot bartender, who wouldn&#x27;t!), but last night she paid a lot more attention to me, and I wasn&#x27;t tipping exceptionally well or anything out of the ordinary. She was unusually flirty with me - even to the point of staying and buying me shots after her shift was over. (Just me, not my buddy).  She hung out at our table for a long while before she left.  I&#x27;ve been going there over 2 years and that has never happened before.  It was like she noticed me for the first time or something.  Coincidence or something else?  Who knows.    I will continue to try it in different settings and see what happens.  I gave it four stars, because like other reviewers, it did give me an added boost of confidence.. whether placebo or not, it can&#x27;t hurt anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 if it was not for the offer of free sample-for-review.  Seeing so many 4- and 5-star reviews with \\&quot;four stars\\&quot; in the review, makes me doubt other reviews.    I had positive results, be it my added self-confidence, or pheromonal attraction, doesn&#x27;t matter, i put it on, i get more glances, and that&#x27;s all i need.    Glances, and maybe smiles, is all it gives you, you&#x27;ll have to work your magic to get the girls to like you, and maybe love you.    I&#x27;ve always had my way with the ladies, even before using this, but these pheromones have been a good boost to me. If that&#x27;s all you need, it&#x27;s worth a try, if you&#x27;re shy, and would let a chance run you by, don&#x27;t waste your hopes on this.    If you use it to get the edge, don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re cheating; over the years, I learned that the most lovely person you&#x27;ll meet may not look attractive. And many may miss their chance to meet her/him and fall in love with them because of the way they look.    If pheromones remove the bias we have towards pretty faces / bodies, this may level the playing field for both men and women.    Happy hunting!</li>
            <li> Had absolutely no luck or see any difference using the product. As usual I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> OK except smell strong</li>
            <li> I tried before a similar product, but only this gave me the results that I expected, thanks!!!.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product. I still remember I went to walk around the mall. I wasn&#x27;t sure what the respond would be and I was not sure if there was going to be any thing different around me. I was WRONG! First time using the oil of PherX I got a # and the lady ...I felt was interested in me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She gave me her # I called her the next day and we met up. The rest is history...EVERYTHING WENT REALLY GOOD. You must try it and just be in the mindset that it will work for you. I have bought my 2nd bottle and it last pretty good. About Month or 2. Depending on the use and how much you put on. Well worth the price! Try it!</li>
            <li> Unless you count the 4 dogs that would try to mount me whenever I&#x27;d wear this stuff - ALL MALE and VERY DETERMINED.&lt;br /&gt;I used the remaining on Sadie, my dog - a female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works for someone, just not me - a human, male.</li>
            <li> As I use the PHERX more it seems to have more of an affect. In the future I will comment again with further details.</li>
            <li> Impressive experience after first time use!</li>
            <li> Really works. Women keep showing more interest in me. Improves self image and confidence.</li>
            <li> This product is effective. It helps boost confidence while working around women. The only product in the market which works.</li>
            <li> I received the item broken, since it made with glass, why cant it be made with plastic, so much cheaper and easier to ship</li>
            <li> I have used pheromone products for years, and like many of you I have purchased many products that were essentially perfumed snake oil.&lt;br /&gt;However, a few years ago I started using PherX and I have noticed a huge increase in the level of comfort women have with me. The times when I do not use PherX I can tell the difference, when I do use PherX women are more attentive towards me initiating eye contact and physical touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I apply PherX is simple. I place a drop or two on my finger and rub it directly on my skin in areas of my body that “stink”, and by that I mean the areas that produce odor (crotch, ears, armpits, etc.). After applying PherX, I then apply my deodorant or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With PherX it is not necessary to shower or bath daily, unless you get really dirty or sweaty during the day, PherX enhances your natural pheromones that are washed away by the chemicals used in many soaps today. The effects of PherX seem to build up the more I use it, so I do not recommend washing it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of Pseudoscience out there in regards to pheromones and their efficacy within the human mating ritual. However, I can provide solid testimony that this product WORKS and the results are immediate. I have women who used to HATE me now smiling and vying for my attention when less than a week ago they wanted little to nothing to do with me. I have women inviting ME into their homes and WANTING to see ME again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to spend money on fancy clothes or expensive status symbols with this product, PherX works better than a Ferrari. PherX gives me a boost in confidence when I see it working, which may influence the way I interact with women thus influencing the way women interact with me, for that alone it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this product even more amazing is the way that women interact with me now. I notice that women agree more with what I say, women perceive sexual innuendos in my statementsthat don’t exist, and I even have women who are in relationships giving me attention that I don’t even want! It is amazing how effective this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, don’t take my word for it. Just buy a bottle and see for yourself, it works.</li>
            <li> Great cologne scent! It works! I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> smells good but that&#x27;s it  and doesn&#x27;t even last the long. total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t attract women its a joke</li>
            <li> I DID NOT expect a miracle here, but for the billing to be Extra Strength and it to be the oil, meaning it&#x27;d last longer, it had NO effect that I could tell. My first use of it was in a heavily female oriented environment. I was only curious to see if my date would notice. She did not. Not even the slight scent that is present upon putting it on but quickly disappears.  I would not but this product again. But curiousity was with me. I blew 30 odd bucks on it because of that. I&#x27;ll just stick to good hygiene and a nice cologne as I have been.</li>
            <li> This is the second pheromone oil I have used, as by far my favorite. It can be used alone or in combination with your favorite cologne. A little of this oil goes a long way - just apply a small amount to wrists and neck and it almost instantly gives you a boost of confidence. PherX makes great products, I would also recommend their pheromone sprays. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> The smell fades away quickly,&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen any results yet.&lt;br /&gt;Will try more and give a more complete review later</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant fairly subtle smell that my girlfriend likes, but I have not noticed more attraction from her or any other woman so far.</li>
            <li> It works no reason for me to lie or promote this product, it&#x27;s the truth.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, and wow. It works great. He has also noticed a real difference at work. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Not any type of holy grail, but it appears to have a positive effect on any women nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 1/17/2016&lt;br /&gt;Definitely has a positive effect, my friends have all complimented me on smelling good. I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d work very well in a crowded bar but on small dates, it&#x27;s done wonders. As a side note: this won&#x27;t do it alone, but it definitely helps improve confidence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/24/2016&lt;br /&gt;A lot of my coworkers will tell me I smell good. My girlfriend absolutely loves the smell and always asks me what cologne I wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using pheromones for the last 2 years and I figured I would try something different. I really love this product and I wore it on a date with someone I&#x27;ve been attracted to for months. Needless to say she is finally coming around after our night out. ;) I got tons of looks from other women even her friend who was with her. If you need an extra edge you need to get this product.</li>
            <li> PherX is great...I put it on and my wife was friendly and more sexual than normal......I also went to Home Depot and struck up a conversation with a lady and she seemed very friendly...I thought it was my imagination but I had on the Pherx....anyhow it worked for me...good luck</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this stuff work but it really does. My wife is way more touchy feeley with me and always want me. Love this stuff</li>
            <li> not sure I notice any difference</li>
            <li> I started using this and I haven&#x27;t notice any change but I will be updating this with the time of usage</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my interactions maybe just a boost of confidence</li>
            <li> This was an easy one my aid gave me my shower this morning, I put some on and as she gave me my massage, it was a very special message she  is plaining on giving me another message in the Morning. But she could barely walk when she left. She is not plan on leaving tomarrow, an all night-er</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Used on wife. Didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s put it this way, something magic will happen. Wearing this product will get female attention. It&#x27;s as if your friend is introducing you to every female in the room. This product will get you the introduction, it won&#x27;t however get the female to rip your clothes off spontaneously and attack you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what you will notice during a conversation is that they are more willing to open up to you. There will be more touching, there will be more smiling. And if you make it to the bedroom... Good luck! Hopefully you&#x27;ve got good endurance! Haha</li>
            <li> Seems to be a decent product.  So far, I have seen a difference on how my wife looks at me.  Her eyes seem to dilate a bit more while she&#x27;s standing close to me.  She is also a bit more inclined for some fun in non-standard locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as other women around me and in my life, coworkers seem to be just as friendly as usual, although I have to admit that I&#x27;m not paying very close attention to them as I do my spouse (watching body movement and eye dilation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t really have much of a scent, per se.  It&#x27;s a great additive to your usual cologne.  I place a bit just behind the ears tracing down the front neck along the arteries, and the pulse points in the inner elbow joint.  This gives the pheromone juice something to work with, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may ask the spouse to go with me to a club sometime in order to test reaction of other females in the room (purely scientific, of course!).  From her reaction with it the first time I applied it to the points, this ought to have a decent effect on others as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, this is NOT something you can apply and have every woman in the room notice and need you.  You still have to be confident in yourself and in your environment.  It&#x27;s an addition to the game, not a magic juice that will have women clamoring over you.</li>
            <li> It makes women pay more attention for sure. I&#x27;ve noticed women at work standing around me for no reason especially at lunch. Try it</li>
            <li> I have been wearing the oil for a few days now, I put it on my neck and wrists. It has a nice smell and blends nicely with my cologne. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my wife or other ladies yet but I will keep wearing it and pay more attention.</li>
            <li> Not much happen! Ok so I rated the product a one star! My suggestion is to go back to the lab and try your product on</li>
            <li> The effects are subtle but noticeable.  Much better price than other similar products I have used.  The oil seems to retain the pheromone better than straight liquid as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve order this product and been using it for a few days now. This product does work. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I put it on and went to the club, I left with five different phone numbers.  I really like the results this oil gave me.</li>
            <li> It worked after the second time I used it.  I thought it was going to be a really strong smelling and oily but is not.</li>
            <li> This is snake oil.... you&#x27;ve been warned... The reviews are fake; look at the profiles... I wish I would have before I bought it...</li>
            <li> We will see how this works...I&#x27;m giving it a 5 star review in advance because it smells like pussy to me, so it will definitely work on at least one of us, and hopefully both....</li>
            <li> To start off this is a difficult product to assess if its really works.  I have been applying it to my wrists and behind my ears as suggested by the bottle.  The smell is very mild and I can&#x27;t say that I personally notice it after the first few minutes of applying it.  I do feel like women are more willing to talk and engage me in conversation when I&#x27;m using it. However, I haven&#x27;t noticed the more extreme reactions described by some other reviewers.  I give it 4 stars because while I have been pleased with the results, I had hoped for a somewhat more obvious response.</li>
            <li> I tried the pheromone oil a couple of times and it does work, i noticed that I gain more attention from more women, thanks</li>
            <li> Great product. I see females are a lot more engaging with me. I&#x27;ve personally sprayed it on my hand and ask a girl if she liked it and she said yeah. so this is definitely one more foot in the door if a special girl you wanna get involved with..</li>
            <li> This has a really subtle and clean fragrance.  It seems to work too.  I sneaked it on without telling my wife and noticed a wild look in her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very fast and arrived in two days with my prime account.  Bottle was safety sealed in nice padded box.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pheromone products for several years now and have come to respect Zyloo products.  This one is no exception as it works at advertised and is offered at a fair price.  I&#x27;m generally not a big fan of oil-based pheromone products as some that I&#x27;ve tried have left a residue on clothing that doesn&#x27;t always wash out.  With that said, oil-based products have their place and purpose, and if you know what you&#x27;re doing, they can be an asset.  This product is one such asset.  It has a pleasant smell that would justify its purchase even if it were not pheromone-infused. Combined with an extra-strong dose of pheromones, this product sits firmly in the \\&quot;win\\&quot; category.  Whether from its fragrant oil base or from its pheromone infusion, this product helps you to gain the right kind of attention, and if you&#x27;re completely honest with yourself, gaining the right kind of attention is why you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing this product in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an oil-based product, so it will not evaporate off in a warm environment as some alcohol-based products can.  Oil-base means that it&#x27;s around for the full day and at least my nose can detect it over 24 hours later.  This also means that you can over do it, so start off light and build up.  This stuff works, so too much will have the exact opposite effect from what you&#x27;re looking for and will make you seem too aggressive and daunting.  Another advantage of this product&#x27;s oil base is that it doesn&#x27;t become fully absorbed by the skin and tends to stay on the top.  Just a little contact seems to release it again, which can be a real plus if you use it wisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this product for a couple of days, and during that time, I&#x27;ve noticed an increased level of attention.  I&#x27;m a short balding little troll who will never be confused with George Clooney, but with this product, I get more than my fair share of attention in the workplace.  I have to assume that if I used this product in the club scene that I&#x27;d probably get a good amount of attention there too, as the warm humid nature of clubs would naturally cause perspiration, which would release this product into the air around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that pheromones only work in close quarters, they do not work on everyone, and that even when they work as advertised they will not make women throw themselves at you.  Pheromone products will not make clothing magically melt off.  They will also not make up for lack of grooming, lack of hygiene or a complete lack of social skills.  What they will do is remind others that you&#x27;re there so that they can take notice of all the good things that you have going for you.  The rest is up to you.I&#x27;d probably get a good amount of attention there too, as the warm humid nature of clubs would naturally cause perspiration, which would release this product into the air around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that pheromones only work in close quarters, they do not work on everyone, and that even when they work as advertised they will not make women throw themselves at you.

            <li> Smells good, works good. I have no complaints. Works good with your Cologne. its worth the money. Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Many products are heavily scented with perfumes that stand out on their own.  PherX Pheromone Oil for Men seems to have only the scent of the pheromone, which is a big plus if one doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a cologne factory.  The oil is a bit runny, so be careful to prevent spills.</li>
            <li> It seem to help me get along with females even on a day to day basis.  It dose seem to get the attention of some that usually dont notice. All in all its worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the second pheromone oil I have tried recently, the first being Arouse RX extra stregnth which I love.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll admit that I was a bit discouraged about this because right after I placed the order on this product, I noticed that the reviews did in fact seem fake. But it was too late and I already ordered this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I wasn&#x27;t dissapointed when I recieved this, I put it on as soon as I got it and went to the movies. I went to meet up with a very old female friend of mine and her friend whome I have never met before. The results were alot different than the arouse Rx results.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the change immediatly, it seems that this oil makes people trust me more, where as arouse rx is more of an aggressive arousal. I actually like this much better because it draws people in easier, rather then just making them highly aroused wich can accutally backfire because they are afraid of loosing control and avoid me more in daytime social situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something I can wear day or night because it seems to create more of a relaxed arrousal. I have worn this at a bar and a club with very good results! Just be carefull because the effects seems to lessen if you wear this every single day, you have to give it a little break and the results go back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not the best reviewer because this is my second review ever, but my goal is to try many pheromones and give reviews of them all. I will up date this information as I try this oil out more, and make reviews as I learn how to better communicate on these reviews. any questions, feel free to ask in the comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I feel it is a shame there are fake reviews floating around, but in my experience this oil works to make women much more relaxed inviting and slightly sexually aroused. I recomend it.</li>
            <li> I have to say, Im not sure if it makes a difference with other women but i will say it gives u a huge boost of confidence.&lt;br /&gt;I find my self having more conversations with random women. I feel that the sent is having a affect.Its very light and blends with all perfumes!&lt;br /&gt;Overall i like the product.</li>
            <li> This is a lot of bang for the buck. Its scent is the same as \\&quot;normal\\&quot; Pherx, but the effect lasts and lasts, and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, and I notice increased interactions from women. A few women I&#x27;ve tried to approach myself have not seemed to be affected by it, which makes sense. It usually works, but if it doesn&#x27;t work for you in some situations, at least you smell nice.</li>
            <li> Who knows whether this helped or not, but having this may boost your confidence and make you feel more attractive. It worked for me :)</li>
            <li> It must be mixed with your favorilte lotion or cologne, just a  few drops will do it, make sure you use ite 2 hours beacuse that is when it is strongest&lt;br /&gt;good luck!!!!</li>
            <li> C......R......A......P.&lt;br /&gt;Quite simply, it does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> This product does not work as intended. It only fools you into thinking you have an advantage over other people. If you research pheromones you will find that what these company&#x27;s are claiming isn&#x27;t yet possible with current technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You taking a sugar pill and your mind is altering your body for a placebo effect.  Talking to yourself in the mirror would have a greater influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh did I mention almost every review is fake. Yeah, that&#x27;s right this company made some 13 amazon accounts \\&quot;bought\\&quot; the item and gave a scripted review with 5-4 stars. I bet they didn&#x27;t even ship the items out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damn con artist.</li>
            <li> Just bought this, love the scent, and so do women!</li>
            <li> Not sure that i really notice any real effects when wearing this oil, but it does smell pretty good.  Will update if any real changes are noticed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x60;t review this product, because i haven&#x60;t use it just.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x60;m going on vacation in October 2015, then I&#x60;ll use it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x60;ll reviewed then. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have found that while wearing this product women and men seem to be more open and engaging with me.  I highly recommend PherX.</li>
            <li> I tried this product being a little sceptical, but after trying it i&#x27;m a true believer.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again I hope everyone who buys this item has similiar success.</li>
            <li> At first i wasn&#x27;t sure on buying this product or not but now that i have it i love this little bottle</li>
            <li> Giving credit where it&#x27;s due. The first day wearing this, a woman struck up conversation with me, and we now have a date set for tomorrow. Granted, she knew of me indirectly (mutual friends) and recognized me from facebook, but results are results. This is only day one, I&#x27;ll come back and update this after some more experience.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me even with the NPA Pheromone Additive. Would not waste my money on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still debating the effectiveness of the Pherx Pheromone, however, I can say that &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; is working.  Not that the attention is at all &amp;#34;naughty&amp;#34; in nature, rather, I seem to be garnering high esteem from colleagues, acquaintances, and management.  Nevertheless, whatever is going on is a welcome change.</li>
            <li> I like the subtle smell it puts off. Other brands I have tried either smell too strong or have no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as efficacy, I seem to get more lovin lately from the Mrs. I haven&#x27;t changed anything and went from 2x/week to 4.  Maybe this is just a fluke since I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but even if it doesn&#x27;t work, it still smells nice. But, I think it does work. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure on the effects yet as I haven&#x27;t been out and about much, but this stuff smells great. I almost bought the spray, but decided on this instead. Maybe next go around I&#x27;ll get the spray</li>
            <li> nothing different, have not scored yet, lol...</li>
            <li> It works for me. Second time around.</li>
            <li> I was curious about whether pheromones worked so I bought this without telling my wife and tried it without her knowledge to see if it had any effect on her. I can&#x27;t say that I noticed a thing. The first night I put it on and made no advances to her. She made none toward me either. The third night I put some on and made advances which she eagerly accepted, but that is normal. Can&#x27;t say this product made any difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using PherX Oil for Men with great success. Using the oil seems more discreet and less smelly than a spray. Women love it, you can change her mood once she gets close&lt;br /&gt;;) I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I find this very nice to wear. Not over powering. Easy to use and not greasy. I have tried their other products and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> This products works great. I have had great results using it.</li>
            <li> This product really works. I just got it in the mail today and after going to the local bar I noticed that I was much more interesting to ladies. I ended up leaving with 2 phone numbers and a good feeling of self confidence. Looks like Pherox really knows what they are doing. It&#x27;s a good product definitely worth buying. I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> First time wearing it ended up grabbing a girl I&#x27;ve been trying to holler at for a while. Also wore it out meeting up with a girl that I&#x27;ve known for a while , and she to seemed to be all over me.</li>
            <li> this product is a straight out lie.  as for the men that reviewed it saying that i works wonders to attract women well i believe they live on another planet.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Whether the pheromones are actually working or if I&#x27;m experiencing some sort of placebo effect remains to be determined. Overall however I do enjoy wearing the product.</li>
            <li> Came in cracked what a joke don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> The best buy that I made !!!</li>
            <li> It has a faint sweet smell to it. I tried it for the first time today and everyone I interacted with seemed to be more talkative especially the women.</li>
            <li> I cannot fully state at this time if this product works or not.  The first test I did just for fun was dinner with friends in a nice restaurant.  An attractive blonde server for some reason gave me a lot of attention and was kind of touchy feely.  Never really had that happen to me in the past dealing with attractive female servers from restaurants before using this product.  I would need to have further testing to see if the product is really effective.  Overall I like the Pherx oil. It smells clean and light.  The shipping from Zyloo Labs was fast.  Received the product promptly in a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using PherX Pheromone Oil for more than two years already and I&#x27;m a happy... let me say it again, HAPPY customer. Why? Because it works!!! I put a couple of drops on my neck and wrist, add some of the regular cologne I normally wear, and I&#x27;m ready to go; and I really can tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I add only the oil. Both ways, it works. I get more attention from females, they notice me right away; and the very first, sometimes the second thing they say is &amp;#34;You smell so good&amp;#34;. And the conversation starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. Actually, I&#x27;ts the only Pheromone product, after trying a few, that I can recommend.</li>
            <li> This product has enhanced my interactions with women, since I have been using this product have have noticed that women are more chatty. This product has a subtle sweet smell, but not overpowering. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to enhance their interactions with women.</li>
            <li> I knew about pheromones and their use for a while. I didn&#x27;t believe pheromones out of a bottle would work vs the pheromone we naturally produce. Ever since i started using this product, results have been good for me. I get a lot of eye contact and smiles from girls in school. This is gonna get you a lot of attention but what you do with that attention is all up to you. It makes you more confident around people and people start to like you more in general.</li>
            <li> I do not feel this product helps at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it four times since I got it , and not only have I not noticed absolutely any positive impact, but twice it has made me dizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to say this is a scam, but it is for sure not as advertised.</li>
            <li> Man this thing worked from the 1st start. I love it man I will be ordering it again and its a good price for it</li>
            <li> Ladies notice me more and sometimes approach me. it works! it isnt a miracle item though, you still have to possess social skills to develop a relationship with someone.</li>
            <li> It is hard to say with precision....I have tested the product now for some weeks, using it in special occasions, and I must say that I have found a difference in the way women interacted with me. At any rate it smells good. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Assists with getting the libido started again with my wife after suffering an ordeal with prostate cancer treatments.  This product puts the zest back regarding relations.  Highly recommend this company, especially since their customer service is very reliable and respectful.  Can e-mail them with all types of situations and questions and the representative is very considerate and helpful. Try this product line since a specialist doctor recommends this item at private consultations.</li>
            <li> So I have been using the PherX for Men (Attract Women) cologne for almost 2 years.  I was able to get the oil form a week ago today.  Well it&#x27;s working.  I was at a warehouse store a few days ago, and honest to god the woman behind the counter was talking loudly about how good someone smelled: I was next in line.  Also, I like the consistency of the oil.  It feels nice, the oil.  I will be using this stuff indefinitely.</li>
            <li> I put some of this on the other night when I went clubbing. Met up with a girl I&#x27;ve been talking to on a dating site. She was all over me by the end of the night. Which is rare luck for me. But I truly believe it wasn&#x27;t luck. I think this stuff actually worlds like it says it will. I will test it again shortly, but for now I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff worked amazingly with this girl I&#x27;ve liked for a long time. It worked really well the the cologne I bought. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Definitely has some effect. The girl ive been seeing was definitely more cuddly and eager, but more testing is needed to determine the degree</li>
            <li> From my experience the oil seems to last much longer than spray pheromones. The smell is subtle but very inviting for the opposite sex. I&#x27;ve tried nexus pheromones, pherlure, ice breaker, and pure instinct. All of them had decent and some better than other results. But this product gives me consistent results in a close proximity setting. Everyone is so warm, inviting, and striking up convos with people you desire to do it with is as easy as turning a key. Mind you, you still got to be a gentleman and have good hygiene, stay fit, and not act like a douche towards women and you&#x27;ll come out a winner easy.</li>
            <li> Its not worth it. Save your money and buy Old Spice Swagger works much better.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s working or not. Maybe I am using it wrong or I am just at the wrong place. I partnered it with lacoste noir which was a strong cologne a couple of times. I put a small amount on my neck and wrist. The only place I go to meet women is the gym. I see several beautiful women there. Majority have boyfriends or husbands. If I see a ring, I pass and move on.  The difficult part is approaching them. I am just an average guy, but slim. I&#x27;m getting to be toned a bit. My specialty is core and balance.  Not a lot of guys can do that. Most of them just hit the weights and stay there.  They do have a lot of muscles though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say I am not really lucky with women.  And I am hoping this will give me the opportunity for them to initiate the conversation instead of me all the time. Most of the time I wave my hand a little to catch their attention. They normally respond.  It is always like that. I always initiate the conversation.  And often, I don&#x27;t get any real interest from them.  Note that I&#x27;m a wide reader so I can have a smart and fun conversation at all times.  I sense if they are interested or not based on their responses.  I will still see. This time, I am just going to wear it by itself without any cologne. And I might try to be closer to the girl so she can smell me. Maybe that&#x27;s the trick.  If not, I will try to go to the arts museum.  The last time I went there, I saw a lot of beautiful women.  Women are always attracted to art.  Guys just hang there to look for girls. So, my approach will probably be to stand next to the lady looking at the art and ask for her honest opinion about it. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I liked the way the PherX mixes with other fragrances. I was able to use my normal after-shave with it. The oil seems to last longer than a few hours. Overall a good product to use.</li>
            <li> This is TRULY one of the very best pheromone colognes I have ever tried. Without exaggeration, I can honestly say this stuff REALLY works like a charm! Not only do more women notice me, but they actually seem compelled to start a conversation with me as well. I am totally satisfied with this product, and plan to buy more soon!! 👍👍</li>
            <li> so far i am not seeing the results i was hoping for but i am staying optimistic! hope to attract a better majority soon</li>
            <li> I brought this product because a friend recommended it may help with spicing up my relationship, it&#x27;s a odorless oil very thin, and water base my opinion only not worth the money for myself would not buy this product again</li>
            <li> does not do as advertised would not  suggest to anyone to buy  it does not work just plain and simple</li>
            <li> Good product it works and it&#x27;s Odorless it was a good experience if you are in control</li>
            <li> I had never tried any of this before so I decided to try this one And the first time I used it I got a very positive response.</li>
            <li> smells really nice just started using it can&#x27;t really tell if it works yet</li>
            <li> I cannot yet say if the product is attracting women or not, but I can say the smell is nice. Even though the smell doesn&#x27;t last a long time, (about an hour or two) it does give me more confidence.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a definite &amp;#34;ice breaker&amp;#34; effect, especially with women who had previously been aloof. As long as your expectations are realistic and not ridiculous, I would recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> appears to have a effect as ladies seem more interactive. Actually ahd a co worker that went out of her way to lean into me and take a huge smell.</li>
            <li> Amazing! The first time I put this on I noticed the effects. A gorgeous girl who I have known for over two years and has always been strictly un-flirtatious with me began to hang ALL OVER me. When I walk into a circle of people now, while I used to feel like I had to fight to get any attention, all the girls are instantly focused on me and displaying signs of interest. I have honestly gotten laid more in the past two weeks of using this product than in the preceding two years. Not exaggerating. I counted.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely, definitely continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Works as good as - or better than - more expensive pheromone colognes out there.&lt;br /&gt;And they offered me a free product just for being a first time buyer.  Win-Win!</li>
            <li> Just started trying the Pherx Oil, and already blown away by the results. Spoke with a woman in a department store and already have a date with her after the first try. I can not wait to see what more this will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;Jamesj</li>
            <li> I tried the product for a week, it seems to work. Women turn their heads at me....one was even stalking me while my girlfriend was around. I like the smell. However, the fragrance fades after 10 minutes...I don&#x27;t know if the females can smell it though. All in all amazing product and I will most likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Purchased the \\&quot;PherX Pheromone Oil for Men (Attract Women) - The Science of Attraction - 20mg of Human Pheromones\\&quot; and tried it with my fiance. Even after a stressful day moving and unloading into our new house, she was eager to jump on me and \\&quot;get it on\\&quot;. Just a little oil on pulsating areas i.e. wrist, under jawbone on neck did it for her. She said \\&quot;don&#x27;t know what it is, I was really in the mood. The problem was with this product, my eyes stung a little after putting it on. Maybe I accidently rub some of the oil on my eyes when rubbing my eyes. Be sure to wash your hands/fingers after placing the oil on you.</li>
            <li> my high recommendation.  and you will be pleased with this product.  i have no complaints.  would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Well first off the hole in the spout is big so a lot of it comes out when you pour. I feel more confident but people and girls treat me the same. The smell is pretty nice but for the price it&#x27;s not worth it. I&#x27;ll keep putting it on though in hopes something changes</li>
            <li> The stuff does work, but your partner still needs to be in the mood.  If she isn&#x27;t having it, you&#x27;re not getting it.  If her mind is elsewhere, thinking of more stressful thinking, the last thing she&#x27;s going to think about is a little hanky-panky.  Use it when you know she&#x27;s going to want to sit with you, watching the game or a movie.  You&#x27;ll find the product does get her thinking about it and it seems to add to her pleasure, bringing out a little more desire for her part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in conjunction with the spray version. Not sure if it has made any difference or not. I&#x27;ve used it at work, school, and the gym. At work, I did notice that one of the girls I work with was much more talkative than usual (not usually the case) and she would stand really close to me. At the gym, I also noticed that some of the girls near me would be glancing over fairly often. Is it from the oil or spray? Could it be placebo? Not sure. Maybe it only works on some people...I do feel more confident while wearing it tho (I will say that). I gave it 3 stars simply because I have not seen enough results to give it 5 stars. Will continue to use it and will post a follow-up if anything changes. I do enjoy the smell!</li>
            <li> I,f your ready for a elevation in your sexual exploration then step 1 is this product , then step 2 brace for impact!</li>
            <li> I recently recieved my bottle of PherX Pherome Oil for Men.. I went out tonight and seemed to attact much more attention than I have in the past.. If this experience is indicative of what I can expect.. I&#x27;m sure to become a steady customer.. Kudo&#x27;s Zyloo Labs !</li>
            <li> First of all, the delivery service from the seller was really good, they shipped on time and with the item as described.&lt;br /&gt;Second about the product, although the seller encourages for the customer to leave feedback this has been a hard&lt;br /&gt;product for me to review, the reason is because I would have said that I didnt really notice any change if it was not&lt;br /&gt;because of a couple of details, note that this is not magic and I am not reviewing as such, however I was much more&lt;br /&gt;observant of behavioral reactions, mainly related to trust, thinking that the product may work similar to what oxytocine&lt;br /&gt;does, which is believed to increase the level of trust between two individuals, trying to identify them with non verbal&lt;br /&gt;signs.&lt;br /&gt;No major change thus far, however I can mention a few details, a couple happened at retailers, and it happened with&lt;br /&gt;both a male and a female, being observant of the customers before me and after me, I noticed that these people,&lt;br /&gt;chatted a bit more in a \\&quot;familiar tone\\&quot; compared to the people before my turn and after, like if I was already a frequent customer,&lt;br /&gt;note that like everyone I am exposed to retailers quite often and even though 2 out of I dont know how many, may not&lt;br /&gt;be a reliable indicator, I could identify them.  And the other one, at work, I usually wear a tiny bit of cologne every day&lt;br /&gt;at work, people dont mention it anymore, but one person (female) in particular, asked me right away about what&lt;br /&gt;cologne do I wear, immediately thereafter, she volunteered herself (out of 4 members in that area), to process the info.&lt;br /&gt;that I needed.  However it seemed to be noticed by only that particular person, no change in the other three individuals.&lt;br /&gt;That is what I can tell so far.  I will re-rate or update my review as needed.  Tx!</li>
            <li> I was curious about the stuff and i will say this that yes women will approach you and talk to you more and I&#x27;m sure it is more effective in different environments. So far I have been wearing it at the office which is usually where I deal with the most women during the day. Example when I step into the elevator for a brief ride and there are several members of the opposite sex inside and just me it seems to work to make them notice and even engage me when in the past this has not happened. I have noticed multiple instances like this. I have even purposely put a fresh spray on before going to speak with certain folks (female) and they seem to perk up after I get close. I have only been using the product for a few weeks off and on so I cannot attest for sure but I have noticed a difference. Have yet to try it in a different setting ie bar or club or other more social setting to see a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes it won&#x27;t make the clothes fly off but I think it helps open the door with the fairer sex I will continue my own personal research.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it smells so good, and lasts a really long time. The best pheromone oil I have ever purchased. And I have tried many others, but PherX Pheromone oil for men really is the best. I&#x27;m serious, use it and see if all the women turn their heads towards you...because this stuff is powerful! I keep getting attention from women all the time now. And I don&#x27;t even try, it&#x27;s really cool, and I&#x27;m being serious now...I know it works and I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with Pherx Pheromone Oil, this is the second bottle I have ordered. I think it works, but you should not expect it to work magically. I feel more confident and attractive when I have it on, and I find women are more interested in me. I like it, I&#x27;m using it to make me feel confident and to have a good conversation with wonen.</li>
            <li> This product definitely gets you more looks and attention. The rest is left up to you! Use with a combination of your personal cologne. Works wonders!</li>
            <li> Product is easy to use, haven&#x27;t rock solid results, but it does have a calming effect on my wife, which is a good thing</li>
            <li> If it helps my buddy get laid; being incarcerated for awhile... then great. He seems like such a lady killer anyway.</li>
            <li> It is very helpful with my wife.. i feel her very dfferent since i  started to use this product.. i love it..</li>
            <li> I worn it a few times, and notice a more relaxed and talkative demeanor from some women. I&#x27;m not sure if it is the product or my own bump in confidence, but it seems to help. I think a person has to be really close over an extended period for the effects to really be noticeable. I have just started using it over the past week, so the verdict is still out, but I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It smells good to me, just started trying it. Small package, easy to carry in pocket etc. I&#x27;ll post more later after i use it a while</li>
            <li> Recently bought  the produc and i was very pleasantly surprised with the outcome. It just seemed like friendlier people were around me....try it out..ive only been using it for a cuple days. but the product smells nice and doest hurt ur chances.</li>
            <li> They sent me this bottle at no charge as long as I promised to review another product I purchased and also this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it, and definitely have noticed women looking at me longer, and other signs of interest.&lt;br /&gt;I have worn it a handful of times, and I like the fragrance and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from women telling me I smell very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried another product from PherX as well as Max Attract, which are both great products but I like the results I get from this one the best.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes. What so ever. I kept a positive attitude, but nothing at all</li>
            <li> This would be my third purchase.  The very first bottle I got a lots of nice compliments from people of different sexes.  They complimented how the smell was so nice.  The most important thing was the smell really created a calm environment for everyone that I deal with or being close to, I mean proximity.  The second bottle I purchased was as a gift for someone and that person told me it did not work at all.  The third bottle I just recently purchased can&#x27;t be compared to my very bottle because I did not smell anything.  At least the first bottle did smell nice when I smell it.  This third one looks like very diluted, water base of some sort.  I spent almost $100 dollars.  Wonder why the first purchase always work but not the later.  Always the case any case.  Wonder if they try to get you the first time do you will get hook and then you will buy more that is when they send you the less quality ones?</li>
            <li> Just received product and tried immediately.  Definitely made me feel more confident after applying.  Noticed women being more talkative and lingering.  Don&#x27;t know if it was the pheromones or not. Will continue testing and update results.</li>
            <li> not sure yet, but will update.</li>
            <li> I tell you what I am a 50 year old 20lbs. over weight man. I have many tattoos and ride a Harley Davidson. Many people look at me as the old fat biker dude. I look at myself as average looking man. lady&#x27;s really don&#x27;t pay attention to me. But since I have started wearing PHERX I have noticed lady&#x27;s are more comfortable being around me. Lady&#x27;s that don&#x27;t normally speak to me at work are now coming around and starting conversations out of the blue. When I go out to the local bar I have lady&#x27;s that will come up to me and speak. hell one lady even bought me a drink that&#x27;s a first for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an interesting little scenario, using this stuff. I&#x27;ve had a full range of response, and have IN FACT seen some results (&#x27;...what&#x27;s that cologne you&#x27;re wearing...&#x27;). I&#x27;ll keep you posted (...no pun).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much, but did have a nice muted scent. Will be returning. Another brand seemed to work better so I will go back to using that one.</li>
            <li> As a Junior scientist I am writing this review so trust every word I say. Here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Small amounts usually work better huge amounts... When you have high concentration, women usually suspect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- I suggest that PherX should not have any smell at all. It is better for the man to keep away from women and let them do the first step or at least a sign. You will receive a lot of attention and smiles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- The effect usually can be noticed on older women more than younger ones. It is really intense on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4- Black, brown hair women usually have more effect on them than blonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5- The effect is usually on the unconscious mind.  So they may come very close to you like hypnotized person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6- Remember that we are Humans so the conscious mind still in control. Also know that women learnt since they were young to suppress their feelings and suppress their unconscious mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is great and more development on it will make a revolution no doupt.... Usually women like to attract men by showing their beauty and their nice body and let men burn so I think this should a weapon to fight back for men.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t get to use it yet but I like the smell. I will know for sure if it work this weekend an maybe I can do another review to till you what happen</li>
            <li> I never noticed any women who were more comfortable around me or approached me. But wearing this stuff makes me more aggressive around everyone and in a bad way. It seems to make me edgy and prone to giving an attitude to people. Ive used it a few times and I thought that it might not be this stuff but indeed it is. So in some sorts this works but in others it doesn&#x27;t work. At least in the way I&#x27;d like it to. I know that pheromones can have different reactions with people and apparently its not good with me. Its possible that it could work around women but I was just to edgy for it to be effective. Overall, give it a try it might work for you. You also might want to mix it with your favorite cologne to make it less concentrated and give it a smell thats more natural for you.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wasn&#x27;t a terribly big fan of the smell (at least in the bottle), but she liked it a lot better when it was on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the pheromones had any effect on her sex drive, however I certainly can&#x27;t complain about the results (whether they were driven by the product or not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s cheap enough, give it a try.. Maybe they do work as intended.</li>
            <li> Seem to be getting more smiles form the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells alright and the price is decent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d order again.</li>
            <li> The product appears to provide the desired effect as advertised, but I didn&#x27;t care for the oil mixture very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in trying a pheromone product for several years now after watching a show on tv where they used hidden cameras and demonstrated in a scientific experiment that pheromones can increase your attractiveness to women or men depending on your preference. I picked out this product after reading several reviews and have just received it in the mail earlier today. I wore it when I went out to dinner and ended up striking up a conversation with the waitress. I definitely noticed that she was making eye contact and playing with her hair and flirting with me, and I believe that the pheromones played a roll in this. It also increases your confidence and that is another bonus. I definitely will be ordering this product again, after I use up the bottle I already have.</li>
            <li> nice smell, and women definitely more talkative</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as an experiment to see (1) If it would \\&quot;spice things up\\&quot; a little more with my wife and (2) since I&#x27;m in sales, to see if it would make my female customers buy more.  I have tried it off and on for a week and have not seen any change in either department. However, I feel a week may not be enough time for a study...so I will give it an average score for now...and after a month or so update my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After trying it for a few weeks I found that there has been no change in interest of the opposite sex.  As a matter of fact my wife even said to me \\&quot;I smell something strange...almost medicinal..\\&quot; and I played dumb.  I really WANTED this to work...but I have to say it does not. :(  (at least not for me...everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different so maybe it would work for someone).  Sorry PherX. I won&#x27;t be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit on the subtle side, but I suppose that is kind of the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the product for a few days, so I can&#x27;t offer any in depth review, I am curious to see how well it works.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer of this product because I have definitely noticed that it seems to work. Maybe it has something to do with complimenting one&#x27;s existing pheromones, I don&#x27;t know. I believe the trick is to only use a slight amount. Too much seems to cancel the response you are looking for. What I experience is more attention from females period. I notice women noticing me from across rooms, across aisles in grocery stores, etc. It opens the door for me to introduce myself to them. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very bad product, doesn&#x27;t have any smell, don&#x27;t even think about it it&#x27;s a ripoff,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works or not. But it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but I don&#x27;t see it works at all</li>
            <li> I know many people won&#x27;t believe in this stuff.. I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical about it myself. I am not kidding that each time I used this I had (let&#x27;s call them) positive results. I tried several experiments and each time I used this I was totally satisfied. I would recommend the oil over the spray. It last longer on you and you don&#x27;t go through the bottle as fast.</li>
            <li> When my romancing options seemed to be eliciting a weak response I ordered this to see if I could get my wife a little more &#x27;interested&#x27; in me.  My first test was a very light application after shaving and after putting on a sweet song and dancing with my wife she fell into my arms.  She told me she liked the way I smelled and within minutes my advanced were rewarded with a lovely response.  Perhaps it&#x27;s the confindence this product brings me or its gentil smell but I&#x27;ve never felt more attractive and I love the attention my wife has been giving me.  I highly recommend the product if your normal romantic endevors haven&#x27;t been working with your partner.</li>
            <li> this stuff does not work, save your money and dont waste on this stuff.</li>
            <li> Draws women like a moth to light. Women are responsive and chatty, great recipe for seduction. Im customer for life!</li>
            <li> The stuffs smells pretty good but doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long. I had some success with members of the opposite sex but it could&#x27;ve just been a coincidence.</li>
            <li> Nothing happen dont take it. They lie to us. This product is no smell. Bad design. And as i said dont waste your money for this S***.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the way I smell, she is always cuddling and commenting, she has no idea...love it.&lt;br /&gt;However just to be clear, there is no actual smell of this product, I simply apply with my cologne.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the PherSpray that I purchased. It is a bit less overpowering, in scent, than the spray, so the effect is still present, just more subtle.</li>
            <li> Maybe works for you but i purchased because i work at sales job which i needed since i work with women alot, i don&#x27;t know but this thing doesn&#x27;t work at all!!!! Company sending me email to review them to get another free bottle of this but why would i need another one if this doesnt work ?</li>
            <li> I think the product has a really unique and rare smell. I have gotten a great number of complements on this product(PherX). Most women  love the smell of it.  I guess it works well with my bio-chem.</li>
            <li> I tried it couple of times before going out, not sure if it really works or not. The oil has a very pleasant fragrance.  I&#x27;ll keep trying until I come out of my shell.</li>
            <li> Every time I have it applied and around women, you can notice a change in body language.  They really turn their body towards you more and you can notice pupil dialation.  I highly suggest when dancing close with that special someone or on dates</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at 1st, but have to say that after trying the product, woman seem to be more engaged.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old and have had not-so-active time with my spouse.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased your oil version of your product and put it on at night.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing happened that evening but in the morning I was pleasently&lt;br /&gt;surprised.&lt;br /&gt;Now I put it on every night with great results.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied</li>
            <li> I just received the product but, so far the results have been better than expected. I would recommend a larger product. Other than that, I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not as attracting as others claim. Haven&#x27;t gotten any stares but one girl is starting to be around me more. Though I will agree with one reviewer who says this gave him more confidence and it sure did. I am usually timid when taking orders at the place I work but wearing made me more confident and I&#x27;ll admit a bit hyper for some reason. While it does not attract women or their stares, it does boost up my self-esteem and helps me talk to girls more easily. Will do business again for sure :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman, and I was supposed to get the PherX Pheromone Oil for Women (to attract men), but I got the opposite one instead. I wanted to make the best out of the situation, so I dabbed it on my husband&#x27;s neck. It works. All I can say is that I only want him wearing this when he&#x27;s alone with me.</li>
            <li> so far so good... will update once I am successful</li>
            <li> My purpose for getting this is because I&#x27;m older and Wanted something to pick up my spirits.  Aging sucks.  I feel bla all the time. and this stuff seemed to make me feel better, more confident. This should be used sparingly, otherwise it bothers your nose. When used with my regular cologne, it seemed to blend nice enough. When I wear this I feel like I&#x27;m in that movie where everything seems to go right for you, the powers of the universe feel like they are working in your favor.</li>
            <li> I like the size of the bottle perfect to put in your pocket. Smell really good! I am sure what a pheromones smell like but after I smell it I am pretty sure women will like it!</li>
            <li> Very effective and it DOES work!</li>
            <li> I feel that women feel an increased attraction to me while wearing the product. I notice women checking me out more often and I feel an increase in confidence while wearing. I have found it best works if you put at least two sprays on your neck and then ask a girl to dance with you. Get her close and let her take it in. After a few minutes I noticed the pick up going much easier. She let me touch her hips as we were dancing. Then I grabbed her arms and put them on my shoulders.</li>
            <li> For sure a confidence builder. Has a very inviting smell, always good for a big night.</li>
            <li> My fiancé loves this stuff but he doesn&#x27;t use it to attract women clearly but for the testerone. The extreme one he&#x27;s a little sensitive to but the regular one he recommends!</li>
            <li> Did not really notice a change on how anyone behavior change when I was wearing it will continue to use it to see if my luck changes</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I purchased the PherX Pheromone Oil for Men (Attract Women) this product worked very well. I would like to let you guys know that this product helps you out when having to talk to other gender. This product gives you some kind of confidence if you need it (exactly what I need) to talk to women. Since I bought it iv&#x27;e used it like 3 or 4 times and it does give you the confidence boost a man sometimes needs to talk to women. Thanks</li>
            <li> Instantanious Results!  Ive used other pheremones in the past but none have shown results on the first day wearing the cologne.  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This product is authentic and not only will attract Women but will make you feel youthful and elegant. I Believe PherX to be one of the best on the market for today.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on positive reviews on youtube. Other pheromones cost as little as fifty dollars. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have noticed when I use this product that women do seem to pay more attention.  Make more eye contact and seem to be more at ease.  Use this and some of my regular fragrances. I have had several compliment on the scent.</li>
            <li> This product smells pretty good! It&#x27;s not that strong smelling though. I don&#x27;t know if it attracted anyone, but it smells good!</li>
            <li> A very decent purchase.  I first used this product on a day that I was flying.  I encountered \\&quot;positive attitudes\\&quot; from a variety of women from the airport restaurant waitress to the flight attendants. I recommend this product to any man who enjoys the company/good conversation with women.  It certainly seems to work.</li>
            <li> They sent me the wrong one. I ordered the one for women and somehow it got changed to the one for men. Being a woman this was not money well spent:-(</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing. I am a pretty good looking dude and I have always been pretty good at getting my foot in the door. But this stuff takes it to the next level! I bartend so have been able to see a lot more women than your average guy in a short amount of time and women of all ages, shapes, marital status, etc. have been way more receptive since I started wearing this stuff. I also feel like I have been more &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; with this stuff. I was thinking maybe that you smell it yourself and your brain is like &amp;#34;Whoa, is that me? If so, I better start acting like a badass, because I obviously am or I wouldn&#x27;t produce those chemicals&amp;#34;!  Just a theory.&lt;br /&gt;Try this stuff! Especially if you like it when women are all up in your business</li>
            <li> So far so good. I actually felt like I was getting more attention when I was first used this product. If I keep getting this type of reaction then my 4 stars will go to a 5 star rating. I like it, I was actually getting attention from girls that usually don&#x27;t notice me.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smelling scent. Somewhat like Cool Springs. Creates a trusting atmosphere where some women will start talking to you. Would buy again for the scent.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all,expency and it doesn&#x27;t work at all !!!! Save your money stay away from this product! Not happy!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now and the response I have has been great. I seem to be getting a lot more attention from the ladies. Even the ones I have known for a while. I was a bit skeptical before I bought it, but this product really seems to work.</li>
            <li> It does not have a fragrance that I am able to detect.  So far it seems to have worked 4 out of the 5 times I have used it with my wife of 40 years. So i give it 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and so far, so good.  Judging from their reaction to me ,the ladies I meet seem to like it and the closer we get the more interested they become. I&#x27;ll keep you posted</li>
            <li> Sorry guys It&#x27;s just snake oil, it smells good to some women but it really does not work other than that. Maybe has some kind of effect on your confidence and that&#x27;s what women like? Other than that it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good and I noticed a little more attention from women, it seems like it just makes them kind of giddy though. As for the spray vs. the oil I like the spray better because the oil comes out to fast and I usually end up with more than I need. I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use this a lot so I may come back and change my review if I get better results in the future.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical in the beginning about using an oil based Pheromone product, however, it delivered just what I needed, no scent in the oil just strong Pheromone base and can add any fragrance of my choice. That is brilliant! Since, some pheromones have a scent to them and not all are necessarily pleasant to everyone thus, undermining the success rate. Overall though, it works well!</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it worked it not.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when buying this product to see if it would work or not and it does! My boyfriend is always 10x touchy and all over me anytime I wear this. A little bit goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t have a scent. Definitely repurchasing when I run out!</li>
            <li> Great product. Was skeptical at first but it does work. Try to balance it with your favorite cologne. Too much cologne can effect it.</li>
            <li> Pher x pheromone  oil for men</li>
            <li> The women can smell lt and definitely smell it and they take notice. I can&#x27;t say it is anything that will over rule anyones plans or anything but it does bring attention</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say but as far as I was able to tell this product has no effect on women. Sorry I wasted my money on it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an overly attractive man. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10, 230 pounds with long black hair and an a-hole personality. I can&#x27;t help it, it&#x27;s just kind of how I&#x27;ve always been. I&#x27;m handsome I suppose, but not someone who stands out in the looks department, and kind of an introvert. Keep that mind when reading this review, and on that note. Excellent product, WHEN used correctly and expectations are reasonable. This is not a magical product that is going to have you fighting women off of you as if you were a One Direction member. NOTHING will achieve that. What this will do is make it easier for YOU to engage and carry conversations with women, actually, from my experience,  it seems like this makes men and women more apt to be friendly with me. I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple weeks now and have used it in various situations, both social and a little more personal, and it has definitely made a difference. I apply it to my wrists, forearm crease, behind my ears and along my jawline and the back of my neck because I have long hair and can really waft it out into the atmosphere that way. Since wearing this people in bars are nicer to me, they buy me drinks, they start conversations with me and generally seem to be more friendly. This product also has a self effect. It, at least in my case, makes ME feel more friendly and confident. I find it easier to approach women and engage in conversations without fear of rejection. I wear it whenever I know I may need a little boost in my aura and so far it has exceeded my expectations. I find that it works best when paired with your own natural chemistry. I like to put it on then work up a little sweat to get my own pheromones mixed and that seems to work best. I attribute my getting a new job, getting laid, and making a bunch of new friends in the last couple of weeks to the effects of this product and the affect it has on me. It&#x27;s 30 something bucks, buy it and try it, just remember that  it merely opens the door, YOU are still the one that must walk through.</li>
            <li> SCAM . fake reviews no ingrediants listed its just scented oil</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good, and the first day I wore it it seemed like it was doing SOMETHING...  I was at an office doing some repair work and the male office manager wouldn&#x27;t stop talking to me (I didn&#x27;t get the vibe like he was gay, but it was like he was sort of fawning on me), then a girl I was trying to explain something about the machine I was working on was very antagonistic towards me, like I was intimidating to her, then another guy I had to work with treated me just like the girl did.  But after that day, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in how people react to me... so I dunno.</li>
            <li> The product does work I notice that girls do look at me more than begore</li>
            <li> I tried it several times and each time it seems to repel women instead of attracting them. It has repugnant odor.. .... it stinks! Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I did a bunch of research into reputable pheromone companies and decided to go with PherX, they&#x27;ve been around awhile and seem to have high standards for production. My order showed up quickly and seems to work as advertised. I&#x27;ll buy this brand again next time I need to restock my pheromones.</li>
            <li> I apply 2 drops to my Adams apple, one drop on each wrist. Has a light pleasant scent to it. Will play around with dose amounts to see what works best. Have not yet seen any &amp;#34;takers&amp;#34; or any attraction out of the ordinary.  In all fairness I have not tested it aggressively yet. I do tend to feel very uplifted when I wear it, for what it&#x27;s worth. Worth a shot.</li>
            <li> This Product really does work. The way Women react when wearing this product ranges from Very Friendly to even Having Hot Flashes. Yes, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I forget sometimes to use this.  Let me start by saying I am a nurse, that works night shift. 96% women are my coworkers. The oil by itself has a very light smell, so I use some expensive imported oil as my primary scent. So when I use it I notice alot of ladies talking to me more, telling me I smell good, then I hear them talking when I walk away, things like &amp;#34;mmmm mmmm hmmmm&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34; dang I could just jump all over him&amp;#34;. So I&#x27;d say it gets me noticed.  When I am at home, my wife will ask me to come here, and she will take deep sniffs lol, and say she likes it, (that is with only the pheromone oil on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really comment on getting dates or anything, I haven&#x27;t used it for that being married and all. I will say that it is a conversation starter, and will get you gossip going on... I can&#x27;t even imagine what they may be saying that I can&#x27;t hear.</li>
            <li> put some on and at the end of the night got a  second date</li>
            <li> the verdict is still out, I will have to update this review in the future when the bottle is depleted.</li>
            <li> Received some notice after wearing the product.</li>
            <li> Okay, as for the smell.. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything so you don&#x27;t need to worry about being caught. As for the effect... Here&#x27;s the tricky part: It works, it does work... However, while giving you confidence on the day you&#x27;re wearing it, your confidence in the day you&#x27;re not will drop to-9000 so my only advice is considering this before you buy it :)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good product  !  Will introduce to friends. Hope to receive this and love to try ....PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men (Attract Women) - The Science of Attraction - 18mg Human Pheromones ( 115-1075870-8013814)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going lie this stuff is pretty sweet.Cost about half of price of expensive Cologne.Smells really dang great.And it&#x27;s easy to take around places.But when it comes down to the promise of attraction women.It does it&#x27;s job.The first day wearing it I got a lot of comments on my smell from random women.And that right there is textbook attraction. You may not get girls throwing themselves at you.But there attention is the most important part in getting your freak on later on.But still Can&#x27;t beat the awesome smell.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference using it or not. Had a particular odor late in the day after using it, that was not pleasent.</li>
            <li> I like the scent...just subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it works to some extent.  I still use it everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will re-order for sure.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> This works it turns women on, maybe not for the person wearing it but it works you still need to attract them yourself but they&#x27;re ready</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough to really determine it&#x27;s effectiveness!</li>
            <li> I got this for when I was In the dog house with the wife. ( Ironically I was put in the dog house for getting this when she found out. )&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived the same day. I immediately applied it behind my ears. That night, our clothes  were flying off within minutes of the lights going out. I still can&#x27;t find one of her socks, and I am still smiling.</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly and although I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days, I seem to notice favorable results, and find the smell pleasant. My observations appear to include increased physical responsiveness and more enthusiastic and easily obtained indicators of interest. Placebo? Maybe, but maybe not. Either way, thanks. The competition is tough out there, and why not have an extra edge?</li>
            <li> I am a good looking guy and wanted to try this out to see what level it could take me to. I currently do not know how effective it is because getting women has never been a real challenge. I will update further.</li>
            <li> Ive been trying this product in a few different variations and im kinda still sceptical about the product. My results are not any different than my normal night out  that i can tell . Im using plenty of the product on my wrist and kneck pressure points and i dont see much difference using it or not using it im still experimenting but nothing good yet.</li>
            <li> Seriously! This company offered me a trial product for review after I had purchased their pheromones(as a Valentine&#x27;s day last ditch effort for a date JOKE).  I didn&#x27;t take them up on the product for review offer, but I will say that this stuff smells very, very good. Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I finally was able to get to my mailbox to obtain my package(mail room was locked).  I cursed and hollored at the offfice staff of women for not having the room available to tennants. they were highly upset with me.  After obtaining my package i immediately dabbled a little on.  to see if it would work, i walked back into the office where the ladies had a change of behavior, as i walked into the bathroom area 1st.  After i re-entered the main office area the ladies loved me.  Were flirty and all that.  bugged me out!!!  you here me!!!...  i went into a Marshalls and some Carribean older lady from Brooklyn damn near gave me her panties.  does it work...  day 1 seems to say so..</li>
            <li> I used different pheromone \\&quot;fake\\&quot; products since a while... This product is totally different and you will notice that from the first time use through a lot of smiles, speaking softly, laughing and getting more close to you.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell. A little bit goes a long way. Have noticed more positive female attention when wearing. Whether that is from the scent or the confidence boost is really up in the air, but either way it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> It really seems to work.  The first time I tried the product, my wife out of the blue became more aggressive and actually apologized for neglecting me for so long.  Even the gals in classes have been more attentive and responsive.  Loving the new attention and experimenting with this product!</li>
            <li> Great Product! From the day I opened the package and began using I noticed a huge difference.  I got noticed a lot more and felt a lot more confident when going out.  This stuff really works! Great scent and easy to apply.  Recommending to my friends</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try it out in public cant use it at work cause I work with dudes. ill give an update asap.</li>
            <li> I put on a little of this product on my neck when my wife and I had our little \\&quot;date nite\\&quot; last weekend.  She put her nose in my neck, gave it one big sniff, and that&#x27;s when the fireworks started.  I have not seen my wife be this sexy in a long, long time! And with having kids under 6 years old, well, you get the picture.  I believe this product was made to help a husband give his wife that little extra, and in my case anyway, it certainly did!  Hey guys, if this sounds like you, get this stuff.  It may not work for everybody (or even like it did for me) but you&#x27;ve got to admit, it&#x27;s sure worth a shot, right?  And if it works for you, I guarantee that you&#x27;ll be in for a fun-filled night!</li>
            <li> great product, doesn&#x27;t have a scent after a min of application. not sure if there are environments for maximum effectiveness or not because i usually work in and outside so i&#x27;m usually a little hot and sweaty so not sure if this decrease it&#x27;s effectiveness or not.</li>
            <li> Seems like a far fetched idea on paper, but thought I would give it a shot based on the posted reviews.  It does indeed have a subtle but powerful effect.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is great product if you want to smell good and turn some heads and get some or more smiles your way from all the females this is your product. i work as a host and i have to say i get alot more tips from the ladies and im loving it right now. thank you guys for making such a great product i will buy another one and another when they run out.</li>
            <li> This may be a flawed bottle, but it is suppose to give you a single drop at a time, instead it pours out of the spout so I am not sure if I am using it properly... or the right amount.</li>
            <li> I found this product to have positive effect on females. I wear it without any cologne or anything. I get warm smiles everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> This Product truly works. Girls that i have never talked to came up and talked to me. If youre looking for a great product to attract the ladies, get this one.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying this product.  First time I used it I got some unusual attention from my female friend (touching, hugging,and kissing) it seems to work as it claims.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all waste of money</li>
            <li> SMELLS REALLY GOOD, I USE IT ON MY NECK AND SHOULDERS ,ITS GOT THAT SEXY N FRESH SMELL ,IT GIVES THAT BOOST TO GET CLOSE TO  WOMAN. MUST TRY</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the way women act around me.  It&#x27;s also a pretty small bottle, although with the amount I use at a time it should last awhile.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t got the chance to really \\&quot;use\\&quot; it per say, but it has a nice smell, and others took notice of me immediately</li>
            <li> I used serval times IT DOES NOT WORK at all,RIP OFF, do not west  your hard earn money. No no no no no</li>
            <li> This is based on very short possession of the product.&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells nice. Not sure if my opinion is valid. Probably needs a woman&#x27;s comment&lt;br /&gt;2. I tried on a friend and she sensed something but not sure what.&lt;br /&gt;3. I will update in a few weeks after I have had time to try it.</li>
            <li> The pheromone is subtle at first but after using it a few times I have noticed a pattern and that I&#x27;m getting a lot more attention.</li>
            <li> This product has an ok/pleasant smell until you get really close. If you put your nose to where you sprayed it (your wrist for example), the smell is pretty strong, bitter, kinda like bad B.O. But that&#x27;s only if you put your nose right there. So when you choose the place you&#x27;re gonna spray, choose a place no girl would put their nose close to! :S&lt;br /&gt;I got this product out of curiosity, 2 friends of mine have used it and said they couldn&#x27;t tell the difference as far drawing the ladies attention/interest to themselves. They continue to wear \\&quot;just in case\\&quot;! ;)&lt;br /&gt;I just think it smells bad!</li>
            <li> We tested this and one other similar attractant over the course of a week.  Our jobs take us into office buildings routinely, so that was our main test.  3 of us (2 had an attractant, 1 had a control) went into offices over the course of that week, and noted any reactions we received.  At the end of the week we found out which one of us had the scents for those days. A few women were told about the test ahead of time to see if they could recognize any noticeable differences, and give us a different perspective.  The evenings were also tested, in restaurants and bars/clubs.&lt;br /&gt;We also had access to a K9 trained to locate missing people.&lt;br /&gt;Our individual notes, showed a little over half of the women, both in the offices and in clubs, reacted more friendly when we had the attractant on.&lt;br /&gt;Of the woman who knew about the test, all 10 picked the attractant out almost immediately.  Though only one acted any differently.  When asked about it, the majority of them said even though they &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; a curious reaction about us at that particular time, they knew it was a test, but that they also notice a difference from time to time in most men.  Some days more attractive then others, and it was rather normal.&lt;br /&gt;Several of the office men were also more talkative during these tests as well, asking mostly about an opinion on something, or requesting help with what we do for the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The K9 test was positive every time, although the handler said the dog didn&#x27;t hit strong, and acted unsure about what it located.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, both appear to have an affect of women, in that they can detect a difference, which did lead to more chatting.&lt;br /&gt;In clubs, when randomly talking to women, the attractant wearer was almost always the focus of the women when talking.&lt;br /&gt;But seemed to only be a sort of ice breaker.  It got their attention, but after that it was up to us to keep them interested.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to single out one particular woman didn&#x27;t do much, andworked better when a small group was gathered for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it does work to get the attention of a woman.  But is not a magic potion.  Women are not going to fall over with their legs in the air because you wore this.  It MAY give you a slight edge to get them interested, but you still have to able to talk to them comfortably to close the deal so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re too shy to talk to women, this is NOT going to help you.&lt;br /&gt;But, this might get her to turn her head for a moment, enough time for you to step up, and make your case.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing. Just put a little bit on and you will smell amazing. As for how well it works, I haven&#x27;t been able to go out too much, but the confidence boost that I have really seems to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s new and I like it</li>
            <li> I used it for a month and it did not work for me. It does smell good. The scent is similar to baby powder</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to make females notice you as far as i can tell so far but it does make other see myself as more intimidating so it does have some form of effect. But when I start seeing more of a difference I will add on to this review to let other possible buyers know.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  Smells freaking great, and based on personal experience I&#x27;d say pheremones do work as advertised.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I use it  for no so long but seems to work I got the attention of girls around - they do not jump on you but they are much friendly.  The only complaint is a little hard to use the oil from the bottle - better get the spray that&#x27;s why 4 stars. Overall I will continue using and update.</li>
            <li> I notice a big difference in my Girlfriend when I wear it... When I wear it she can&#x27;t get enough of me in bed!... Turns her on!</li>
            <li> I wrote a review for the water-based cologne version of this product recently, so you if you&#x27;re interested you can read my fuller response to PherX products there. The bottom line is that I think both of these products work as adverstised. This oil-based formula has the same fragrance but a little lighter (maybe less volatile), so you could probably use more of it if you&#x27;re looking for more effect, without smelling like you bathe in cologne. I find a couple sprays/drops applied once or twice a day is enough to pique interest, and at that rate a small bottle will likely last two to three months or longer. That works out to a pretty good investment.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all! Smells good though.</li>
            <li> I have only worn this product out a few times, and it seems to get me more attention from women. They seem more excited and friendly around me. Definitely noticing a difference:)</li>
            <li> This is a good product  pherx pheromone be working in my body and smell good i recommend this is very special</li>
            <li> Received  product  few days ago  waiting for something to happen been married 30yrs. Just trying to get my wife to be a little more responsive. Don&#x27;t know yet if something happens I will let you know.</li>
            <li> I have used Pheromone fragrances before but they were of the spray type, never an oil. I like the oil application much better than the spray because I can control the amount and place it on a pulse point like behind my ear. I&#x27;m not trying to attract anyone but use it sparingly when I work. My employment is in a hospital with lots of women around and I find my interactions with them seems to go smoother when I wear the oil. The price that Amazon has on this product will keep me ordering it again.  The fragrance is light and compliments my after shave without overpowering it nicely.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell of this product.  I Get multiple complements a day every time I wear this oil. Also notice women want to flirt more when I wear it. I wear it on my hot spots( wrist, kneck, behind ear) as well as cologne and its not over whelming or to musky. Mixes perfect with all  cologne I have tried. I have no complaints. Shipping was quick and on time as well! 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this product. I noticed my wife is more attentive to me and relaxed when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt; It has a subtle , pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I just started using my oil yesterday and my luck has already changed. Thank you for creating this product,it seems like a new me 😃</li>
            <li> Not overly impressed, no noticeable difference really.  But I really didn&#x27;t expect too much.  Money better spent on a nice cologne in my opinion.</li>
            <li> i like ihe long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Its okay ...but doesn&#x27;t do any wonders ...nothing beats the gym and maintenance to how you look ...though this product is light especially when you don&#x27;t wanna over do it with a heavy cologne...</li>
            <li> Have not used product yet, just got it yesterday.  Shipping was on time, exactly as promised.  I am adding a few drops to an unscented stick deodorant, The first drop came out fine, then about 6 or 7 drops ran out quickly.  I will have to wait a day or two for the oil to soak into the deodorant as this was too much. Addendum:  Purchased a small bottle with a roller ball head, this made for a good applicator.  There does seem to be a subtle change in the way some people respond to me when using the product.  It is as if I am seen as someone in charge.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like tea tree oil and doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> When wearing this I have notice more attention from women. More smiles, friendlier conversations, more looks. Don&#x27;t put on too much. I put a small amount on and couldn&#x27;t even smell it, but had several women comment on the nice smell from a distance of more than 6 feet.</li>
            <li> I got more then kissing results on the first date, and get another second date with a different girl the next night!!! just give it a try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other pheromones,  this one is pretty decent. I like it, the girls like it. I can&#x27;t complain too much wish the oil had a dropper for better application other than that it works!!</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m wearing the productI like how easy it is to make friends with women.</li>
            <li> I WAS BORED THIS IS DEFINITLEY A WASTE OF MONEY! IT DID NOT WORK!</li>
            <li> This  is very  good it make y feel wanted  everywhere girls are even at Church</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the product works or not. I use it but not really in a social atmosphere.</li>
            <li> This is a lot more viscus than the spray version, but has the same effect. You feel bolder and more confident during the day. It&#x27;s not gonna have women fawning over you, but you will notice people want to be around you more and you will get a few more glances and touches. Use every advantage that you can.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical before I bought it, but this product really seems to work. Has a nice aroma and definitely gives you a confidence boost. More smiles and nice reactions from women.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few days now and I have noticed more women checking me out with a smile. More so than when I don&#x27;t use. Good product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work waste of money. I give it a chance after reading other reviews on here what a waste of money</li>
            <li> I have never met a woman I was attracted to and after three hours of talking to her, she rights her number down before I asked for it. I am a believer of this stuff. Woman are definitely more talkative and approachable. It&#x27;s interesting that pheromones can be responsible for all of this.</li>
            <li> well first off it dosent have a scent which is good so you can use your regular calone. i used the other night did seem to help she said i smelled good and little by little as night went on she got closer and closer. i would buy again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested the product for variety of conditions yet, but I have seen a clear effect on my girl-friend. She is somewhat less resistant to my advances and she is eager to spend more time with me. I am eager to test PherX Pheromone in a club environment soon. I had purchased another brand of pheromone about 6 months ago, but seen no results at all. I am not expecting miracles, just a tiny help would suffice and I believe this product provides that edge, that confidence boosting effect.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product earlier than estimated delivery date (thanks). It is less oily and easy to apply, but a bit watery so be cautioned, use lightly.</li>
            <li> Works! Blends well with other colognes.</li>
            <li> at the beggining i didn&#x27;t know if this was going to work but then exactly the same day that i used i received many different compliments about me. i even had sex that day.!!! this really work and ladies love it and they dont even know what its that smell</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful user of PherX Pheromone Oil for years now. I have had more compliments from women on how good I smell, even from strangers! And that is without wearing any other type of cologne. It also seems like women are more friendly even when it is in a business situation. Maybe it the pheromones of maybe I just feel more confident when I&#x27;m wearing it, but whatever it is, I&#x27;m going to continue to purchase it period.</li>
            <li> In less than a week is working good so far</li>
            <li> I had ordered this for my brother as a gag gift. You know, something that would get a laugh out of both of us, being relatively confident it wouldn&#x27;t work. It seems I was wrong, to the delight of my brother. He&#x27;s claimed that since he started using it women have been approaching him more frequently, with the majority acting coquettishly. Now, my brother is a college student, so he&#x27;s around young ladies constantly. If he&#x27;s noticing a difference in the demeanor of the women around him just now, then it&#x27;s safe to assume it&#x27;s because of the pheromone he&#x27;s applying. Whodathunkit?</li>
            <li> When I give a Lady a warm hug it is harder to get away. They get very friendly and don&#x27;t want to turn loose. I really don&#x27;t mind, it is fun and flattering.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from the actual smell of this (musk? something funky?) It&#x27;s a fairly subtle smell that dabbed behind your ears shouldn&#x27;t freak anyone out who is sensitive to colognes and perfumes (i.e., this isn&#x27;t going to be traumatic for anyone you share an elevator with, even if you were a bit more liberal than dabbing it behind your ears).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I didn&#x27;t buy this for the purpose of hooking up. The academic literature regarding human pheromones doesn&#x27;t say that that you&#x27;ll be swimming in men/women; rather, the effects are more subtle and subconscious (and aren&#x27;t all about having sex; calming effects, etc). At this price point, it seemed like a no-brainer to try PherX.</li>
            <li> It smells good regardless, my girlfriend loves the smell. Actually smells better than my regular cologne, leaves hands feeling a little greasy however</li>
            <li> I feel more confident when using this. This the first thing to attract women absolutely. And I also see the different acting from them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> This product works. However, it doesn&#x27;t work on every woman, but when it does- look out! I had a young lady walk up to me and stand right next to me and seemed to wait for my command. The oil seems to to wear off somewhat quickly. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s best to wear it with cologne as I guess it would be difficult to smell or sense the pheromones. This is a good product in which I saw results.</li>
            <li> This product is quality. It has no strong smell. It is designed, as pure pheromone solutions should be, to be detected subconsciously. I had only purchased one as a trial. I will surely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I just received the oil and tried it today when I went to the store and it must work because every woman in the store that I was near was smiling at me.this stuff is great.</li>
