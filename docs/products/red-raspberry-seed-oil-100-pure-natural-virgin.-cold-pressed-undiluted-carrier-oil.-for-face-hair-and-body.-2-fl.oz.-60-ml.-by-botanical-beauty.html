            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>I loved this product!</li>
            <li>This does not have the best smell, but if you add it to another oil that has a pleasant aroma, the scent disappears.</li>
            <li>I used it in a homemade sunscreen and it worked great.</li>
            <li>And it works great.</li>
            <li>Great for hair treatment &amp; face&lt;</li>
            <li>Great product, good quality.  </li>
            <li>Some complain about the smell, but you&#x27;re not buying this to smell good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The smell is not as great as I hoped, but it&#x27;s not horrible either.</li>
            <li>Amazing plus her skin was good and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Raspberry oil is enriched with nutrients and vitamins, it has a nice texture and a seed scent.</li>
            <li>and it smells so nice</li>
            <li>This is an excellent moisturizer for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin is happy, healed, golden, glowy and protected.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy that it came in a plastic bottle and also  the oil has a very rancid smell. ......</li>
            <li>I love it&#x27;s consistency as well...</li>
            <li>I tried jojoba oil before I tried this, and this is way better for me and my acne.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>This is truly a wonderful essential oil!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, and great oil.</li>
            <li>I am excited to use this for my own homemade sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Greaat oil even though the smell is not so strong</li>
            <li>Oils generally don&#x27;t have a great scent to them.</li>
            <li>I choose this oil not only for its convenient bottle with the pump but also for the beautiful results it gives me.</li>
            <li>It is helping to reduce the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and soaks into skin pretty fast.</li>
            <li>all day.&lt;br /&gt;I am also using this for sunscreen when I go to Florida next month; I&#x27;ve had good luck with coconut and olive oil in the past, and raspberry seed oil is supposed to be one of the most effective oils for sunscreen use and very good for after sun repair.</li>
            <li>oil should have a clean light scent</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>great sunscreen and healed my dogs dry cracked nose!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad thing</li>
            <li>That one worked fine, but this brand smells more, and my 9-year old refuses to use it.</li>
            <li>It did not smell fresh.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the smell is there because the oil is old, or if this brand just smells more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried hypo allergenic sunscreens like JĀSÖN, but not too pleased by the white residue it leaves.</li>
            <li>It came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I will def be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try adding some essential oil to see if that can make it more useable.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I put on my raspberry seed oil first, wait a couple minutes, put some aloe vera gel on, wait a couple minutes, and then put my mineral makeup on.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Love especially in my homemade sun protection spray.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed to make sunscreen for upcoming trips in summer.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly and appears to be quite pure.</li>
            <li>It does seem to provide some sun protection, but practically speaking I don&#x27;t really want to smell like that.  </li>
            <li>LIKE THIS PRODUCT ALOT JUST DONT REALLY CARE FOR THE SPRAY PUMP.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t do too much in the way of rehydrating it.</li>
            <li>It really allows your skin to retain moisture without be oily.</li>
            <li>I love how it soothes my dry skin, especially around the eyes, but absorbs quickly so my face isn&#x27;t slimy and shiny</li>
            <li>I choose that I loved the product because I use Red Raspberry Seed Oil everyday and it has improved my skin.</li>
            <li>I prefer the raspberry but both products are high quality oils.</li>
            <li>I have not been in the sun long enough to see if it has the SPF coverage but love this product whether or not.</li>
            <li>and you sure could not tell because my face wasn&#x27;t even a little bit red.  </li>
            <li>I have also found that after I use it, any blemishes start to clear up by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Bought this to use as a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I use this to mix in with Caribbean solutions sunscreen (which is biodegradable) as this raspberry seed oil is a natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>scent&lt;br /&gt;good natural sunscreen-never burned when I was out golfing</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try using something natural instead of chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry hands because I wash them a lot</li>
            <li>Finally, I heard from a friend that natural oils like coconut have inherent spf in them.</li>
            <li>I blend it with coconut oil for the natural SPF and have never used traditional sunscreen since.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and cannot use commercial sunscreens...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Some complain about the smell, but you&#x27;re not buying this to smell good. Oils generally don&#x27;t have a great scent to them. I love how it soothes my dry skin, especially around the eyes, but absorbs quickly so my face isn&#x27;t slimy and shiny all day.&lt;br /&gt;I am also using this for sunscreen when I go to Florida next month; I&#x27;ve had good luck with coconut and olive oil in the past, and raspberry seed oil is supposed to be one of the most effective oils for sunscreen use and very good for after sun repair.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from eczema as an allergic reaction to commercial sunscreens. I&#x27;ve tried hypo allergenic sunscreens like JĀSÖN, but not too pleased by the white residue it leaves. Finally, I heard from a friend that natural oils like coconut have inherent spf in them. I did some online research and discovered that red raspberry seed oil not only has the highest spf, defends uva &amp; uvb rays, but it also treats eczema! I&#x27;ve been using it all summer and my skin is happy, healed, golden, glowy and protected. No stain and no scent, but apply it as often as any other sunscreen. I&#x27;m elated to be using this wholesome product.</li>
            <li> Great product, good quality.  Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> I always use virgin Red Raspberry oil.  I choose this oil not only for its convenient bottle with the pump but also for the beautiful results it gives me. Raspberry oil is enriched with nutrients and vitamins, it has a nice texture and a seed scent. Very practical for everyday use for face and neck. I also use a dab of raspberry oil with my facial cleanser to remove make up.  Definitely worth every penny! Thank you Botanical Beauty.</li>
            <li> I loved this product! I used it in a homemade sunscreen and it worked great. Used it on a cruise and never got burned, and got the best base tan I&#x27;ve had in years! Plus, I used my sunscreen, which was made up of only oils and a small amount beeswax as a moisturizer after the sun. PERFECT! Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use as a natural sunscreen. It came exactly as described. The smell is not as great as I hoped, but it&#x27;s not horrible either. And it works great. I blend it with coconut oil for the natural SPF and have never used traditional sunscreen since. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It did not smell fresh.  Unfortunately, it smell somewhat rancid.  Had to return it.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this oil.  I was in the sun for several hours and you sure could not tell because my face wasn&#x27;t even a little bit red.  This is the best sunscreen there is.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy that it came in a plastic bottle and also  the oil has a very rancid smell. ......</li>
            <li> All expectations were met.</li>
            <li> Great product used it for sunscreen as my daughter has allergic reactions to preservatives!! I love it&#x27;s consistency as well...</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a sunblock and it works like a charm!  Bought both the raspberry and carrot.  I prefer the raspberry but both products are high quality oils.</li>
            <li> I bought another brand last time. to use on my son as sun screen before school every day. That one worked fine, but this brand smells more, and my 9-year old refuses to use it. I don&#x27;t know if the smell is there because the oil is old, or if this brand just smells more.</li>
            <li> I choose that I loved the product because I use Red Raspberry Seed Oil everyday and it has improved my skin.</li>
            <li> You can find recipes for sunscreen on pinterest &amp; instead of using zinc you may substitute it with this. I put it on my daughter at 11 a and at 6 p she had no burns. Amazing plus her skin was good and moisturized. I will def be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. This does not have the best smell, but if you add it to another oil that has a pleasant aroma, the scent disappears. Smells like you would imagine a seed to smell. I have been using this in my coconut oil along with apricot kernal oil. It is helping to reduce the fine lines around my eyes. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Ooh, that smell...  I&#x27;m not crazy about it. It reminds me a bit of Neem oil which is not a great association - though much milder and just a hint of raspberry if that&#x27;s not just my imagination.  It does seem to provide some sun protection, but practically speaking I don&#x27;t really want to smell like that.  I&#x27;m going to try adding some essential oil to see if that can make it more useable.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I used it in my homemade sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I use this to mix in with Caribbean solutions sunscreen (which is biodegradable) as this raspberry seed oil is a natural sunscreen.  I don&#x27;t like the feel of just raspberry seed oil, too oily, and so, hence, the mixing.  I used this mixture while snorkeling, as I feel like I am not harming the sea life.  It protected my skin and no burning or pinkness.  I also use this in the dry Minnesota winters as a facial moisturizer.  I apply sparingly in the evenings and give it awhile to soak in before bedtime.</li>
            <li> I put this in all my lotion for sunscreen....I have really sensitive skin and cannot use commercial sunscreens...this stuff is perfect!</li>
            <li> LIKE THIS PRODUCT ALOT JUST DONT REALLY CARE FOR THE SPRAY PUMP. I SPLASHES EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> I expected the bottle to contain a dropper. The instructions explain using drops, but the bottle comes with a spayer not a dropper! How do you spray oil? It does not work well and is so messy.</li>
            <li> looking forword to using this in our home made sun screen.</li>
            <li> and it smells so nice</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for very sensitive skin. This does not make me breakout at all. And it doubles as sun protection! I use it every day in the morning under my mineral makeup. It smells great, and soaks into skin pretty fast. Sometimes it can be hard to get your makeup to blend right after putting the raspberry seed oil on. When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I put on my raspberry seed oil first, wait a couple minutes, put some aloe vera gel on, wait a couple minutes, and then put my mineral makeup on. This seems to create a better base for the makeup. But on days when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup, I just put on some raspberry seed oil as moisturizer and I&#x27;m out the door. Will definitely be buying again!! I tried jojoba oil before I tried this, and this is way better for me and my acne. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t know what red raspberry oil should smell like, I can tell you that this one smells an awful lot like olive oil. It&#x27;s not a bad thing but I didn&#x27;t want to use it as a sunscreen since I don&#x27;t trust it. As for a moisturizer it&#x27;s only so-so. I have pretty dry hands because I wash them a lot and it doesn&#x27;t do too much in the way of rehydrating it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use as a sun screen and I really love it. I use it on my face before any long sun exposure and for me it has prevented me from burning. I have also found that after I use it, any blemishes start to clear up by the end of the day. Great item for skin care!</li>
            <li> unfortunately mine smelled rancid -- meaning it had past expired. oil should have a clean light scent</li>
            <li> great sunscreen and healed my dogs dry cracked nose!  will purchase again and have been telling everyone i know about it</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and appears to be quite pure. I used it in my homemade sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Greaat oil even though the smell is not so strong</li>
            <li> This is truly a wonderful essential oil! It absorbs faster than any essential oil I have ever used. It really allows your skin to retain moisture without be oily. I have not been in the sun long enough to see if it has the SPF coverage but love this product whether or not.</li>
            <li> Great for hair treatment &amp; face&lt;br /&gt;pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;good natural sunscreen-never burned when I was out golfing</li>
            <li> I use this in my health and beauty recipes.  Love especially in my homemade sun protection spray.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed to make sunscreen for upcoming trips in summer. I can&#x27;t wait to try using something natural instead of chemical sunscreen. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. Fast delivery, and great oil. I am excited to use this for my own homemade sunscreen.</li>
