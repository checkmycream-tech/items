            <li>The serum in this one seems to be more condensed, which is perfect for nighttime skin care along with the follow-up moisturizing lotion/cream.</li>
            <li>Once she was able to figure out which mask did what, she was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This one smell not as fruity as the papaya one, but is still quite pleasant to me.</li>

            <li>It arrived exactly on time and was packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li>Just placed order of 2 of these more myself!</li>
            <li>The quality of the products are amazing.</li>
            <li>will repurchase the blake rose and marine moisturizing sheets but avoid the arbutus brightening.</li>
            <li>They are so effective and work so</li>
            <li>BUT these are really nice quality masks for a good price, a lot better than the Sephora ones</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried each one from the two types of sheet masks, and I am quite impressed wih the cut and design as well as the quality of the sheet masks.</li>
            <li>and I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I love how the mask has hooks to hook onto your ears</li>
            <li>My favorite ones are the face lifting and tightening serum masks.</li>
            <li>the sheet masks hold more treatment product then the lace ones.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>This was one of the easiest, most pain-free transactions that I have had on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My brother gifted this to me when I started working after graduation.</li>
            <li>but when I get a chance to take care of myself I love these masks because they are fun and easy to apply and It makes me feel good afterwards.</li>
            <li>The seller was extremely easy to work with.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>Also, one of the most important thing I feel is that they feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>They were easy to use in their application</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good and is full of plenty amount of serums, so I think it may also be used as moisturizing mask as well.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t think they do anything remarkable to my skin, I really enjoyed them and unlike many other masks they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>After using two of the lifting and tightening masks my face is chiseled and tight and looks wonderful!</li>
            <li>She has been very happy with them, and will definitely be looking into longer use with her positive praise.</li>
            <li>I can apply the lace masks which go over my ears and stay on hands free as I walk around doing chores or playing with my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>These are nice and thin, fit perfectly and are drenched with products!</li>
            <li>I do hope that the sheet mask alone will be available on the market someday.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I think the trial set is a great deal.</li>
            <li>I leave not the mask for 20 minutes, remove and using circular rubbing to make sure the residue is absorbed by the skin on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>but the ones I&#x27;ve used so far have been good to my skin.</li>
            <li>Loved this product so much that I bought another set to give to a friend as a gift!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>and I love them so much!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to tell the difference between the effects of the 8 types of masks, but they are all very hydrating!</li>
            <li>It comes with 8 different masks made by the company, Each in its own cute packaging.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask and so glad to find out that it sells on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This lovely trial set arrives with fast shipping and professonal packing which exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li>Super results</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more today!</li>
            <li>She keeps telling everyone how much she enjoys using these masks and how special they are.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, love the variety, especially the lace face masks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this variety pack as a gift to your female friends(the packaging is adorable!).</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced too.  </li>
            <li>You must try this and fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>My favorite was the brightening white yogurt lifting lace mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first one I tried is the papaya exfoliating mask made with apple fiber.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it if you are looking for something to calm irritated skin and gently plump and add moisture to your face!</li>
            <li>With such simplified skin care and convenient packaging, I will definitely stock a couple more boxes for home and travel uses!</li>
            <li>I leave them on for 20-30 minutes and really let me face soak in all the liquids.</li>
            <li>These masks do not break me out and are very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this skin care package for anyone.</li>
            <li>They are made and packaged very well</li>
            <li>My favorite one so far are blue triple HA and purple Arbutin.</li>
            <li>I tried other sheet masks and they were thick and fit wasn&#x27;t that great either.</li>
            <li>She was hesitant at first because she couldnâ€™t read the package, but was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>My skin looks lively and the wrinkle/pores are literally disappearing.</li>
            <li>great sheet masks, very thin, but soft and extremely high quality.</li>
            <li>The masks come with a little plastic sheet inside (to help keep the actual mask nice and organized, I recommend unfolding it first, and then placing the mask side with the plastic still ATTACHED, and only removing the plastic after the mask is on your face, and then adjusting it.</li>
            <li>In the pretty competitive Taiwanese sheet mask market, these masks totally do *not* stand out.</li>
            <li>I usually use them before I go to bed (after cleansing and toner), I slap it on for 20 minutes or so (until my skin drinks up most of the goodness) and when I take it off</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and while I feel like the serum works well, the cloth of the other brands&#x27; masks isn&#x27;t as nice.</li>
            <li>I love both the lace (almost feel guilty throwing them away after using) and the super think masks, plus there&#x27;s tons of essence within the package.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>a busy mom</li>
            <li>I tried 3 different kinds of mask of this brand and really like them all</li>
            <li>What I like the most is that once the masks are applied on the face, they stay (for at least 20 mins) until the time to remove them.</li>
            <li>When I wake up the next day and wash my face, my face feels really slippery sometimes (as if there&#x27;s a lot of leftover essence).</li>
            <li>They helped restore the natural color to her face</li>
            <li>I had a lot of extra fat on the lower parts of my face making my face look more round.</li>
            <li>There is so much serum left in the package I have enough for my face, neck, dÃ©colletage, hands, and feet!</li>
            <li>Great ingredients, thick (a few are strange</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s your first time using these, carefully remove and keep the instructions that are attached to the outside plastic covering for later use.</li>
            <li>Also, the effect is not long lasting, I would say 2 days max, so</li>

            <li> Also, the effect is not long lasting, I would say 2 days max, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super hard to untangle the mask after you remove the plastic too soon, especially for the super thin mask.</li>
            <li> Other than that however, it does your skin a lot of favors - soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> College just started again for me and consequently I&#x27;m more sleep deprived than usual, and my skin literally shows the quality of sleep I receive, but with these masks my skin feels and looks rejuvenated (which would otherwise look dull with my sleep depravation).</li>
            <li> am sensitive to perfumes so a few of these bothered me that way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Theres even extra hydration serum in the packet that I can rub onto other areas of my body.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after realizing how dry and rough.</li>
            <li> I just carefully unfold them, put them on, &amp; pull off the plastic.</li>
            <li> A few tiny adjustments &amp; they stay put for the 20-30 mins I leave them on.</li>
            <li> The masks are dripping wet when they come out, and no I&#x27;m not being overdramatic.</li>
            <li> You must carefully remove mask from its package, unfold, place the cloth side on your face and remove the plastic side carefully.</li>
            <li> The other one I tried is the Arbutin brightening/lifting lace mask.</li>
            <li> not sure if there are any long term benefits.</li>
            <li> The other type made with apple fiber fits like gloves as well, and it is so sheer that it feels alomst like a thin layer of jelly.</li>

            <li> Wow. Great ingredients, thick (a few are strange, they&#x27;re huge and think lace front!!</li>
            <li> This set is really cool because you can discover which one you like the best. It comes with 8 different masks made by the company, Each in its own cute packaging. Four are ultra thin masks and four are lacy sheet masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with the cute packaging and quality of all the materials.  Im a busy mom but when I get a chance to take care of myself I love these masks because they are fun and easy to apply and It makes me feel good afterwards. I can apply the lace masks which go over my ears and stay on hands free as I walk around doing chores or playing with my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theres even extra hydration serum in the packet that I can rub onto other areas of my body. I put it on my neck arms and legs.  It makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth. I can&#x27;t say enough about this fab product. It is great quality and I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!! You must try this and fast shipping too!ðŸ˜Š The quality of the products are amazing.</li>
            <li> I love these! I leave them on for 20-30 minutes and really let me face soak in all the liquids. I love how the mask has hooks to hook onto your ears so the mask wont slide off your face. My favorite ones are the face lifting and tightening serum masks. I had a lot of extra fat on the lower parts of my face making my face look more round. After using two of the lifting and tightening masks my face is chiseled and tight and looks wonderful! Definitely buying more today!</li>
            <li> These masks do not break me out and are very hydrating.  While I don&#x27;t think they do anything remarkable to my skin, I really enjoyed them and unlike many other masks they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I tried 3 different kinds of mask of this brand and really like them all so I purchased this set for my sister-in-law&#x27;s birthday. She loves it! She keeps telling everyone how much she enjoys using these masks and how special they are. I highly recommend this variety pack as a gift to your female friends(the packaging is adorable!). It&#x27;s also great for yourself if you don&#x27;t know which kind of their masks to start.</li>
            <li> This mask is AMAZING! I have sensitive skin that is prone to redness and irritation at all times of the day, and from causes that range from using irritating ingredients to rubbing my moisturizer in a bit too hard. The Hey! Pinkgo Girl sheet mask LEFT MY SKIN PERFECT (with NO irritation)!! I bought this product after realizing how dry and rough. This truly helped add moisture and hydrated my skin. It is so calming and pleasant, and I absolutely love that you don&#x27;t have to rinse it off! I have used it as 20 minute mask. Another perk is that I can cook with it on! You can stay complexly mobile!  Even after my face looked as if it was glowing, there was still plenty of essence in the packet, for  my neck, arms and legs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it if you are looking for something to calm irritated skin and gently plump and add moisture to your face!</li>
            <li> I actually hated this the first time I tried them and I thought I&#x27;d give it another shot.&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to perfumes so a few of these bothered me that way. Other than that however, it does your skin a lot of favors - soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Loved this product so much that I bought another set to give to a friend as a gift!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> great sheet masks, very thin, but soft and extremely high quality. will be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> These mask work great while on vacation. They are a bit tricky to put on once you take them out of the bag since they are sort of slimy, but once on they feel great.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, love the variety, especially the lace face masks.</li>
            <li> Nice masks! Great way to try them all.  Very reasonably priced too.  I tried other sheet masks and they were thick and fit wasn&#x27;t that great either. These are nice and thin, fit perfectly and are drenched with products! I actually prefer the sheet masks over the lace masks.  I just fee&lt;br /&gt;Like the sheet masks hold more treatment product then the lace ones.</li>
            <li> Great variety pack, arrived quickly and all the masks were wonderful. My favorite was the brightening white yogurt lifting lace mask.</li>
            <li> I love these masks! I have tried other brands and while I feel like the serum works well, the cloth of the other brands&#x27; masks isn&#x27;t as nice. I have to fuss around adjusting them a lot, whereas with Pinkgo Girl masks I just carefully unfold them, put them on, &amp; pull off the plastic. A few tiny adjustments &amp; they stay put for the 20-30 mins I leave them on. I think their secret is the ultra thin cloth. There is so much serum left in the package I have enough for my face, neck, dÃ©colletage, hands, and feet!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 packs of the marine moisturizing masks when I visited Taiwan last year. I really like this mask and so glad to find out that it sells on Amazon. I bought this LE two weeks ago. I have tried 6 of them thus far.&lt;br /&gt;I like almost all of them except the brightening arbutin mask. It smelled weird after I applied it to my face. It smelled like a worse version of the SK II Treatment Lotion. I am not sure if it supposed smelling like that or it simply just got spoiled.&lt;br /&gt;I will repurchase the blake rose and marine moisturizing sheets but avoid the arbutus brightening.</li>
            <li> This lovely trial set arrives with fast shipping and professonal packing which exceeds my expectations. So far I&#x27;ve tried each one from the two types of sheet masks, and I am quite impressed wih the cut and design as well as the quality of the sheet masks. The lace design is SO cute and unique with strechy fibers that fits perfectly on my face. The other type made with apple fiber fits like gloves as well, and it is so sheer that it feels alomst like a thin layer of jelly. What I like the most is that once the masks are applied on the face, they stay (for at least 20 mins) until the time to remove them. No worries to hold or to keep adjusting the sheet masks ever! I do hope that the sheet mask alone will be available on the market someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I tried is the papaya exfoliating mask made with apple fiber. It smells pretty good and is full of plenty amount of serums, so I think it may also be used as moisturizing mask as well. The other one I tried is the Arbutin brightening/lifting lace mask. This one smell not as fruity as the papaya one, but is still quite pleasant to me. The serum in this one seems to be more condensed, which is perfect for nighttime skin care along with the follow-up moisturizing lotion/cream. Overall, I think the trial set is a great deal. With such simplified skin care and convenient packaging, I will definitely stock a couple more boxes for home and travel uses!</li>
            <li> Love them. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent! The seller was extremely easy to work with. It arrived exactly on time and was packaged perfectly. I would absolutely recommend this skin care package for anyone. It is very nice to be able to have a choice of which skin care products to use, depending on when I need them. This was one of the easiest, most pain-free transactions that I have had on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A great way to try a variety of types to see what you like best or for adding to spa gift packs for a family member that likes things like this.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:7c1e2b2931bdbfe1a54a6a8813ce3d06]] I have been using these sheets masks for a while now and I love them so much! They are so effective and work so so well! The customer service is simply impeccable too! I would recommend any of these sheet masks to guys and girls alike. They are made and packaged very well, they cling to your face perfectly and leave you with beautiful glowing skin!!</li>
            <li> In the pretty competitive Taiwanese sheet mask market, these masks totally do *not* stand out. I&#x27;ve tried almost all from this pack now. They&#x27;ve all given about the same results: very mediocre hydration (you might as well just put on some hydrating toner and move on with your life), and they consistently fail to deliver the advertised effect (brightening, deep hydration, etc.). In addition, the lace masks in this set are insanely itchy and uncomfortable to wear. I think I&#x27;ll stick to My Beauty Diary and Annie&#x27;s Way.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to tell the difference between the effects of the 8 types of masks, but they are all very hydrating! I usually use them before I go to bed (after cleansing and toner), I slap it on for 20 minutes or so (until my skin drinks up most of the goodness) and when I take it off I do notice a big difference. College just started again for me and consequently I&#x27;m more sleep deprived than usual, and my skin literally shows the quality of sleep I receive, but with these masks my skin feels and looks rejuvenated (which would otherwise look dull with my sleep depravation). I love both the lace (almost feel guilty throwing them away after using) and the super think masks, plus there&#x27;s tons of essence within the package. The masks are dripping wet when they come out, and no I&#x27;m not being overdramatic. The masks come with a little plastic sheet inside (to help keep the actual mask nice and organized, I recommend unfolding it first, and then placing the mask side with the plastic still ATTACHED, and only removing the plastic after the mask is on your face, and then adjusting it. It&#x27;s super hard to untangle the mask after you remove the plastic too soon, especially for the super thin mask. SO why 4 stars? Sometimes I feel like the product doesn&#x27;t fully absorb? When I wake up the next day and wash my face, my face feels really slippery sometimes (as if there&#x27;s a lot of leftover essence). Also, the effect is not long lasting, I would say 2 days max, so not sure if there are any long term benefits. BUT these are really nice quality masks for a good price, a lot better than the Sephora ones *cough cough*. So yeah try it if you haven&#x27;t! :D</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s your first time using these, carefully remove and keep the instructions that are attached to the outside plastic covering for later use. You must carefully remove mask from its package, unfold, place the cloth side on your face and remove the plastic side carefully. I haven&#x27;t used each type yet but the ones I&#x27;ve used so far have been good to my skin. I leave not the mask for 20 minutes, remove and using circular rubbing to make sure the residue is absorbed by the skin on my face and neck. I also use the residue left on the mask and inside the package to apply on my face, neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage ( upper chest area). After which there&#x27;s mo need for moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li> My brother gifted this to me when I started working after graduation. The morning to evening work along with dust and pollution was making my screen really dull. But from the moment I have started using these sheets, the result is just absurd! They are easy to apply and remove. Also, one of the most important thing I feel is that they feel comfortable. My skin looks lively and the wrinkle/pores are literally disappearing. The quality of masks seems really good. My favorite one so far are blue triple HA and purple Arbutin. I recommend it to everyone, this is a must have item in your daily inventory. Just placed order of 2 of these more myself!</li>
            <li> Great deal . Super results</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife because she is always looking for quality skin care products to review for her health and beauty writing column. She was hesitant at first because she couldnâ€™t read the package, but was pleasantly surprised by the results. Once she was able to figure out which mask did what, she was very happy with the results. Her skin was clearer and smoother than it had been before trying the masks. They were easy to use in their application They helped restore the natural color to her face She has been very happy with them, and will definitely be looking into longer use with her positive praise. Great product; packaged perfectly, and definitely worth every penny, for the improved clearer skin.</li>
