            <li>Excellent service and top quality</li>
            <li>Loved my Panasonic razor when I got it.</li>
            <li>Each of the blades has to be pulled out and reinstalled in a kind of sea-saw motion.  </li>
            <li>The best for a fast shave.</li>
            <li>Best razor I have ever owned just need new head every 6 months.</li>
            <li>Genuine Panasonic part at a good price</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t remember how great your razor was when you first met it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT SEEMED LIKE I WAS SPENDING MORE TIME TO GET</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving two stars because the cartridge itself looks ok, it just made no improvement.</li>
            <li>The electric shaver that this replacement blade and foil set fits is an outstanding shaver.  </li>
            <li>Shaves okay but does hut the skin quite often.</li>
            <li>Oem on the shaver was allot better.</li>
            <li>Love Amazon</li>
            <li>shave better than the worn one</li>
            <li>Good price on this surprisingly hard to find replacement blades for THE BEST SHAVER!</li>
            <li>but I am positive it will be as good as what I&#x27;m using now.</li>
            <li>The product itself came in Panasonic branded packaging, and was fairly easy to install.  </li>
            <li>I STRONGLY suggest keeping the foil protected by included plastic case at all times.</li>
            <li>Restored my razor back to its original (very good) performance.</li>
            <li>Panasonic electric shavers are the best of all hands down.</li>
            <li>IT MADE A HUGE TIME DIFFERANCE</li>
            <li>Had bought the &#x27;best&#x27; electric shaver a few years ago.</li>
            <li>Works as well as the original</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the price of this combo set fluctuates here on Amazon, but I got it for fifty-five dollars, which is certainly more cost effective than buying the foil and cutter individually.</li>
            <li>Razor back to new condition giving a great shave</li>
            <li>Came from UK but worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is well worth changing these parts every year.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I consider the Panasonic electric shavers to be excellent, and one really needs to replace its blades at least once per year.  </li>
            <li>Like using a brand new razor, easy installation.</li>
            <li>This combo foil and cutter set works great, makes my shaver run much quieter, and, best of all, restores the cutting performance to the same as it was when I first purchased the shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this blade and foil set and they make my shaver shave like new again smooth with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Is exactly that I am looking</li>
            <li>This item worked perfectly, but is expensive.</li>
            <li>Top quality, direct replacement.....makes my razor run like new again and cut fast.</li>
            <li>I tried various other brands over the years, but 40 years ago, I settled on Panasonic and I&#x27;m still happy.</li>
            <li>Very good but expensive</li>
            <li>Pricey (&#x3D;minus one star), but a much better price here than anywhere else I could find.</li>
            <li>High quality, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Ihave a new razor again!</li>
            <li>Works ok, I found these don&#x27;t last as long as I would like, maybe change is required every 12 months</li>
            <li>If you want to keep your shaver operating effectively, then you need to replace the blades and foil at least each year.  </li>
            <li>The foil pops out of its plastic frame, and the new one pops in.  </li>
            <li>Made my razor like new.</li>
            <li>Keeps my razor shaving like new</li>
            <li>Made my husband&#x27;s shaver like brand new.</li>
            <li>THAT I WOULD NEED NEW BLADES</li>
            <li>Like a new razor once again.</li>
            <li>The shaving performance was renewed so that it now shaves like new.</li>
            <li>Now the razor is like new.</li>
            <li>Fits the new eslv 95s Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li>When replacing the foil and blades with this kit, it feels as if you you just purchased a new razor.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve spent so much on this high-end model shaver to start with, it&#x27;s well worth it to replace these on an annual basis.</li>
            <li>And I feel a some improvement after replacing the old one with this</li>
            <li>I thought replacing my 3 year old cartridge would a make a difference.</li>
            <li>It closes all the time unexpectedly.</li>
            <li>Factory replacement to put your shaver back to new .. !</li>
            <li>Sometimes I wonder if I am really saving money with my expensive razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, straight razor replacements are very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My last foil and cutter lasted for over a year and a half, but I only shave my face and head with the Panasonic after first shaving with a Gillette Mach 3.</li>

            <li> I have extremely course Italian facial hair, if that makes a difference.</li>

            <li> I waited about a year and a half to buy this replacement for my Arc 5 which was probably too long.  </li>

            <li> Big waste of my time!</li>

            <li> I do, and I have trouble with razor irritation, razor nicks, and closeness of shave.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but only option with a Panasonic Arc-5 razor</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I waited about a year and a half to buy this replacement for my Arc 5 which was probably too long.  My razor is back to how it was when I bought it.  I guess I would say 1 year is about the lifecycle of these blades.  The product itself came in Panasonic branded packaging, and was fairly easy to install.  The foil pops out of its plastic frame, and the new one pops in.  Each of the blades has to be pulled out and reinstalled in a kind of sea-saw motion.  It is pretty expensive, but for a yearly investment it is still probably cheaper than cartridges.</li>
            <li> Great used before best razor in the wold period Endof story.</li>
            <li> As described It is cheaper then on Panasonic website And I feel a some improvement after replacing the old one with this</li>
            <li> Expensive, but only option with a Panasonic Arc-5 razor</li>
            <li> Made my razor like new.</li>
            <li> Have these as spares, know from using the ones coming with the razor,&lt;br /&gt;they will be great. great.</li>
            <li> Had bought the &#x27;best&#x27; electric shaver a few years ago. Wasn&#x27;t cutting well. Found this replacement blade. Works like new - if not better. Came from UK but worth it.</li>
            <li> Fits my Panasonic ES-LV61 shaver. Panasonic changed the replacement blade number in the year and a half since I ordered the last set (outer foil and inner blades). I was concerned that WES9032 would not fit (the previous model number was WES9030). Not to worry - it works perfectly. It is also about half the price of the other part number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well worth changing these parts every year. Because the razor gets dull very slowly, you don&#x27;t realize it isn&#x27;t working like new anymore. This is my third set of blades on this razor.</li>
            <li> Is exactly that I am looking</li>
            <li> Keeps my razor shaving like new</li>
            <li> Excellent met my expectation.</li>
            <li> Genuine Panasonic part at a good price</li>
            <li> Panasonic electric shavers are the best of all hands down.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the original</li>
            <li> Made my husband&#x27;s shaver like brand new. 3 seconds to install. Just awesome</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, the product is just as described. I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Ihave a new razor again!</li>
            <li> Works ok, I found these don&#x27;t last as long as I would like, maybe change is required every 12 months</li>
            <li> DID NOT REALIZE AFER SHAVING MY HEAVY BEARD THAT I WOULD NEED NEW BLADES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT SEEMED LIKE I WAS SPENDING MORE TIME TO GET THAT CLOSE SHAVE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONCE I REPLACED THE BLADES IT MADE A HUGE TIME DIFFERANCE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOOKS LIKE I NEED TO REPLACE THESE ABOUT EVERY 8-10 MONTHS AS I SHAVE EVERY DAY</li>
            <li> Like a new razor once again. Do note, these foils are VERY delicate. Replace whenever you notice the slightest bend. Expensive, yes. I STRONGLY suggest keeping the foil protected by included plastic case at all times.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and top quality</li>
            <li> High quality, fast shipping. Recommended A+++++</li>
            <li> I have not used this but I am positive it will be as good as what I&#x27;m using now.</li>
            <li> Loved my Panasonic razor when I got it. Over the next 18 months it slowly became less effective….but so gradually that I didn&#x27;t even realize it. Replaced the foil and cutters…WOW what a difference. Will now replace every 12 months.</li>
            <li> As usual when replacing the cutters and screen, it&#x27;s like getting a new shaver.  If you&#x27;ve spent so much on this high-end model shaver to start with, it&#x27;s well worth it to replace these on an annual basis.</li>
            <li> I thought replacing my 3 year old cartridge would a make a difference. The difference is negligable if a difference at all. I&#x27;m giving two stars because the cartridge itself looks ok, it just made no improvement. I have extremely course Italian facial hair, if that makes a difference. If anything, that should mean a new cartridge would be a noticable improvement.</li>
            <li> Worked Great. The shaving performance was renewed so that it now shaves like new.</li>
            <li> Great replacement. Now the razor is like new.</li>
            <li> just refills you can&#x27;t get anything else a bit expensive</li>
            <li> The best for a fast shave. Do not like the flip up part. It should lock open. It closes all the time unexpectedly.</li>
            <li> Fits the new eslv 95s Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> Pricey (&#x3D;minus one star), but a much better price here than anywhere else I could find. Restored my razor back to its original (very good) performance. Yay!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace the foil and cutter on my blue Panasonic LV-61. My last foil and cutter lasted for over a year and a half, but I only shave my face and head with the Panasonic after first shaving with a Gillette Mach 3. I like it close! This combo foil and cutter set works great, makes my shaver run much quieter, and, best of all, restores the cutting performance to the same as it was when I first purchased the shaver. I&#x27;ve noticed the price of this combo set fluctuates here on Amazon, but I got it for fifty-five dollars, which is certainly more cost effective than buying the foil and cutter individually.</li>
            <li> Razor back to new condition giving a great shave</li>
            <li> Description says for ES-LV95-LV81-LV65-LV61.  I have a ES-LV81 and it will NOT fit.  Big waste of my time!</li>
            <li> This item worked perfectly, but is expensive.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t remember how great your razor was when you first met it.&lt;br /&gt;This will remind you that.</li>
            <li> Top quality, direct replacement.....makes my razor run like new again and cut fast.</li>
            <li> Good price on this surprisingly hard to find replacement blades for THE BEST SHAVER!</li>
            <li> Very good but expensive</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever owned just need new head every 6 months. I can never get them to last longer than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Panasonic Electric wet/dry razor for years. I tried various other brands over the years, but 40 years ago, I settled on Panasonic and I&#x27;m still happy. That&#x27;s why I bought these replacement foils and blades. Just replace them once a year.</li>
            <li> The electric shaver that this replacement blade and foil set fits is an outstanding shaver.  I have previously commented on the shaver.  This replacement unit keeps the shaver operating at peak efficiency.  If you want to keep your shaver operating effectively, then you need to replace the blades and foil at least each year.  I do, and I have trouble with razor irritation, razor nicks, and closeness of shave.</li>
            <li> Shaves okay but does hut the skin quite often. Oem on the shaver was allot better.</li>
            <li> Like using a brand new razor, easy installation.</li>
            <li> Factory replacement to put your shaver back to new .. !</li>
            <li> Simply perfect. Love Amazon</li>
            <li> I have been using the original blades and outer foil set for a year, I noticed that the blades were dragging while cutting my beard, like a lawn mower mowing high grass, also my face was starting to irritate me after shaving, I do use pre and after electric shave lotion, but it was due to the dullness of the blades. I bought this blade and foil set and they make my shaver shave like new again smooth with no irritation. What I don&#x27;t like about them is the price, that is why I gave it four stars instead of five</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I wonder if I am really saving money with my expensive razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, straight razor replacements are very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, to purchase a $300 Panasonic premium shaver and to have to buy these replacement blades and foil every year seems to almost be a &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; when you consider the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I consider the Panasonic electric shavers to be excellent, and one really needs to replace its blades at least once per year.  When replacing the foil and blades with this kit, it feels as if you you just purchased a new razor.</li>
            <li> shave better than the worn one</li>
