            <li> Received on time. The product is amazing, helps to reduce the puffiness around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the cream is light i feel my skin is still breathing. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have loved this since it came out in the 1980s.  I leave it by my bed and apply it as I get up in the morning.  It feels cool and refreshing while keeping my under-eye area moist and smooth.  Especially great to use before going to morning exercise class!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. it feels cool on the eyes. Some days it seems to work wonders and puffiness is immediately relieved and somedays not so much but it is very moisturizing and feels cool and refreshing so it&#x27;s worth the 7$ I paid at TJ Maxx.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t help wrinkles but puffiness is better</li>
            <li> Liked this one very much.  It absorbs instantly and feel just great.  I would definitely order this product again.  Good price too!</li>
            <li> Really decreases undereye swelling.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the purchase.  This product has been my go to for years.  It feels like a spa treatment every time.  It feels like velvet going on and my skin drinks it up.</li>
            <li> love this stuff for my one under eye puff!!!&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately I THINK it is discontinued!</li>
            <li> I use this product for moisturizing and darkness. I find it to be very refreshing and has a good price point.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I have always liked Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s skin products.  She makes great moisturizers.  The eye treatment package was bent up.  I used to work for Elizabeth Arden in a Department Store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that hates sticking their fingers into a pot to scoop out eye cream so I love that these come in little tubes. I&#x27;m not sure if the product is doing anything but it feels really soft on my skin so I am going to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I having been using this product for over six months, and I am amazed how quickly it works. I wake up with bags under my eyes, so I apply in that area. It works immediately.</li>
            <li> This product is okay but not what I was expecting.  The tube was very small and didn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see that it made any difference around my eye area.</li>
            <li> Have used this eye treatment for years. It is especially effective when cold. A quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love the Good Morning Eye Treatment.  I have used many many eye treatments and nothing worked.  This is the first one that showed immediate relief.  Even my husband noticed.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping and item as described...</li>
            <li> great, soothing and no reaction from my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> So not worth it! Yes it does moisturize, but does nothing for tightening or lifting. Dare I say waste of money gimmick?!</li>
            <li> Of all the eye proucts I use or have used for those &amp;#34;crows feet and worry lines&amp;#34; women over a certain seem to get this is one of the best products I have found. With the rare exception for the past thirty-five years Elizabeth Arden has been the only product line I have used. Her products are light, actually work and one doesn&#x27;t feel like their face is weighted down with alot of not so good ingredients.</li>
