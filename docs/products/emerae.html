            <li>Loves all the ways it adjusts and so light weight!  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I was able to find this mirror and buy it.  </li>
            <li>I tried many times to get the hang of using this, but just couldn&#x27;t seem to get it to cooperate.  </li>

            <li>I love this mirror.</li>

            <li>I tried it more than once, and it did not stay in place</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure that it would work</li>

            <li>I need to see the back of my hair for styling--so this is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought both of the them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I love that it is do easy to use.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair so this will work great for the back.</li>
            <li>Love this mirror leaves hands free .  </li>
            <li>I ordered both the Emerae and Bella-Specchio Hands Free Mirrors and love them both.</li>
            <li>For many years I&#x27;ve used an around the neck hands free mirror for styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>My french twist  hairdo has never looked so good!</li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy for the elderly to use.</li>
            <li>This mirror is well designed, sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This mirror is not as easy to use as I had envisioned.  </li>
            <li>Also easy for traveling.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one thinking it would be easy to use</li>
            <li>Is easily adjustable to your neck.</li>
            <li>and the handles would break easily within 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Well made and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The mirror tilts and swivels making it easy to use all around the head without having to readjust the neck piece or balance bar.  </li>
            <li>The construction is strong.  </li>
            <li>Magnification too strong.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight and easy to pack for travel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a hands free mirror for years when coloring my hair.  </li>
            <li>and thus I purchased this for her to enjoy.</li>
            <li>But there was a notation that it was available for pick up at PO.  </li>
            <li>However, it does meet my needs for hands free hair styling.</li>
            <li>I have been using/ordering the plastic hands free mirror</li>
            <li>Decided to try the Emerae Hands Free Mirror</li>
            <li>I was happy to find several types of around the neck mirrors on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Now it just sits in my bathroom, in its original package, in that ratty ol&#x27; box staring at me.</li>
            <li>The Emerae Hands Free Mirror, however, is exactly what I want!  </li>
            <li>I only had about two good uses from it.</li>
            <li>They are both very well made!!</li>
            <li>I got this mirror so that I could cut the back of my hair more easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit around my neck very well.</li>
            <li>Very maneuverable and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The magnifying&lt;br /&gt;side is also useful when applying makeup.</li>
            <li>It is even better than my old one ever was.</li>
            <li>I purchased it so I would be able to style the back of my hair hands free.</li>
            <li>Use this to cut my own hair: it takes a bit of getting used to working on the back of our head.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$.</li>
            <li>This item is sturdy, well made, and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>A little pricy, but I am glad I purchased the better one.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra bucks and get a better made mirror.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>being able to see the back of your head and using both hands to adjust any problems with your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might seem good for the first two uses, but after that, WHAT A WASTE.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be perfect for travel, but it is uncomfortable and does not stay in place well when trying to style my hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly like I had years ago.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter to resolve the problem of not being able to see the back of her head.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something like this very much, but it doesn&#x27;t stay around my neck very well</li>
            <li>THIS mirror is fully adjustable in every possible direction, is of very sound construction, and keeps steady while in use (no wobbling).  </li>
            <li>I had one years ago but haven&#x27;t been able to find one in the stores in a long time.</li>
            <li>This frees up my hands so I can arrange the back of my hair easily.  </li>
            <li>Once accustomed to adjusting it, I can easily work with the back of my hair using both hands.</li>
            <li>I bought a cheap, plastic Chinese-made similar product and it broke on the first use.</li>
            <li>Finally a hands free mirror that doesn&#x27;t look like it will break the first month I use it.  </li>
            <li>It is large and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Made so cheap , not sturdy enough would not recommend it.</li>
            <li>This mirror was more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I had a hands free mirror for 30 years and the mirror size was the same as this one.</li>
            <li>It was very flimsy.</li>
            <li>They picked it out from several available.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>Bought one for my elderly mother, and the mirror has made it so much easier for her to apply make-up, etc.</li>
            <li>Not like cheap plastic ones that don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolute necessity.  </li>
            <li>For daily use I bought the Emerae Hands Free Mirror.  </li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>This was a very well designed product.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Still, at least as good as others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Total length was only 9&amp;#34;, lightweight and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s not exactly hands free!  </li>
            <li>So many purchases I have made have been average.</li>
            <li>When styling my hair, I can see the right side just fine but am having trouble adjusting the mirror</li>
            <li>Will not stay steady.</li>
            <li>I have an older mirror like this one, but I do like this one just as well.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and I am using it daily.</li>
            <li>this Hands Free Mirror is the only thing I ever found to replace my worn old mirror.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this mirror.  </li>
            <li>If you need this type mirror, then I highly recommend this one.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra money!  </li>
            <li>I had put off ordering this mirror for a long time and glad I finally made this purchase.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but it is a little to large.</li>
            <li>It kept falling right or left when I put my arm(s)</li>
            <li>This new one is a bit bulkier, but I have gotten used to it</li>
            <li>It really helps her to style the back of her hair.</li>
            <li>I have no trouble &amp;#34;wearing&amp;#34; it around my neck when using it.  </li>
            <li>I look at my old mirror and wonder why the simplicity of it can&#x27;t be made again.  </li>
            <li>She was using a twenty year old plastic one that fell a part each time she used it.</li>
            <li>Can adjust to see back of head perfectly ,I really like it.</li>
            <li>Have cut my own hair for years, but never satisfied with the back - this definitely solves the problem.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be found in stores, stepson had one he got from grandfather and wanted me to look for one on garage sales, however, as usual, it was available on Amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a hands free mirror for years but had a hard time finding a replacement for my old one.</li>
            <li>The mirror is large enough for you to see the entire back of your head and both sides.</li>
            <li>plastic mirror is very flimsy and probably will not last long.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it briefly so far</li>
            <li>They said is was much lower quality than they expected.</li>
            <li>I would be better off buying those handheld mirrors I could get from a beauty supply store and holding that behind my head while looking at my hair through a bigger mirror.</li>
            <li>Of the many hands free mirrors I have purchased in the past several years, this is one of the very few that hasn&#x27;t broken within the first few months.  </li>

            <li> Use this to cut my own hair: it takes a bit of getting used to working on the back of our head.</li>
            <li> Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> This item is sturdy, well made, and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> A little pricy, but I am glad I purchased the better one.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra bucks and get a better made mirror.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> being able to see the back of your head and using both hands to adjust any problems with your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might seem good for the first two uses, but after that, WHAT A WASTE.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be perfect for travel, but it is uncomfortable and does not stay in place well when trying to style my hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly like I had years ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to resolve the problem of not being able to see the back of her head.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something like this very much, but it doesn&#x27;t stay around my neck very well</li>
            <li> THIS mirror is fully adjustable in every possible direction, is of very sound construction, and keeps steady while in use (no wobbling).  </li>
            <li> I had one years ago but haven&#x27;t been able to find one in the stores in a long time.</li>
            <li> This frees up my hands so I can arrange the back of my hair easily.  </li>
            <li> Once accustomed to adjusting it, I can easily work with the back of my hair using both hands.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap, plastic Chinese-made similar product and it broke on the first use.</li>
            <li> Finally a hands free mirror that doesn&#x27;t look like it will break the first month I use it.  </li>
            <li> It is large and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Made so cheap , not sturdy enough would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This mirror was more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I had a hands free mirror for 30 years and the mirror size was the same as this one.</li>
            <li> It was very flimsy.</li>
            <li> They picked it out from several available.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li> Bought one for my elderly mother, and the mirror has made it so much easier for her to apply make-up, etc.</li>
            <li> Not like cheap plastic ones that don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an absolute necessity.  </li>
            <li> For daily use I bought the Emerae Hands Free Mirror.  </li>
            <li> She really likes it.</li>
            <li> This was a very well designed product.</li>
            <li> She really likes it.  </li>
            <li> Still, at least as good as others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Total length was only 9&amp;#34;, lightweight and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s not exactly hands free!  </li>
            <li> So many purchases I have made have been average.</li>
            <li> When styling my hair, I can see the right side just fine but am having trouble adjusting the mirror</li>
            <li> Will not stay steady.</li>
            <li> I have an older mirror like this one, but I do like this one just as well.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and I am using it daily.</li>
            <li> this Hands Free Mirror is the only thing I ever found to replace my worn old mirror.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this mirror.  </li>
            <li> If you need this type mirror, then I highly recommend this one.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra money!  </li>
            <li> I had put off ordering this mirror for a long time and glad I finally made this purchase.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but it is a little to large.</li>
            <li> It kept falling right or left when I put my arm(s)</li>
            <li> This new one is a bit bulkier, but I have gotten used to it</li>
            <li> It really helps her to style the back of her hair.</li>
            <li> I have no trouble &amp;#34;wearing&amp;#34; it around my neck when using it.  </li>
            <li> I look at my old mirror and wonder why the simplicity of it can&#x27;t be made again.  </li>
            <li> She was using a twenty year old plastic one that fell a part each time she used it.</li>
            <li> Can adjust to see back of head perfectly ,I really like it.</li>
            <li> Have cut my own hair for years, but never satisfied with the back - this definitely solves the problem.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be found in stores, stepson had one he got from grandfather and wanted me to look for one on garage sales, however, as usual, it was available on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a hands free mirror for years but had a hard time finding a replacement for my old one.</li>
            <li> The mirror is large enough for you to see the entire back of your head and both sides.</li>
            <li> plastic mirror is very flimsy and probably will not last long.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it briefly so far</li>
            <li> They said is was much lower quality than they expected.</li>
            <li> I would be better off buying those handheld mirrors I could get from a beauty supply store and holding that behind my head while looking at my hair through a bigger mirror.</li>
            <li> Of the many hands free mirrors I have purchased in the past several years, this is one of the very few that hasn&#x27;t broken within the first few months.  </li>
            <li> The shaft is to long and makes it wobble on a short person.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit awkward to store, but sure beats the frustration of the constant breaking of the plastic variety.  </li>
            <li> This is a little more expensive than the plastic ones, but - being metal - hopefully it will last a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> What took me so long to order this???</li>
            <li> but I wear my hair in short layers and can do the basic cut and trim but found it difficult to get the back of my hair even and consistent using a hand mirror.</li>
            <li> It did not live up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very big in length, extremely bulky and so heavy at the mirror end that it wobbles back and forth as you are moving your arms with a comb or brush.  </li>
            <li> She had one from her cosmetologist days, that broke a few years back.  </li>
            <li> Even though this package was sent 2-day priority USPS made no attempt to deliver this mirror nor did they leave a pink slip.  </li>
            <li> I expected to be brought to the door (remember, this package was sent 2-day priority).  </li>
            <li> She just loves this, she had just recently told me she needed a new one because her old one, a plastic one, was in really bad shape</li>
            <li> I have tried other ones and they broke within a month of having it.  </li>
            <li> Its made of aluminum, brass and other high-quality materials.</li>
            <li> It has a wide balance bar at the base for stability while using, and many durable adjustable screws and wing nuts.  </li>
            <li> Is just a little wobbly when on and not easy to keep in place when working on back of head.  </li>
            <li> Mirror is a little heavier than I expected, and could use some padding on the bars that rest on your chest.</li>
            <li> This mirror enables me to use both hands to steady the scissors or trimmer while cutting the back sections.  </li>
            <li> At times I wish it were &amp;#34;weighted&amp;#34; down as it does turn as I turn.</li>
            <li> Whenever I would angle the mirror on my neck, it gradually (noticeably) falls down.</li>
            <li> The last around the neck mirror that I bought had a very small bar to stabilize it and did not work, it was returned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the cheaper version of this mirror by another manufacturer which lasted less than one year.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> A bit on the large size and a little awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay steady, mirror to small and metal is uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Certainly wasted my money with this one.</li>
            <li> I got tired of puting it back together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to purchase a small one just for traveling because this is too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit on the small side</li>
            <li> The neck piece is uncomfortable the part that rests against your chest is not very stable.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and very overpriced for the quality especially the mirror,i.e., the magnifying mirror is distorted and this is not unusual today, unfortunately!</li>
            <li> It is expensive but you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> A bit awkward but works.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding it!</li>
            <li> I actually hate to pay for the privilege of having to go and pick up an item(s)</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit around my neck very well.</li>
            <li> Very handy for shaving.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother, she is 82, soon to be 83 next month. She just loves this, she had just recently told me she needed a new one because her old one, a plastic one, was in really bad shape she had it all taped up trying to hold it together! So I got on line and found this one and bought it for a surprise for her. She called me as soon as it came in! Loves all the ways it adjusts and so light weight!  She called it a deluxe model!</li>
            <li> Just as described. Lightweight and easy for the elderly to use. Spend the extra bucks and get a better made mirror.</li>
            <li> This frees up my hands so I can arrange the back of my hair easily.  The magnifying&lt;br /&gt;side is also useful when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I was able to find this mirror and buy it.  I am now able to cut my own hair at home and save money.  The mirror is every thing that was advertised it would be....Margaret W.</li>
            <li> I tried many times to get the hang of using this, but just couldn&#x27;t seem to get it to cooperate.  It kept falling right or left when I put my arm(s) up to comb my hair.  I&#x27;m a bit on the small side so maybe that was the problem!</li>
            <li> This is a very good mirror.  It is expensive but you get what you pay for.  Well made and stays put when you move it.  I would highly recommend this mirror.  Well worth the money and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the cheaper version of this mirror by another manufacturer which lasted less than one year.  THIS mirror is fully adjustable in every possible direction, is of very sound construction, and keeps steady while in use (no wobbling).  Well worth the extra money!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Made so cheap , not sturdy enough would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a hands free mirror for years when coloring my hair.  When it finally refused to stay at the angle that I put it in, I bought this one.  It is even better than my old one ever was.</li>
            <li> I thought I would never find another neck mirror.  I have used them for years and my last one crumbled from age.  I cut my own hair and could not do it without one of these mirrors.  There were a number to choose from and I believe this one was the best choice.  I like that there are not plastic parts.</li>
            <li> TOO POWERFUL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish its magnification was only 5 and not 8. Good product, however. Will keep it and use it.</li>
            <li> This mirror is well designed, sturdy and easy to use. It is exactly as described. Once accustomed to adjusting it, I can easily work with the back of my hair using both hands. I had put off ordering this mirror for a long time and glad I finally made this purchase.</li>
            <li> received in great shape.  Love this mirror leaves hands free .  Bar across the bottom helps to stabilize the mirror&lt;br /&gt;Price was fair and I would recommend.  I have had similar mirrors this however is the best yet,</li>
            <li> Mirror returned-  it was akward on my neck and did not stay in place when I moved my arms to style the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> Still learning to use it. The neck piece is uncomfortable the part that rests against your chest is not very stable. I am hoping to find a way to use to style my hair.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair so this mirror is perfect for it. At times I wish it were &amp;#34;weighted&amp;#34; down as it does turn as I turn. I had a difficult time finding it! I&#x27;m happy I found this one!</li>
            <li> My mom had been looking for one of these for years.  She had one from her cosmetologist days, that broke a few years back.  It really helps her to style the back of her hair.</li>
            <li> just what i needed to replace the one i broke use it when i trim the back of my hair</li>
            <li> Something you can&#x27;t buy anymore, gift requested by stepson.  Can&#x27;t be found in stores, stepson had one he got from grandfather and wanted me to look for one on garage sales, however, as usual, it was available on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two plastic mirrors like this, which both broke.  This is a little more expensive than the plastic ones, but - being metal - hopefully it will last a lot longer.  I couldn&#x27;t do without this, as I cut and style my hair myself.  A great product!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money! Frame is flimsy .</li>
            <li> I love how light and cheery the set is!!  It looks great in the master bedroom!</li>
            <li> I have one of these in a different brand and use it to highlight the back of my hair. My mother in law thought it was a great thing and thus I purchased this for her to enjoy. So far so good!</li>
            <li> This mirror was more than I expected.  It is large and very sturdy.  I have tried other ones and they broke within a month of having it.  This one is wonderful!  I used it every day.  Thank you for such a quality product!!!  You won&#x27;t regret getting this.</li>
            <li> I have only used it briefly so far but I bought it to replace one that was destroyed in a house fire years ago. I and others I know have been looking for one like this but have not seen one anywhere. I was very pleased to find this on Amazon and I was not even concerned about the price. So far, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> works well but the magnifying side is blurry</li>
            <li> This mirror is made in America and is of first-rate quality! I bought a cheap, plastic Chinese-made similar product and it broke on the first use. This mirror, although three times more expensive, will last a lifetime or longer. Its made of aluminum, brass and other high-quality materials. Buy it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This mirror is not as easy to use as I had envisioned.  When styling my hair, I can see the right side just fine but am having trouble adjusting the mirror so I can see the left side of my hair.  I purchased it so I would be able to style the back of my hair hands free.</li>
            <li> In description of item it indicated that it came with a decorative gift box..but, did not receive.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is smaller than I imagined but otherwise is as described.</li>
            <li> Use this to cut my own hair: it takes a bit of getting used to working on the back of our head. Very easy  adjustg for angle and distance frm your face.</li>
            <li> This is a quality mirror and works as intended.  I had one of these when a teenager and used it constantly.  I was really happy to find this one at amazon.com and happy it&#x27;s made in the USA.  I have no trouble &amp;#34;wearing&amp;#34; it around my neck when using it.  If I could change anything, it would be to make the mirror slightly larger, hence the 4 stars.  Still and all, I&#x27;d buy this again and it will get a lot of use.  If you need this type mirror, then I highly recommend this one.  Big bonus:  being able to see the back of your head and using both hands to adjust any problems with your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special note:  The shipper had two day priority in two different places on the package so this comment is NOT directed toward the mirror company.  Even though this package was sent 2-day priority USPS made no attempt to deliver this mirror nor did they leave a pink slip.  I found out it was at PO by signing on line.  There was no 800 number, no indication delivery had been attempted, no indication it would be delivered at all, natta, nothing.  But there was a notation that it was available for pick up at PO.  I&#x27;m making note of this here since there is some controversy now regarding shippers being used by amazon.com.  I actually hate to pay for the privilege of having to go and pick up an item(s) I expected to be brought to the door (remember, this package was sent 2-day priority).  Why shop on line if I have to take time to pick up packages when I could just as easily go to a store and buy the item(s)!  Something to think about for sure!!!!</li>
            <li> I had a hands free mirror for 30 years and the mirror size was the same as this one. Total length was only 9&amp;#34;, lightweight and very easy to use.  Also easy for traveling.  It finally just wore out.  I bought this one thinking it would be easy to use but it isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s very big in length, extremely bulky and so heavy at the mirror end that it wobbles back and forth as you are moving your arms with a comb or brush.  I&#x27;m going to have to purchase a small one just for traveling because this is too heavy.  The construction is strong.  Magnification too strong.  I look at my old mirror and wonder why the simplicity of it can&#x27;t be made again.  I can&#x27;t recommend this mirror for anyone needing to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It was very flimsy. I only had about two good uses from it. After that, it kind of just fell apart. Whenever I would angle the mirror on my neck, it gradually (noticeably) falls down. Now it just sits in my bathroom, in its original package, in that ratty ol&#x27; box staring at me. What a waste of money. I would be better off buying those handheld mirrors I could get from a beauty supply store and holding that behind my head while looking at my hair through a bigger mirror. I honestly don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t do that. Ugh, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It might seem good for the first two uses, but after that, WHAT A WASTE.</li>
            <li> I like everything about it.  I like the way that it will turn 360 degrees and fits nicely around my neck.</li>
            <li> A bit awkward but works.</li>
            <li> This mirror was a gift for a relative. They picked it out from several available. They said is was much lower quality than they expected.</li>
            <li> A bit on the large size and a little awkward to use.  However, it does meet my needs for hands free hair styling.</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted and needed.  I am happy with the purchase and the fact that it is Made in America sold me!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  I like that this product is metal.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Of the many hands free mirrors I have purchased in the past several years, this is one of the very few that hasn&#x27;t broken within the first few months.  It seems to me that the only breakable part would be the mirror itself.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be perfect for travel, but it is uncomfortable and does not stay in place well when trying to style my hair. Certainly wasted my money with this one.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair so this will work great for the back. I like the way it swivels many ways and you can adjust it to your needs</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and very overpriced for the quality especially the mirror,i.e., the magnifying mirror is distorted and this is not unusual today, unfortunately!</li>
            <li> Junk!  Doesn&#x27;t work as promoted.  Will not stay steady.</li>
            <li> Very maneuverable and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my elderly mother, and the mirror has made it so much easier for her to apply make-up, etc. Bought one for myself and I absolutely love it. Is easily adjustable to your neck.</li>
            <li> I have an older mirror like this one, but I do like this one just as well.  This new one is a bit bulkier, but I have gotten used to it and I like it.</li>
            <li> I wanted something like this very much, but it doesn&#x27;t stay around my neck very well and I am constantly adjusting it. So, it&#x27;s not exactly hands free!  I end up holding it in place a lot.</li>
            <li> I use it to see the back of my head when I curl my hair.  It&#x27;s necessary for this &amp;#34;chore&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great item! Exactly like I had years ago. Should hold up to use. A little pricy, but I am glad I purchased the better one.</li>
            <li> I ordered both the Emerae and Bella-Specchio Hands Free Mirrors and love them both. I&#x27;ve used a hands free mirror for years but had a hard time finding a replacement for my old one. Now I have one for home and one for travel. They are both very well made!!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. I had one years ago but haven&#x27;t been able to find one in the stores in a long time. I love that it is do easy to use. It is great for anyone who does their own hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have cut my own hair for years, but never satisfied with the back - this definitely solves the problem.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Finally a hands free mirror that doesn&#x27;t look like it will break the first month I use it.  I have been using/ordering the plastic hands free mirror and the handles would break easily within 6 weeks.  Decided to try the Emerae Hands Free Mirror and so glad I did.  It is just what I wanted and needed.  It&#x27;s a bit awkward to store, but sure beats the frustration of the constant breaking of the plastic variety.  What took me so long to order this???</li>
            <li> There is nothing I like about this mirror.  Doesn&#x27;t stay steady, mirror to small and metal is uncomfortable.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror to use for when I color my hair.  It did not live up to my expectations.  I tried it more than once, and it did not stay in place so I could see what I was doing.  I even readjusted it, but no luck.</li>
            <li> Not like cheap plastic ones that don&#x27;t last.  Durable metal and does what it is suppose to do.  Fas shipping!</li>
            <li> Is just a little wobbly when on and not easy to keep in place when working on back of head.  Still, at least as good as others I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best hands free mirror I have ever found. It adjust to any position. The mirror is large enough for you to see the entire back of your head and both sides. It is light weight and easy to pack for travel. The bar across the bottom holds the mirror in place. It will not move around while you are trying to comb the back of your hair. My french twist  hairdo has never looked so good!</li>
            <li> Well made and easy to use.  Received promptly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to resolve the problem of not being able to see the back of her head.  Wasn&#x27;t sure that it would work but she loves it!</li>
            <li> I got this mirror so that I could cut the back of my hair more easily. I am not a hairdresser by any stretch but I wear my hair in short layers and can do the basic cut and trim but found it difficult to get the back of my hair even and consistent using a hand mirror. This mirror enables me to use both hands to steady the scissors or trimmer while cutting the back sections.  It takes a bit a balancing when I use my non-dominant hand, but with practice, I can now do that without difficulty.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but it is a little to large.</li>
            <li> Mirror is a little heavier than I expected, and could use some padding on the bars that rest on your chest. The mirror assembly is good quality metal and will never wear out!</li>
            <li> I got this Mirror for my wife.She was using a twenty year old plastic one that fell a part each time she used it.I got tired of puting it back together. I went to the web and found  this one. She is very happy with it and so am I.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how well this mirror is assembled.  My wife is thrilled with it and liked the &amp;#34;swivel&amp;#34; feature.  She&#x27;s gone through several or these and especially liked the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; style feature that keeps the mirror &amp;#34;still&amp;#34;.  great value.</li>
            <li> very nice mirror...works great and is well made.</li>
            <li> The shaft is to long and makes it wobble on a short person.</li>
            <li> What a handy item to have! It works great, and is infinitely adjustable for just about anyone to use. Nice quality. Fast delivery. Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I need to see the back of my hair for styling--so this is perfect for traveling. I really love it.</li>
            <li> Does everything I wanted in a mirror. Can adjust to see back of head perfectly ,I really like it.</li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve used an around the neck hands free mirror for styling my hair.  It&#x27;s an absolute necessity.  So when the mirror I&#x27;ve been using for 20 + years broke, I went into a mini panic.  I was happy to find several types of around the neck mirrors on Amazon.  I purchased an inexpensive plastic mirror for travel.  For daily use I bought the Emerae Hands Free Mirror.  I&#x27;m glad I bought both of the them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic mirror is very flimsy and probably will not last long.  It&#x27;s definitely not for daily used.  The Emerae Hands Free Mirror, however, is exactly what I want!  It&#x27;s well made, has a cushioned neck piece for comfort.  It has a wide balance bar at the base for stability while using, and many durable adjustable screws and wing nuts.  The mirror tilts and swivels making it easy to use all around the head without having to readjust the neck piece or balance bar.  I received this mirror in good condition and four days before the earliest estimated arrival date.  I would definitely recommend this mirror and this company.</li>
            <li> I got this mirror as a gift for a friend.  She tells me that it adjusts well and that it is much better than her old mirror for cutting the back of her hair.  She really likes it.</li>
            <li> So many purchases I have made have been average. This item is sturdy, well made, and definitely worth the price. It is great to be pleased with an on line purchase like this. The item arrived quickly and I am using it daily.</li>
            <li> This was a very well designed product. The last around the neck mirror that I bought had a very small bar to stabilize it and did not work, it was returned. This works good. I have one that I have had for about 40 years and this Hands Free Mirror is the only thing I ever found to replace my worn old mirror.</li>
            <li> My mom had a mirror like this when I was a child.  I found out recently that it broke, so I found this for her.  She really likes it.  They aren&#x27;t easy to find!</li>
