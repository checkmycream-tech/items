            <li>This product is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Pleasant mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>They are good.</li>
            <li>I like it so much better!</li>
            <li>I am trying to find a good replacement but there aren&#x27;t many choices.  </li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy and benefit from these wonderful products as much as I have!</li>
            <li>/&gt;To stay thrush-free, I floss before bed, brush with Biotene toothpaste 2x a day (making sure to brush the gums, roof of mouth, and tongue), and rinse with Biotene mouthwash to top it off.</li>
            <li>I have used the gel toothpaste for many years.</li>
            <li>This product allows me to get to sleep without that \\&quot;tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth\\&quot; feeling (almost like Velcro).I have severe xerostomia from loss of most salivary glands (cancer), radiation treatments and a mouth</li>
            <li>This has been my brand of toothpaste for many years, but I dont think I can take the change.</li>
            <li>I sure did.</li>
            <li>I think it is okay, but I prefer the gel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product and I highly recommend it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The toothpaste could be smidge mintier but its pretty good for a jel.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is very gentle - in a world where everything seems to be extra strong in order to be effective, this is a very welcome relief.  </li>
            <li>It is very good, although I personally prefer the cream over the gel.</li>
            <li>It also makes your teeth feel smooth.</li>
            <li>(the toothpaste itself isn&#x27;t cheap either)</li>
            <li>: The flavor and texture remind me of the original Colgate toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars instead of 3 because it is good to find basic toothpaste</li>
            <li>so I returned it for a full refund.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums do so much better when I use it and it feels so much better than any other toothpaste that every time I&#x27;ve tried switching back to something cheaper, I greatly regretted</li>
            <li>Since I have been using the biotene gentle mint toothpaste, I have had almost no issues with my mouth, which is amazing to me, and I am very thankful to have found this product.</li>
            <li>After suffering from years of sensitive teeth and frequent gum problems which were all worsened by Sensodyne and other toothpastes for sensitive teeth or problem gums, this wonderful toothpaste and their mouthwash have become an ongoing lifesaver and a joy to use.  </li>
            <li>As any sufferer of thrush knows, these infections quickly advance to the point that one can not eat solid food, drink mildly acidic liquids, or even speak coherently.</li>
            <li>I ORDERED 4 tubes of Gentle Mint GEL toothpaste-I received Fresh Mint PASTE toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>The product that is in most generic toothpastes, sodium lauryl sulfate, is a form of soap, and can cause canker sores and an irritated mouth in some individuals.</li>
            <li>I did use it in the past and really loved it which is why I ordered it from Amazon when I found it online.</li>
            <li>This great toothpaste (GEL), which is hard to find, cleans the mouth well &amp; the gentle flavor leaves it fresh yet naturally moist.</li>
            <li>but loved the gel and was willing to pay a ridiculous price for it</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Still to much mint in the paste.</li>
            <li>It has changed to Gentle Formula&amp;#34; The cap has changed to one that does not fit the tube right and most of all is the taste...</li>
            <li>I love biotene brand in general because all their products are gentle on the mouth, all my family uses biotene, even those who do not suffer dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy the new Biotene products!  </li>
            <li>Other toothpastes are so strong and spicy, that they really aggravate the situation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: The paste gives decent results, so I will increase its rating to a 4.  </li>
            <li>I used the old formula Biotene toothpaste for 12 years with no problem, but since they removed the helpful ingredients and made the toothpaste and mouthwash much harsher, my mouth sores have returned and it burns my tongue.  </li>
            <li>- it will still clean your teeth gently and with low irritation and low</li>
            <li>The gel toothpaste was the only thing on the market like it, PLEASE BRING BACK ORIGINAL GEL FORMULA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ordered the Mint Gel toothpaste and received the regular Gentle Mint ... NOT the GEL.</li>
            <li>I called them to see if I could get the old formula and the answer is no.  </li>
            <li>On the box upper right corner it says &amp;#34;Gentle low foaming formula&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>He usually gets the gentle mint gel but was sent the gentle mint.  </li>
            <li>starting inhaled steroids for asthma 10 years ago, frequent oral thrush (candidas albicans) infections were an ongoing problem.</li>
            <li>I am a dentist that recommends Biotene toothpaste to those patients that have sensitive mouths, dry mouths, or get canker sores frequently.  </li>
            <li>&quot; a little when I first use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to bad that the company messed with a good product.</li>

            <li> take medicines that dry your mouth...</li>
            <li> I have used this on recommendation of my dentist since I have dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> definitely going to try the other Biotene products from this line!</li>
            <li> I have very dry mouth</li>
            <li> I have a dry mouth due to medications that I take.  </li>
            <li> Never had that happen with any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with getting mouth sores on the cheek/gumline due to autoimmune issues.  </li>
            <li> It will not \\&quot;foam\\&quot; like other toothpastes, since it has no sodium lauryl sulfate, but don&#x27;t let this bother you</li>
            <li> Instead, it has enzymes that help break down plaque and loosen plaque from the teeth.  </li>

            <li> First bad experience with an order.</li>
            <li> The new formula changes to the Biotene products are terrible for dry mouth sufferers!!  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know about this seller, but I ordered the gel from another seller and got the awful new &amp;#34;gentle mint&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> This toothpaste turned my teeth a weird ugly color.  Never had that happen with any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist had given me samples of &#x27;Biotene products and after a hospitilization when I had the problem, I ordered them online.  They are good.</li>
            <li> I have a dry mouth due to medications that I take.  I was using Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpast for a dry mouth but I decided to try Biotene.  I like it so much better! After one use my mouth was moister. I like the taste too. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;foam\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I can still \\&quot;feel\\&quot; it on my teeth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to try the other Biotene products from this line! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> My husband has dry mouth so uses all the biotene and oasis products.  He usually gets the gentle mint gel but was sent the gentle mint.  We didn&#x27;t want to send it back as he needed it so he kept it.  It&#x27;s a little bit harsher for him.</li>
            <li> After suffering from years of sensitive teeth and frequent gum problems which were all worsened by Sensodyne and other toothpastes for sensitive teeth or problem gums, this wonderful toothpaste and their mouthwash have become an ongoing lifesaver and a joy to use.  My teeth and gums do so much better when I use it and it feels so much better than any other toothpaste that every time I&#x27;ve tried switching back to something cheaper, I greatly regretted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my dental hygienist has noticed a big improvement in the health of my gums and teeth and she always picks up on any adverse signs anywhere.  I hope you enjoy and benefit from these wonderful products as much as I have!</li>
            <li> I ORDERED 4 tubes of Gentle Mint GEL toothpaste-I received Fresh Mint PASTE toothpaste.  I ordered the gel specifically because it doesn&#x27;t gag me.  It was a waste-I could have bought the PASTE a lot cheaper at Wal-Mart with NO shipping charges!</li>
            <li> The combination of this toothpaste and mouthwash is the only treatment I have found that seems to prevent thrush infections. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After starting inhaled steroids for asthma 10 years ago, frequent oral thrush (candidas albicans) infections were an ongoing problem. The alcohol-based mouthwashes only made matters worse, and it was a hassle to get prescription nystatin, as it usually required a delayed trip to my doctor. As any sufferer of thrush knows, these infections quickly advance to the point that one can not eat solid food, drink mildly acidic liquids, or even speak coherently. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To stay thrush-free, I floss before bed, brush with Biotene toothpaste 2x a day (making sure to brush the gums, roof of mouth, and tongue), and rinse with Biotene mouthwash to top it off. I can now eat spicy foods again!</li>
            <li> The new formula changes to the Biotene products are terrible for dry mouth sufferers!!  I used the old formula Biotene toothpaste for 12 years with no problem, but since they removed the helpful ingredients and made the toothpaste and mouthwash much harsher, my mouth sores have returned and it burns my tongue.  I am trying to find a good replacement but there aren&#x27;t many choices.  May have to try a children&#x27;s toothpaste.  Don&#x27;t buy the new Biotene products!  It&#x27;s a waste of money and it burns your mouth.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is very gentle - in a world where everything seems to be extra strong in order to be effective, this is a very welcome relief.  I have a problem with getting mouth sores on the cheek/gumline due to autoimmune issues.  Other toothpastes are so strong and spicy, that they really aggravate the situation.  Since I have been using the biotene gentle mint toothpaste, I have had almost no issues with my mouth, which is amazing to me, and I am very thankful to have found this product.</li>
            <li> seems to help my condiction</li>
            <li> I am a dentist that recommends Biotene toothpaste to those patients that have sensitive mouths, dry mouths, or get canker sores frequently.  The paste is a god-send for these folks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotene toothpaste is biocompatible product that will clean your teeth without irritating your oral mucosa.  The product that is in most generic toothpastes, sodium lauryl sulfate, is a form of soap, and can cause canker sores and an irritated mouth in some individuals. BIOTENE DOES NOT HAVE SODIUM LAURYL SULFATE. Instead, it has enzymes that help break down plaque and loosen plaque from the teeth.  It will not \\&quot;foam\\&quot; like other toothpastes, since it has no sodium lauryl sulfate, but don&#x27;t let this bother you - it will still clean your teeth gently and with low irritation and low abrasivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim \\&quot;Konedog\\&quot; Koenig, DDS</li>
            <li> Never got the product. Ordered it and got a paste instead. I did use it in the past and really loved it which is why I ordered it from Amazon when I found it online.</li>
            <li> I have used the gel toothpaste for many years. It&#x27;s been a salvation. Now it&#x27;s gone and &amp;#34;gentle mint&amp;#34; is here. It literally tastes like vomit. My dry mouth does not salivate with that flavor. And is not a real gel, so it&#x27;s more irritating too. The gel toothpaste was the only thing on the market like it, PLEASE BRING BACK ORIGINAL GEL FORMULA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about this seller, but I ordered the gel from another seller and got the awful new &amp;#34;gentle mint&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My sister (a nurse) recommened this toothpaste for me to try as I have dry mouth and canker sores.  It works very well.</li>
            <li> This product allows me to get to sleep without that \\&quot;tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth\\&quot; feeling (almost like Velcro).I have severe xerostomia from loss of most salivary glands (cancer), radiation treatments and a mouth I can&#x27;t close completely&lt;br /&gt;(more reconstruction later will allow me to close my mouth again)...I hope. This product is wonderful! I use Oasis mouthwash every day without a problem. Biotene mouthwash doesn&#x27;t help me at all. Though Oasis spray works it does \\&quot;burn\\&quot; a little when I first use it.</li>
            <li> Watch what you buy... The product made a big change. On the box upper right corner it says &amp;#34;Gentle low foaming formula&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;But thats not what you get... It has changed to Gentle Formula&amp;#34; The cap has changed to one that does not fit the tube right and most of all is the taste... It&#x27;s so bad that I&#x27;m not sure I can keep useing the product. This has been my brand of toothpaste for many years, but I dont think I can take the change. It&#x27;s to bad that the company messed with a good product.</li>
            <li> Still to much mint in the paste. I have very dry mouth and my system can&#x27;t handle spice like mint.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Mint Gel toothpaste and received the regular Gentle Mint ... NOT the GEL. I can purchase the regular at any store ... Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Biotene changed their formula a few months ago and now it burns just like all the other toothpastes.  I called them to see if I could get the old formula and the answer is no.  If it says &amp;#34;improved formula&amp;#34; on the box and you can&#x27;t handle toothpastes that burn, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I love biotene brand in general because all their products are gentle on the mouth, all my family uses biotene, even those who do not suffer dry mouth. This great toothpaste (GEL), which is hard to find, cleans the mouth well &amp; the gentle flavor leaves it fresh yet naturally moist. Definitely on my list for refills,</li>
            <li> Ever have a dry mouth? take medicines that dry your mouth...boy I sure did. Then I started to use Biotine toothpaste and mouthwash and after a week I could feel the difference. The toothpaste could be smidge mintier but its pretty good for a jel.</li>
            <li> I have not received my products yet!!!! What is going on?? Please, update me. I would like to know when I will receive my purchases.</li>
            <li> I have used this on recommendation of my dentist since I have dry mouth.  It is very good, although I personally prefer the cream over the gel.</li>
            <li> Gel (5 stars): I like the less-drying effect. It also makes your teeth feel smooth. Pleasant mint flavor.  I recommend and will purchase again...If I can locate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paste (4 stars): The flavor and texture remind me of the original Colgate toothpaste.  I think it is okay, but I prefer the gel.  I give it 4 stars instead of 3 because it is good to find basic toothpaste these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The paste gives decent results, so I will increase its rating to a 4.  I still would like to acquire the gel again, too, as I give it a 5.</li>
            <li> This was advertised as the GEL which I know to be out of production now...but loved the gel and was willing to pay a ridiculous price for it (the toothpaste itself isn&#x27;t cheap either) but when it arrived it was the Toothpaste...so I returned it for a full refund. First bad experience with an order.</li>
