            <li>/&gt;Great product - Beautiful presentation.  </li>
            <li>Perfect gift for a lip balm lover and what a cute tin!</li>
            <li>This would make a great stocking stuffer or gift at any time.  </li>
            <li>I like the size and package a lot, and the lip shimmer and lip butter are great as well.</li>
            <li>Purchased for coworkers Christmas happy.</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>The products are great too.  </li>
            <li>This would be a great stocking stuffer or gift basket item.</li>
            <li>both have a great raspberry</li>
            <li>Very nice</li>
            <li>The tin is adorable and would make for a wonderful stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a perfect product, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Was a good looking gift.</li>
            <li>It also smells good, but doesn&#x27;t have a flavor that makes me want to lick it off my lips all the time.</li>
            <li>Might look good on a beige or bronze skin tone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These would make great stocking stuffers or a nice treat for yourself.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s a good set.</li>
            <li>I do think, however, that both products are a bit thicker than what I consider really good lip balm.</li>
            <li>Kiss of Shimmer radiant lip care is nice, and it has a pleasant raspberry fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is a very cute and affordable gift set.</li>
            <li>Since the winter holidays and the start of chapped lip season coincide these lip care products would be a practical and welcome gift for most ladies.</li>
            <li>This lip butter is great and one of my favorites of many lip balms</li>
            <li>It looked nice and the recipient says she loved it.</li>
            <li>This gift set is nice, and a good value.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fruity smell and feels good on the lips.</li>
            <li>Nivea never disappoints me, and this 2 piece gift set is adorable!  </li>
            <li>The Kiss of Shimmer indicates, light-heartedly, that it &amp;#34;make{s} kisses better&amp;#34;, but to be honest, I would not want to kiss my boyfriend with this, as it would leave product on him!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and makes my lips feel great.</li>
            <li>The lip butter smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Butter Raspberry Rose Kiss&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Kind of sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>rose as its name implies.  </li>
            <li>rose scent and feel like silk on your lips.</li>
            <li>Although it would have been nice to see some padding/tissue paper in the tin, there was none.</li>
            <li>products have a touch of shimmer and a nice fruity scent.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re someone (like me) who doesn&#x27;t wear makeup, lipstick or like any kind of feeling on your lips, this might not be for you.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice, moisturized feel without being sticky or waxy.</li>
            <li>gloss is not too glossy, it adds a nice shimmery shine that keeps my lips moist.</li>
            <li>she liked the tin to hold the items.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s even a bit of tissue paper inside, which is a nice touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gift set from Nivea is not just nice, but cute as well.  </li>
            <li>liked the stick (Kiss of Shimmer) better than the butter, as the butter was more gummy and gelatinous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both lip products have a nice smell and go on easily.</li>
            <li>Would make a nice stocking stuffer, is pretty good</li>
            <li>Depends what you&#x27;re looking for, if it&#x27;s a very light neutral color you&#x27;ll like this, but if you&#x27;re looking for something with a bit more shin to it than look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>Pleased with product.</li>
            <li>They both smell of raspberry when you take off the top, but the scent does not linger when you apply</li>
            <li>The lipstick style balm  is creatively titled a &amp;#34;kiss of shimmer&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>fitting lid</li>
            <li>I love both of these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use it without getting gobs under my nails.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find either to be overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute, with tissue paper inside holding the products.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the tin of lip butter.</li>
            <li>But most of the time Nivea lip products don&#x27;t do that to me.</li>
            <li>tube is a nice light lip care lipstick.</li>
            <li>They both have a nice smell, go on smoothly, and have a hint of raspberry flavor.</li>
            <li>but I wished it had a bit more shimmer to it as is advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a matte shimmer rather than shiny.</li>
            <li>This causes one to lick one&#x27;s lips more (as does the flavor), and that contributes to chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband kissed me after application of both to test the claim, and he agreed that both made &amp;#34;kisses better&amp;#34;, but much more so with the Lip</li>
            <li>I love this set.  </li>
            <li>The shimmer lip balm doesn&#x27;t really have a flavor to it but has a very nice light pinkish shimmery tint to it.  </li>
            <li>There is no color to either, so these would be great for tweens who like to add some gloss to their lips without looking too old.</li>
            <li>This would be great as a stocking stuffer, especially for teenagers as the colors are very light.  </li>
            <li>;  lip stick is the perfect light pink color.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty nice</li>
            <li>Wonderful, it has a little shimmer to it.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;kissable&amp;#34; lip gloss is a bit thicker, but still goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Or, anyone of any age who wants to keep their lips moist without adding color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin is a nice size and can be used for anything from holding lose change to jewelry.</li>
            <li>The navy color of the tin is attractive but not specific to any holiday.  </li>
            <li>Yes, good old Chap Stick just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li>The products within the tin are easily worth the $4.99 sticker price, but the tin really adds a good value.  </li>
            <li>It has to be applied with a lip brush or CLEAN</li>
            <li>they come in this cute gift set with a handy, dandy multi-use tin (3 1/2\\&quot; across x 1 1/4\\&quot; deep).</li>
            <li>It is also very nice for young girls who are wanting a lipstick but parents aren&#x27;t really ready for them to be wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>This kit was smaller than I thought it would be size wise for some reason</li>
            <li>Both make my lips feel nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>For some reason it reminds me of my childhood, with a sweet berry</li>
            <li>This is a super item for yourself or for others on your gift list as the holidays creep up on us.</li>
            <li>but it mellows out quickly.  </li>
            <li>The shimmer is pretty on its own or on top of another lipstick for a bit of punch or to make a dry lipstick a bit softer.  </li>
            <li>Keeps dry lips moisturized and feeling good.  </li>
            <li>I actually like the set better than I thought I might!</li>
            <li>I got this in the mail today and it was a great little pick me up for a rainy Monday.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this set and it would make a great stocking stuffer or small gift or pick-me-up for friends.</li>
            <li>By far, my favorite of the two.</li>
            <li>The trendy egg-shaped EOS is acceptable, but clearly a two-stage lip care product such as this is much more the rage.  </li>
            <li>Comes in a blue tin with a nice design.</li>
            <li>As an adult I still find the two cute and useful.</li>
            <li>(I used it right over the lip butter.)  </li>
            <li>This would not be the ideal color for all women, but if you like the new nude and pale shades of lipstick trending right now, you would probably like this.</li>
            <li>It goes on completely clear, with a nice raspberry scent and leaves your lips feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>The tin is a bit of a throwaway as it is just not that pretty or useful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s that time of year where this makes me think of it being a good stocking stuffer or little holiday gift to your friend, or a party favor for a girl&#x27;s birthday party.</li>
            <li>lip butter is so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>First body butter and now lip butter.  </li>
            <li>First off the smell of raspberry is just lovely the moment you open the tin</li>
            <li>They smell pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;**As a side note, both products are fantastic for dry lips, however keep in mind there is a light color and shimmer to both.</li>
            <li>Given that I&#x27;m rather an outlier, I would unhesitating recommend this as it&#x27;s such a great value and a lovely little gift item.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that the products lasted all that long or made my lips better.</li>
            <li>the products come in would be good for storing buttons, hair barrettes, coins or even for regifting  small item(s).  </li>
            <li>The Lip Butter, on the other hand, gives a nice little tingle, and it absorbed into my lips better than the Kiss of Shimmer product.  </li>
            <li>This is a must have for winter to help prevent dry and chapped lips :)</li>
            <li>Not like a lipstick, but very pretty and soft.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and sinks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very light pink tint and raspberry</li>
            <li>This two pack of Nivea lip care products comes nicely packaged for gift giving and the round blue and silver tin could easily be used for something else after opening.</li>
            <li>This Nivea Lip Care Kissable 2 Piece Gift Set is a nice little package.</li>
            <li>; is also very soothing and  doesn&#x27;t deposit any color.  </li>
            <li>a while&lt;br /&gt;Gives my lips a more pink shade.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li>I really like the lip butter.</li>
            <li>and I really like that.  </li>
            <li>My wife really likes both.</li>
            <li>really like the Raspberry Ros&amp;eacute;</li>
            <li>The lip butter wears well and really softens lips.  </li>
            <li>Nice basic stocking stuffer that contains a sizeable lip butter tin with ingredients such as seed oil, shea butter and petrolatum and a Kiss Of Shimmer Radiant Lip Care stick</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how cute and low cost the lip products in this tin.?</li>
            <li>In other words, she wants more.</li>
            <li>but ive used better or would prefer some other brands just as much.  </li>
            <li>I feel like the Nivea Lip Care (sealed very well with plastic - it was a bear to open) and Lip Butter hydrate my lips better without being heavy or greasy, which is a huge plus as winter rolls around.</li>
            <li>It comes in a cute blue and white tin, there are 2 lip care products inside</li>
            <li>These two products come in a cute, reusable blue and white tin.</li>
            <li>This gift set includes a decent tin that contains two of Nivea&#x27;s lip care products.  </li>
            <li>The Kiss of Shimmer Radiant Lip Care feels good on the lips too, but it does give one that \\&quot;pale white lip\\&quot; color that some people don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Highly scented (raspberry) and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both products.</li>
            <li>Love this little set.</li>
            <li>The kiss of shimmer gives a light neural pink frost to the lips.</li>
            <li>As someone who normally wears nothing but chapstick all winter, it was a change for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear stuff like this normally, and when I had it on, I could feel it</li>
            <li>As with all Nivea products both the shimmery lip balm and lip butter are nice and moisturizing without being too thick or gloppy.</li>
            <li>This little set would make a great gift for a little child.  </li>
            <li>Great stocking stuffer or small gift for any other time.</li>
            <li>The frosty look is, well, very, very young.  </li>
            <li>This would be a great stocking stuffer or secret Santa gift or just a fun little friend gift for any time of year.</li>
            <li>My only problem with it was the taste while drinking a hot beverage.  </li>
            <li>They smell and feel great, and the moisturizing lasts for a little bit longer than the lip balms I usually use.</li>
            <li>The Lip Butter has a little hint of raspberry flavor and both leave the lips feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Anyways, according to her, she really likes the stick and how soft it makes her lips, especially when topped off with the lip butter.  </li>
            <li>It is soothing while adding a natural tint.  </li>
            <li>My daughter as a 13 year old, is nearly a connoisseur of lip care products.  </li>
            <li>Does a decent/good job as far as moisturizing and conditioning lips</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the size and quality of the tin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite old fashioned looking, and reminds me of tins my grandmother used for sewing notions.</li>
            <li>This product (the Kiss of Shimmer) feels like a cross between chapstick and lipstick - maybe a more firm lip gloss, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is light, and pale, with just a hint of shimmer, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tin box that the gift set comes in is cute, but mine arrived dented, which was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the strong unpleasant scent, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this lip care set to adults, although some children may like the product.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely gift set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because it contains BHT and an artificial dye (which I generally need to avoid), but otherwise I really enjoy the set.  </li>
            <li>The lip butter comes in an appealing pale pink color and definitely has a taste of raspberry</li>
            <li>It came in a pretty little tin that contained no advertising, which makes it nicer for re-use.</li>
            <li>I found the scent to be unpleasant, and way too strong for a product that I was applying right under my nose.  </li>
            <li>She also really likes the smell and the little tin that it came in.  </li>
            <li>Nivea Lip Care Kissable 2 Piece Gift Set is made for &amp;#34;kissable&amp;#34; lips, which would seem to imply that the product is for those who are old enough to be kissed (older teens and adults), however, the product is scented with a very childish candy-like scent.  </li>

            <li> They both smell of raspberry when you take off the top, but the scent does not linger when you apply</li>
            <li> The lipstick style balm  is creatively titled a &amp;#34;kiss of shimmer&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> fitting lid</li>
            <li> I love both of these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use it without getting gobs under my nails.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find either to be overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The packaging is cute, with tissue paper inside holding the products.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the tin of lip butter.</li>
            <li> But most of the time Nivea lip products don&#x27;t do that to me.</li>
            <li> tube is a nice light lip care lipstick.</li>
            <li> They both have a nice smell, go on smoothly, and have a hint of raspberry flavor.</li>
            <li> but I wished it had a bit more shimmer to it as is advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a matte shimmer rather than shiny.</li>
            <li> This causes one to lick one&#x27;s lips more (as does the flavor), and that contributes to chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband kissed me after application of both to test the claim, and he agreed that both made &amp;#34;kisses better&amp;#34;, but much more so with the Lip</li>
            <li> I love this set.  </li>
            <li> The shimmer lip balm doesn&#x27;t really have a flavor to it but has a very nice light pinkish shimmery tint to it.  </li>
            <li> There is no color to either, so these would be great for tweens who like to add some gloss to their lips without looking too old.</li>
            <li> This would be great as a stocking stuffer, especially for teenagers as the colors are very light.  </li>
            <li> ;  lip stick is the perfect light pink color.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty nice</li>
            <li> Wonderful, it has a little shimmer to it.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;kissable&amp;#34; lip gloss is a bit thicker, but still goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> Or, anyone of any age who wants to keep their lips moist without adding color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin is a nice size and can be used for anything from holding lose change to jewelry.</li>
            <li> The navy color of the tin is attractive but not specific to any holiday.  </li>
            <li> Yes, good old Chap Stick just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li> The products within the tin are easily worth the $4.99 sticker price, but the tin really adds a good value.  </li>
            <li> It has to be applied with a lip brush or CLEAN</li>
            <li> they come in this cute gift set with a handy, dandy multi-use tin (3 1/2\\&quot; across x 1 1/4\\&quot; deep).</li>
            <li> It is also very nice for young girls who are wanting a lipstick but parents aren&#x27;t really ready for them to be wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> This kit was smaller than I thought it would be size wise for some reason</li>
            <li> Both make my lips feel nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> For some reason it reminds me of my childhood, with a sweet berry</li>
            <li> This is a super item for yourself or for others on your gift list as the holidays creep up on us.</li>
            <li> but it mellows out quickly.  </li>
            <li> The shimmer is pretty on its own or on top of another lipstick for a bit of punch or to make a dry lipstick a bit softer.  </li>
            <li> Keeps dry lips moisturized and feeling good.  </li>
            <li> I actually like the set better than I thought I might!</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail today and it was a great little pick me up for a rainy Monday.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this set and it would make a great stocking stuffer or small gift or pick-me-up for friends.</li>
            <li> By far, my favorite of the two.</li>
            <li> The trendy egg-shaped EOS is acceptable, but clearly a two-stage lip care product such as this is much more the rage.  </li>
            <li> Comes in a blue tin with a nice design.</li>
            <li> As an adult I still find the two cute and useful.</li>
            <li> (I used it right over the lip butter.)  </li>
            <li> This would not be the ideal color for all women, but if you like the new nude and pale shades of lipstick trending right now, you would probably like this.</li>
            <li> It goes on completely clear, with a nice raspberry scent and leaves your lips feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> The tin is a bit of a throwaway as it is just not that pretty or useful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s that time of year where this makes me think of it being a good stocking stuffer or little holiday gift to your friend, or a party favor for a girl&#x27;s birthday party.</li>
            <li> lip butter is so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> First body butter and now lip butter.  </li>
            <li> First off the smell of raspberry is just lovely the moment you open the tin</li>
            <li> They smell pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;**As a side note, both products are fantastic for dry lips, however keep in mind there is a light color and shimmer to both.</li>
            <li> Given that I&#x27;m rather an outlier, I would unhesitating recommend this as it&#x27;s such a great value and a lovely little gift item.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that the products lasted all that long or made my lips better.</li>
            <li> the products come in would be good for storing buttons, hair barrettes, coins or even for regifting  small item(s).  </li>
            <li> The Lip Butter, on the other hand, gives a nice little tingle, and it absorbed into my lips better than the Kiss of Shimmer product.  </li>
            <li> This is a must have for winter to help prevent dry and chapped lips :)</li>
            <li> Not like a lipstick, but very pretty and soft.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and sinks in quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very light pink tint and raspberry</li>
            <li> This two pack of Nivea lip care products comes nicely packaged for gift giving and the round blue and silver tin could easily be used for something else after opening.</li>
            <li> This Nivea Lip Care Kissable 2 Piece Gift Set is a nice little package.</li>
            <li> ; is also very soothing and  doesn&#x27;t deposit any color.  </li>
            <li> a while&lt;br /&gt;Gives my lips a more pink shade.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I really like the lip butter.</li>
            <li> and I really like that.  </li>
            <li> My wife really likes both.</li>
            <li> really like the Raspberry Ros&amp;eacute;</li>
            <li> The lip butter wears well and really softens lips.  </li>
            <li> Nice basic stocking stuffer that contains a sizeable lip butter tin with ingredients such as seed oil, shea butter and petrolatum and a Kiss Of Shimmer Radiant Lip Care stick</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how cute and low cost the lip products in this tin.?</li>
            <li> In other words, she wants more.</li>
            <li> but ive used better or would prefer some other brands just as much.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the Nivea Lip Care (sealed very well with plastic - it was a bear to open) and Lip Butter hydrate my lips better without being heavy or greasy, which is a huge plus as winter rolls around.</li>
            <li> It comes in a cute blue and white tin, there are 2 lip care products inside</li>
            <li> These two products come in a cute, reusable blue and white tin.</li>
            <li> This gift set includes a decent tin that contains two of Nivea&#x27;s lip care products.  </li>
            <li> The Kiss of Shimmer Radiant Lip Care feels good on the lips too, but it does give one that \\&quot;pale white lip\\&quot; color that some people don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Highly scented (raspberry) and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both products.</li>
            <li> Love this little set.</li>
            <li> The kiss of shimmer gives a light neural pink frost to the lips.</li>
            <li> As someone who normally wears nothing but chapstick all winter, it was a change for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear stuff like this normally, and when I had it on, I could feel it</li>
            <li> As with all Nivea products both the shimmery lip balm and lip butter are nice and moisturizing without being too thick or gloppy.</li>
            <li> This little set would make a great gift for a little child.  </li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer or small gift for any other time.</li>
            <li> The frosty look is, well, very, very young.  </li>
            <li> This would be a great stocking stuffer or secret Santa gift or just a fun little friend gift for any time of year.</li>
            <li> My only problem with it was the taste while drinking a hot beverage.  </li>
            <li> They smell and feel great, and the moisturizing lasts for a little bit longer than the lip balms I usually use.</li>
            <li> The Lip Butter has a little hint of raspberry flavor and both leave the lips feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Anyways, according to her, she really likes the stick and how soft it makes her lips, especially when topped off with the lip butter.  </li>
            <li> It is soothing while adding a natural tint.  </li>
            <li> My daughter as a 13 year old, is nearly a connoisseur of lip care products.  </li>
            <li> Does a decent/good job as far as moisturizing and conditioning lips</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the size and quality of the tin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite old fashioned looking, and reminds me of tins my grandmother used for sewing notions.</li>
            <li> This product (the Kiss of Shimmer) feels like a cross between chapstick and lipstick - maybe a more firm lip gloss, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is light, and pale, with just a hint of shimmer, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tin box that the gift set comes in is cute, but mine arrived dented, which was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the strong unpleasant scent, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this lip care set to adults, although some children may like the product.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely gift set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because it contains BHT and an artificial dye (which I generally need to avoid), but otherwise I really enjoy the set.  </li>
            <li> The lip butter comes in an appealing pale pink color and definitely has a taste of raspberry</li>
            <li> It came in a pretty little tin that contained no advertising, which makes it nicer for re-use.</li>
            <li> I found the scent to be unpleasant, and way too strong for a product that I was applying right under my nose.  </li>
            <li> She also really likes the smell and the little tin that it came in.  </li>
            <li> Nivea Lip Care Kissable 2 Piece Gift Set is made for &amp;#34;kissable&amp;#34; lips, which would seem to imply that the product is for those who are old enough to be kissed (older teens and adults), however, the product is scented with a very childish candy-like scent.  </li>
            <li> (unflavored: not good, not bad)</li>
            <li> And the tin is adorably early 20th century, making this a terrific secretly inexpensive gift for an older woman or a young woman with retro taste.</li>
            <li> The shimmer is very slight and very flattering.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the raspberry scent of the lip butter is a little strong.</li>
            <li> I also like the flat tin which means with my longer nails</li>
            <li> she used it and like how the product keeps her lips moist for her lips dry out through the later fall to spring.  </li>
            <li> The tin is dark blue with white accents so it could be used as a Hanukkah gift.</li>
            <li> the smell lasts a LONG time on your lips.  </li>
            <li> The frost stuck around for a long time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too scented and girly for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a young woman, so that look just washes me out.</li>
            <li> Two products come in a round, blue, flat tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also like the little blue tin they come in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a bit too pink for me</li>
            <li> the pigment and scent are minimal and pleasing.</li>
            <li> Inside the blue tin are a lipstick with frosty moisturizer and a small tin pan of pink lip balm.  </li>
            <li> This kit comes with a round tin and inside are a smaller tin of lip butter and a slightly sparkly lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and, against my pale skin, makes me look a little sickly.</li>
            <li> The stick has a slight shimmer to it and tastes like berries.  </li>
            <li> It goes on as a very pale pink color.</li>
            <li> On my pale ivory tone, it takes the color out of my lips and almost makes them disappear.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would be a heavy gloss and look garish on someone past their 20&#x27;s, but that&#x27;s not the case.  </li>
            <li> This would make a small practical gift to give a woman during the holiday season.  </li>
            <li> that will leave your lips soft and moisturized during the cold winter months.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what it is.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small tin with a raspberry lip butter and kiss of shimmer lip care inside.</li>
            <li> Just take the packaging off and you&#x27;ll look like you went to some trouble!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly remarkable compared to other lip care products on the market however.  </li>
            <li> The lip butter goes on very smoothly (no globs) and has a subtle raspberry flavor.  </li>
            <li> So the shimmer, though subtle, is noticeable.</li>
            <li> The balm gives a subtle shimmer to the lips making lips appear plump and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The scent was cloying and left a bad taste in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot (and I mean a crazy, ridiculous amount) of lip balms, and I&#x27;ve gotten ridiculously picky about what I like.</li>
            <li> but apparently I&#x27;m behind the times because now &amp;#34;butters&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> The shimmer lip care makes my lips look weird, though.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I use a lot of lip products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This would make a great stocking stuffer or gift at any time.  The presentation is beautiful and the products  are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve  used Nivea creams and lotions for years but never lip care.  Two products come in a round, blue, flat tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;A Kiss of Shimmer&amp;#34;  lip stick is the perfect light pink color.  It is soothing while adding a natural tint.  My only problem with it was the taste while drinking a hot beverage.  In the future, I&#x27;ll wait to apply it after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller tin of &amp;#34;Lip Butter Raspberry Rose Kiss&amp;#34; is also very soothing and  doesn&#x27;t deposit any color.  It has to be applied with a lip brush or CLEAN finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product - Beautiful presentation.  Thumbs Up.</li>
            <li> This two pack of Nivea lip care products comes nicely packaged for gift giving and the round blue and silver tin could easily be used for something else after opening. As with all Nivea products both the shimmery lip balm and lip butter are nice and moisturizing without being too thick or gloppy. This is a must have for winter to help prevent dry and chapped lips :)</li>
            <li> Nivea Lip Care Kissable 2 Piece Gift Set is made for &amp;#34;kissable&amp;#34; lips, which would seem to imply that the product is for those who are old enough to be kissed (older teens and adults), however, the product is scented with a very childish candy-like scent.  I found the scent to be unpleasant, and way too strong for a product that I was applying right under my nose.

            <li> Outstanding product. Got for my wife and she loves it. She likes the taste and especially the texture of the product. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, Tinted Lip Balm and Lip Shimmer for years. But Nivea has come up with two products I will be using along with the Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  I feel like the Nivea Lip Care (sealed very well with plastic - it was a bear to open) and Lip Butter hydrate my lips better without being heavy or greasy, which is a huge plus as winter rolls around. Very light pink tint and raspberry fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus they come in this cute gift set with a handy, dandy multi-use tin (3 1/2\\&quot; across x 1 1/4\\&quot; deep). This is a super item for yourself or for others on your gift list as the holidays creep up on us. The tin is dark blue with white accents so it could be used as a Hanukkah gift.</li>
            <li> This is a very cute and affordable gift set. I like the size and package a lot, and the lip shimmer and lip butter are great as well. My only complaint is that the raspberry scent of the lip butter is a little strong.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for a lip balm lover and what a cute tin!</li>
            <li> Pleased with product. Purchased for coworkers Christmas happy. Was a good looking gift.</li>
            <li> Kind of sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Last a while&lt;br /&gt;Gives my lips a more pink shade.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> Great Product.Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, it has a little shimmer to it. Smells wonderful and works great for moisturizing lips.</li>
            <li> This gift set from Nivea is not just nice, but cute as well.  The tin doesn&#x27;t have any logo on it, so I feel I can actually use it for storage and have it out of the counter.  The products are great too.  The Lip Butter has a little hint of raspberry flavor and both leave the lips feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like the lip butter. It&#x27;s smooth and makes my lips feel great. It also smells good, but doesn&#x27;t have a flavor that makes me want to lick it off my lips all the time. (unflavored: not good, not bad) I would definitely recommend! The shimmer lip care makes my lips look weird, though. It&#x27;s very light and, against my pale skin, makes me look a little sickly. Might look good on a beige or bronze skin tone. On my pale ivory tone, it takes the color out of my lips and almost makes them disappear. Also, they have the lip butter at my corner CVS, so I will probably not buy online again.</li>
            <li> This kit comes with a round tin and inside are a smaller tin of lip butter and a slightly sparkly lip gloss.  They both smell of raspberry when you take off the top, but the scent does not linger when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip butter is so soft and smooth.  By far, my favorite of the two. The &amp;#34;kissable&amp;#34; lip gloss is a bit thicker, but still goes on smooth.  There is no color to either, so these would be great for tweens who like to add some gloss to their lips without looking too old. Or, anyone of any age who wants to keep their lips moist without adding color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin is a nice size and can be used for anything from holding lose change to jewelry.</li>
            <li> This would make a small practical gift to give a woman during the holiday season.  The lip butter and lip balm are manufactured by Nivea which is a respected moderately priced name in skin care.  The lip butter comes in an appealing pale pink color and definitely has a taste of raspberry rose as its name implies.  The lipstick style balm  is creatively titled a &amp;#34;kiss of shimmer&amp;#34;.  The tin container with well fitting lid the products come in would be good for storing buttons, hair barrettes, coins or even for regifting  small item(s).  The navy color of the tin is attractive but not specific to any holiday.  Since the winter holidays and the start of chapped lip season coincide these lip care products would be a practical and welcome gift for most ladies.</li>
            <li> I love both of these. They smell and feel great, and the moisturizing lasts for a little bit longer than the lip balms I usually use. This would be a great stocking stuffer or gift basket item.</li>
            <li> This kit was smaller than I thought it would be size wise for some reason but it&#x27;s absolutely perfect!  The balm is moisturizing without any stickiness or gooey feeling.  It goes on smooth and sinks in quickly.  I also like the flat tin which means with my longer nails I&#x27;m able to use it without getting gobs under my nails.  The shimmer is pretty on its own or on top of another lipstick for a bit of punch or to make a dry lipstick a bit softer.  It&#x27;s almost a bit too pink for me personally but it mellows out quickly.  Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this set and it would make a great stocking stuffer or small gift or pick-me-up for friends.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail today and it was a great little pick me up for a rainy Monday. It came in a pretty little tin that contained no advertising, which makes it nicer for re-use. The lip butter and lip balm both have a great raspberry rose scent and feel like silk on your lips. This would be a great stocking stuffer or secret Santa gift or just a fun little friend gift for any time of year.</li>
            <li> Nivea never disappoints me, and this 2 piece gift set is adorable!  It is perfect as a stocking stuffer. It comes in a cute blue and white tin, there are 2 lip care products inside that will leave your lips soft and moisturized during the cold winter months.  Very nice product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**As a side note, both products are fantastic for dry lips, however keep in mind there is a light color and shimmer to both.</li>
            <li> My daughter as a 13 year old, is nearly a connoisseur of lip care products.  Yes, good old Chap Stick just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  The trendy egg-shaped EOS is acceptable, but clearly a two-stage lip care product such as this is much more the rage.  Not only that, but apparently I&#x27;m behind the times because now &amp;#34;butters&amp;#34; are all the rage now.  First body butter and now lip butter.  Anyways, according to her, she really likes the stick and how soft it makes her lips, especially when topped off with the lip butter.  She also really likes the smell and the little tin that it came in.  In other words, she wants more.</li>
            <li> First off the smell of raspberry is just lovely the moment you open the tin and I really like that.  The shimmer lip balm doesn&#x27;t really have a flavor to it but has a very nice light pinkish shimmery tint to it.  Not like a lipstick, but very pretty and soft.  The lip butter has the delectable raspberry flavor as you put it on.  Both make my lips feel nice and soft.  The tin is adorable and would make for a wonderful stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> These two products come in a cute, reusable blue and white tin. Although it would have been nice to see some padding/tissue paper in the tin, there was none. And my tin was ever-so-slightly bent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products have a touch of shimmer and a nice fruity scent. As someone who normally wears nothing but chapstick all winter, it was a change for me. Every time I wore either product, people would point out my lips! So the shimmer, though subtle, is noticeable. This product (the Kiss of Shimmer) feels like a cross between chapstick and lipstick - maybe a more firm lip gloss, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the stick (Kiss of Shimmer) better than the butter, as the butter was more gummy and gelatinous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the pigment and scent are minimal and pleasing. I didn&#x27;t find either to be overwhelming. They smell pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These would make great stocking stuffers or a nice treat for yourself. If you&#x27;re someone (like me) who doesn&#x27;t wear makeup, lipstick or like any kind of feeling on your lips, this might not be for you. I don&#x27;t wear stuff like this normally, and when I had it on, I could feel it and it came off on anything I ate or touched. No fault of the product itself - just not my preference. The Kiss of Shimmer indicates, light-heartedly, that it &amp;#34;make{s} kisses better&amp;#34;, but to be honest, I would not want to kiss my boyfriend with this, as it would leave product on him!</li>
            <li> Got this to give as a gift. It looked nice and the recipient says she loved it.</li>
            <li> The packaging is cute, with tissue paper inside holding the products. The lip butter smells amazing. It gives a nice, moisturized feel without being sticky or waxy. The balm gives a subtle shimmer to the lips making lips appear plump and moisturized. This will make a perfect stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> Love this little set. For some reason it reminds me of my childhood, with a sweet berry smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloss is not too glossy, it adds a nice shimmery shine that keeps my lips moist.</li>
            <li> Nivea Lip Care Kissable 2 Piece Gift Set.  I&#x27;ve used lots of lip gloss, lip stick, etc.  Needless to say, I use a lot of lip products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lip set is perfect.  And I like the idea that it is in a &amp;#34;gift set&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a tin of lip butter and a tube of shimmer lip care, all in a reusable bigger tin.  I am already contemplating what I am going to re-use this tin for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect product, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of both these lip products. My favorite is the tin of lip butter. It goes on completely clear, with a nice raspberry scent and leaves your lips feeling very soft. Some lip balms have something in it that sort of makes my throat feel scratchy. I am not sure what it is. But most of the time Nivea lip products don&#x27;t do that to me. This lip butter is great and one of my favorites of many lip balms I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is a nice light lip care lipstick. It goes on as a very pale pink color. This would not be the ideal color for all women, but if you like the new nude and pale shades of lipstick trending right now, you would probably like this. It is also very nice for young girls who are wanting a lipstick but parents aren&#x27;t really ready for them to be wearing makeup. It is light, and pale, with just a hint of shimmer, but not overly frosty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s that time of year where this makes me think of it being a good stocking stuffer or little holiday gift to your friend, or a party favor for a girl&#x27;s birthday party.</li>
            <li> This little set would make a great gift for a little child.  Inside the blue tin are a lipstick with frosty moisturizer and a small tin pan of pink lip balm.  Highly scented (raspberry) and the smell lasts a LONG time on your lips.  The frosty look is, well, very, very young.  The frost stuck around for a long time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too scented and girly for me.  But I would give this to a child.</li>
            <li> This Nivea Lip Care Kissable 2 Piece Gift Set is a nice little package. It comes with a small tin with a raspberry lip butter and kiss of shimmer lip care inside. My wife really likes both. They both have a nice smell, go on smoothly, and have a hint of raspberry flavor. Great stocking stuffer or small gift for any other time.</li>
            <li> gave this to the wife to use.  she liked the tin to hold the items.  she used it and like how the product keeps her lips moist for her lips dry out through the later fall to spring.  she likes this product</li>
            <li> Both lip products have a nice smell and go on easily. The tin is a bit of a throwaway as it is just not that pretty or useful. I didn&#x27;t find that the products lasted all that long or made my lips better.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell or texture as it was applied to lips.  A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice basic stocking stuffer that contains a sizeable lip butter tin with ingredients such as seed oil, shea butter and petrolatum and a Kiss Of Shimmer Radiant Lip Care stick that&#x27;s pretty nice but I wished it had a bit more shimmer to it as is advertised. It&#x27;s more like a matte shimmer rather than shiny. Comes in a blue tin with a nice design. Set has a raspberry taste and smell to it. Would make a nice stocking stuffer, is pretty good but ive used better or would prefer some other brands just as much.  Depends what you&#x27;re looking for, if it&#x27;s a very light neutral color you&#x27;ll like this, but if you&#x27;re looking for something with a bit more shin to it than look elsewhere. Does a decent/good job as far as moisturizing and conditioning lips I&#x27;d say. For the price it&#x27;s a good set. About 3.5-4 stars.</li>
            <li> This gift set is nice, and a good value. I was surprised at the size and quality of the tin. It&#x27;s quite old fashioned looking, and reminds me of tins my grandmother used for sewing notions. There&#x27;s no brand name on the tin; if you take off the packaging, it&#x27;ll look like you put the set together yourself. There&#x27;s even a bit of tissue paper inside, which is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Raspberry Ros&amp;eacute; Kiss Lip Butter. It has a nice fruity smell and feels good on the lips. The Kiss of Shimmer Radiant Lip Care feels good on the lips too, but it does give one that \\&quot;pale white lip\\&quot; color that some people don&#x27;t like. I&#x27;m not a young woman, so that look just washes me out. However, I&#x27;m not detracting any stars for that; it&#x27;s simply a matter of taste. I do think, however, that both products are a bit thicker than what I consider really good lip balm. This causes one to lick one&#x27;s lips more (as does the flavor), and that contributes to chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that, I give this four stars. I have tried a lot (and I mean a crazy, ridiculous amount) of lip balms, and I&#x27;ve gotten ridiculously picky about what I like. Given that I&#x27;m rather an outlier, I would unhesitating recommend this as it&#x27;s such a great value and a lovely little gift item. And the tin is adorably early 20th century, making this a terrific secretly inexpensive gift for an older woman or a young woman with retro taste. Just take the packaging off and you&#x27;ll look like you went to some trouble!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely gift set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because it contains BHT and an artificial dye (which I generally need to avoid), but otherwise I really enjoy the set.  Directions for use for both lip products are the same: &amp;#34;Apply to lips to make kisses better.&amp;#34;  Well, I decided to test that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Kiss of Shimmer radiant lip care is nice, and it has a pleasant raspberry fragrance.  It&#x27;s not terribly remarkable compared to other lip care products on the market however.  The Lip Butter, on the other hand, gives a nice little tingle, and it absorbed into my lips better than the Kiss of Shimmer product.  My husband kissed me after application of both to test the claim, and he agreed that both made &amp;#34;kisses better&amp;#34;, but much more so with the Lip Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the little blue tin they come in.  The products within the tin are easily worth the $4.99 sticker price, but the tin really adds a good value.  I actually like the set better than I thought I might!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how cute and low cost the lip products in this tin.? You get a roll up tube called a kiss of shimmer and a tin of rasberry flavored lip gloss. The only drawback to the tin of gloss is the need to use your fingers to put it on or perhaps with a q-tip. The kiss of shimmer gives a light neural pink frost to the lips. However, it&#x27;s not a tacky overdone frost.  Just like it says a shimmer.  This would be great as a stocking stuffer, especially for teenagers as the colors are very light.  As an adult I still find the two cute and useful.</li>
            <li> This gift set includes a decent tin that contains two of Nivea&#x27;s lip care products.  The stick has a slight shimmer to it and tastes like berries.  The lip butter wears well and really softens lips.  My wife loves these, and I&#x27;m liking them, too.</li>
            <li> I love this set.  The lip butter goes on very smoothly (no globs) and has a subtle raspberry flavor.  Keeps dry lips moisturized and feeling good.  The lip gloss is excellent. (I used it right over the lip butter.)  The shimmer is very slight and very flattering.  I was worried that it would be a heavy gloss and look garish on someone past their 20&#x27;s, but that&#x27;s not the case.  I highly recommend both products.</li>
