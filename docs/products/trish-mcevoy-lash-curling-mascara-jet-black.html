            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>It applies and comes off easily and makes my lashes look great.  </li>
            <li>It also is amazing to remove.  </li>
            <li>Just warm water.</li>
            <li>One of the things I liked about it was how you removed it.  </li>
            <li>Warm water would just make it fall off in tubes.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and comes off in a breeze.  </li>
            <li>It did not look as nice on me as it did on my friend.</li>
            <li>Nice gift.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to remove with water.</li>
            <li>The RN at my dermatologist has the most amazing lashes.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>This is the best mascara along three years.&lt;br /&gt;She washed off with warm water only .</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to wash out (with just warm water), but that&#x27;s all about</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump going on and my lashes look thicker for sure.  </li>
            <li>I love the tube aspect.</li>
            <li>And it is challenging to remove it.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY mascara that will NOT come off underneath your eyes after wearing it all day and night AND it wears perfectly in the heat/humidity.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really comfortable, light, gorgeous mascara for every day moment.</li>
            <li>for the price - you are basically paying for mascara and mascara removal as one deal :)</li>
            <li>I have gotten 3 more mailed to me and will try them to see if they might be part of the &amp;#34;new batch&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it coats your lashes with a tube</li>
            <li>I love Trish MacEvoy mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, been using it for a couple of years, it doesn&#x27;t smear and comes off with water.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update in a month :)</li>
            <li>But neither do most tubing mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oddly satisfying to take off as well.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I like this mascara more and more each time I use it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara.  </li>
            <li>My favorite mascara since Loreal discontinued what I had been using for many years.  </li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t want to struggle with washing your lashes off for 30min in the evening you should get this one for sure.</li>
            <li>When you go over it with the wand brush to separate, it doesn&#x27;t, it just adds more mascara to the clump.</li>
            <li>Find a better product distributed by a reputable company.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>One of the top eye lashes</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>This was the best mascara I had tried in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I love how easily it&#x27;s washed of with just water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so confident that it would be fabulous</li>
            <li>It does seem to curl a bit, but its most important benefit is staying on your lashes instead of on your face.</li>
            <li>All these great reviews are of the old formula.</li>
            <li>For me, that was great because my eyelashes come out easily and this mascara (the old formula anyway), came off without a lot of rubbing.  </li>
            <li>Warm water takes it right off</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool mascara!</li>
            <li>Love it very much and strongly recommend it to all my friends!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye and the removal is so easy that it doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it flakes off easily, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Easy to get off with soap and water.</li>
            <li>No smudging under my eyes and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>I wanted something easy to remove, that wouldn&#x27;t smudge or flake.  </li>
            <li>but it is easy to remove at night.</li>
            <li>tried Trish McEvoy High Volume Mascara (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00132FPFY/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and Trish McEvoy Lash Curling Mascara (this curent product).&lt;br /&gt;These are defiantly superior to Kevyn Aucoin Volume Mascara (this one) but</li>
            <li>This is ok mascara, nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the normal TMcV stuff.</li>
            <li>It was unique and come off easily.  </li>
            <li>This is a gel and it is important to read the directions on how to apply.</li>
            <li>Available in the &amp;#34;nicer&amp;#34; stores and here, of course.</li>
            <li>But dryer than that I bought at Nordstroms and didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few others too (i.e. Lancome), but this one works best for me.</li>
            <li>main reason for using tubing mascaras----it is how easy to take it off---you just wash your face with warm water and</li>
            <li>I realize that it pays for a unique technology, but it is still a lot to pay for mascara.  </li>
            <li>You can use little for \\&quot;no make-up\\&quot; look, or add some more -- and it looks great for the evening.</li>
            <li>No need for make-up remover and so clean.  </li>
            <li>I got a special price on 3</li>
            <li>Do not need special tools.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t give me racoon eyes and makes my lashes look much, MUCH longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>I love that there is no flaking, that I can layer as much as I want and it never makes my lashes spidery.</li>
            <li>it makes my straight lashes much more straighter, even after curling with curler...</li>
            <li>It dries quickly after applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited, but now I&#x27;m pretty underwhelmed...</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t worth $30 in my opinion.</li>
            <li>And very simply washed off with warm water.</li>
            <li>After ready good reviews I finally got this one.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>If you buy from their website directly they send 3 free gifts!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the price</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Blinc, on the other hand, goes on smoothly, separates and stays all day until you take it off at night with a warm damp cloth.</li>
            <li>This mascara is pricey, and it&#x27;s not my favorite in terms of how it makes my lashes look (pretty good, but not amazing).</li>
            <li>It coats the lashes like a tube and then sort of slips right off, not damaging the lashes or pulling them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aucoin Volume Mascara (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014LLC3I/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) provides just the right amount of lash amplification, with out lumps and clumps.</li>
            <li>This mascara comes right off in your fingers and never smudges or dyes your skin when you take your makeup off.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not waterproof, it does NOT run at all and is very easy to remove - NO eye-makeup remover necessary (just glide your fingers along your lashes with some water to remove the tube-like mascara).</li>
            <li>and, though it doesn&#x27;t smudge much, it isn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
            <li>They are delighted with the Trish McEvoy Lash Curling Mascara Jet Black</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural look, no smudges and easy removal.</li>
            <li>When the Blinc mascara comes off, it&#x27;s in nice fat tubes, like you just pulled out healthy thick lashes.</li>
            <li>It has a tubular formula so it washes off clean with a little rubbing and warm water.</li>
            <li>and it looks good on the lashes even if it snows or some drops of water fall down on them!</li>
            <li>the price is much higher.</li>
            <li>The first tube wasn&#x27;t like this at all.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff, personally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not entirely convinced it&#x27;s much better than the $6 mascara I can get at the drug store.</li>
            <li>Finally I found it:)</li>
            <li>First off, it comes out in clumpy flakes.</li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s more 30 minutes later.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first time this has happened either.  </li>
            <li>and this is good for everyday or for business.</li>
            <li>I have been a long time Blinc customer and decided to try this to see if it worked better.</li>
            <li>I have spent 2 decades trying various mascaras, from drugstore cheap to super-pricey, and this is the only brand I have ever found that looks great and does not give me raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>This pretty much happens with all mascaras I&#x27;ve used, except for They&#x27;re Real.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I was looking for a top quality mascara and these Amazon reviews were so good, but I was a bit disappointed in this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly (spidery lashes)</li>
            <li>Amazing little wand.,</li>
            <li>so perhaps it is thanks to this mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are very runny and don&#x27;t amplify lashes at all, but rather glue them together.</li>
            <li>I can go for about 9 or 10 hours before it really starts to bug me.</li>
            <li>totally worth every penny, so far.</li>
            <li>When I put it in the morning it stays whole day on my lashes.</li>
            <li>and this really helps to extend my eyelashes a bit.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t give you much volume or dramatically long lashes - and that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>For a more dramatic look achieved with more than one application, this mascara would not be the go-to.  </li>
            <li>It also give my very straight eyelashes a natural curl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other mascaras both more and less expensive to see if there&#x27;s anything comparable or better (Lancome, YSL, Maybelline Great Lash, Dior, etc.).  </li>
            <li>The lash curling stuff in this mascara just makes lashes more subject to clumping ...</li>
            <li>highly recommend L&#x27;oreal tubing mascara:</li>
            <li>I have never used a better quality mascara, hands down!</li>
            <li>But, at the same time, you can wash it off with just warm water -- it comes off in tiny tubes, does not sting the eyes, does not require extra chemicals under, over it, or for washing it off.</li>
            <li>so easy to remove, and makes your eyelashes endless!</li>
            <li>It only comes off in warm water in plasticy little clumps, but stays on even through tears.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t yet tried the new replacement.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit to get used to b/c when you wash it off it kind of flakes off the way false lashes do but to me that is better than running down my face.</li>
            <li>Was previously using Kevyn Aucoin (same tube like formula) and loved that but found this and won&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping this product doesn&#x27;t dry out as quickly as Kevyn Aucoin did..</li>
            <li>How nice to come home after a long day at work and not have black smudges under my eyes.</li>
            <li>When my first tube ran out, I bought a second tube.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge all day and it is easy to remove...a little water and it rolls off your lashes.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, comes off with water in little tubes and has never smudged or flaked</li>
            <li>One of the few beauty products I am willing to pay any price for, totally worth it.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, this is \\&quot;the</li>
            <li>This does not give me the natural look I like.  </li>
            <li>so there is no mess all over your face</li>
            <li>This mascara washes off with a little warm water but doesn&#x27;t run down your face.</li>
            <li>I love the mascara, but there is a serious defect with the mascara tube.  </li>
            <li>I have tried ten different mascaras and this is the first one that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>This past time I tried another kind, I swore I would never waste my money on any other mascara again - unless I am headed to a funeral or swimming.  </li>
            <li>Go back to the old formula, please!!</li>
            <li>I always have a new one as a back up</li>
            <li>I have ordered this mascara several times - and the tube completely came apart on each one!  </li>
            <li>It basically just slides off your lashes with the help of a little water, and for that reason, I will stick with Trish McEvoy until there is some other, better alternative.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey  but worth it to me.</li>
            <li>4 stars because when you use it for about a first month it mirror down under your eyes.</li>
            <li>treat it with water a little bit and pull it of your lashes with your fingers - mess free!</li>
            <li>Just a little warm water and my usual facial cleanser</li>
            <li>I used to be big into layering mascaras (They&#x27;re Real with Bad Gal Lash or Lash Domination with Buxom Lash and More Than Mascara).</li>

            <li> The RN at my dermatologist has the most amazing lashes.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this mascara!  </li>
            <li> This is the best mascara along three years.&lt;br /&gt;She washed off with warm water only .</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to wash out (with just warm water), but that&#x27;s all about</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump going on and my lashes look thicker for sure.  </li>
            <li> I love the tube aspect.</li>
            <li> And it is challenging to remove it.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY mascara that will NOT come off underneath your eyes after wearing it all day and night AND it wears perfectly in the heat/humidity.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really comfortable, light, gorgeous mascara for every day moment.</li>
            <li> for the price - you are basically paying for mascara and mascara removal as one deal :)</li>
            <li> I have gotten 3 more mailed to me and will try them to see if they might be part of the &amp;#34;new batch&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it coats your lashes with a tube</li>
            <li> I love Trish MacEvoy mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, been using it for a couple of years, it doesn&#x27;t smear and comes off with water.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update in a month :)</li>
            <li> But neither do most tubing mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love it:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oddly satisfying to take off as well.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara more and more each time I use it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara.  </li>
            <li> My favorite mascara since Loreal discontinued what I had been using for many years.  </li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t want to struggle with washing your lashes off for 30min in the evening you should get this one for sure.</li>
            <li> When you go over it with the wand brush to separate, it doesn&#x27;t, it just adds more mascara to the clump.</li>
            <li> Find a better product distributed by a reputable company.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> One of the top eye lashes</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> This was the best mascara I had tried in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I love how easily it&#x27;s washed of with just water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so confident that it would be fabulous</li>
            <li> It does seem to curl a bit, but its most important benefit is staying on your lashes instead of on your face.</li>
            <li> All these great reviews are of the old formula.</li>
            <li> For me, that was great because my eyelashes come out easily and this mascara (the old formula anyway), came off without a lot of rubbing.  </li>
            <li> Warm water takes it right off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool mascara!</li>
            <li> Love it very much and strongly recommend it to all my friends!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye and the removal is so easy that it doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it flakes off easily, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Easy to get off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> No smudging under my eyes and comes off easily.</li>
            <li> I wanted something easy to remove, that wouldn&#x27;t smudge or flake.  </li>
            <li> but it is easy to remove at night.</li>
            <li> tried Trish McEvoy High Volume Mascara (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00132FPFY/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and Trish McEvoy Lash Curling Mascara (this curent product).&lt;br /&gt;These are defiantly superior to Kevyn Aucoin Volume Mascara (this one) but</li>
            <li> This is ok mascara, nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as the normal TMcV stuff.</li>
            <li> It was unique and come off easily.  </li>
            <li> This is a gel and it is important to read the directions on how to apply.</li>
            <li> Available in the &amp;#34;nicer&amp;#34; stores and here, of course.</li>
            <li> But dryer than that I bought at Nordstroms and didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few others too (i.e. Lancome), but this one works best for me.</li>
            <li> main reason for using tubing mascaras----it is how easy to take it off---you just wash your face with warm water and</li>
            <li> I realize that it pays for a unique technology, but it is still a lot to pay for mascara.  </li>
            <li> You can use little for \\&quot;no make-up\\&quot; look, or add some more -- and it looks great for the evening.</li>
            <li> No need for make-up remover and so clean.  </li>
            <li> I got a special price on 3</li>
            <li> Do not need special tools.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t give me racoon eyes and makes my lashes look much, MUCH longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> I love that there is no flaking, that I can layer as much as I want and it never makes my lashes spidery.</li>
            <li> it makes my straight lashes much more straighter, even after curling with curler...</li>
            <li> It dries quickly after applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited, but now I&#x27;m pretty underwhelmed...</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t worth $30 in my opinion.</li>
            <li> And very simply washed off with warm water.</li>
            <li> After ready good reviews I finally got this one.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> If you buy from their website directly they send 3 free gifts!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the price</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Blinc, on the other hand, goes on smoothly, separates and stays all day until you take it off at night with a warm damp cloth.</li>
            <li> This mascara is pricey, and it&#x27;s not my favorite in terms of how it makes my lashes look (pretty good, but not amazing).</li>
            <li> It coats the lashes like a tube and then sort of slips right off, not damaging the lashes or pulling them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aucoin Volume Mascara (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014LLC3I/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) provides just the right amount of lash amplification, with out lumps and clumps.</li>
            <li> This mascara comes right off in your fingers and never smudges or dyes your skin when you take your makeup off.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not waterproof, it does NOT run at all and is very easy to remove - NO eye-makeup remover necessary (just glide your fingers along your lashes with some water to remove the tube-like mascara).</li>
            <li> and, though it doesn&#x27;t smudge much, it isn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
            <li> They are delighted with the Trish McEvoy Lash Curling Mascara Jet Black</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural look, no smudges and easy removal.</li>
            <li> When the Blinc mascara comes off, it&#x27;s in nice fat tubes, like you just pulled out healthy thick lashes.</li>
            <li> It has a tubular formula so it washes off clean with a little rubbing and warm water.</li>
            <li> and it looks good on the lashes even if it snows or some drops of water fall down on them!</li>
            <li> the price is much higher.</li>
            <li> The first tube wasn&#x27;t like this at all.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff, personally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely convinced it&#x27;s much better than the $6 mascara I can get at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Finally I found it:)</li>
            <li> First off, it comes out in clumpy flakes.</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s more 30 minutes later.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first time this has happened either.  </li>
            <li> and this is good for everyday or for business.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Blinc customer and decided to try this to see if it worked better.</li>
            <li> I have spent 2 decades trying various mascaras, from drugstore cheap to super-pricey, and this is the only brand I have ever found that looks great and does not give me raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> This pretty much happens with all mascaras I&#x27;ve used, except for They&#x27;re Real.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was looking for a top quality mascara and these Amazon reviews were so good, but I was a bit disappointed in this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly (spidery lashes)</li>
            <li> Amazing little wand.,</li>
            <li> so perhaps it is thanks to this mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are very runny and don&#x27;t amplify lashes at all, but rather glue them together.</li>
            <li> I can go for about 9 or 10 hours before it really starts to bug me.</li>
            <li> totally worth every penny, so far.</li>
            <li> When I put it in the morning it stays whole day on my lashes.</li>
            <li> and this really helps to extend my eyelashes a bit.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t give you much volume or dramatically long lashes - and that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> For a more dramatic look achieved with more than one application, this mascara would not be the go-to.  </li>
            <li> It also give my very straight eyelashes a natural curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other mascaras both more and less expensive to see if there&#x27;s anything comparable or better (Lancome, YSL, Maybelline Great Lash, Dior, etc.).  </li>
            <li> The lash curling stuff in this mascara just makes lashes more subject to clumping ...</li>
            <li> highly recommend L&#x27;oreal tubing mascara:</li>
            <li> I have never used a better quality mascara, hands down!</li>
            <li> But, at the same time, you can wash it off with just warm water -- it comes off in tiny tubes, does not sting the eyes, does not require extra chemicals under, over it, or for washing it off.</li>
            <li> so easy to remove, and makes your eyelashes endless!</li>
            <li> It only comes off in warm water in plasticy little clumps, but stays on even through tears.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t yet tried the new replacement.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get used to b/c when you wash it off it kind of flakes off the way false lashes do but to me that is better than running down my face.</li>
            <li> Was previously using Kevyn Aucoin (same tube like formula) and loved that but found this and won&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this product doesn&#x27;t dry out as quickly as Kevyn Aucoin did..</li>
            <li> How nice to come home after a long day at work and not have black smudges under my eyes.</li>
            <li> When my first tube ran out, I bought a second tube.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge all day and it is easy to remove...a little water and it rolls off your lashes.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, comes off with water in little tubes and has never smudged or flaked</li>
            <li> One of the few beauty products I am willing to pay any price for, totally worth it.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this is \\&quot;the</li>
            <li> This does not give me the natural look I like.  </li>
            <li> so there is no mess all over your face</li>
            <li> This mascara washes off with a little warm water but doesn&#x27;t run down your face.</li>
            <li> I love the mascara, but there is a serious defect with the mascara tube.  </li>
            <li> I have tried ten different mascaras and this is the first one that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> This past time I tried another kind, I swore I would never waste my money on any other mascara again - unless I am headed to a funeral or swimming.  </li>
            <li> Go back to the old formula, please!!</li>
            <li> I always have a new one as a back up</li>
            <li> I have ordered this mascara several times - and the tube completely came apart on each one!  </li>
            <li> It basically just slides off your lashes with the help of a little water, and for that reason, I will stick with Trish McEvoy until there is some other, better alternative.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey  but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because when you use it for about a first month it mirror down under your eyes.</li>
            <li> treat it with water a little bit and pull it of your lashes with your fingers - mess free!</li>
            <li> Just a little warm water and my usual facial cleanser</li>
            <li> I used to be big into layering mascaras (They&#x27;re Real with Bad Gal Lash or Lash Domination with Buxom Lash and More Than Mascara).</li>
            <li> Apparently with age I now have dry eyes</li>
            <li> I wasted so much money on cheap, smeary mascara all the while telling myself that the McEvoy was too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes, and it is the ONLY one I have ever tried that does not end up under my eyes by the end of the day</li>
            <li> The only trick is that it takes a while to dry fully before I can curl my lashes so that it doesn&#x27;t clump (if I curl them before I put the mascara on, the mascara makes me lose the curl).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and have gone through a whole slew of expensive mascaras (including supposed hypoallergenic ones) looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t make my eye itch and turn red if it got too close to or got in my eye during removal.  </li>
            <li> I have long hesitated in buying this mascara.</li>
            <li> So, if you are not sensitive to mascara, it will probably be 5 stars for you.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly long, but sparse eyelashes.</li>
            <li> and it truly does make it look like eyeliner with mascara due to the tiny brush that gets so close to your skin.  </li>
            <li> I work outside in extreme humidity.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and always come back,  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is, and this is just for me because I am so sensitive, that by the end of the day my eyes are somewhat irritated by it.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t  ever dry!  </li>
            <li> Just a simple black one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so wet that you cannot apply it without getting it all over your eyes.</li>
            <li> This is expensive but completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Expensive for mascara, but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> She hew what she wanted and the price was as expected.</li>
            <li> but you must be careful to get it all</li>
            <li> Although expensive, the mascara is definitely worth the money: simple brush (no fancy messy puffs), the material goes on each eyelash, separately, and does not come off even in the rain.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with clumping (maybe it was just old) and also had trouble with raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> You basically have to hand separate the lashes (not easy) and hold them separate while it dries and don&#x27;t ever put a second coat on.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand the smudgy black eyes it left me with no matter how much scrubbing I did, I&#x27;m obsessed with this one bc</li>
            <li> only drawback is that these little black things (the \\&quot;tubes) that are on the inside of my shower curtain from when I wash them off.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that I felt the tube dried out much quicker than other expensive mascaras I have owned</li>
            <li> No need to rub and pull at your eyes like with other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I will not buy any other.</li>
            <li> It curls and makes my little lashes so long!</li>
            <li> Cones off in weird little lash tubes so don&#x27;t freak &amp; think all your lashes fell out the first time you wash your face.</li>
            <li> Little dry pebbles of black are all over my cheeks and eyelids when I finish and there&#x27;s practically nothing on my eyelashes!  </li>
            <li> We are prone to mascara sliding down our faces.</li>
            <li> There is no smudging, running, or any other unsightlness!  </li>
            <li> never have to deal with black all over your face.  </li>
            <li> Nor any black streaks under his eyes.</li>
            <li> tried Blinc Mascaras in black and purple (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MUNBZS/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1)</li>
            <li> It doesnt smudge and will never leave you with black tear stained cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love this mascara so bad!</li>
            <li> the mascara rolls off in little clumps.</li>
            <li> It comes off in rubbery little tubes</li>
            <li> and it comes off in little tubes.</li>
            <li> I have little stubby eyelashes</li>
            <li> It gets sticky and can be messy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It dried out within a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Product was damaged and dried out.</li>
            <li> I got absolutely dried out mascara...</li>
            <li> IF you get a tube that isn&#x27;t totally dried out,</li>
            <li> If you are looking for really heavy velvety eye lashes, this mascara may not be \\&quot;it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day, no smudges or black circles under your eyes!</li>
            <li> I had to blow dry the wand before I used it just to get rid of the wetness and the tube was broken and kept coming out of the outer container.</li>
            <li> Not sure what caused both issues -</li>
            <li> Having longer lashes, this has been a problem for me in the past.  </li>
            <li> Just ordinary mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about it&#x27;s curling capabilities, but it doesn&#x27;t run or stain my skin.  </li>
            <li> Little bit expensive than other maskaras</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than mascara running down your face or causing skunk-like eyes when you wash up at night.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended it to me about 6-7 years ago, and I&#x27;ve been a die hard fan ever since.  </li>
            <li> but IT SUCKS.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand how they are selling this crap.</li>
            <li> No more raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> I have very small lashes</li>
            <li> Little balls of mascara that will adhere to the wrong places, the tip of your lash, your eyelid, your cheeks.</li>
            <li> I took it back and they told me that yes, they had gotten complaints and that the they had gotten some bad batches.  </li>
            <li> I wear contacts and got tired of my mascara coming off by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> The McEvoy brand comes off in thin strands, a screaming testament to it&#x27;s inability.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, and randomly stumbled upon Trish McEvoy&#x27;s curling mascara.</li>
            <li> Works like a dream, and no more raccoon eyes!!!!</li>
            <li> I suspect that these are all bad and that whatever they&#x27;ve done to the formula, they&#x27;ve ruined it.  </li>
            <li> I give it four stars because it does clump up around the base when I replace the brush and seal it up.  </li>
            <li> Too bad!  </li>
            <li> Completely disappointed!  </li>
            <li> im very disappointed... :</li>
            <li> Once I got home and tried the replacement, it was equally bad!!  </li>

            <li> I love this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t give me racoon eyes and makes my lashes look much, MUCH longer and thicker. The only trick is that it takes a while to dry fully before I can curl my lashes so that it doesn&#x27;t clump (if I curl them before I put the mascara on, the mascara makes me lose the curl). I also use to have eyelash breakage, and I no longer do, so perhaps it is thanks to this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that these little black things (the \\&quot;tubes) that are on the inside of my shower curtain from when I wash them off. But whatever. Worth it.</li>
            <li> This is generally a great mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t clump going on and my lashes look thicker for sure.  I can even handle the way it flakes off when in wash my face because it means I don&#x27;t need to use make up remover.  I give it four stars because it does clump up around the base when I replace the brush and seal it up.  It gets sticky and can be messy.  This isn&#x27;t about the way it performs as a mascara so I will keep splurging on it.</li>
            <li> I love the tube aspect. It never runs.</li>
            <li> The RN at my dermatologist has the most amazing lashes.  I asked her if she was using latisse (no) or had eyelash extensions (no)?  She said, \\&quot;Its the Trish McEvoy mascara!\\&quot;  So off I went to Saks and dropped four or five times what I spend at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so confident that it would be fabulous but IT SUCKS.  I picked the non-curling one (my lashes are over curly already) which by looking at the above reviews may have been my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply it it&#x27;s flaky and lumpy.  Little dry pebbles of black are all over my cheeks and eyelids when I finish and there&#x27;s practically nothing on my eyelashes!  I really don&#x27;t understand how they are selling this crap.</li>
            <li> best mascara out there!  never have to deal with black all over your face.  treat it with water a little bit and pull it of your lashes with your fingers - mess free!</li>
            <li> This is ok mascara, nothing special.  I had trouble with clumping (maybe it was just old) and also had trouble with raccoon eyes.  Not sure what caused both issues - but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I did not like this mascara.It feels like Lancome,you cannot reapply it.And it is challenging to remove it.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY mascara that will NOT come off underneath your eyes after wearing it all day and night AND it wears perfectly in the heat/humidity.  Having longer lashes, this has been a problem for me in the past.  I&#x27;ve tried other mascaras both more and less expensive to see if there&#x27;s anything comparable or better (Lancome, YSL, Maybelline Great Lash, Dior, etc.).  This past time I tried another kind, I swore I would never waste my money on any other mascara again - unless I am headed to a funeral or swimming.  Although it&#x27;s not waterproof, it does NOT run at all and is very easy to remove - NO eye-makeup remover necessary (just glide your fingers along your lashes with some water to remove the tube-like mascara).</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was looking for a top quality mascara and these Amazon reviews were so good, but I was a bit disappointed in this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly (spidery lashes) and, though it doesn&#x27;t smudge much, it isn&#x27;t anything special.  It certainly isn&#x27;t worth $30 in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I always have a new one as a back up so I never am without it.  Put it on in the morning and until you wash it off  it stays in place.  This is a gel and it is important to read the directions on how to apply.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I have ever used that didn&#x27;t smudge on me.  It is a little pricey  but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> The only mascara that doesnt make my eyes burn or itch. Love it.</li>
            <li> A great mascara. Easy to apply, lasts a long time. And very simply washed off with warm water. Good product for each day.</li>
            <li> Will not give you racoon eyes...even through a workout.  The mascara forms tubes or fibers around your lashes and comes off with water and a tissue.  I tried similar products such as \\&quot;Kiss Me\\&quot; brand, but I always go back to Trish McEvoy Lash Curling Mascara.</li>
            <li> The best mascara EVER. No flakes, running, smearing, or pillow case stains. Cones off in weird little lash tubes so don&#x27;t freak &amp; think all your lashes fell out the first time you wash your face.</li>
            <li> I wasted so much money on cheap, smeary mascara all the while telling myself that the McEvoy was too expensive. Finally came to my senses, and bought this again. How nice to come home after a long day at work and not have black smudges under my eyes. It does seem to curl a bit, but its most important benefit is staying on your lashes instead of on your face.</li>
            <li> Good mascara!  Stays on and doesn&#x27;t smudge.  Good consistency.  A+++</li>
            <li> This mascara washes off with a little warm water but doesn&#x27;t run down your face. It coats the lashes like a tube and then sort of slips right off, not damaging the lashes or pulling them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this Mascara !!! it&#x27;s really comfortable, light, gorgeous mascara for every day moment. One of the best mascara of the world )</li>
            <li> Great product, my lashes have never looked so great. Trish McEvoy is one of my all time favorites.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and have gone through a whole slew of expensive mascaras (including supposed hypoallergenic ones) looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t make my eye itch and turn red if it got too close to or got in my eye during removal.  This fits the bill.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye and the removal is so easy that it doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes.  It also does a good job of coating without clumping.  The only drawback is that I felt the tube dried out much quicker than other expensive mascaras I have owned and then the application became clumpy.</li>
            <li> I have long hesitated in buying this mascara. Now that I have it, I recommend it to all. Every girl should be. During the day, it does not spread, not showered. And as she washed off? Just warm water. Nor any black streaks under his eyes. This best mascara which I enjoyed and will remain forever a fan of this mascara.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this mascara so bad! After ready good reviews I finally got this one.&lt;br /&gt;From day one this mascara was giving me &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look, no curls, no volume, no length... nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s easy to wash out (with just warm water), but that&#x27;s all about this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;It dried out within a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;As for the price - you are basically paying for mascara and mascara removal as one deal :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not recommend and will not buy this mascara again. It&#x27;s way overrated.</li>
            <li> I tried different tubing mascaras and I have to say that this one has the best price to quality ration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Trish McEvoy High Volume Mascara (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00132FPFY/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and Trish McEvoy Lash Curling Mascara (this curent product).&lt;br /&gt;These are defiantly superior to Kevyn Aucoin Volume Mascara (this one) but the price is much higher. I can not say that the quality out ways having to pay ~50$ for Trish McEvoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Blinc Mascaras in black and purple (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MUNBZS/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and I have to say that even though these are cheaper---I don&#x27;t like them at all! These are very runny and don&#x27;t amplify lashes at all, but rather glue them together. I&#x27;m done with Blinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevyn Aucoin Volume Mascara (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014LLC3I/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) provides just the right amount of lash amplification, with out lumps and clumps. It also allows for proper lash separation and stay on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main reason for using tubing mascaras----it is how easy to take it off---you just wash your face with warm water and the mascara rolls off in little clumps. No more raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this and absolutely loved it--until they changed the formula!!  When my first tube ran out, I bought a second tube. It&#x27;s so wet that you cannot apply it without getting it all over your eyes. And it doesn&#x27;t  ever dry!  I had to blow dry the wand before I used it just to get rid of the wetness and the tube was broken and kept coming out of the outer container. The first tube wasn&#x27;t like this at all. I took it back and they told me that yes, they had gotten complaints and that the they had gotten some bad batches.  I got a special price on 3 (if I purchased them there and they would mail them to me.  I hadn&#x27;t yet tried the new replacement.  Once I got home and tried the replacement, it was equally bad!!  I have gotten 3 more mailed to me and will try them to see if they might be part of the &amp;#34;new batch&amp;#34;.  I suspect that these are all bad and that whatever they&#x27;ve done to the formula, they&#x27;ve ruined it.  All these great reviews are of the old formula. If not, all of them will be going back!  It&#x27;s a shame!  This was the best mascara I had tried in a long time.  Why change the formula??!  One of the things I liked about it was how you removed it.  Warm water would just make it fall off in tubes.  It was unique and come off easily.  For me, that was great because my eyelashes come out easily and this mascara (the old formula anyway), came off without a lot of rubbing.  Too bad!  Go back to the old formula, please!!</li>
            <li> My sister turned my on to this brand of mascara. We are prone to mascara sliding down our faces. This is expensive but completely worth it. It has a tubular formula so it washes off clean with a little rubbing and warm water. If you buy from their website directly they send 3 free gifts!</li>
            <li> I have never used a better quality mascara, hands down! I used to be big into layering mascaras (They&#x27;re Real with Bad Gal Lash or Lash Domination with Buxom Lash and More Than Mascara). I&#x27;ve gotten some killer results that way, but none of those compare to this product. I love that there is no flaking, that I can layer as much as I want and it never makes my lashes spidery. I also love that it coats your lashes with a tube so I never get raccoon-eye from it and that it makes my lashes sky-high in just a couple of swipes. It is the one-stop-shop mascara that I have been looking for my entire make-up-wearing life. My only complaint is, and this is just for me because I am so sensitive, that by the end of the day my eyes are somewhat irritated by it. I can go for about 9 or 10 hours before it really starts to bug me. This pretty much happens with all mascaras I&#x27;ve used, except for They&#x27;re Real. So, if you are not sensitive to mascara, it will probably be 5 stars for you. With that being said, I still don&#x27;t think I will ever use anything else again. As far as I can tell, this is \\&quot;the one\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> It is the best mascara I ever met! Love it very much and strongly recommend it to all my friends!</li>
            <li> Just ordinary mascara. No curling effect that I noticed. Plus, it flakes off easily, in my opinion. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  It is the only one I ever buy now.  It goes on nicely and comes off in a breeze.  No need to rub and pull at your eyes like with other mascaras.</li>
            <li> and got a refund. It did not look as nice on me as it did on my friend. Wasn&#x27;t worth the price but customer service I rate a 10.</li>
            <li> My favorite  mascara ever! so easy to remove, and makes your eyelashes endless!</li>
            <li> Great mascara and it truly does make it look like eyeliner with mascara due to the tiny brush that gets so close to your skin.  Amazing little wand.,</li>
            <li> Thank you I am very happy</li>
            <li> I heard such hype about Trich McEvoy products, so I decided to give it a try.  Not at all what I expected.  Nothing that great to tell. Over priced for the product.  sorry but I won&#x27;t be trying anymore of her overrated in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascra - you never ever get raccoon eyes.  It takes a bit to get used to b/c when you wash it off it kind of flakes off the way false lashes do but to me that is better than running down my face.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the normal TMcV stuff. The lash curling stuff in this mascara just makes lashes more subject to clumping ...&lt;br /&gt;But as with all TMcV the waterproofing is miraculous.</li>
            <li> I love Trish MacEvoy mascara.  I&#x27;m not sure about it&#x27;s curling capabilities, but it doesn&#x27;t run or stain my skin.  It only comes off in warm water in plasticy little clumps, but stays on even through tears.</li>
            <li> I recomend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have spent 2 decades trying various mascaras, from drugstore cheap to super-pricey, and this is the only brand I have ever found that looks great and does not give me raccoon eyes. Ever. One of the few beauty products I am willing to pay any price for, totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge all day and it is easy to remove...a little water and it rolls off your lashes.  A friend of mine recommended it to me about 6-7 years ago, and I&#x27;ve been a die hard fan ever since.  Expensive for mascara, but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> There were no complaints from the  friend. She hew what she wanted and the price was as expected. Nice gift.</li>
            <li> I work outside in extreme humidity.  I will wear this mascara up to 90 degrees.  There is no smudging, running, or any other unsightlness!  Warm water takes it right off but you must be careful to get it all or you will end up with some build up.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, been using it for a couple of years, it doesn&#x27;t smear and comes off with water. I will not buy any other.</li>
            <li> I used to avoid wearing mascara altogether because I hated removing it, but this mascara is incredible.  It comes off in rubbery little tubes so there is no mess all over your face and although it&#x27;s not waterproof, it withstands my workouts and even swimming.  I will never buy another mascara.  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Completely disappointed!  I have ordered this mascara several times - and the tube completely came apart on each one!  I love the mascara, but there is a serious defect with the mascara tube.  The product dries up and globs up!  I even purchased from Neiman&#x27;s a month ago and the same thing happened!! I hope the manufacturer addresses this problem immediately.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Was previously using Kevyn Aucoin (same tube like formula) and loved that but found this and won&#x27;t go back. I&#x27;m hoping this product doesn&#x27;t dry out as quickly as Kevyn Aucoin did.. Only time will tell. I&#x27;ll update in a month :) totally worth every penny, so far.</li>
            <li> It is not a curling mascara. Just a simple black one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, and randomly stumbled upon Trish McEvoy&#x27;s curling mascara. I was so excited, but now I&#x27;m pretty underwhelmed...these are not the lashes I&#x27;ve been looking for. Wimpy, flaccid. Yes, they don&#x27;t smear. But neither do most tubing mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend L&#x27;oreal tubing mascara: http://www.amazon.com/LOreal-Paris-Mascara-Blackest-0-33-Fluid/dp/B001M7QLSA. It&#x27;s a fraction of the price, so if it doesn&#x27;t work for your lashes you&#x27;re only out $10, not $30. I love the stuff, personally. L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s tubing mascara is Latisse in a bottle!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara ever.  It doesnt smudge and will never leave you with black tear stained cheeks.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This mascara is pricey, and it&#x27;s not my favorite in terms of how it makes my lashes look (pretty good, but not amazing). But as someone who used to avoid wearing mascara when I could, simply bc I couldn&#x27;t stand the smudgy black eyes it left me with no matter how much scrubbing I did, I&#x27;m obsessed with this one bc it comes off with such ease. It basically just slides off your lashes with the help of a little water, and for that reason, I will stick with Trish McEvoy until there is some other, better alternative.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  It goes on nicely and looks great.  It also is amazing to remove.  It just comes off- no raccoon eyes or left over residue.  Love it:)</li>
            <li> Product was damaged and dried out. Tried contacting seller and did not hear back.</li>
            <li> Perfect mascara! It curls and makes my little lashes so long! and it looks good on the lashes even if it snows or some drops of water fall down on them!</li>
            <li> Love it!  I applied one coat of this mascara and it looked great! I&#x27;ve always had problems with my mascara flaking off under my eyes. Not with this product! I applied it at 8:30am, stayed outside all day in the heat, and even went to an indoor trampoline park and this mascara stayed put until I took it off that night. It&#x27;s oddly satisfying to take off as well. Just a little warm water and my usual facial cleanser and it comes off in little tubes. Amazing!</li>
            <li> No one make mascara like Trish McEvoy.  I have tried other brands and always come back,  I have not found the same technology where the mascara washes away in strings with no residue around the eyes.  No need for make-up remover and so clean.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara more and more each time I use it.  It applies and comes off easily and makes my lashes look great.  The only downside is the price.  I&#x27;m not entirely convinced it&#x27;s much better than the $6 mascara I can get at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara.  There is nothing worse than mascara running down your face or causing skunk-like eyes when you wash up at night.  This mascara comes right off in your fingers and never smudges or dyes your skin when you take your makeup off.  Simple soap and water or cleanser and water does the trick - actually just water does too.  I have very small lashes and this is good for everyday or for business.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara along three years.&lt;br /&gt;She washed off with warm water only . Do not need special tools. I will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;I did it as a gift to my friends . They are delighted with the Trish McEvoy Lash Curling Mascara Jet Black</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara since Loreal discontinued what I had been using for many years.  This doesn&#x27;t flake off and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and got tired of my mascara coming off by the end of the day.  If I wore waterproof mascara, I had to use make-up remover at the end of the day that left greasy residue around my eyes that eventually made its way onto my contacts.  This does the trick.  It looks like your eyelashes are coming off when you wash your face with water and apply pressure, but it is just the tubes that went around your eyelashes.  Works like a dream, and no more raccoon eyes!!!!</li>
            <li> It does what it say it does and comes off with very warm water. Available in the &amp;#34;nicer&amp;#34; stores and here, of course.</li>
            <li> I got absolutely dried out mascara...I couldnt return it because I didnt save the recipe ....&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy it again!</li>
            <li> 4 stars because when you use it for about a first month it mirror down under your eyes. When it became a bit dryer everything started working as it should work.</li>
            <li> I have been looking the ideal maskara for years! Finally I found it:) Doesn&#x27;t make panda eyes.When I put it in the morning it stays whole day on my lashes. Little bit expensive than other maskaras but if you don&#x27;t want to struggle with washing your lashes off for 30min in the evening you should get this one for sure.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t give you much volume or dramatically long lashes - and that&#x27;s fine with me. I wanted a natural look, no smudges and easy removal. This mascara is the best at all that. I love how easily it&#x27;s washed of with just water. And it NEVER smudges.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day, no smudges or black circles under your eyes! Easy to get off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this mascara. If you&#x27;re looking for one that forms tubes around your lashes, get Blinc brand. This mascara, while sleek looking packaging and expensive price might persuade you to think it&#x27;s better, it&#x27;s not. First off, it comes out in clumpy flakes. Little balls of mascara that will adhere to the wrong places, the tip of your lash, your eyelid, your cheeks. And as you wear it, the flaking balls continue for the rest of the day. You wipe some off and poof, there&#x27;s more 30 minutes later. I have incredibly long, but sparse eyelashes. This mascara glues them together, making it look even sparser. When you go over it with the wand brush to separate, it doesn&#x27;t, it just adds more mascara to the clump. You basically have to hand separate the lashes (not easy) and hold them separate while it dries and don&#x27;t ever put a second coat on. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and no matter how differently I try applying it, all of the above complaints occur. Blinc, on the other hand, goes on smoothly, separates and stays all day until you take it off at night with a warm damp cloth. When the Blinc mascara comes off, it&#x27;s in nice fat tubes, like you just pulled out healthy thick lashes. The McEvoy brand comes off in thin strands, a screaming testament to it&#x27;s inability. I have been a long time Blinc customer and decided to try this to see if it worked better. It did not and I will be going back to Blinc.</li>
            <li> Best mascara on the market</li>
            <li> I have tried ten different mascaras and this is the first one that has worked for me. Apparently with age I now have dry eyes and I&#x27;m constantly blinking. I&#x27;ve been walking around for a year wiping under my eyes and worried about the smudges. This one works. No smudging under my eyes and comes off easily.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 pieces per sample. It&#x27;s cool mascara! I love it! Promptly sent, well packed. Will buy again. Now it&#x27;s my must have )</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. It has all day staying power and never smudges. It is also very easy to remove with water.</li>
            <li> This is GREAT mascara.  IF you get a tube that isn&#x27;t totally dried out, like I just received.  Now I have to spend my time and money returning the package to the UPS store because they lack quality control.  This isn&#x27;t the first time this has happened either.  Find a better product distributed by a reputable company.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! No &amp;#34;coon eyes&amp;#34; at the end of the day. But dryer than that I bought at Nordstroms and didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface this my purpose for buying this mascara.  I wanted something easy to remove, that wouldn&#x27;t smudge or flake.  This is the ticket.  It is easy to apply, comes off with water in little tubes and has never smudged or flaked (even after a night&#x27;s sleep).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reasons I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars were: cost and effect.  $30 is a lot to pay for mascara.  I realize that it pays for a unique technology, but it is still a lot to pay for mascara.  This does not give me the natural look I like.  My lashes look spikey.  For a more dramatic look achieved with more than one application, this mascara would not be the go-to.  It dries quickly after applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great product for a specfic purpose.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes, and it is the ONLY one I have ever tried that does not end up under my eyes by the end of the day</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. Not only does it stay put during the day but it is easy to remove at night. How do they do that? I don&#x27;t know but it is great!</li>
            <li> One of the top eye lashes</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like it at all... it makes my straight lashes much more straighter, even after curling with curler...and there is no volume at all!!!! im very disappointed... :[[[</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this mascara!  I have little stubby eyelashes and this really helps to extend my eyelashes a bit.  I have tried a few others too (i.e. Lancome), but this one works best for me.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It can be removed with water and doesn&#x27;t smudge. It also give my very straight eyelashes a natural curl.</li>
            <li> This mascara was recommended to me by make-up artist. Although expensive, the mascara is definitely worth the money: simple brush (no fancy messy puffs), the material goes on each eyelash, separately, and does not come off even in the rain. But, at the same time, you can wash it off with just warm water -- it comes off in tiny tubes, does not sting the eyes, does not require extra chemicals under, over it, or for washing it off. You can use little for \\&quot;no make-up\\&quot; look, or add some more -- and it looks great for the evening. If you are looking for really heavy velvety eye lashes, this mascara may not be \\&quot;it\\&quot;.</li>
