            <li>I am fairly light and the tint doesn&#x27;t even show up.</li>
            <li>Smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>It makes a smooth surface that can stand alone as well .</li>
            <li>I buy this product for my wife, she loves this stuff because it has a tint to it and goes on silky smooth, she has been using it for years and won&#x27;t try anything else.  </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s tinted but not too much like foundation.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen tinted foundation for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is the shade of tint is just a tad to dark for me and can be streaky if not blended in really well.</li>
            <li> so it lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is my third tube of product in the past 2 yrs.</li>
            <li> besides all the other solar protectors I have tried have clogged my pores and get my face extremely oily...</li>
            <li> I Have given up all my other makeup for this product.</li>
            <li> I see improvement with my face, dark spots fading.</li>
            <li> but its tint is a bit dark for me.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased this for the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> It has a slight tint and a matte finish that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> So I touch my face less, have less breakouts and the tint gives a finish look that minimizes the need for make up.</li>
            <li> The color is a bit dark for my complexion, and it dried my skin out a little.</li>
            <li> This and a little powder is all I use now.</li>
            <li> The proof will be during summer use which is a few months away.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I ordered and had it at my door in just a few days!  </li>
            <li> I was recommended this product as a matte sunscreen that is also a makeup base.</li>
            <li> Had to go without, which made an unhappy girl!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best product that I have used for my face. I used to always burn on my face. With this product, I rarely have a sunburn even after all day sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I like this coverage.  It feels real silky going on and lasts throughout the day. I will most likely stay with this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is great for protecting and blending redness on post laser skin.  It feels very light.  I do have fair skin and the tint works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It feels good on your skin and it is perfect for the beach or tropical vacation when you don&#x27;t want to wear makeup.  There is a nice tint to it so it almost feels like the benefit of wearing foundation and gives you a nice glow while not feeling heavy or anything like makeup.  I took it on a trip to Antigua to try it out and was really happy with it but I also live in southern California so I&#x27;ve continued to used it for beach days.  This will be a routine purchase for me as I run out.</li>
            <li> My favorite and a good price.</li>
            <li> Tizo was recommended to me by a dermatologist about 8 years ago. I have been using it ever since. It is lightly tinted and easily blends right into your skin. I have tried other similar formulas, but this is the best.</li>
            <li> This is the best tinted sunscreen on the market. I previously purchased this for the doctor&#x27;s office. Getting the product through Amazon is a lot easier.</li>
            <li> Goes on amazingly smooth and doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy at all. Also doesn&#x27;t make me breakout. Only negative is the shade of tint is just a tad to dark for me and can be streaky if not blended in really well. But once blended, the tint essentially goes away.</li>
            <li> Been using for a couple years.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is my third tube of product in the past 2 yrs. It lasts such a long time and does exactly what is should! Blends with any type of skin. I have olive skin and my daughter has light, pink skin. We both used it on vacation and could not even tell we were wearing the same thing! My dermatologists recommended and I&#x27;m so glad she did. I don&#x27;t leave the house without it now.....</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product!  I have sensitive skin and almost everything breaks me out.  I use this as sunscreen as well as foundation.  It feels like silk!  I ordered and had it at my door in just a few days!  Terrific customer service!  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Im using this product since 2013 and for me it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen tinted foundation for a long time.  It is utterly weightless on your face and has just the right amount of tint to give you some color without looking washed out.  I am in my mid 60&#x27;s.  Feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> Excelente protection crean</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery happy with product</li>
            <li> My husband loves this for his rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this because it glides on smooth, and is a great first layer to wear under my make up.</li>
            <li> Great product - have used for about a year now, this is my third re-order.</li>
            <li> Goes on like velvet. Feels great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen  for about 6 months already and i like it.  It has a silky texture which makes it easy to spread. It has a soft color on it, but I like it because even up my skin. In general is the best I have found in the market.</li>
            <li> Fabulous skin care product. It feels like silk when applying to face, and it works well to protect one&#x27;s skin from harmful solar rays. It lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist/nurse practitioner post Fraxel laser. I like that it is tinted. I am more likely not to forget it.</li>
            <li> Excellent sun protection, with a silky light coverage that I far prefer to a heavy-based tell her.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on really well and is very smooth. The color is a bit dark for my complexion, and it dried my skin out a little.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years,  I love it!!</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product.  It is tinted so you are not covered in white cream....but when it goes on.....that is the best part.  It is like a baby powder when it dries...silky, soft .... and it works.  I run a lot and use this product and it does not come off with my sweat.....</li>
            <li> Recommended by my derm.  This is silky, doesn&#x27;t leave a ghost-like cast, doesn&#x27;t leave a shine.  it&#x27;s tinted but not too much like foundation.  I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens over the years and this is it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Creates a great barrier to the sun.</li>
            <li> Covers well and easy to blend. My favorite !!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen so much.  It has a slight tint which is great if you don&#x27;t want to wear makeup and it is water resistant.  I am prone to breakouts and this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.  My dermatologist recommended it 2 years ago and I always buy this one.</li>
            <li> Have been using these since December 2012. I was not sure It would give me good protection, besides all the other solar protectors I have tried have clogged my pores and get my face extremely oily... not matter if they were oil free or made to acne prone skin, they did not work. But this one has. It does not give you a shine face, does not clog your pores, the tinted moisturizer gives you a fair-good coverage, use a good loose powder on top and it will look like you are wearing makeup. Great for everyday!! I&#x27;m sure this will be part of my life from now on. THANK YOU TIZO 3!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent seller 100% Recommended</li>
            <li> I love this sunblock. Provides a smooth finish and great sun protection.</li>
            <li> I Have given up all my other makeup for this product. This and a little powder is all I use now. Love it!</li>
            <li> Its amazing!! Very soft, non-greasy , and great sun protection. Very water resistant perfect for the beach and other activities.&lt;br /&gt;Also looks very natural and the skin glows.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Feels like silk and gives great protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist so I bought it here on Amazon as it was cheaper than in the Dr.&#x27;s office.  It is still a bit pricy but worth it. The product is wonderful - very lightweight and goes on easily. I am able to use it alone or under makeup. I am fairly light and the tint doesn&#x27;t even show up. I use it daily now and it protects very well - but it is winter. The proof will be during summer use which is a few months away.  4 stars for the winter sun coverage.  Hope it becomes a 5 star in summer use.</li>
            <li> This is the best on the market! I use it everyday under my makeup. You don&#x27;t even know&lt;br /&gt;you have it on.</li>
            <li> I love the product. I have been using it for 3 years.</li>
            <li> I am a fan.  This product agrees with my skin, it just works well. I live in a very hot, very sunny climate and this Tizo was initially recommended by my dermatologist.  Been a big fan ever since.</li>
            <li> Tinted, blends in well with skin color.  Smooth texture.  Doesn&#x27;t sweat off when exercising.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen. Also makes makeup go on super smooth. Seems pricy but you only have to use a tiny bit daily so it lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Great stuff wife loves it</li>
            <li> This product meets my expectations. I see improvement with my face, dark spots fading. It arrived on time in a tamper-proof package.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I use it every day over moisturizer and under my foundation. It makes a smooth surface that can stand alone as well . Not heavy or obvious. Best of all is no sun burning.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product as a matte sunscreen that is also a makeup base. I texture seems fine but its tint is a bit dark for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Excellent Purchase - Product was as described and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> By far the best sunblock protection I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a slight tint and a matte finish that lasts all day. Given the fact that I have oily skin, with this mineral sunblock, i never have to blot my face because even though it gets oily, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; oily or shiny. So I touch my face less, have less breakouts and the tint gives a finish look that minimizes the need for make up. In fact, I can&#x27;t remember the last time I used foundation or a powder!</li>
            <li> Little pricey but smooth texture and nice feel. Last tube lasted quite a while.</li>
            <li> almost works like a foundation, eliminates oily appearance of the skin, evens tone out and happens to be a sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I buy this product for my wife, she loves this stuff because it has a tint to it and goes on silky smooth, she has been using it for years and won&#x27;t try anything else.  The only problem I have with it is the cost, but happy wife, happy life.</li>
            <li> Great product, I upgraded my shipping since I wanted to take with me on trip. Well, it didn&#x27;t get to me when it was supposed to. Had to go without, which made an unhappy girl!! Just know can&#x27;t count on the shipping promises.</li>
