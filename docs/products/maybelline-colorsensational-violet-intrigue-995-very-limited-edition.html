            <li>Kind of a shimmery finish.</li>
            <li>Packaging was very good and the delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li>i loved it , it sort of a light purple and its creamy , i recommend this product</li>
            <li>Color is very light...</li>
            <li>I gave this product five stars because I love the color.</li>
            <li>I did think it would have been more brighter though.</li>
            <li>Overall a good lipstick and great seller.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the arrival time and product</li>

            <li>I love this color</li>
            <li>You have to apply it too many times to get the color.</li>
            <li>I AM GLAD THEY PUT IN PLASTIC</li>
            <li>Found out about this through a make-up bloggers YouTube tutorial and so glad I did.</li>

            <li>I love this item arrive very quickly</li>
            <li>The color and quality is good but it smelled a bit like chemicals and wasn&#x27;t pleasantly scented as other Maybelline lipsticks.</li>
            <li>You will need to layer on a lot to get a fairly strong chroma/pigment.</li>
            <li>makes me look so different and beautiful</li>
            <li>Overall, both lipsticks are great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting &amp;#34;Violet Intrigue&amp;#34; for a while now, so happy I finally got it.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s all I expected and more, the color is beyond gorgeous:</li>

            <li>I love this lipstick so much that I brought 6 because u can&#x27;t find in the store</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy to have gotten this to add to my other additions.</li>

            <li>quick delivery</li>
            <li>Very pretty shade-</li>
            <li>but overall its a nice color</li>
            <li>I very much recommend it to anyone who likes bold colors on their lips</li>
            <li>But overall very pretty :)</li>
            <li>Fairly creamy in consistency, finish is opaque with a slight sheen.</li>
            <li>Also it came very fast.</li>
            <li>I think this is a pretty close dupe for MAC&#x27;s heroine.</li>
            <li>This is a really pretty color</li>

            <li>Very inexpensive compared to Mac prices!</li>

            <li>Good lipstick, I thought it was a dupe for mac&#x27;s heroine, but it&#x27;s really just a slightly similar shade of purple, not a real dupe but still a pretty colour</li>
            <li>Expected more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s straight up purple.</li>
            <li>CLICK ON THE PHOTO FOR THE REAL COLOR*****....</li>
            <li>Much darker than I wanted.</li>
            <li>Really creamy.  </li>

            <li>I love how this color pops on my dark complexion.  </li>
            <li>Such a pretty color</li>

            <li>I agree with the other reviewer  the item look purple not fushia, however, it&#x27;s a pretty color.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly last a long time and very affordable,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap for a drugstore product, but it&#x27;s sooo worth</li>

            <li> I would recommend this color to any dark skinned African American woman.  </li>

            <li> color is darker than expected and have to apply several layers to so</li>
            <li> that it was limited</li>
            <li> Just a shame it is Limited Edition.</li>
            <li> The picture has a pink / purple look to it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no shimmer...</li>
            <li> but its kinda not was I expected.</li>
            <li> Not really I&#x27;ll just have to buy the real thing and suck it up and spend the $15 nothing wrong with this lipstick tho</li>
            <li> not worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered another purple lipstick from Milani for $5 that is nicer color purple its lighter and not as a dark gothic purple as I thought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark skin</li>
            <li> I add some lipliner and a little concealer before I apply this color</li>
            <li> It lays streaky and the color is not accurate to what&#x27;s shown online.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> beautiful color, great purple for fall</li>
            <li> Color is very light... almost like lipgloss...not worth it.</li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty close dupe for MAC&#x27;s heroine. Love the creamy cyber purple -- really makes other colors pop (like orange, as you can see!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency was nice. It&#x27;s creamy with just a bit of shine, and non-drying. I definitely recommend a lip liner though.</li>
            <li> I gave this product five stars because I love the color. It looks great on too!</li>
            <li> This purple is great üòç</li>
            <li> Was supposed to be a gift but I had to try it, so guess it is staying. I lick my lips a lot so lipstick doesn&#x27;t stay around for long anyway.  I understand I should us lipliner.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Goes on smoothly last a long time and very affordable,</li>
            <li> I thought the color was more vibrant but I still like it!!!</li>
            <li> Not too impressed with the coverage of this lipstick. It lays streaky and the color is not accurate to what&#x27;s shown online. Expected more.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color goes on real nice  I love this item arrive very quickly</li>
            <li> makes me look so different and beautiful so everybody tells me</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty color but it doesn&#x27;t look like the color pictured in my opinion. It&#x27;s straight up purple. The picture has a pink / purple look to it.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous purple!  I did think it would have been more brighter though. But overall very pretty :)</li>
            <li> Great color! Fast shipping! Perfect sheen dupe to Mac heroine lipstick! Very inexpensive compared to Mac prices! Would definitely recommend to others</li>
            <li> If you like purple or orchid colors you will like this color.  Great price making this lipstick a good value</li>
            <li> The color and quality is good but it smelled a bit like chemicals and wasn&#x27;t pleasantly scented as other Maybelline lipsticks. Overall a good lipstick and great seller.</li>
            <li> Product good....quick delivery</li>
            <li> Such a pretty color and I&#x27;m so glad I found it!! I will purchase another 3 to give as gifts!</li>
            <li> You will need to layer on a lot to get a fairly strong chroma/pigment. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great drug store lipstick :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a bolder purple color. I have to layer on a lot to see any hint of purple.  Packaging was very good and the delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the arrival time and product it&#x27;s beautiful!! It&#x27;s a great dupe to macs heroine only difference is that it&#x27;s a cream finish and not matte</li>
            <li> Have looked for this color for ages,  Just what I wanted. Brand name prompted me to try without seeing,just by look on &#x27;puter.!!!</li>
            <li> I love how this color pops on my dark complexion.  I would recommend this color to any dark skinned African American woman.  I add some lipliner and a little concealer before I apply this color and it last all day if I don&#x27;t eat or drink.  When I do eat or drink I only have to reapply once throughout my work day.  I received a lot of compliments on the color as well.</li>
            <li> Not even close to the photo...Absolutely no shimmer... The photo is so off... I Love maybelline Lipsticks for the reasonable price and great colors but this photo is not even close to the actual color..**** THE PHOTO HAS BEEN UPDATED...CLICK ON THE PHOTO FOR THE REAL COLOR*****....That is the correct color...Not one I would have purchased.</li>
            <li> Pretty but not the color I was hoping for. Much darker than I wanted.</li>
            <li> one of y favorite lipsticks i have in my collection</li>

            <li> Really like this color, it&#x27;s very nice with blues and purples, Thanks.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer  the item look purple not fushia, however, it&#x27;s a pretty color. It remind me of 521 purple flame by Posner.  I think it&#x27;s a pretty Fall color.</li>
            <li> Bought this BC ppl said it was a Mac (heroin) dupe. Not really I&#x27;ll just have to buy the real thing and suck it up and spend the $15 nothing wrong with this lipstick tho but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is a great color but a tad bit darker of a purple color than I expected. I ordered another purple lipstick from Milani for $5 that is nicer color purple its lighter and not as a dark gothic purple as I thought. Overall, both lipsticks are great but I prefer Milani.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick so much that I brought 6 because u can&#x27;t find in the store bein that it was limited edition I&#x27;m dark skin and it look so good on me</li>
            <li> Was packaged well and the color looks great. Also it came very fast. I am a milk chocolate complextion and it looks very nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very happy because this color is very, very, very beautiful, i love the color, in my opinion is PERFECT and unique. fast delivery and excellent seller.</li>
            <li> I love this color it&#x27;s so gorgeous it&#x27;s a creamy finish and it puts you in the mind of mac&#x27;s violetta it&#x27;s so pretty and I&#x27;m so happy to have gotten this to add to my other additions.</li>
            <li> Bought it for as a gift for my mother and she loves it! the color is a beautiful velvety purple.... and soooo lovely!</li>
            <li> Good lipstick, I thought it was a dupe for mac&#x27;s heroine, but it&#x27;s really just a slightly similar shade of purple, not a real dupe but still a pretty colour</li>
            <li> Really creamy.  You have to apply it too many times to get the color. The color is exactly as the picture one. I gave it 3 stars because I feel it cames used</li>
            <li> FEELS GOOD ON MY LIPS. WOULD BUY AGAIN. I AM GLAD THEY PUT IN PLASTIC BAGGY WITH THE STICKER ON THE BAG,NOT ON THE LIPSTICK TUBE. THANK YOU!!!!</li>
            <li> This lip color is perfect and i got it a day after i ordered it. I very much recommend it to anyone who likes bold colors on their lips</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! Fairly creamy in consistency, finish is opaque with a slight sheen. Found out about this through a make-up bloggers YouTube tutorial and so glad I did. Just a shame it is Limited Edition. Must stock up!</li>
            <li> Very pretty shade- this will definitely be one of my staples.</li>
            <li> I love the color. Purple is my favorite color. but its kinda not was I expected. Kind of a shimmery finish. Was expecting a matte finish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting &amp;#34;Violet Intrigue&amp;#34; for a while now, so happy I finally got it. It&#x27;s all I expected and more, the color is beyond gorgeous: violet indeed, just like the picture.It&#x27;s not cheap for a drugstore product, but it&#x27;s sooo worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on creamy but it stays put, doesn&#x27;t feather. Also lots of pigment, I don&#x27;t need to apply several layers to achieve the color.&lt;br /&gt;Most excellent. I only need the &amp;#34;Lavender Voltage&amp;#34; now and I&#x27;m all set with violets for a while....they&#x27;re so trendy these days!</li>
            <li> lip stick was old and sticky</li>
            <li> I love the color, my second time ordering</li>
            <li> color is darker than expected and have to apply several layers to so but overall its a nice color</li>
            <li> Perfect color for fall. I love maybelline lipsticks.</li>
