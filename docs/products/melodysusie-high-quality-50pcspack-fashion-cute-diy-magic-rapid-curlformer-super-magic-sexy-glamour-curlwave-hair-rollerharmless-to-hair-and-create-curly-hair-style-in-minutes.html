            <li>Really love this product.  </li>
            <li>It works after you get the hang of it, lovely curls.</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments</li>
            <li>and this is the perfect item for when I want to wear my hair differently and don&#x27;t want to use heat to press it out.</li>
            <li>They come out so so cute.</li>
            <li>and i have had them for more than 6 months with no problems</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Love these rollers.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>so I am thinking of buying the slim metal one at Sally&#x27;s for more comfort.</li>
            <li>Great for those who are transitioning from relaxed to natural hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need 50 but 30 or 25 would work.stick breaks easy.</li>
            <li>breaks easy.</li>
            <li>Yes, a knockoff from better curlers and best curlers ever are the familair Velcro round curlers.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how good these worked without any heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my niece told me about them and from the very first time we used them she was able to sleep with them in</li>
            <li>She puts them in at night and has HUGE curls in the morning.  </li>
            <li>They did such a great job.</li>
            <li>but I am overall happy with these.</li>
            <li>They are a pain to sleep in but worth in the morning!</li>
            <li>I never tried the original curlformers from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply</li>
            <li>Until this product came along, the best chance I had for any kind of curl or body, was to tie it up in a tight braid after a towel dry from the shower before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>the best one only lasted 2 weeks, even following all the rules just like you&#x27;re supposed to in order to maintain the curl.  </li>
            <li>They really are very easy to install and didn&#x27;t take much time at all.</li>
            <li>Very high quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Still had great smooth thick ringlets.  </li>
            <li>Was definitely worth it for me to get these</li>
            <li>I love how easy the product is to use and it beats a traditional roller set as far as time and usage but the curls only last 3 days at best</li>
            <li>Only positive is that once you finally get them in your hair after much frustration is that you will receive nice curls but don&#x27;t stay in hair unless you use a good quality organic spray.</li>
            <li>They would be difficult to fit under a portable bonnet hair drier, but that would be ideal and a quick set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pros: shipped in great timing, had terrific, bouncy curls left as a result to the use of these, and was way cheaper than the originals at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I tested these out on my 5 year old daughter and she slept just fine them overnight</li>
            <li>My granddaughter is in love with these, such good curls and so little difficulty putting them in and sleeping on them.</li>
            <li>Wand should have a better, larger hook to grab hair so it won&#x27;t pull hair.</li>
            <li>The curl formers are exactly what they claim to be and they were just what my hair was in need of.</li>
            <li>They definitely work better than flexirods.</li>
            <li>It is exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li>But overall gives me more independence to do my hair .</li>
            <li>They came in when they say they would but it was missing the hook which is the most important piece.</li>
            <li>Great product for African American natural hair.</li>
            <li>I may have to get some layers cut into my hair as the top was so long, over 24 inches</li>
            <li>They actually lasted 2 full days!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m most of the way to dry.  </li>
            <li>or when ever you have several hours a free time.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair curl up too much.</li>
            <li>Pulls hair too much.</li>
            <li>and I really can not tell a difference.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair.  </li>
            <li>That would result in a light wave that might last me through the day.  </li>
            <li>my whole head is wrapped up in these</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready for drying time.  </li>
            <li>These work really really well.</li>
            <li>and they do work really well.</li>
            <li>lots of compliments from the other moms :-)</li>
            <li>High quality for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The curlers are kind of hard to sleep in.</li>
            <li>The curlers are kind of hard to sleep in.</li>
            <li>Then my cousin told me about this product, it seemed easy enough and it worked on the same principle as my braids.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product because heat curls don&#x27;t last long in my hair and these last me 3 days</li>
            <li>I liked the product because heat curls don&#x27;t last long in my hair and these last me 3 days</li>
            <li>It came with to long black hooks for grabbing the hair which is nice.</li>
            <li>The outcome was exactly the same from both.</li>
            <li>They are very simple to use once you get the hang of it and work exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I have used this product several times, especially for special engagements.</li>
            <li>My hair stayed curly all day and was so soft.</li>
            <li>I have used them twice so far and each time my hair received rave reviews.</li>
            <li>My daughter has natural hair with a kinky curly texture and was looking for something to stretch it out without using heat.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/kinky hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are not super comfortable to sleep in, especially if you clip them close to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Need more than two hands for holding hook with curler on and trying to grab your hair without pulling is very difficult and takes quite a bit of time, too tedious to use needing more than the hands you have better to have friend do it</li>
            <li>These curlers dry evenly and fairly fast.  </li>
            <li>It does take quite a few rollers to do the whole head, as you can&#x27;t put too much hair in at once.  </li>
            <li>I have a small pack of the original Curlformers from Sally</li>
            <li>I emailed them stating that the hook was missing and they emailed back pretty much saying that they don&#x27;t sale the hooks alone</li>
            <li>It only takes a few tries to learn the technique and then it is a pretty quick process.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a curly hair girl, into the no heat natural method, so I decided to give these a try for a different look.</li>
            <li>I could barely understand it.</li>
            <li>They can be a bit uncomfortable to sleep on though, you have to find that sweet spot between pulling at the root, noise right next to your ear, or the stiffness up against your face.  </li>
            <li>I use this product for my natural textured hair or my flat ironed hair and it works very well on either wet or damp to dry hair</li>
            <li>Once you find the compromise though, it&#x27;s not so bad, especially when the next morning, you get to pull them out, and like magic you have these lovely little ringlets.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I finally have a reusable option, for just a little bit of fuss and the price of what a perm costs (or at least what it cost when I was a kid).</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I finally have a reusable option, for just a little bit of fuss and the price of what a perm costs (or at least what it cost when I was a kid).</li>

            <li> These are the best curlers I have ever used! They did such a great job. My hair stayed curly all day and was so soft. Love them!</li>
            <li> These wavers are a great option for longer hair.  I used to use wet curlers, but my long hair took too long to dry.  These curlers dry evenly and fairly fast.  I never have to worry about a wet spot in the middle of my rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are not super comfortable to sleep in, especially if you clip them close to the scalp.  Any movement of the curler causes a pull of the hair.  But, if you set the former lower, with a few inches loose hair next to the scalp, it is much easier to sleep in them.  They would be difficult to fit under a portable bonnet hair drier, but that would be ideal and a quick set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service from this seller was great!</li>
            <li> Great product for African American natural hair. I have used this product several times, especially for special engagements. Purchase if you want nice curly hair</li>
            <li> I was really worried they might not work since they are generic, but I was shocked to see the curls on my daughter! They actually lasted 2 full days! I allowed her to skip shampoo one day to see if the curls would stay and they did! Great product, Great price.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 8 year little girl her hair is down to her hips I have arthritis so its had for me to use regular curlers my niece told me about them and from the very first time we used them she was able to sleep with them in and she got the CURLS she wanted. Love them very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need 50 but 30 or 25 would work.stick breaks easy. The curls are safe and health. The curlers are kind of hard to sleep in. I liked the product because heat curls don&#x27;t last long in my hair and these last me 3 days but of course they fall a little bit at a time. I use these all the time. breaks easy. The curls are safe and health. The curlers are kind of hard to sleep in. I liked the product because heat curls don&#x27;t last long in my hair and these last me 3 days but of course they fall a little bit at a time. I use these all the time.</li>
            <li> I like these. They tug at my hair a little but its otherwise alright. They make really nice curls too i loved it.</li>
            <li> Awesome. ..from the time I received my package to the finished product.  I was very surprised at how good these worked without any heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are uncomfortable to sleep in but sometimes you just have to suck it up. I have used them twice so far and each time my hair received rave reviews.</li>
            <li> Put them in with my Hair slightly damp while watching TV. Used about thirty curlers. I would recommend using fewer curlers and slightly larger sections of hair. I tried to sleep on them.  Would not recommend that.  I had to take them out after about an hour or two.  Still had great smooth thick ringlets.  I suggest doing it up Saturday morning or when ever you have several hours a free time.  Really love this product.  I may have to get some layers cut into my hair as the top was so long, over 24 inches, that several inches stuck out and I had to pull the curlers down a little to complete the cure at the end.</li>
            <li> These curlformers are awesome. Do pay attention to how they are installed in your hair. They come half clockwise/counter clockwise. Great for those who are transitioning from relaxed to natural hair. Also a great alternative for drying your hair without heat. I do want to add that they are uncomfortable to sleep in, so sitting under a hooded dryer with these is another option.</li>
            <li> Wife love when, very easy to use</li>
            <li> These are a great substitute for the brand named CurlFormers.  High quality for a fraction of the price.  The quality of these curlers surpassed my expectations!</li>
            <li> Low rating because difficult to work with, not flexible curlers at all some curlers defective webbing flaws, wand comes in two pieces, always falls off while trying to curl hair also flimsy plastic, had to glue pieces together to keep coming apart. Thought curlers were different sizes, nope only one size though two different colors in package, usually two different colors are two different sizes,  you would have to purchase others, rather pricey. Wand should have a better, larger hook to grab hair so it won&#x27;t pull hair. Best be sure to twist hair first before apply on hook otherwise..&amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34;. Need more than two hands for holding hook with curler on and trying to grab your hair without pulling is very difficult and takes quite a bit of time, too tedious to use needing more than the hands you have better to have friend do it Yes, a knockoff from better curlers and best curlers ever are the familair Velcro round curlers. These curlers I bought must be wrapped around finger first otherwise impossible to attach, find yourself very frustrated in the process. I would not buy these again. Only positive is that once you finally get them in your hair after much frustration is that you will receive nice curls but don&#x27;t stay in hair unless you use a good quality organic spray.</li>
            <li> They arrived well before the scheduled arrival date and did not disappoint. The curl formers are exactly what they claim to be and they were just what my hair was in need of. They definitely work better than flexirods.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is in love with these, such good curls and so little difficulty putting them in and sleeping on them.</li>
            <li> It works after you get the hang of it, lovely curls. No heat required which is nice. It just doesn&#x27;t take any less time to do. Look up some YouTube videos to help you out!</li>
            <li> It is exactly how it was described. Once I learned how to use them, I got great results.</li>
            <li> Makes hair curl up too much. Can not comb it. Pulls hair too much. Not good for long hair or short hair at all.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> you have to try it a couple of times but when you get the technique, then you are good to go&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it is a DIY&lt;br /&gt;forms very lovely curls, just dampen the hair a bit and voom!</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to purchase the Curlformers kit but never did because of the price. My daughter has natural hair with a kinky curly texture and was looking for something to stretch it out without using heat. These worked perfectly, plus I received 50 of them for a great price. I have a small pack of the original Curlformers from Sally and I really can not tell a difference. The outcome was exactly the same from both. It made perfect Shirley Temple like curls. People thought I got her hair pressed. They were amazed when I told her what I used. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a curly hair girl, into the no heat natural method, so I decided to give these a try for a different look. I absolutely loved the outcome. I watched a couple of YouTube videos to learn how to use them and voila, I was an instant pro. They really are very easy to install and didn&#x27;t take much time at all. I received so many compliments n even inspired a couple of my friends to purchase their own set!</li>
            <li> I have straight hair.  Long, soft, thin, can&#x27;t do anything with it hair.  As a kid I had every type of perm you could think of and the best one only lasted 2 weeks, even following all the rules just like you&#x27;re supposed to in order to maintain the curl.  Curling irons are time consuming and again, on me (no matter what type of holding product I try) don&#x27;t hold.  Blow Dryer, I don&#x27;t bother with that either, because all i usually need is a towel for 20 minutes and I&#x27;m most of the way to dry.  Until this product came along, the best chance I had for any kind of curl or body, was to tie it up in a tight braid after a towel dry from the shower before going to bed.  That would result in a light wave that might last me through the day.  Then my cousin told me about this product, it seemed easy enough and it worked on the same principle as my braids.  Wash, comb through, and maybe 20 minutes of patience...my whole head is wrapped up in these and I&#x27;m ready for drying time.  I find it best to sleep on them. They can be a bit uncomfortable to sleep on though, you have to find that sweet spot between pulling at the root, noise right next to your ear, or the stiffness up against your face.  Once you find the compromise though, it&#x27;s not so bad, especially when the next morning, you get to pull them out, and like magic you have these lovely little ringlets.  I will brush them out at the crown just enough to put into a barrette, and they last me all day.  Was definitely worth it for me to get these and I&#x27;m glad I finally have a reusable option, for just a little bit of fuss and the price of what a perm costs (or at least what it cost when I was a kid).</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/kinky hair and this is the perfect item for when I want to wear my hair differently and don&#x27;t want to use heat to press it out. They come out so so cute. They are a pain to sleep in but worth in the morning! These work really really well.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve involved in getting the knack of using the rollers, but the results are simply beautiful.</li>
            <li> Works just like the name brand and i have had them for more than 6 months with no problems</li>
            <li> I love how easy the product is to use and it beats a traditional roller set as far as time and usage but the curls only last 3 days at best but that might be because I still have relaxed ends ? But overall gives me more independence to do my hair .</li>
            <li> Works great!! Just need a little setting lotion for longer lasting curls! I received several compliments on my hair style!!</li>
            <li> I loved the curls that the Curl Formers make. But they are horrible to sleep in and I have to sleep in them so that my hair would be completely dried. I have not tried to used they by myself. My daughter put them in my  hair for me. The are uncomfortable even when you are not trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> I love these. So happy they offer them at a lower price than the name brand. They are very simple to use once you get the hang of it and work exactly as described. I get the same result as the name brand. I suggest getting the longer ones even if you have mid-length hair, esp if you are growing your hair out.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers.  It only takes a few tries to learn the technique and then it is a pretty quick process.  It does take quite a few rollers to do the whole head, as you can&#x27;t put too much hair in at once.  Keep that in mind when ordering.</li>
            <li> They came in when they say they would but it was missing the hook which is the most important piece. I emailed them stating that the hook was missing and they emailed back pretty much saying that they don&#x27;t sale the hooks alone and they were in the package and there was nothing they can do. Also the email was incoherent I could barely understand it. I did keep the Curlformers because I can get the hook elsewhere and they do work really well.</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES these!  She puts them in at night and has HUGE curls in the morning.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t use any heat to set them and it&#x27;s healthier for her hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works great on my 4b type hair. It even curled my braids. Really great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I tested these out on my 5 year old daughter and she slept just fine them overnight (it took 15 curlformers for her hair) I never tried the original curlformers from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply but I am overall happy with these. It came with to long black hooks for grabbing the hair which is nice. However, hook did snag hair a couple of times when I was applying these (it is thick and plastic) so I am thinking of buying the slim metal one at Sally&#x27;s for more comfort.</li>
            <li> Made excellent curls for my daughter&#x27;s baton competition... lots of compliments from the other moms :-) They all wanted to know where we got them and how they worked.</li>
            <li> This is the knock off brand of curlformers. Pros: shipped in great timing, had terrific, bouncy curls left as a result to the use of these, and was way cheaper than the originals at Sally&#x27;s. Con: they are harder to apply (less flexible) than the originals or other knock off brands which makes it more difficult to apply and can lead to tugging or pulling on the hair. Also there were rips in the weaving of some of them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the curlformers work so I can&#x27;t speak comparatively. I like these a lot, They worked how they claimed, I did get a bit of hair pulling but I will see if it was operator error.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my natural textured hair or my flat ironed hair and it works very well on either wet or damp to dry hair</li>
