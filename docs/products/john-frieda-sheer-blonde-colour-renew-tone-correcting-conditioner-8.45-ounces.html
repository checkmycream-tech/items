    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The John Frieda line of products are perfect for blondes with color treated hair.</li>
            <li>Goes perfect with using the John Frieda tone correcting shampoo.  </li>
            <li>All John Freida products for blondes are excellent, I use them all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not the best conditioner I have used in terms of restoring moisture and strength to me damaged hair, however I am noticing a difference for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
            <li>Love them!!!</li>
            <li>This product was great...</li>
            <li>Really really happy...</li>
            <li>Works great at getting rid of bassiness.</li>
            <li>Great product to help color correct graying hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great Product.&lt;br /&gt;Works great for my highlights.&lt;br /&gt;Compares to salon products and is great for my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but I don&#x27;t like the way it leaves my hair feeling</li>
            <li>I will buy this again when I need it as it is nice to shampoo and condition the brassyness away!</li>
            <li>works great and has a wonderful fresh smell!</li>
            <li>John Frieda products are always good products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sheer Blond is really good to hide that effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The good news is that it did NOT make my  hair purple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over a year that I&#x27;ve done my highlights and every now and then, I&#x27;d get compliments on how my hair looks great and healthy.</li>
            <li>Love Amazon, and am a walking advertisement for them and prime!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Even without the purple color, this is a nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also perfect on my natural color hair.</li>
            <li>But it was easy to find on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Love the color glaze too-</li>
            <li>This is the only place I could find it and great price!!!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo + conditioner.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>OK for conditioning hair alone as a conditioner.</li>
            <li>should be way more purple in color to be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I love John Frieda products.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t justify paying more just to tone and maintain it.  </li>
            <li>Paying $150 for ombre and having it last for over a year is very good investment in my book! &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I love all their products</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazing deal, fast shipping, great company.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my white/gray hair look.</li>
            <li>And at a much better price than the online beauty specialty stores.</li>
            <li>After a couple uses this corrected the problem :)</li>
            <li>After becoming blond I discovered that I am one of the many for whom their hair will turn progressively orange, from the day it is colored.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, leaves my hair soft until I wring it out....</li>
            <li>It does keep my highlighted hair shiny and bright, and it also makes my hair really soft and easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li>There is nowhere in my little town that sells this, plus it was a good deal money wise.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair bright and shiny as well as frizz free and soft.</li>
            <li>The John Frieda conditioner has a light lavender scent.</li>
            <li>but it make my hair smooth and shinny</li>
            <li>I have those glorious champagne highlights on a light blond not a brassy blond.  </li>
            <li>and I use it generously, lightly scrub a shower wall, then rinse.  </li>
            <li>(I use Aveda highlighter to change my hair from light brown to honey blond.</li>
            <li>Not a ton of toning, but smells nice and works as a normal conditioner</li>
            <li>This product will clean your hair but it is nothing special.</li>
            <li>after a semi permanent hair color gave reddish tones my hair, I needed help and after using it my husband commented that my hair color looked more natural and better than after the first stuff I used.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>As an extra bonus, the two pack I buy on Amazon is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>Try it - It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is such a nice affordable line for blonds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think it is worth using the Color Renewal shampoo and conditioner product together.</li>
            <li>great and much more affordable than the other blue conditioner i was using when i first colored my hair that was $28/tube.</li>
            <li>I have many lighter, natural high lights, but nothing truly platinum.)</li>
            <li>This condition works just as well as the Aveda blue malva, and it smells way better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my color at home with ION hair color and the 9N picks up more red than I would like.</li>
            <li>and my hair feels great and the blue really brings out the platinum in my blonde hair.</li>
            <li>This product has helped my hair so much!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This has a nice fragrance and left my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t if it really takes care of brassiness because I also use a purple shampoo</li>
            <li>This conditioner is gentle and maintains color.</li>
            <li>Eh, nothing really happened with my hair..</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>No noticeable difference in tone and doesn&#x27;t condition very well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The conditioner itself isn&#x27;t very conditioning, but I&#x27;ll keep using it as a &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; leave-in conditioner once a week or so to keep the brassiness at bay.</li>
            <li>It really does the job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find these special products for blondes in most stores, so I get mine from amazon.</li>
            <li>Smells different than I remembered and the package is different (new?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, for the overall product, it&#x27;s good quality.</li>
            <li>She has loved this conditioner ever since I met her and a two pack for the same price as one smaller bottle at my local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my hair more manageable and tones down the gray.</li>
            <li>So glad I found out about the John Frieda Sheer Blonde products-</li>
            <li>No tone correcting, but a decent conditioner.</li>
            <li>Apparently it was supposed to be easy to find in my local mega store or supermarket, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It  brings back that silky golden shine.</li>
            <li>using it a normal conditioner now.</li>
            <li>My color looks amazing with much less red, brassy tones!  </li>
            <li>I paired this product with the matching shampoo (see my review under Highly Recommended) and my hair color has definitely improved, however there is no way to know whether the shampoo or condition is responsible for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This just totally removes the bad tint and makes the hair look great!!</li>
            <li>clearly this shampoo and conditioner is all I needed.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo completely got rid of the brassy orange/yellow tones.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li>This conditioner will make your hair silky soft and glisten like the sun.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>like day 2, that if I use this blue based renewer and it really does get that orange out</li>
            <li>totally toned and correct my brassy blonde hair wish there was a worldwide shipping of shampoos,but its  really worth the price</li>
            <li>I have a blonde top with a dark red on my bottom half, and the combo does a great job at restoring my blonde even when some of my red bleeds into my blonde and it never damages my red (or not that i&#x27;ve noticed to date).</li>
            <li>and when I first blow dry</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any major changes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much these &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; products really help, but my hair tends to get brassy</li>
            <li>Keeps brassy yellow color out of my natural blonde/gray hair.</li>
            <li>thanks but no thanks..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a salon blonde and when my stylist recommended a toning shampoo and conditioner, I felt like I was going on a wild goose chase.</li>
            <li>Researching this I discovered it has something to do with hair being green or blue based and for most dark haired women</li>
            <li>it gets a little brassy and rusty and that isn&#x27;t very often</li>

            <li> thanks but no thanks..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a salon blonde and when my stylist recommended a toning shampoo and conditioner, I felt like I was going on a wild goose chase.</li>
            <li> Researching this I discovered it has something to do with hair being green or blue based and for most dark haired women</li>
            <li> it gets a little brassy and rusty and that isn&#x27;t very often</li>
            <li> It does keep me happier between salon visits as my new growth becomes less noticeable (or so it seems) and my blonde stays brighter.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair soft, but it can be drying due to the nature of the product.</li>
            <li> Not a major diffrence in the color</li>
            <li> The color seems slightly corrected but after a couple weeks, I prefer my old conditioner over this one.</li>
            <li> The platinum blonde made my hair very dry, and this helped keep it a lot softer.</li>
            <li> so this lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt really dry</li>
            <li> Really helps remove the brassiness due to hard water</li>
            <li> I prefer, using other product..</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the difference this product has made to my blonde hair over the few weeks I have been using it!  </li>
            <li> Usually I try to only apply conditioner to my ends.</li>
            <li> It has kept the brassy tones down which is tough to do with the super hard water I have.</li>
            <li> However it leaves my thick chemical processed hair very dry and frizzy, even using only weekly.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted naturally dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> This product helps tone it down and adds lots of moisture.</li>
            <li> The instructions read to use it a few times before you expect results.</li>
            <li> I wasted 10 dollars on this</li>
            <li> I used it together with the John Frieda Shampoo, and had no problems keeping my hair vibrant white, and it never really turned that terrible brassy color at all.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of this conditioner each time I shampoo.</li>

            <li> This product was great...a must have for not-so-natural blondes. Price and shipping were unbeatable. Shampoo completely got rid of the brassy orange/yellow tones.</li>
            <li> John Frieda products are always good products. This has a nice fragrance and left my hair very soft. I have a problem with my hair at times because I don&#x27;t take care of it like I should. This was bought as a double price and couldn&#x27;t have purchase it any cheaper! Love Amazon, and am a walking advertisement for them and prime!</li>
            <li> This product will clean your hair but it is nothing special.</li>
            <li> This condition works just as well as the Aveda blue malva, and it smells way better. The Aveda tone corrector smells like cherry cough syrup to me. The John Frieda conditioner has a light lavender scent. Plus this stuff is about a third of the price of the Aveda, depending on where you buy it. I recommend only using once or twice a week. It does make your hair soft, but it can be drying due to the nature of the product.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Makes my hair feel really soft. Don&#x27;t if it really takes care of brassiness because I also use a purple shampoo</li>
            <li> Smells great, leaves my hair soft until I wring it out....Then it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I used conditioner. The color seems slightly corrected but after a couple weeks, I prefer my old conditioner over this one.</li>
            <li> The John Frieda line of products are perfect for blondes with color treated hair. This conditioner is gentle and maintains color.</li>
            <li> This conditioner will make your hair silky soft and glisten like the sun.  Goes perfect with using the John Frieda tone correcting shampoo.  It  brings back that silky golden shine.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t color my hair for two years.&lt;br /&gt;While I was trying not to color colored part of them became very yellow because of sun.&lt;br /&gt;Sheer Blond is really good to hide that effect.&lt;br /&gt;It is also perfect on my natural color hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my color at home with ION hair color and the 9N picks up more red than I would like. This product helps tone it down and adds lots of moisture.</li>
            <li> Keeps brassy yellow color out of my natural blonde/gray hair.</li>
            <li> Not a ton of toning, but smells nice and works as a normal conditioner</li>
            <li> Not a major diffrence in the color but it make my hair smooth and shinny</li>
            <li> Eh, nothing really happened with my hair.. Ill skip this one.. seriously.. I prefer, using other product.. thanks but no thanks..</li>
            <li> works great and has a wonderful fresh smell! Love the color glaze too- this keeps the red out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely see a difference when I use this product!  Takes that yellow brassiness out of my hair.  This is the only place I could find it and great price!!! Really really happy... Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use both the shampoo and conditioner for this product. I use them as a weekly or so maintenance product to keep my blonde from turning brassy, which I hate. It does keep me happier between salon visits as my new growth becomes less noticeable (or so it seems) and my blonde stays brighter. However it leaves my thick chemical processed hair very dry and frizzy, even using only weekly. To combat the dryness I also use a deep conditioner which helps. I will buy this again when I need it as it is nice to shampoo and condition the brassyness away!</li>
            <li> Works great at getting rid of bassiness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about three weeks and my hair feels great and the blue really brings out the platinum in my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I like this. It works well with my color treated blonde hair. The only con is that it isn&#x27;t hydrating enough for my color treated hair hair. Try it - It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo + conditioner. I have a blonde top with a dark red on my bottom half, and the combo does a great job at restoring my blonde even when some of my red bleeds into my blonde and it never damages my red (or not that i&#x27;ve noticed to date). :)</li>
            <li> My hair has not improved...the brassiness is still there. Do not recommend buying. OK for conditioning hair alone as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> my color treated hair was in need of some DEEP conditioning that kept my color silvery instead of brassy. this conditioner actually did correct a brassy tinge after about a week or two of continued use.  i use this all the time with the john frieda highlight enhancing conditioner as well.  great and much more affordable than the other blue conditioner i was using when i first colored my hair that was $28/tube.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted naturally dark brown hair.  I&#x27;m not sure how much these &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; products really help, but my hair tends to get brassy and I do notice a difference when I use them.  Even without the purple color, this is a nice conditioner.</li>
            <li> totally toned and correct my brassy blonde hair wish there was a worldwide shipping of shampoos,but its  really worth the price</li>
            <li> Really helps remove the brassiness due to hard water</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.  It does keep my highlighted hair shiny and bright, and it also makes my hair really soft and easy to comb through.  As an extra bonus, the two pack I buy on Amazon is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Not really very effective at removing brassiness- should be way more purple in color to be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;Just using it a normal conditioner now.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference in tone and doesn&#x27;t condition very well. My hair felt really dry and like I didn&#x27;t use a conditioner at all.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the difference this product has made to my blonde hair over the few weeks I have been using it!  My color looks amazing with much less red, brassy tones!  I thought there was an issue with the color being used on my hair but clearly this shampoo and conditioner is all I needed.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great product to help color correct graying hair. I use a small amount of this conditioner each time I shampoo. Makes my hair more manageable and tones down the gray. I love John Frieda products.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product.&lt;br /&gt;Works great for my highlights.&lt;br /&gt;Compares to salon products and is great for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice affordable line for blonds. There is nowhere in my little town that sells this, plus it was a good deal money wise.</li>
            <li> Smells different than I remembered and the package is different (new?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, for the overall product, it&#x27;s good quality. The only problem with the conditioner is that my hair is greasy after about 15-20 hours of showering.. I would not say I have grease prone hair either, I just think it is the ingredients in the conditioner. Usually I try to only apply conditioner to my ends.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but I don&#x27;t like the way it leaves my hair feeling and my hair is dirty the next day when I can typically go 2+ days without washing/conditioning. It has kept the brassy tones down which is tough to do with the super hard water I have.</li>
            <li> After becoming blond I discovered that I am one of the many for whom their hair will turn progressively orange, from the day it is colored.  Researching this I discovered it has something to do with hair being green or blue based and for most dark haired women I guess we have what it takes to go orange, vs the medium brown who don&#x27;t have whatever it is.  The short of the matter is that if you go orange, and I do, almost immediately...like day 2, that if I use this blue based renewer and it really does get that orange out and when I first blow dry I have those glorious champagne highlights on a light blond not a brassy blond.  But, I do have to use it weekly and I use it generously, lightly scrub a shower wall, then rinse.  Shower, get rid of the orange, and 1 cleaned wall all in one shot.  Cleaning wall is for timing purposes only...you could shave your legs instead or whatever is your pleasure.</li>
            <li> The good news is that it did NOT make my  hair purple. This &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; conditioner is very sheer and only violet. I bought it to compliment a purple shampoo I bought at Walmart. The purple shampoo stripped my hair of moisture and I doubt I&#x27;ll use it again. So, I put this conditioner in my hair and left it in for 24 hours as a leave-in treatment. I didn&#x27;t see any major changes. (I use Aveda highlighter to change my hair from light brown to honey blond. I have many lighter, natural high lights, but nothing truly platinum.) The instructions read to use it a few times before you expect results. The conditioner itself isn&#x27;t very conditioning, but I&#x27;ll keep using it as a &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; leave-in conditioner once a week or so to keep the brassiness at bay. I wouldn&#x27;t expect to see any brass correction using ONLY this conditioner. And I wouldn&#x27;t leave it in my hair if I was platinum blond.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a blonde--natural or not --this product delivers. Daily use keeps my hair really blonde until my next coloring appointment.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find these special products for blondes in most stores, so I get mine from amazon. All John Freida products for blondes are excellent, I use them all.</li>
            <li> I paired this product with the matching shampoo (see my review under Highly Recommended) and my hair color has definitely improved, however there is no way to know whether the shampoo or condition is responsible for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not the best conditioner I have used in terms of restoring moisture and strength to me damaged hair, however I am noticing a difference for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it is worth using the Color Renewal shampoo and conditioner product together.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Works great!</li>
            <li> I always buy this to tone my blonde highlights.  I had my hair done with ombre blonde highlights on the ends and every now and then it needs toning.  I paid $150 for the salon to do this to my hair and it&#x27;s wonderful and I love it.  I just can&#x27;t justify paying more just to tone and maintain it.  I always buy this when I need to tone my highlights(when it gets a little brassy and rusty and that isn&#x27;t very often so this lasts a long time.  It really does the job.  It&#x27;s been over a year that I&#x27;ve done my highlights and every now and then, I&#x27;d get compliments on how my hair looks great and healthy. Did you just get highlights? etc.  I love it!  Paying $150 for ombre and having it last for over a year is very good investment in my book! &#x3D;-)Trust me.  You won&#x27;t regret buying this conditioner.  I swear by it.</li>
            <li> I use this on my silver hair.  It keeps my hair bright and shiny as well as frizz free and soft. I just recently gave a tube to my daughter as she is trying to go gray gracefully. My blond granddaughter tells me she is using it now as well. This company does not disappoint. I love all their products</li>
            <li> I used this product when I bleached my hair. The platinum blonde made my hair very dry, and this helped keep it a lot softer. I used it together with the John Frieda Shampoo, and had no problems keeping my hair vibrant white, and it never really turned that terrible brassy color at all.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my hair so much! Sometimes when coloring blonde hair it will get a brassy or even greenish or ashey tint to it. This just totally removes the bad tint and makes the hair look great!! So glad I found out about the John Frieda Sheer Blonde products- the shampoo, conditioner, and hair spray. Love them!!!</li>
            <li> I wasted 10 dollars on this and I couldve saved for the dollar store shampoo that works the same.  My hair is still red and in fact seems redder since using it...still brassy.  this stuff sucks and Im mad I got ripped off buying it.  Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> No tone correcting, but a decent conditioner.</li>
            <li> Bought this two pack for my fiance.  She has loved this conditioner ever since I met her and a two pack for the same price as one smaller bottle at my local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing deal, fast shipping, great company.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my white/gray hair look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a salon blonde and when my stylist recommended a toning shampoo and conditioner, I felt like I was going on a wild goose chase. Apparently it was supposed to be easy to find in my local mega store or supermarket, but it wasn&#x27;t. But it was easy to find on Amazon! And at a much better price than the online beauty specialty stores. It keeps the brassiness away and doesn&#x27;t keep me in debt.</li>
            <li> All 3 daughters have blonde hair that goes platinum in the summer sun. My oldest used a &amp;#34;wash out&amp;#34; color for a school function that left her hair orange/ red.... After a couple uses this corrected the problem :)</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> after a semi permanent hair color gave reddish tones my hair, I needed help and after using it my husband commented that my hair color looked more natural and better than after the first stuff I used.  My hair is not blonde but I do have some lighter brown areas that had the reddish tones and this worked.</li>
