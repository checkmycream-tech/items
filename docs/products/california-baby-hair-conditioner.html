    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It works great for my baby&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li>Great smell.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy that I found this.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner does not do a great job at getting out the tangles</li>
            <li>Smells soo good and works well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good conditioner and gets the knots out of my daughters curly hair.</li>
            <li>I guess someone else loved it too....</li>
            <li>It was much more manageable and my scalp does not itch!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my own fine curly hair as a leave in and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice and have a sheen over it.</li>
            <li>It also smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I ended up making my own shea butter whipped as well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice conditioner for my baby</li>
            <li>This stuff smells nice.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner smells really nice and gets the tangles out well.</li>
            <li>Her curls come out nice and her hair is shiny.</li>
            <li>This scent is the best one we have found with organic or natural shampoos.</li>
            <li>I love California baby products and was hopping this product would condition her hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>So I decided it&#x27;s time to find better hair product for her.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner for my daughters.</li>
            <li>If you like being able to smell the scent after you get out of the shower, you may want to try something else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to use more of it than I should.</li>
            <li>While I absolutely love California Baby baby wash...</li>
            <li>Works great for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My daughter has curly hair that knots easily, so combing through is always a challenge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many natural conditioners and this is so far the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>It made their hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I do feel like I have to use quite a bit though to get her hair smooth and to get the knots out.</li>
            <li>but I always go back to the California Baby conditioner because it really works the best.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked so golden before!  </li>
            <li>(If you&#x27;re familiar with California Baby products, it smells like the rest of the line does.)  </li>
            <li>I usually use Baby Zen Conditioner and that works wonderful on her hair, but I had run out of it and wanted to try another product.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a leave in on my super long hair and it works great, makes hair shiny and full of body.</li>
            <li>i use this to condition the hair closer to her scalp since its natural, then use my own conditioner for the ends of her hair.</li>
            <li>I have used many other conditioners and my fine hair is usually very easy to brush through afterwards.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I had went through many natural products trying to find something that would help smooth out her hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell fades rather quickly too.</li>
            <li>First night after bath, her hair is smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>I love all other California baby products and they all smell amazing</li>
            <li>but I noticed this conditioner is still very drying on her hair and had a strong smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and often get sore spots on the top of my scalp from eczema.  </li>
            <li>I love this all natural conditioner.</li>
            <li>I lived overseas when I ordered this, and it still came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve never trimmed her hair at the back, so it&#x27;s still the original fine baby hair that she had when she was born.</li>
            <li>postive to this product is that it is very gentle.</li>
            <li>The calendula conditioner combined with the natural shampoo make my hair feel silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this conditioner in travel-sample pack of California baby products.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 18 month old daughter with straight fine hair.</li>
            <li>i get the peace of mind that what&#x27;s against her skin is natural, but the detangling/silkening work of my own regular conditioner for the tips.   </li>
            <li>When I switched my baby to california baby calendula shampoo, I liked it enough to start using it myself, as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair super soft.</li>
            <li>I used it on my daughter for the first time last night and it made her hair soft and took away her cradle cap for the most part</li>
            <li>I thought it worked really well on both of them.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only natural product that seems to work and leaves her hair soft and nice smelling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensative to frangrance and this doesn&#x27;t bother me which is another plus.  </li>
            <li>However that doesn&#x27;t really help much with the untangling.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started to noticed her hair was very sensentive when it started to come out when combing it while coated in conditoner.</li>
            <li>I really dislike the packaging.</li>
            <li>It is very floral.</li>
            <li>I have a huge bag of dried calendula as I use it for many purposes quite frequently</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>(especially since the california baby shampoo is so non-moisturizing and leaves it really squeaky clean).</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth using, as combing and styling go exactly the same way whether we use it or</li>
            <li>but is safe for little ones with a head of hair.  </li>
            <li>so far this method has worked out fine and when her hair is dry, you can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li>One has fine hair and other doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t leave her hair any where near as soft as a regular conditioner and basically just takes the squeaky clean edge off of her shampooed hair.</li>
            <li>i even tried getting a shower filter to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the hard water that was preventing the conditioner from really working.</li>
            <li>I wondered if the commercial shampoo and conditioner I was using was drying my skin out on my scalp, so I decided to find something natural to use with no artificial fragrances.  </li>
            <li>started using California Baby Calendula Conditioner last night for the first time.  </li>
            <li>the other california baby conditioner (not the calendula one) worked much better for me and will go back to purchasing that once this runs out.</li>
            <li>And it has a tiny little spout on the top.</li>
            <li>i tried this product to keep with the natural products only to find that it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>We also took her to swimming lessons since 8 months old every week and it might have contribute to the damaging effects as well.</li>
            <li>but it does leave her hair soft, silky and manageable.  </li>
            <li>my daughter is 3.5, has stick straight asian hair.</li>
            <li>They have sever eczema, and this is one of the few soaps that their skin can handle, plus it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>my two year old&#x27;s curly and often frizzy hair</li>
            <li>My 23 month old has a head full of tight ringlets.  </li>
            <li>Not only that, her baby fine hair isn&#x27;t weighed down by this - even when I leave it in.  </li>
            <li>(i have fine thin straight hair).</li>
            <li>not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also separated in the bottle and for the first 15 uses was very watery, and now it is too thick to come out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I tried it in my hair the next day and couldn&#x27;t believe that it left my hair stringy, almost stripped feeling, and not at all soft</li>
            <li>I was taking the advice of other natural moms and started using Shea Moisture on my daughers hair at 1 yrs old.</li>
            <li>My daughter has fairly long curly hair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The next time I tried it as a leave in conditioner, I put it in when my hair was wet; when my hair dried it was silky smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>My 2 1/2 year old daughter has very long hair for her age</li>
            <li>My son is nearly 2 but was having periodic bouts with cradle cap type dry spots.</li>

            <li> My son is nearly 2 but was having periodic bouts with cradle cap type dry spots.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and it almost looks brown if I use any other natural hair care products.  </li>
            <li> The last inch of the hair no longer feels coarse and doesn&#x27;t stick to each other.</li>
            <li> It took me so long to comb the tangles out.  </li>
            <li> I left it in for about 3 minutes while finishing my shower routine and then combed it with a wide tooth comb and rinsed it out.  </li>
            <li> Every so often if I&#x27;m not able to find this product in store I will try something new</li>
            <li> Doest dry out my baby&#x27;s scalp like theJohnson &amp; Johnson brand.</li>
            <li> It also took care of her dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> Got it to help my twins dry scalp, but it was a big let down.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated, when I comb through her hair, it created clumps and more knots at the ends, making it very difficult to comb through her hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try something else or go back to Little Twig</li>
            <li> I bought it because I use the baby shampoo and body wash, but unfortunately it does not help my baby hair get her tangles out and to leave in the smell is too strong for a small baby.</li>
            <li> I really wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> This resolved the issue in less than a week.</li>
            <li> It caused the end of her hair clump together into a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> It was a mess.  </li>
            <li> I have long curly/wavy hair, that is fairly thick.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t give her the hair slip that Little Twig did.</li>
            <li> , this product does little to nothing.  </li>
            <li> I also dried my hair after showering and put a quarter sized amount in my hair as leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday on me and my toddler.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works well and isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy, without relaxing her curl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  I had to stop using this conditioner because it was causing pretty bad eczema breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Finding the shampoo without sodium laureth sulfate (or other surfactants) was relatively easy, but finding a conditioner that didn&#x27;t have known allergens was horrible.  </li>
            <li> No more tangles.</li>
            <li> Not pleased anymore.</li>
            <li> missing from Grandma&#x27;s stash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with their conditioner.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> The conditioner is very thick.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not seeing any growth in the thin areas either.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive.</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair with a lot of tangles and makes  it difficult to brush.</li>
            <li> Even with the cap off, it is difficult to get out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t even compare which was a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to get conditioner out of the litte spout.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad fragrance by any means but it doesn&#x27;t smell like calendula.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible, but isn&#x27;t unbearable.</li>

            <li> I bought it because I use the baby shampoo and body wash, but unfortunately it does not help my baby hair get her tangles out and to leave in the smell is too strong for a small baby.</li>
            <li> I used this on my twin boy/girl - 20 months.  One has fine hair and other doesn&#x27;t.  &#x27;    I thought it worked really well on both of them.  It made their hair shiny and smooth.  very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many natural conditioners and this is so far the best I&#x27;ve found.  My daughter has thick, wavy hair and this is the only natural product that seems to work and leaves her hair soft and nice smelling.  I&#x27;m very sensative to frangrance and this doesn&#x27;t bother me which is another plus.  I&#x27;ve used it on my own fine curly hair as a leave in and it works great.  Every so often if I&#x27;m not able to find this product in store I will try something new but I always go back to the California Baby conditioner because it really works the best.</li>
            <li> My daughter has fairly long curly hair and sensitive skin.  I love California baby products and was hopping this product would condition her hair and scalp.  I applied it as instucted for 2 minutes and repeated.  It caused the end of her hair clump together into a tangled mess.  It took me so long to comb the tangles out.  It was a mess.  I tried it in my hair the next day and couldn&#x27;t believe that it left my hair stringy, almost stripped feeling, and not at all soft (i have fine thin straight hair).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 18 month old daughter with straight fine hair. We are not using this to untangle curly hair, but her hair seems coarse at the tip, and always \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; together. We&#x27;ve never trimmed her hair at the back, so it&#x27;s still the original fine baby hair that she had when she was born. We also took her to swimming lessons since 8 months old every week and it might have contribute to the damaging effects as well. Her hair tangles and knots up at the bottom and she would cry every time I try to untangle it. So I decided it&#x27;s time to find better hair product for her. We&#x27;ve been using Johnson&#x27;s head-to-toe during bath, but I switched to using Mustela baby shampoo. However that doesn&#x27;t really help much with the untangling. So I bought this California Baby Hair Conditioner and give it a try. First night after bath, her hair is smooth as silk. No more tangles. It feels nice and have a sheen over it. The last inch of the hair no longer feels coarse and doesn&#x27;t stick to each other. I don&#x27;t like leaving in conditioner so I massage it to her hair, leave it on for 2 minutes, then rinse it out. It works great for my baby&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> Great smell.  Doest dry out my baby&#x27;s scalp like theJohnson &amp; Johnson brand.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and often get sore spots on the top of my scalp from eczema.  I wondered if the commercial shampoo and conditioner I was using was drying my skin out on my scalp, so I decided to find something natural to use with no artificial fragrances.  Finding the shampoo without sodium laureth sulfate (or other surfactants) was relatively easy, but finding a conditioner that didn&#x27;t have known allergens was horrible.  Everything, even hypoallergenic stuff, had fragrance, parabens, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using California Baby Calendula Conditioner last night for the first time.  After shampooing and rinsing, I put a generous amount on my hair (like the label said) and worked it in, concentrating on the roots and the ends.  I left it in for about 3 minutes while finishing my shower routine and then combed it with a wide tooth comb and rinsed it out.  I also dried my hair after showering and put a quarter sized amount in my hair as leave-in conditioner.  My hair has never looked so golden before!  I have blonde hair and it almost looks brown if I use any other natural hair care products.  The calendula conditioner combined with the natural shampoo make my hair feel silky and smooth.  It was much more manageable and my scalp does not itch!  I am very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I had to stop using this conditioner because it was causing pretty bad eczema breakouts.  Not pleased anymore.</li>
            <li> My 23 month old has a head full of tight ringlets.  I had went through many natural products trying to find something that would help smooth out her hair.  I am so happy that I found this.  It doesn&#x27;t detangle or anything like commercial conditioners do - but it does leave her hair soft, silky and manageable.  It also took care of her dry scalp.  Not only that, her baby fine hair isn&#x27;t weighed down by this - even when I leave it in.  It also smells nice.  (If you&#x27;re familiar with California Baby products, it smells like the rest of the line does.)  My only gripe is the price.  I really wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> My 2 1/2 year old daughter has very long hair for her age and it&#x27;s curly.  As another reviewer stated, when I comb through her hair, it created clumps and more knots at the ends, making it very difficult to comb through her hair.  I usually use Baby Zen Conditioner and that works wonderful on her hair, but I had run out of it and wanted to try another product.  I&#x27;m going back to the Baby Zen Conditioner.</li>
            <li> My son is nearly 2 but was having periodic bouts with cradle cap type dry spots. This resolved the issue in less than a week. And we now use is as prevention.</li>
            <li> I first tried this conditioner in travel-sample pack of California baby products. I have long curly/wavy hair, that is fairly thick. I tried using it as a rinse out conditioner and it didn&#x27;t work for me. The next time I tried it as a leave in conditioner, I put it in when my hair was wet; when my hair dried it was silky smooth and shiny. I use California baby products on my kids as well. I love this all natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was taking the advice of other natural moms and started using Shea Moisture on my daughers hair at 1 yrs old. I started to noticed her hair was very sensentive when it started to come out when combing it while coated in conditoner. I stopped using all hair products immediately and bought this product along with shea butter. I ended up making my own shea butter whipped as well but I noticed this conditioner is still very drying on her hair and had a strong smell to it. My daugher&#x27;s hair isn&#x27;t coming out anymore but I&#x27;m not seeing any growth in the thin areas either. I&#x27;m looking for a &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; mositurizing conditoner because I will not buy this one again.</li>
            <li> I bought the California baby sample pack and this was in it. I used it on my daughter for the first time last night and it made her hair soft and took away her cradle cap for the most part but i just can&#x27;t get over the smell. It smells like rubber and lemon furniture polish. I love all other California baby products and they all smell amazing but this one is definitely going in the trash.</li>
            <li> The calendula oil inside this conditioner is what made me buy the product.  It helped to get rid of my baby&#x27;s cradle cap. I would suggest it to everyone.</li>
            <li> my daughter is 3.5, has stick straight asian hair. i condition her hair bc it gets tangled at the ends (especially since the california baby shampoo is so non-moisturizing and leaves it really squeaky clean). i tried this product to keep with the natural products only to find that it didn&#x27;t work very well. it doesn&#x27;t leave her hair any where near as soft as a regular conditioner and basically just takes the squeaky clean edge off of her shampooed hair. i even tried getting a shower filter to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the hard water that was preventing the conditioner from really working. finally i just compromised - i use this to condition the hair closer to her scalp since its natural, then use my own conditioner for the ends of her hair. so far this method has worked out fine and when her hair is dry, you can&#x27;t tell the difference. i get the peace of mind that what&#x27;s against her skin is natural, but the detangling/silkening work of my own regular conditioner for the tips.   the other california baby conditioner (not the calendula one) worked much better for me and will go back to purchasing that once this runs out.</li>
            <li> This scent is the best one we have found with organic or natural shampoos. I also like that the conditioner can double as a leave in treatment. It leaves hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner for my daughters. They have sever eczema, and this is one of the few soaps that their skin can handle, plus it smells fantastic. I lived overseas when I ordered this, and it still came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells soo good and works well. A bit expensive.</li>
            <li> When I switched my baby to california baby calendula shampoo, I liked it enough to start using it myself, as I have sensitive skin. I thought I would try the condioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple things I do not like:&lt;br /&gt;  1. The conditioner leaves my hair with a lot of tangles and makes  it difficult to brush. I have used many other conditioners and my fine hair is usually very easy to brush through afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;  2. I really dislike the packaging. The conditioner is very thick. And it has a tiny little spout on the top. It is impossible to get conditioner out of the litte spout. Squeezing the bottle does not make conditioner come out either. Even with the cap off, it is difficult to get out.&lt;br /&gt; 3. I am not the biggest fan of the scent. Of course this is a personal preference. It is very floral. The scent also does not last. If you like being able to smell the scent after you get out of the shower, you may want to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The postive to this product is that it is very gentle. I have not had any issues with reactions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice conditioner for my baby but it doesn&#x27;t give her the hair slip that Little Twig did. I feel like I have to use more of it than I should. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad fragrance by any means but it doesn&#x27;t smell like calendula. I feel like they use that name not expecting people to know what it smells like but basically calendula is a fancy word for marigold. I have a huge bag of dried calendula as I use it for many purposes quite frequently and they don&#x27;t even compare which was a bit disappointing. While I absolutely love California Baby baby wash... I&#x27;m not thrilled with their conditioner. I&#x27;ll try something else or go back to Little Twig the next go around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good conditioner and gets the knots out of my daughters curly hair. I do feel like I have to use quite a bit though to get her hair smooth and to get the knots out. I also like the scent and ingredients!</li>
            <li> I use it as a leave in on my super long hair and it works great, makes hair shiny and full of body. Use it everyday on me and my toddler.  I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does not do a great job at getting out the tangles but is safe for little ones with a head of hair.  Perhaps it is made for babies?</li>
            <li> I guess someone else loved it too....missing from Grandma&#x27;s stash!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells nice.  That&#x27;s my positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my two year old&#x27;s curly and often frizzy hair, this product does little to nothing.  It isn&#x27;t worth using, as combing and styling go exactly the same way whether we use it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also separated in the bottle and for the first 15 uses was very watery, and now it is too thick to come out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells really nice and gets the tangles out well. My daughter has curly hair that knots easily, so combing through is always a challenge. This stuff works well and isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy, without relaxing her curl. Her curls come out nice and her hair is shiny.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell. Smells toxic!</li>
            <li> Works great for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin. The smell is horrible, but isn&#x27;t unbearable. The smell fades rather quickly too.</li>
            <li> Got it to help my twins dry scalp, but it was a big let down.</li>
