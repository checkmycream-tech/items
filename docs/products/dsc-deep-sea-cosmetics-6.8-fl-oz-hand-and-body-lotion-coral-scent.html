            <li>The best is when I buff my feet in the shower, get out/dry off and immediately put this stuff on them.</li>

            <li>I think it is a great product.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t ball up, and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I really love this product!!</li>
            <li>Feels great but would be wonderful as fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>My skin just looked that good.  </li>
            <li>The one thing is that the scent in this doesn&#x27;t have the pleasant rose smell it used to have.  </li>
            <li>She said she liked it.  </li>
            <li>nice fragrance, will not interfere with your cologne.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own stock, but wish I did.</li>
            <li>My mom is using it as I wear a perfume and this overpowers my own perfume.  </li>
            <li>I would not have gone out of my way to purchase this product on my own</li>
            <li>According to my wife (for whom this product was a gift), it is easy to apply, has a very pleasant and fresh fragrance, and serves well the purpose of softening and hydrating her skin.</li>
            <li>LIKE THE ECONOMICAL APPROACH OF SHOPPING FOR THIS GREAT PRODUCT AT AMAZON.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and makes my hands feel much younger and more supple and nice.</li>
            <li>that did some of these things before, so I didn&#x27;t consider this the best lotion EVER until I ran out of facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have bought this before, but seeing it on Amazon at a way better price made it better.</li>
            <li>I really love the smell of this companies lotions</li>
            <li>I started using DSC body scrub, body butter, and hand/body lotion over a year ago and just love the line.</li>
            <li>Hands/elbows seem to look so much better than with anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li>Once I started using the products, I fell in love with the lotion, coral scent.  </li>
            <li>I use the nail products too, but my favorite is the coral scent lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on here buying more now.</li>
            <li>I first bought this DSC lotion at a mall kiosk for more like $50 (to be fair</li>
            <li>that all sounds pretty good</li>
            <li>This was for my wife who really find it a pleasant</li>
            <li>They charged less than the mall, but more than this, so I was happy to find it  here at a good price.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft all over, gently scented and my nails look great since I began using the kit!</li>
            <li>It is good for daily use and to have nice smelling hands.</li>
            <li>The smell is so strong that it literally causes a burning sensation in my nose.  </li>
            <li>texture is smooth and not gunky, oily, or runny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It says it&#x27;s for face and hands, but I also use it on my feet after a shower and they become SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>My elbows and hands are \\&quot;smooth as buttah\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>So now, it&#x27;s even more economical.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, blends fast and dries quickly without any kind of alcohol smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still, with the most significant item being the hand and body lotion and their own website selling the lotion for $17-$23USD it seems like the price was majorly jacked.</li>
            <li>My husband liked it so much he took it away from me, so I ordered more online from the company directly.  </li>
            <li>Regular virgin olive oil makes my skin feel really good without perfumes to irritate my nose and eyes.</li>
            <li>I was trying to save money, but i guess the saying is true</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling, and it makes you smooth without any kind of overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li>more soft looking.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>This goes on right into your skin....</li>
            <li>I compared the full label, aroma, etc, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the same.</li>
            <li>The lotion is quite rich and only a small amount is needed, so it&#x27;s actually a very good value for the money.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like greasy and are looking for quality ingredients then any of the DSC products are exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>I first bought from DS Cosmetics kiosk at the mall</li>
            <li>In short - LOVE the line.</li>
            <li>Since the first time that I used I said woow</li>
            <li>It has a soft, light scent that goes well with my cologne.  </li>
            <li>coral scent is by far my favorite, it&#x27;s subtle and reminds me of a light, light rose with a slight beachy undertone.</li>
            <li>It really  heals my hands.</li>
            <li>I could really use one.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve tried really nice or expensive lotions (including many others with shea butter)</li>
            <li>Only liked the scent, did not moisturized very deep, hand lotion Coral.</li>
            <li>The sales rep recommended this lotion in the coral because it smelled better Han the other.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is made of high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I washed my face, applied my normal benzoyl peroxide, and used this before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>would buy this lotion again, and I&#x27;d recommend it to try on problem skin.ace, applied my normal benzoyl peroxide, and used this before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I have thick calluses and they just become nice and feminine.</li>
            <li>This is more like a cheap perfume smell that unfortunately lingers.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know what they smell like since the descriptions aren&#x27;t very clear.  </li>
            <li>I love the small .</li>
            <li>Later in the day, I went to remove my makeup and my first thought was \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li>Later in the day, I went to remove my makeup and my first thought was \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li>I really like this product but wanted other buyers aware that the bottle is NOT 8 ounces as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Plus I bought enough I qualified for free shipping from the company and it came about a week before I expected it to.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to scents and can&#x27;t even wear perfume, but I can wear this lotion</li>
            <li>I avoid most lotions because they make me break out, and I have noticed that mineral oil is a common culprit.</li>
            <li>It is advertised as \\&quot;softly fragranced.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it as a hand cream during the frosty weather and have to agree that it does make sore skin feel considerably better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
            <li>Funny, I started running out of everything about the same time, so they last about a year.</li>
            <li>an keeps my skin soft  and last all day</li>
            <li>As far as the scent, I&#x27;ve had the blue and coral; they both seem to disappear on me.....</li>
            <li>however I found that this lotion is not for very dry sensitive hands.</li>

            <li> My wife had purchased a small tube of Deep Sea body lotion several years ago.  </li>
            <li> There are other scents made by DSC</li>
            <li> For moisturizing and feeling I would give 5 stars but the smell ruins it for me.  </li>
            <li> the sun drys my skin badly and dscdeep sea lotion absorbs into my skin quickly</li>
            <li> If you want to grow your nails out use the Dead Sea Nourishing&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the scent of the coral Dead Sea Hand &amp; Body Lotion overpowering.</li>
            <li> no greasy or messy stuff you have to blot off.</li>
            <li> I bought this hand cream at a mall kiosk a few years ago along with a nail kit.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a bigger bottle than what I have previously purchased elsewhere and was disappointed when I received my order.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed that it did not smell the same.</li>
            <li> The card shuffler has a broken pc.</li>
            <li> Just as annoyingly I have dry skin on my forehead, around my eyelids, and on my jawline</li>
            <li> It is too expensive to buy from the company</li>
            <li> Prices doubled so sorry will be buying something else to use.</li>
            <li> It was disappointing when the bottle became emptier and emptier, and I thought it was going to cost me another $50 to get this lotion again.</li>
            <li> Even though this lotion has mineral oil I decided to use it because I was desperate.</li>
            <li> , you get what you pay for... dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> This is problematic because I have acne prone skin, I also have annoying oil that builds up on my nose, cheeks, and chin.</li>

            <li> If you don&#x27;t like greasy and are looking for quality ingredients then any of the DSC products are exactly what you&#x27;re looking for. Great scent and achieves desired results.</li>
            <li> I first bought this DSC lotion at a mall kiosk for more like $50 (to be fair I guess it came in a nail kit with a couple nail accessories and a cuticle lotion). Still, with the most significant item being the hand and body lotion and their own website selling the lotion for $17-$23USD it seems like the price was majorly jacked. It was disappointing when the bottle became emptier and emptier, and I thought it was going to cost me another $50 to get this lotion again. Not so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coral scent is by far my favorite, it&#x27;s subtle and reminds me of a light, light rose with a slight beachy undertone. I am sensitive to scents and can&#x27;t even wear perfume, but I can wear this lotion NO PROBLEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is smooth and not gunky, oily, or runny. It goes on easily, blends fast and dries quickly without any kind of alcohol smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it&#x27;s for face and hands, but I also use it on my feet after a shower and they become SMOOTH. I have thick calluses and they just become nice and feminine. The best is when I buff my feet in the shower, get out/dry off and immediately put this stuff on them. It fixes them like wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it on body and hands is great too, of course. It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling, and it makes you smooth without any kind of overwhelming smell. It does not aggravate my body acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that all sounds pretty good but I&#x27;ve tried really nice or expensive lotions (including many others with shea butter) that did some of these things before, so I didn&#x27;t consider this the best lotion EVER until I ran out of facial moisturizer. This is problematic because I have acne prone skin, I also have annoying oil that builds up on my nose, cheeks, and chin. Just as annoyingly I have dry skin on my forehead, around my eyelids, and on my jawline so I need to wear lotion. I avoid most lotions because they make me break out, and I have noticed that mineral oil is a common culprit. Even though this lotion has mineral oil I decided to use it because I was desperate. I washed my face, applied my normal benzoyl peroxide, and used this before applying makeup. Later in the day, I went to remove my makeup and my first thought was \\&quot;wow I did well with my makeup today\\&quot; because sometimes I do. But when I used my makeup removing wipes there was NO makeup on the wipe meaning that there was NO makeup left on my face. My skin just looked that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this lotion again, and I&#x27;d recommend it to try on problem skin.ace, applied my normal benzoyl peroxide, and used this before applying makeup.

            <li> I really like this product but wanted other buyers aware that the bottle is NOT 8 ounces as advertised.  It is only 6.8 ounces.  I thought I was buying a bigger bottle than what I have previously purchased elsewhere and was disappointed when I received my order.</li>
            <li> I have bought this before, but seeing it on Amazon at a way better price made it better. Plus I bought enough I qualified for free shipping from the company and it came about a week before I expected it to. Definately will order it again</li>
            <li> I love the small . It is not overpowering. It really  heals my hands. I use it daily in the winter.</li>
            <li> This lotion is made of high quality ingredients. There is nothing out there to compare, they only come&lt;br /&gt;close. I&#x27;ve had compliments on the scent too. If you want to grow your nails out use the Dead Sea Nourishing&lt;br /&gt;Cuticle Oil with this lotion. This stuff is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> The price and delivery were very good.  The lotion is quite rich and only a small amount is needed, so it&#x27;s actually a very good value for the money.</li>
            <li> My wife had purchased a small tube of Deep Sea body lotion several years ago.  She said she liked it.  So I decided to get some for when I give her back massages.  The Coral Scent last longer than the Deep Blue scent.  Why, I don&#x27;t know.  I just wish she would give me a massage...  I could really use one.</li>
            <li> nice fragrance, will not interfere with your cologne.  Keeps your hands/body hydrated without any greasy feel. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this companies lotions however I found that this lotion is not for very dry sensitive hands. It is good for daily use and to have nice smelling hands.</li>
            <li> It made my hands look youthful again, more soft looking.&lt;br /&gt;i LIKE THE ECONOMICAL APPROACH OF SHOPPING FOR THIS GREAT PRODUCT AT AMAZON.</li>
            <li> I find the scent of the coral Dead Sea Hand &amp; Body Lotion overpowering. It is advertised as \\&quot;softly fragranced.\\&quot; But I have scrubbed my hands three times and still can&#x27;t get the smell off. I would suggest testing this product before buying, if possible.</li>
            <li> I started using DSC body scrub, body butter, and hand/body lotion over a year ago and just love the line. I use it faithfully at bedtime, and after washing hands. My elbows and hands are \\&quot;smooth as buttah\\&quot;. Funny, I started running out of everything about the same time, so they last about a year. I first bought from DS Cosmetics kiosk at the mall and it was MUCH more expensive than at Yahoo. So now, it&#x27;s even more economical. I compared the full label, aroma, etc, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the same. This goes on right into your skin....no greasy or messy stuff you have to blot off. Hands/elbows seem to look so much better than with anything else I&#x27;ve tried. As far as the scent, I&#x27;ve had the blue and coral; they both seem to disappear on me.....In short - LOVE the line. ps...I don&#x27;t own stock, but wish I did.</li>
            <li> I was coerced at a mall kiosk and had to buy something.  The sales rep recommended this lotion in the coral because it smelled better Han the other.  The smell is so strong that it literally causes a burning sensation in my nose.  My mom is using it as I wear a perfume and this overpowers my own perfume.  I can always smell when she opens the tube.  Feels great but would be wonderful as fragrance free.  For moisturizing and feeling I would give 5 stars but the smell ruins it for me.  Regular virgin olive oil makes my skin feel really good without perfumes to irritate my nose and eyes.</li>
            <li> This lotion does not smell or feel like the lotion we purchased at the kiosk in the mall.. I was trying to save money, but i guess the saying is true, you get what you pay for... dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed that it did not smell the same.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> An excellent product.</li>
            <li> The card shuffler has a broken pc. which causes it to not shuffle properly</li>
            <li> This was for my wife who really find it a pleasant product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it as a hand cream during the frosty weather and have to agree that it does make sore skin feel considerably better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul W</li>
            <li> I bought this hand cream at a mall kiosk a few years ago along with a nail kit.  My husband liked it so much he took it away from me, so I ordered more online from the company directly.  They charged less than the mall, but more than this, so I was happy to find it  here at a good price.  The one thing is that the scent in this doesn&#x27;t have the pleasant rose smell it used to have.  This is more like a cheap perfume smell that unfortunately lingers.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion.  It smells wonderful and makes my hands feel much younger and more supple and nice.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!! Since the first time that I used I said woow this is good! . .</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift initially as part of a fancy nail kit.  Once I started using the products, I fell in love with the lotion, coral scent.  It has a soft, light scent that goes well with my cologne.  There are other scents made by DSC but I don&#x27;t know what they smell like since the descriptions aren&#x27;t very clear.  I would not have gone out of my way to purchase this product on my own but since I received it, I am hooked.  I use the nail products too, but my favorite is the coral scent lotion.  It is too expensive to buy from the company so I found it here at a great price and no shipping costs.  I hope they continue to carry the lotion and they don&#x27;t change the pricing.  My skin is soft all over, gently scented and my nails look great since I began using the kit!</li>
            <li> Prices doubled so sorry will be buying something else to use. Only liked the scent, did not moisturized very deep, hand lotion Coral.</li>
            <li> According to my wife (for whom this product was a gift), it is easy to apply, has a very pleasant and fresh fragrance, and serves well the purpose of softening and hydrating her skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 years&lt;br /&gt;and I think it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;  thank you&lt;br /&gt;  barbara christopher</li>
            <li> This is the best for message. It doesn&#x27;t ball up, and it smells great. I&#x27;m on here buying more now.</li>
