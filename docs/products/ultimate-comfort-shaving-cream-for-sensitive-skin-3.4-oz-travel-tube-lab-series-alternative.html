    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and since we travel a lot I find this size is just perfect.  </li>
            <li>but when they stopped making it I tried the Face product and it is the best I have found to replace the Aramis.  </li>
            <li>Since Lab Series changed the formula for their \\&quot;maximum comfort shave cream\\&quot; and eliminated the benzocaine ingredient, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>So happy I have found this!</li>
            <li>But this one works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling great!  </li>
            <li>I have tried a handful of the $16 - $30 shaving creams (5 oz. - 8 oz jars) and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>My face is smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!!!</li>
            <li>After seeing this product on a \\&quot;Best of 2013 Shave Products\\&quot; list</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s even better!!!</li>
            <li>It is a very good product as it is.</li>
            <li>Great product and great service!</li>
            <li>This stuff is incredible......</li>
            <li>Great service and price make this a winner</li>
            <li>A great product.  </li>
            <li>After seeing great reviews for this product I ordered a tube.  </li>
            <li>company also has great customer service.</li>
            <li>and I was most definitely impressed.</li>
            <li>I loved the way my legs felt.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t mind sharing his shaving cream when my legs feel and look this good.</li>
            <li>It allows the razor to glide across my face so easily for an incredibly close, nick-free shave with no burning or stinging.</li>
            <li>This is great and the new packaging awesome.  </li>
            <li>so I am very happy to find Face Skin Cares, it is a very good solution for me, I definitely will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;Herbert</li>
            <li>It is by far the BEST shave I have ever experienced and</li>
            <li>and I was very impressed with my first shave.</li>
            <li>Changing the packaging to a jar would make it even better!</li>
            <li>note, service was amazing.</li>
            <li>I just put on some warm water, and some shaving cream, shave and</li>
            <li>This substitutes Lidocaine, which is also an effective pain suppressant.</li>
            <li>The lidocaine is matched with some really effective creams and butters that make for a very smooth and close</li>
            <li>Great for a clean smooth shave!</li>
            <li>Works excellent for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it as it still numbs my face and gives me a clean, nick free and in-grown hair free shave.  </li>
            <li>It allows for a very smooth and very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m able to get it that way.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, definitely recommended.</li>
            <li>The one thing I would love is for the tube to be more flexible (easier to get all of the cream out of it when getting close to the end of it.)</li>
            <li>This person said they may start putting more desensitizer into the formula.  </li>
            <li>It is an outstanding shaving cream, buy it an you&#x27;ll see and feel  the difference in your face.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I no longer have to lament that Lab Series changed their formula and ruined their product.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this.</li>
            <li>Like many of the customers who have also rated this product,  I used Lab Series shave cream with benzocaine for years.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I think it will achieve an even greater cult status than its predecessor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important!</li>
            <li>THANKS FACE!!!!</li>
            <li>Simply the best, most comfortable shave out there.  </li>
            <li>This one provides the most comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>It contains the skin numbing ingredient lidocaine, making for a much more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a nice shave I got!  </li>
            <li>Some of the stuff he tried, including the new Lab Series, not sooooo good.  </li>
            <li>They quickly apologized and corrected the situation!  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product</li>
            <li>and I have finally found a great replacement for my shave cream.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is not only a great replacement</li>
            <li>Face saves my skin and my legs feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>to enjoy the benefits....</li>
            <li>Not bad but not as good as the Lab Series old formula</li>
            <li>I find it rinses away easily and leaves my skin calm and smooth, with virtually no redness or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I was concerned as the feel was more like a skin cream than a foamy lather.  </li>
            <li>My skin is super smooth.....</li>
            <li>I was excited to discover Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream by Face Skin Care and have found it to be an even superior premium cream.</li>
            <li>The inclusion of lidocaine provides some of the comfort/protection that the Lab Series product provided, but the overall effect is not quite as good.  </li>
            <li>little pricey -- but good stuff!</li>
            <li>was a loyal Maximum Comfort Shave cream (by Lab Series) user for over 25 years.</li>
            <li>dont forget to moisturize with a sensitive free, dye free, chemical free moisturizer...recommend men science moisturizer</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m not saying that its perfect (I still can get a little red), but its far superior to anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I commend the guy who moved so decisively to make up this new better formulation with lidocaine rather than benzocaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The texture is great, save for the slightly grainy bits.</li>
            <li>Ultimate Comfort is great for my sensitive skin, and I like that it has no fragrance.</li>
            <li>Face Skin Care has me as a new, loyal customer, and I encourage everyone to give it a try!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful new product which more than adequately replaces the much-loved Lab-series Comfort Shave which changed its formulation so disastrously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve being using the Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream by Face Skin Care for about a year now and simply love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different shaving creams but this one beats them all.  </li>
            <li>They put it in softer tubes for travel, much better, and larger pots for home use.  </li>
            <li>When I first ordered I made a mistake with my shipping address.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>nothing else one will use now or later will ever better than this.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of the shave is, in my view, even slightly better than previously : close, comfortable and irritation-free.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to guys who spend a little more money to save their skin and faces...:-)</li>
            <li>So glad this company took the feedback from many thousands who complained about Lab Series altering their formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li>I had a question shortly after placing my order and I received a response very quickly.</li>
            <li>only wish would be that eventually the product becomes available in stores</li>
            <li>My question was answered very thoroughly and the email even included some tips for using the product.</li>
            <li>Absolute Comfort Shave Cream.  </li>
            <li>Face Skin Care is the real deal.</li>
            <li>and I never realized how much of a difference it really would make.</li>
            <li>I have real problems with shaving my legs...</li>
            <li>But, when I came across this product, I found that I actually like it better than the old Lab Series.</li>
            <li>I will always be a fan of the product for my sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li>The new jar just made everything that much easier!  </li>
            <li>It lubricates your face much better than any other cream I have used.  </li>
            <li>Like many other guys, I have been searching the internet for a product to replace Lab Series</li>
            <li>Since I started using FACE about a year ago, I&#x27;ve noticed less razor bumps and an all around better shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>The Aramis container was $25 for an amount that was two and a half times more than Face Skin Care.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I used the original product for over twenty years very faithfully, but for an unknown reason they took the numbing ingredient out about a year ago which distroyed the product quality and effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is thick plastic that cannot be squeezed effectively to get the cream out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>Ultimate Comfort contains many natural botanicals and lubricating oils in a rich, creamy base that is smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I too was a long-time consumer of Lab Series and was upset with the new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; formula.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new shaving cream and found this product reviewed on a shaving blog.</li>
            <li>After researching it, Lab Series new formula does not contain the numbing agent.  </li>
            <li>With other creams I would always have 1 or 2 nicks, but very rarely with this one.</li>
            <li>After many years of using Aramis Lab Series shave cream, they removed the numbing benzocaine, resulting in an inferior product and my search for an alternative with a similar active ingredient.</li>
            <li>A small amount does the trick, so the product can last a very long time, making for a great value for the price paid for this premium, high-quality shave cream.</li>
            <li>What a classy outfit.  </li>
            <li>I have always had sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The last 1/3 of the amount has to be removed by unscrewing the top and getting gravity and careful shaking to cause some to come out (but frequently too much comes out and the next several minutes are consumed by trying to get the stuff back in the tube - while you are waiting to shave!).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Desperate to find something else, I looked high and low for a comparable product for almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Face Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream helps me get a close smooth shave that regular soap or other shave creams just can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>It is the only shave cream that comes close to the old Maximum Comfort formula!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it because once you try it compared to any regular shave cream, gel, etc., you will never go back.</li>
            <li>Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream with Lidocaine for Sensitive Skin]]</li>
            <li>Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream with Lidocaine for Sensitive Skin]]</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although Face Shaving Cream is not quite as smooth, its organic product base is actually better for your skin, just not as creamy as Lab Series</li>
            <li>this is coming from someone with super sensitive skin and a really thick coarse beard.</li>

            <li> The last 1/3 of the amount has to be removed by unscrewing the top and getting gravity and careful shaking to cause some to come out (but frequently too much comes out and the next several minutes are consumed by trying to get the stuff back in the tube - while you are waiting to shave!).</li>

            <li> Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream with Lidocaine for Sensitive Skin]]</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although Face Shaving Cream is not quite as smooth, its organic product base is actually better for your skin, just not as creamy as Lab Series</li>
            <li> this is coming from someone with super sensitive skin and a really thick coarse beard.</li>
            <li> Last a long time for me.</li>

            <li> I really do not see/feel the difference between this product and the Lab Series Maximum Comfort.</li>
            <li> I remember with the original Lab Series product the benzocaine would make your lip go numb temporarily.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve being using the Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream by Face Skin Care for about a year now and simply love it. I too was a long-time consumer of Lab Series and was upset with the new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; formula. But, when I came across this product, I found that I actually like it better than the old Lab Series. And, the customer service I have received is tops in my book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish would be that eventually the product becomes available in stores so I&#x27;m able to get it that way. But, until then, I&#x27;ll be content ordering on-line and getting the smoothest shave of my life!</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple shaving creams.  This one provides the most comfortable shave.  It lubricates your face much better than any other cream I have used.  With other creams I would always have 1 or 2 nicks, but very rarely with this one.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried every shaving cream out there, but every time I get terrible razor burn. Now, I&#x27;m not saying that its perfect (I still can get a little red), but its far superior to anything else I&#x27;ve tried. In fact, I don&#x27;t even need a post shave gel. I just put on some warm water, and some shaving cream, shave and thats it. I&#x27;ve been a repeat buyer and won&#x27;t shave without Face.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and since we travel a lot I find this size is just perfect.  Great service and price make this a winner</li>
            <li> Great for a clean smooth shave! Works excellent for my sensitive skin. Last a long time for me. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, definitely recommended. The one thing I would love is for the tube to be more flexible (easier to get all of the cream out of it when getting close to the end of it.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different shaving creams but this one beats them all.  Since I started using FACE about a year ago, I&#x27;ve noticed less razor bumps and an all around better shaving experience.  The new jar just made everything that much easier!  I hightly recommend FACE Shave Cream.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Aramis shave cream with the desensitize in it but when they stopped making it I tried the Face product and it is the best I have found to replace the Aramis.  The Aramis seemed to numb my face better.  I spoke to the Face company and they indicated that the Aramis product had a desensitizer in it that may be harmful to people.  That&#x27;s why they stopped making it.  Face uses a different desensitizer.  This person said they may start putting more desensitizer into the formula.  If they do I will give this shave cream 5 Stars next time.  It is a very good product as it is.</li>
            <li> The Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream by Face Skin Care is nothing like the Lab Series Maximum Comfort Shaving Cream with Benzocaine.</li>
            <li> Was so upset when Lab Series removed Benzocaine.  This is great and the new packaging awesome.  They put it in softer tubes for travel, much better, and larger pots for home use.  A great product.  Simply the best, most comfortable shave out there.  Slightly numbs your face and feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it. So glad this company took the feedback from many thousands who complained about Lab Series altering their formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note, service was amazing. Contacted them as felt shipping was a little over priced for this.  They quickly apologized and corrected the situation!  Great product and great service!</li>
            <li> After seeing great reviews for this product I ordered a tube.  The first time I tried it, I was concerned as the feel was more like a skin cream than a foamy lather.  Wow, what a nice shave I got!  The thicker lubricating properties allowed the razor to shave closely without injuring my skin.  I think my razors last longer too.  One other note: When I first ordered I made a mistake with my shipping address.  I notified them within hours, but they had already sent it out to the wrong address.  They promptly notified me that another tube was sent to the proper address at no additional charge to me.  What a classy outfit.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is an outstanding shaving cream, buy it an you&#x27;ll see and feel  the difference in your face. Try it!</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a replacement to the Lab Series shaving cream with benzocaine as well. After trying several, I am sticking with this one. The texture is great, save for the slightly grainy bits. It is thick enough to allow the same small amount of use, which justifies the price as well.  It allows for a very smooth and very comfortable shave.  I am so glad I no longer have to lament that Lab Series changed their formula and ruined their product.  I have found my replacement.[[ASIN:B008Z6IMOM Face Shaving Cream Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream with Lidocaine for Sensitive Skin]]</li>
            <li> Since Lab Series changed the formula for their \\&quot;maximum comfort shave cream\\&quot; and eliminated the benzocaine ingredient, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  The inclusion of lidocaine provides some of the comfort/protection that the Lab Series product provided, but the overall effect is not quite as good.  Oh, and the tube the product comes in is nasty.  It is thick plastic that cannot be squeezed effectively to get the cream out of the tube.  The last 1/3 of the amount has to be removed by unscrewing the top and getting gravity and careful shaking to cause some to come out (but frequently too much comes out and the next several minutes are consumed by trying to get the stuff back in the tube - while you are waiting to shave!).</li>
            <li> Not bad but not as good as the Lab Series old formula</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new shaving cream and found this product reviewed on a shaving blog. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and I was very impressed with my first shave. My only critique is that I wish the bottle was bigger! Glad I found this.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a loyal Maximum Comfort Shave cream (by Lab Series) user for over 25 years. However, they \\&quot;improved\\&quot; the formula by taking out the benzocaine, rendering their product useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to find something else, I looked high and low for a comparable product for almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have finally found it and this is it--Face Skin Care. It is the only shave cream that comes close to the old Maximum Comfort formula! Trust me, once you try it you will never go back to any others!</li>
            <li> I bought this after Aramis dropped the benzocaine from their LAB series.  This substitutes Lidocaine, which is also an effective pain suppressant. The lidocaine is matched with some really effective creams and butters that make for a very smooth and close shave.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the amount and cost. The Aramis container was $25 for an amount that was two and a half times more than Face Skin Care.</li>
            <li> Like many of the customers who have also rated this product,  I used Lab Series shave cream with benzocaine for years. Since Lab Series changed their formula, I gave Face Skin Care Shave Cream a try. The Face Skin Care Shave Cream is a terrific replacement. So happy I have found this! Changing the packaging to a jar would make it even better!</li>
            <li> Used to be Lab Series had it, now this is the only thing I know.  I&#x27;m going to buy a bunch and stock up.</li>
            <li> I have used a few other shaving products including Edge and Barbasol.  But this one works the best for me.  Leaves my skin feeling great!  Definitely reduced the nicks and cuts.  I will always be a fan of the product for my sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried a handful of the $16 - $30 shaving creams (5 oz. - 8 oz jars) and this one is the best. Although I still get some razor burn and ingrown hairs, I have fewer issues than I did with the other creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company also has great customer service. I had a question shortly after placing my order and I received a response very quickly. My question was answered very thoroughly and the email even included some tips for using the product.</li>
            <li> I was a loyal LAB Series user for almost 10 years and was very disappointed when they changed their formula to remove the numbing agent.  I searched online to find another product that had a numbing ingredient and I found Face Skin Care Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream.  I am very happy with it as it still numbs my face and gives me a clean, nick free and in-grown hair free shave.  It allows me to actually shave so close that I only have to shave every other day.  I highly recommend it because once you try it compared to any regular shave cream, gel, etc., you will never go back.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after I tried Lab Series Maximum Comfort shaving creme.  After researching it, Lab Series new formula does not contain the numbing agent.  I have been using Face Skin Care&#x27;s Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream for close to two months.  I have found my shaving creme and plan to order it again.</li>
            <li> I really do not see/feel the difference between this product and the Lab Series Maximum Comfort. I know it contains lidocaine but I do not feel the effect of it. I remember with the original Lab Series product the benzocaine would make your lip go numb temporarily. So I don&#x27;t hate it but I don&#x27;t love it. For me, it&#x27;s a wash. Based on price, I will go with the Lab Series.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful new product which more than adequately replaces the much-loved Lab-series Comfort Shave which changed its formulation so disastrously. I commend the guy who moved so decisively to make up this new better formulation with lidocaine rather than benzocaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave is, in my view, even slightly better than previously : close, comfortable and irritation-free. I think it will achieve an even greater cult status than its predecessor. Please pass the word on. It&#x27;s important!</li>
            <li> Like many other guys, I have been searching the internet for a product to replace Lab Series Absolute Comfort Shave Cream.  I used the original product for over twenty years very faithfully, but for an unknown reason they took the numbing ingredient out about a year ago which distroyed the product quality and effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Face Shaving Cream is not quite as smooth, its organic product base is actually better for your skin, just not as creamy as Lab Series and I have finally found a great replacement for my shave cream.  I highly recommend this product to guys who spend a little more money to save their skin and faces...:-)</li>
            <li> I was a Lab Series Shave Cream customer for over 20 years. When the made a change in their formula I said Adios and made the switch to the Face Skin Care Shave Cream. This stuff is not only a great replacement but I think it&#x27;s even better!!! My face is smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!!!</li>
            <li> Ultimate Comfort says it all! After many years of using Aramis Lab Series shave cream, they removed the numbing benzocaine, resulting in an inferior product and my search for an alternative with a similar active ingredient. I was excited to discover Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream by Face Skin Care and have found it to be an even superior premium cream. It contains the skin numbing ingredient lidocaine, making for a much more comfortable shave. Ultimate Comfort contains many natural botanicals and lubricating oils in a rich, creamy base that is smooth and easy to apply. It allows the razor to glide across my face so easily for an incredibly close, nick-free shave with no burning or stinging. I find it rinses away easily and leaves my skin calm and smooth, with virtually no redness or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream goes a long way. A small amount does the trick, so the product can last a very long time, making for a great value for the price paid for this premium, high-quality shave cream. Ultimate Comfort is great for my sensitive skin, and I like that it has no fragrance. Face Skin Care has me as a new, loyal customer, and I encourage everyone to give it a try!</li>
            <li> Face Skin Care is the real deal. No more razor burn, ingrown hairs and for the first time in years I can actually shave every day. I only wish that they would come out with an after shave balm. This sounds like a fake commercial but I have tried everything from gels to foams to creams and nothing works like this.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. I have always had sensitive skin. It has gotten worse as I have turned older -- to the point that I can only shave 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mentally, it takes some getting used to. It does not foam up like other gels. But works just the same. There is a slight tingle when applied. And NO razor rash when I am done. ( I do use a moisturizer every day as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey -- but good stuff!</li>
            <li> After seeing this product on a \\&quot;Best of 2013 Shave Products\\&quot; list I decided to try it and I was most definitely impressed. I had read other reviews about the numbing ingredient in it and I never realized how much of a difference it really would make. It is by far the BEST shave I have ever experienced and this is coming from someone with super sensitive skin and a really thick coarse beard. I still get the occasional bump or ingrown hair here and there but nothing compared to what I use to get before this. Face Skin Care Ultimate Shave Cream will be the only shave cream I use from here on out!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a substitute to lab series so I am very happy to find Face Skin Cares, it is a very good solution for me, I definitely will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;Herbert</li>
            <li> My husband used to use Lab Series so, I did too. I loved the way my legs felt. When they changed the product well, my husband had to find another product. Some of the stuff he tried, including the new Lab Series, not sooooo good.  He started using Face Shaving Cream and now, I do too. I have real problems with shaving my legs...irritation, bumps, in-grown hairs. Face Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream helps me get a close smooth shave that regular soap or other shave creams just can&#x27;t do. Face saves my skin and my legs feel silky smooth. My husband doesn&#x27;t mind sharing his shaving cream when my legs feel and look this good. THANKS FACE!!!! Date night legs are BACK!!!  [[ASIN:B008Z6IMOM Face Shaving Cream Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream with Lidocaine for Sensitive Skin]]</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible......nothing else one will use now or later will ever better than this.....My skin is super smooth.....BUT, You have to shave every other day....to enjoy the benefits....so ur skin can heal and replenish itself....dont forget to moisturize with a sensitive free, dye free, chemical free moisturizer...recommend men science moisturizer</li>
