            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>love the smell and feel as well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This spray lotion seemed better than the Yes to Coconut body balm, which was quite greasy and did not penetrate well, instead leaving my clothes and sheets oily.</li>
            <li>lotion has a very mild coconut smell and I love the pump</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, dries quickly, nongreasy.  </li>
            <li>This is an effective moisturizer in a convenient spray form, which makes it quick to apply.</li>
            <li>This goes on nicely and penetrates quickly, without feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>It is best-suited for spring-fall use and/or for people whose skin doesn&#x27;t get very dry; body butters seem best for winter use.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and goes on super easy.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on nice and light and absorbs quickly into your skin without feeling sticky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This goes nicely with the Yes to Coconut body scrub, which is gentle and not as drying as many scrubs, because it contains salt, sugar, and glycerin, along with coconut oil, of course.</li>
            <li>Cheap cheap packaging.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin hydrated and smooth</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, very nice product for the winter dry and bumpy skin, and stops the itching.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on the smell ;)</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a pleasant coconut, which is fairly strong initially (but I like coconut, so that&#x27;s a plus for me) and persists for hours as a mild</li>
            <li>love that most of the ingredients are natural as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also very handy for my twins with small fingers because they are able to get the lotion out easily and they don&#x27;t use too much.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>it soaks into my skin so quickly that i can easily get dressed right after.</li>
            <li>Kind of like old school sun tan lotion.</li>
            <li>The whole family has dry skin, and we go through this awesome lotion pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this for a family member,not the best but not the worse.</li>
            <li>It would really have been ok to instead make it 100% natural and leave the fragrance out.</li>
            <li>Great lotion but the sprayer is definitely not effective.</li>
            <li>Really really like this product.</li>
            <li>But I am very fussy about lotions.</li>
            <li>the lotion is okay, not as moisturizing as I would have expected.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>This new version of lotion in spray bottle works really well.</li>
            <li>It is an odd smelling coconut and a just okay moisturizer.</li>
            <li>lotion is light, so if you are looking for lotion for dry skin then this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>IF you are looking for a real Coconut scent that&#x27;s natural Organic</li>
            <li>More upsetting is that the spray feature stopped working within a few days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  still looking for a good body lotion that contains at least 95% natural ingredient and definitely no petrolatum( petroleum).</li>
            <li>Smells divine and makes my skin soft but not slimy.</li>
            <li>No problems on sensitive skin, either.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that I have very dry body skin, and very oily face, my luck</li>

            <li> I was told that the spray nozzle broke on first use and it didn&#x27;t have a real Coconut scent to fake and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; products but for the life of me I can&#x27;t understand why they have to put a fake coconut fragrance in it.</li>
            <li> I thought you could mist it on yourself, but it&#x27;s a steady hard spray</li>
            <li> and it only sprays about half the time.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize a little but not enough for me.</li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting..</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing but still a nice product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like a lot of other YesTo products but not this one.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not as moisturizing as shea or other body butters, but lotions never are.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t handle lotions or perfumes that are too heavily fragranced.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The sprayer will not work if the bottle is tilted the least bit while spraying it on your body.</li>
            <li> To late to return it.</li>
            <li> Sprays evenly and is moisturizing but not too thick.  </li>
            <li> but today while using it the sprayer came off the bottle and would not go back on making it impossible to use.</li>
            <li> the lotion itself is to thin ,on the watery side.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with the fake smell, as well.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut ... :  (</li>
            <li> Why not just coconut and leave out the awful perfume, or whatever was added to it.  </li>
            <li> But, I hate the smell!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells wonderful! It is not sticky after applying. This is my go to lotion these days.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff.  Smells divine and makes my skin soft but not slimy.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with the fake smell, as well. Why not just coconut and leave out the awful perfume, or whatever was added to it.  Otherwise, nice moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the lotion consistency. However it is not moisturizing enough for me. It does moisturize a little but not enough for me. My hands and body remain ashy. Keep in mind that I have very dry body skin, and very oily face, my luck, right!!! I&#x27;m  still looking for a good body lotion that contains at least 95% natural ingredient and definitely no petrolatum( petroleum). I will not re-purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Sprays evenly and is moisturizing but not too thick.  Really really like this product.</li>
            <li> It felt too greasy. But I am very fussy about lotions. It smells wonderful and I do like the spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Perfect for just after showering and drying off... I have it hanging on my shower caddy.</li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting.. It is an odd smelling coconut and a just okay moisturizer. But I still like it.</li>
            <li> I love the product but the spray bottle broke after one use.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea but it needs perfecting. The sprayer will not work if the bottle is tilted the least bit while spraying it on your body. I got use to that but today while using it the sprayer came off the bottle and would not go back on making it impossible to use. To late to return it.</li>
            <li> The perfect summer lotion, for winter use you might want to go with something thicker but for summer it works great.  The lotion goes on nice and light and absorbs quickly into your skin without feeling sticky.  It has a nice light coconut scent that reminds me of summers at the pool as a kid</li>
            <li> Smells divine. Kind of like old school sun tan lotion. I will keep repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This product is a birthday gift for my daughter, but I&#x27;m assuming it will be perfect for her, as she uses body lotion and loves the smell of coconut.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! If you want your skin to feel amazing and not greasy, this is what you want!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut ... :  (</li>
            <li> the lotion is okay, not as moisturizing as I would have expected.  More upsetting is that the spray feature stopped working within a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like a lot of other YesTo products but not this one. The smell was so off putting I couldn&#x27;t use it. Best I could describe is, the butter popcorn flavored JellyBelly jelly bean. I&#x27;m not kidding. That&#x27;s the image that came to my mind after not having jelly belly&#x27;s in YEARS. Too bad. Gave to friend who didn&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;spray gun&amp;#34; cap broke within about 10 uses. Cheap cheap packaging.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Smells amazing and goes on super easy. Leaves skin hydrated and smooth</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  The whole family has dry skin, and we go through this awesome lotion pretty fast.  No problems on sensitive skin, either.</li>
            <li> Smells great and glides on smooth. Non greasy!!</li>
            <li> Great lotion and I love the spray bottle function.</li>
            <li> The Yes to... line of products is always a reliable good bet for quality at a fair price. This new version of lotion in spray bottle works really well. Glad to find it!</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;Say yes to coconuts&amp;#34; hand and cuticle cream. I wanted this to provide the same level of hydration. I was a little disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing but still a nice product.</li>
            <li> Great lotion but the sprayer is definitely not effective. I thought you could mist it on yourself, but it&#x27;s a steady hard spray so I have to spray it to my hands and rub in anyways.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS. it soaks into my skin so quickly that i can easily get dressed right after.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels and the spray bottle is great. But, I hate the smell! I&#x27;m a huge fan of the &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; products but for the life of me I can&#x27;t understand why they have to put a fake coconut fragrance in it. It&#x27;s like a plastic coconut smell. It would really have been ok to instead make it 100% natural and leave the fragrance out.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, very nice product for the winter dry and bumpy skin, and stops the itching. It also smells good. I recommend to those not offended by a coconut smell, will buy again if skin gets itchy and bumpy next winter, and I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> It smells like old-school play-doh and it only sprays about half the time. As a moisturizer it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t handle lotions or perfumes that are too heavily fragranced.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has a very mild coconut smell and I love the pump action.&lt;br /&gt;It is also very handy for my twins with small fingers because they are able to get the lotion out easily and they don&#x27;t use too much.&lt;br /&gt;They love the smell and feel as well.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is light, so if you are looking for lotion for dry skin then this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;But if you just need a light summer lotion with a great light scent, this is the perfect lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I love that most of the ingredients are natural as well.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, dries quickly, nongreasy.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on the smell ;)</li>
            <li> This is an effective moisturizer in a convenient spray form, which makes it quick to apply. This goes on nicely and penetrates quickly, without feeling sticky. This lotion is not as moisturizing as shea or other body butters, but lotions never are. It is best-suited for spring-fall use and/or for people whose skin doesn&#x27;t get very dry; body butters seem best for winter use. The fragrance is a pleasant coconut, which is fairly strong initially (but I like coconut, so that&#x27;s a plus for me) and persists for hours as a mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes nicely with the Yes to Coconut body scrub, which is gentle and not as drying as many scrubs, because it contains salt, sugar, and glycerin, along with coconut oil, of course. This spray lotion seemed better than the Yes to Coconut body balm, which was quite greasy and did not penetrate well, instead leaving my clothes and sheets oily.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a family member,not the best but not the worse. I was told that the spray nozzle broke on first use and it didn&#x27;t have a real Coconut scent to fake and the lotion itself is to thin ,on the watery side.Only reason I purchased this for family member is because they use yes products for years.IF you are looking for a real Coconut scent that&#x27;s natural Organic I suggest organic fields of Heather I use it and it&#x27;s the best I have ever purchased and it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
