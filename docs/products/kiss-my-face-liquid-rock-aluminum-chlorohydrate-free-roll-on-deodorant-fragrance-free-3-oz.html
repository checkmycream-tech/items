    <ol>
            <li>Works great all day!</li>
            <li>Finally, a wonderful product with no aluminum ingredient!!</li>
            <li>Sooo happy to have found this!!</li>
            <li>Great Stuff!</li>
            <li>I have found that using A LOT works the best, but I still use a scented lotion or perfume just to cover anything the deodorant does not.</li>
            <li>Great stuff in my opinion!</li>
            <li>This is the best deoderant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I ordered this stuff because my Mom told me it works awesome.</li>
            <li>So, it isn&#x27;t perfect, but what can I expect.  </li>
            <li>I think this is the best deodorant I have ever used</li>
            <li>KMF Liquid Rock is great!  </li>
            <li>and she is very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Best deodorant ever!  </li>
            <li>Another great thing is my clothes do not have any odor/fragrance/stain on them</li>
            <li>My Face Liquid Rock works great though.  </li>
            <li>Great product, been using it for years - but will never buy from this supplier again.  </li>
            <li>Great product...</li>
            <li>Great for those with allergies.  </li>
            <li>No scent at all and works great for me.</li>
            <li>but the product was good.</li>
            <li>best of all - they are cruelty free-</li>
            <li>this product also has a musty smell that wears off after drying but not too good smelling.  </li>
            <li>It no longer lasts more than 8 hours and isn&#x27;t great with wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>On top of that, I now have to pay for the return shipping!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>So while I was happy to be pain free, now I was embarrassed and self-conscious about my stinkiness.  </li>
            <li>So to each his/her own.</li>
            <li>While I still sweat with this product a bit, it&#x27;s not as much, I don&#x27;t have pit stains, and best of all there&#x27;s no odor all day</li>
            <li>I gave up on the doctors and tried an experiment on my own.  </li>
            <li>I think I would rather smell my own body odor.</li>
            <li>We used to use gilette which smells nice, but my ex could not control the sweat and he had stains on his under t-shirts.  </li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, although I think the fragrance free is the best.  </li>
            <li>Very mild, but effective formula.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>However, make sure you buy the unscented.  </li>
            <li>I found this product as a travel size in the organic section of my grocery store, I tried it and was extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Most don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly love the product</li>
            <li>this is definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>With this deodorant I feel confident raising my arms again.  </li>
            <li>I AM SO GLAD</li>
            <li>I use this during the day and pat some off after applying for a better  affect.</li>
            <li>so I got the fragrance free kind</li>
            <li>you know how many companies abuse animals every day?</li>
            <li>This KMF product is excellent - almost totally fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>love the roll-on and invisible application.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Switched to Deodomom and have better results.</li>
            <li>I switched to Herban Cowboy-Power Greens and got much better results.</li>
            <li>Had tried many different types but this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, as a deodorant it works, but it is NOT aluminum free!</li>
            <li>and I have been using this product for a year now and love it.</li>
            <li>I like it ok.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my radiology tech and was so glad to be able to stop using after treatments.  </li>
            <li>We bought 3 more bottles to keep on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most deodorants.</li>
            <li>I had used this product many years ago without any problems but since time the product has changes and irritates my underarms.  </li>
            <li>This was my favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>Many, many problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If no one has ever had a problem with it because of the parabens, and the product works better with them, then LEAVE THEM IN.</li>
            <li>I went looking for a new deodorant and saw the great reviews this one was getting and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>Was pleased to find them available here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also an intelligent human being, so I do not want to stop my body from sweating any more than I&#x27;d try to stop it from digesting food - sweating</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, affordable, and has solved my problems.  </li>
            <li>I suspect using an antiperspirant caused my body to over-compensate by producing more sweat to cool off.  </li>
            <li>The roll on works just fine</li>
            <li>I have the fragrance free version.  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Aluminum Free Deodorant, Fragrance Free, 3.1-Oz Sticks (Pack of 6)]]  </li>
            <li>But I am much more confident with this product and am glad to have found something natural that works.</li>
            <li>I use the fragrance free version which to me smells a bit of witch hazel, but it&#x27;s not too noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased it several times and have always been happy with it.</li>
            <li>aluminum free.</li>
            <li>Being a profuse sweater, I tended to use things like Mitchum, which worked great, but which did god only knows what to my health.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless of any of this, the product is DOO DOO now, and it was a fantastic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good, clear deodorant for a while</li>
            <li>This is a really good natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Overall, it works well and is a good value.</li>
            <li>I had been using Old Spice deodorant/antiperspirant for the longest time and while I liked the scent, I would still sweat buckets</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d smell funky after a full day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lightweight liquid which dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that this is an effect of  - some lucky people&#x27;s - sweat interacting with antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I choose a 4 because it has a mild scent</li>
            <li>I could notice body odor on myself, and my significant other even mentioned to me that I smelled--and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>It really is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It works as good as can be expected.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to most scents</li>
            <li>This is my favorite natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps me smelling fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>I was scared of the aluminum in the products, so I thought I&#x27;d try more natural products.</li>
            <li>This one really works with my body chemistry, so it may not work for everyone, as we are all so chemically unique, but I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>Cool weather,warm weather,working or doing nothing,it absolutely did not work for me.</li>
            <li>most other products, even fragrance free ones, give me a rash.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use a LOT and COVER the entire area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and I believe some days are better than others, but I still feel worried when I wear this, especially if I&#x27;m doing any activity where I&#x27;ll sweat</li>
            <li>In any case, the two are quite different products, and I find that the stick works better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for about four years now, and it&#x27;s still my fave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product works for me in hot weather, and it works all day.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll start with the basics, first off</li>
            <li>Love this entire brand!</li>
            <li>Works wonderful, and small enough to take with you on vacation in the carry on.</li>
            <li>I think I will purchase the fragrance one next &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the unscented, but traditionally have found KMF&#x27;s scents pleasant (I use the lavender-shea lotion daily)</li>
            <li>In the future, I will continue to opt for the stick, but keep in mind that different products might work better for different people--plenty of people use potassium alum-based deodorants with good luck, but I must not be one of them.ack of consistent effectiveness.</li>
            <li>In the future, I will continue to opt for the stick, but keep in mind that different products might work better for different people--plenty of people use potassium alum-based deodorants with good luck, but I must not be one of them.</li>
            <li>Now, at first it wasn&#x27;t really working for me, by the end of the day</li>
            <li>This works well under stress, much better than some I have tried, unsented and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The others have an odd odor and don&#x27;t seem as effective.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume, and I&#x27;d certainly rather smell a bit of witch hazel than</li>
            <li>For most days, I apply this only once (although on very hot days, I might need to apply a second time halfway through the day).  </li>
            <li>Next time I will read more carefully, but product works fine.</li>
            <li>Prevent odor very well, goes on smoothly, is not sloppy.</li>
            <li>I was very unimpressed.  </li>
            <li>serves several important purposes.  </li>
            <li>Somewhere about mid-day, I would really start to offend myself.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything and was ready to give up.  </li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>I might as well have worn absolutely nothing, and paid $7 for it.</li>
            <li>Not as much a fan of the scented,</li>
            <li>I have been using this for quite a while now just because I really couldn&#x27;t decide what to say for the review.</li>
            <li>Every paraben and aluminum free product I tried left me stinky, and I tried all of them.</li>
            <li>According to the FDA, there are no risks in the amounts that they legally allow.</li>
            <li>So who the heck knows what the real story is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I appreciate the intent behind this product: a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant, no added scents (although I wonder if the scented version might seem to work better), and a recyclable bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the search for a better all natural deodrant that actually works.</li>
            <li>However, I have found that putting it on right after showering (I am a night showerer) and then reapplying in the morning works wayyyy better then leaving bare arms for too long.</li>
            <li>I have to buy my daughter fragrance free products because she is highly allergic to perfumes and essential oils.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine all day long.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried that works for me.</li>
            <li>The problem was I could not locate the full size product anywhere locally, until I took my search to amazon, thank goodness for amazon.com</li>
            <li>but anyway, it is quite impressive and even if you do get a little stinky, it really tones it down to wear someone would have to take a big sniff of your armpit to even notice.</li>
            <li>I think it is good for the winter months, but during the summer it only lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li>Finding an effective, natural deodorant was a long trial and error process, but I finally struck gold with this product.  </li>
            <li>so I tried their roll on deodorant with high hopes.</li>
            <li>some research and found KMF roll on deo was highly rated for killing smell and not leaving stains.  </li>
            <li>although it contains corn starch and \\&quot;clay\\&quot; (presumably the ingredient listed as kaolin); the liquid version here is primarily potassium alum (an antiseptic, which should really work but just doesn&#x27;t seem to for me), although there are other ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d take a sniff and smell pure body odor and would be self conscious.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, three stars is the best I can give this due to its lack of consistent effectiveness.</li>
            <li>We weren&#x27;t allowed to use reguar deoderant of any kind, so as you might guess, when I graduated and moved out, I went strait for the \\&quot;hard stuff\\</li>
            <li>, I just thought that was as good as it gets for deodorant, smelling like sweat and flowers, which the flowers almost made it worse</li>
            <li>Every time I found a new one, I tried it.</li>
            <li>The true test was a day that I put the deodorant on after a shower at 3:00pm, then went out dancing late into the night, then had one of those sleeps full of sweaty tossing and turning.</li>
            <li>I did read and I believe it is true, that once you stop using traditional deodarant and antiperspants it takes a while for your body to clean out the pores and stop smelling, as the other products actually block your pores, once I went thru this stage I can go a whole day, doing anything</li>
            <li>I was very surprised.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert where it is hot, and I have a physical, outdoor job.  </li>
            <li>The natural deodorant search began!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find my personal odor offensive, but since I&#x27;m often sweating in exercise classes or at the gym or on hot dance floors I want to be considerate of my neighbors.</li>
            <li>A sucky product that checks off all the environmental \\&quot;dos\\&quot; is NOT BETTER than a great product that has a few flaws.</li>
            <li>This deodorant keeps me dry and fresh all day</li>
            <li>I am a male, and my arm hairs always get snagged in the ball which is not fun, but not terrible.</li>
            <li>you know the full aluminum chlorohidrate heavy duty stuff,  sprays choked me, some of the deodorant sticks contained too much perfume</li>
            <li>At age fifteen I had a reaction to Regular drug store deoderant and developed large one inch cysts all underneath my arms.</li>
            <li>There is no gooey, gummy feeling like I get from clear, stick deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I definitely have to clean my underarms daily and sometimes clean up at noon time depending on how active I am or whether I&#x27;ve been outside.---I could go a second day with the Mitchem,  </li>
            <li>The only downside is you really have to completely slather it all over your underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally settled on Mitchem only to find that in time it didn&#x27;t work--especially here in Florida --and especially when I most needed it such as in dance class.  </li>
            <li>this product was nearly depleted, I bought [[ASIN:B001FB5HFQ</li>
            <li>This deodorant i like that its all natural, plus it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a million natural (aluminum and paraben-free) deodorants - Tom&#x27;s, Desert Essence, JASON...</li>
            <li>I am a VERY oily person and have always been extra sweaty/hormonal</li>
            <li>So all in all, knowing that this product is much safer than the ones out there and with how well it worked for me, I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li>and it is natural.  </li>
            <li>Another thing to note is the majority of natural deodorants have this ingredient.</li>
            <li>My ex and I decided to try some natural products when we were still together, and this is the one that stuck.  </li>
            <li>Like lots of others here, I have wanted to change to a natural deodorant product for years.</li>
            <li>I also use certain dry at night and it&#x27;s helped me stay fresh - although certain dry took two months to finally work, it&#x27;s officially saved my life!</li>
            <li>First it is wet</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s so wet when you put it on</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s weird though is usually my right armpit smells more than my left</li>
            <li>but this product keeps me feeling and smelling fresh all day when other natural products weakened mid day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend over all the other natural deodorants, even Tom&#x27;s of Maine new roll-on version.</li>
            <li>It also has a strange, foul stink to it when you first apply it, however the smell wears off completely shortly after application.</li>
            <li>However, the ingredients and mechanism are actually quite different: the main ingredient in the stick is some sort of \\&quot;natural vegetable</li>
            <li>I really like this deoderant that I ordered over other natural brands.</li>
            <li>Only natural roll-on deodorant I will use.  </li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant which has worked for me.</li>
            <li>I think the trade off for a natural product, and letting my body actually sweat, is A-OK.</li>
            <li>One of the other reviewers said that they really slathered it on, which I wasn&#x27;t doing.  </li>
            <li>This goes on quite wet, but once it drys it really help keep me dry and not stink!</li>
            <li>It washes off easily at night and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or pasty residue that is hard to come off like any other deodorant.</li>
            <li>I use this daily plus use the Certain Dri liquid roll on (which goes on at night) for a couple of days every few months and it keeps my sweating under control.</li>

            <li> I think I would rather smell my own body odor.</li>
            <li> We used to use gilette which smells nice, but my ex could not control the sweat and he had stains on his under t-shirts.  </li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, although I think the fragrance free is the best.  </li>
            <li> Very mild, but effective formula.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> However, make sure you buy the unscented.  </li>
            <li> I found this product as a travel size in the organic section of my grocery store, I tried it and was extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Most don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly love the product</li>
            <li> this is definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> With this deodorant I feel confident raising my arms again.  </li>
            <li> I AM SO GLAD</li>
            <li> I use this during the day and pat some off after applying for a better  affect.</li>
            <li> so I got the fragrance free kind</li>
            <li> you know how many companies abuse animals every day?</li>
            <li> This KMF product is excellent - almost totally fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> love the roll-on and invisible application.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> Switched to Deodomom and have better results.</li>
            <li> I switched to Herban Cowboy-Power Greens and got much better results.</li>
            <li> Had tried many different types but this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, as a deodorant it works, but it is NOT aluminum free!</li>
            <li> and I have been using this product for a year now and love it.</li>
            <li> I like it ok.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my radiology tech and was so glad to be able to stop using after treatments.  </li>
            <li> We bought 3 more bottles to keep on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most deodorants.</li>
            <li> I had used this product many years ago without any problems but since time the product has changes and irritates my underarms.  </li>
            <li> This was my favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li> Many, many problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If no one has ever had a problem with it because of the parabens, and the product works better with them, then LEAVE THEM IN.</li>
            <li> I went looking for a new deodorant and saw the great reviews this one was getting and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> Was pleased to find them available here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also an intelligent human being, so I do not want to stop my body from sweating any more than I&#x27;d try to stop it from digesting food - sweating</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, affordable, and has solved my problems.  </li>
            <li> I suspect using an antiperspirant caused my body to over-compensate by producing more sweat to cool off.  </li>
            <li> The roll on works just fine</li>
            <li> I have the fragrance free version.  </li>
            <li> This is fantastic deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Aluminum Free Deodorant, Fragrance Free, 3.1-Oz Sticks (Pack of 6)]]  </li>
            <li> But I am much more confident with this product and am glad to have found something natural that works.</li>
            <li> I use the fragrance free version which to me smells a bit of witch hazel, but it&#x27;s not too noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased it several times and have always been happy with it.</li>
            <li> aluminum free.</li>
            <li> Being a profuse sweater, I tended to use things like Mitchum, which worked great, but which did god only knows what to my health.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless of any of this, the product is DOO DOO now, and it was a fantastic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good, clear deodorant for a while</li>
            <li> This is a really good natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Overall, it works well and is a good value.</li>
            <li> I had been using Old Spice deodorant/antiperspirant for the longest time and while I liked the scent, I would still sweat buckets</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d smell funky after a full day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lightweight liquid which dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that this is an effect of  - some lucky people&#x27;s - sweat interacting with antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I choose a 4 because it has a mild scent</li>
            <li> I could notice body odor on myself, and my significant other even mentioned to me that I smelled--and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> It really is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> It works as good as can be expected.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to most scents</li>
            <li> This is my favorite natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps me smelling fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> I was scared of the aluminum in the products, so I thought I&#x27;d try more natural products.</li>
            <li> This one really works with my body chemistry, so it may not work for everyone, as we are all so chemically unique, but I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> Cool weather,warm weather,working or doing nothing,it absolutely did not work for me.</li>
            <li> most other products, even fragrance free ones, give me a rash.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use a LOT and COVER the entire area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and I believe some days are better than others, but I still feel worried when I wear this, especially if I&#x27;m doing any activity where I&#x27;ll sweat</li>
            <li> In any case, the two are quite different products, and I find that the stick works better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for about four years now, and it&#x27;s still my fave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> product works for me in hot weather, and it works all day.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll start with the basics, first off</li>
            <li> Love this entire brand!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful, and small enough to take with you on vacation in the carry on.</li>
            <li> I think I will purchase the fragrance one next &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the unscented, but traditionally have found KMF&#x27;s scents pleasant (I use the lavender-shea lotion daily)</li>
            <li> In the future, I will continue to opt for the stick, but keep in mind that different products might work better for different people--plenty of people use potassium alum-based deodorants with good luck, but I must not be one of them.ack of consistent effectiveness.</li>
            <li> In the future, I will continue to opt for the stick, but keep in mind that different products might work better for different people--plenty of people use potassium alum-based deodorants with good luck, but I must not be one of them.</li>
            <li> Now, at first it wasn&#x27;t really working for me, by the end of the day</li>
            <li> This works well under stress, much better than some I have tried, unsented and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The others have an odd odor and don&#x27;t seem as effective.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume, and I&#x27;d certainly rather smell a bit of witch hazel than</li>
            <li> For most days, I apply this only once (although on very hot days, I might need to apply a second time halfway through the day).  </li>
            <li> Next time I will read more carefully, but product works fine.</li>
            <li> Prevent odor very well, goes on smoothly, is not sloppy.</li>
            <li> I was very unimpressed.  </li>
            <li> serves several important purposes.  </li>
            <li> Somewhere about mid-day, I would really start to offend myself.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything and was ready to give up.  </li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> I might as well have worn absolutely nothing, and paid $7 for it.</li>
            <li> Not as much a fan of the scented,</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quite a while now just because I really couldn&#x27;t decide what to say for the review.</li>
            <li> Every paraben and aluminum free product I tried left me stinky, and I tried all of them.</li>
            <li> According to the FDA, there are no risks in the amounts that they legally allow.</li>
            <li> So who the heck knows what the real story is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I appreciate the intent behind this product: a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant, no added scents (although I wonder if the scented version might seem to work better), and a recyclable bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the search for a better all natural deodrant that actually works.</li>
            <li> However, I have found that putting it on right after showering (I am a night showerer) and then reapplying in the morning works wayyyy better then leaving bare arms for too long.</li>
            <li> I have to buy my daughter fragrance free products because she is highly allergic to perfumes and essential oils.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fine all day long.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried that works for me.</li>
            <li> The problem was I could not locate the full size product anywhere locally, until I took my search to amazon, thank goodness for amazon.com</li>
            <li> but anyway, it is quite impressive and even if you do get a little stinky, it really tones it down to wear someone would have to take a big sniff of your armpit to even notice.</li>
            <li> I think it is good for the winter months, but during the summer it only lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Finding an effective, natural deodorant was a long trial and error process, but I finally struck gold with this product.  </li>
            <li> so I tried their roll on deodorant with high hopes.</li>
            <li> some research and found KMF roll on deo was highly rated for killing smell and not leaving stains.  </li>
            <li> although it contains corn starch and \\&quot;clay\\&quot; (presumably the ingredient listed as kaolin); the liquid version here is primarily potassium alum (an antiseptic, which should really work but just doesn&#x27;t seem to for me), although there are other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d take a sniff and smell pure body odor and would be self conscious.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, three stars is the best I can give this due to its lack of consistent effectiveness.</li>
            <li> We weren&#x27;t allowed to use reguar deoderant of any kind, so as you might guess, when I graduated and moved out, I went strait for the \\&quot;hard stuff\\</li>
            <li> , I just thought that was as good as it gets for deodorant, smelling like sweat and flowers, which the flowers almost made it worse</li>
            <li> Every time I found a new one, I tried it.</li>
            <li> The true test was a day that I put the deodorant on after a shower at 3:00pm, then went out dancing late into the night, then had one of those sleeps full of sweaty tossing and turning.</li>
            <li> I did read and I believe it is true, that once you stop using traditional deodarant and antiperspants it takes a while for your body to clean out the pores and stop smelling, as the other products actually block your pores, once I went thru this stage I can go a whole day, doing anything</li>
            <li> I was very surprised.  </li>
            <li> I live in the desert where it is hot, and I have a physical, outdoor job.  </li>
            <li> The natural deodorant search began!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find my personal odor offensive, but since I&#x27;m often sweating in exercise classes or at the gym or on hot dance floors I want to be considerate of my neighbors.</li>
            <li> A sucky product that checks off all the environmental \\&quot;dos\\&quot; is NOT BETTER than a great product that has a few flaws.</li>
            <li> This deodorant keeps me dry and fresh all day</li>
            <li> I am a male, and my arm hairs always get snagged in the ball which is not fun, but not terrible.</li>
            <li> you know the full aluminum chlorohidrate heavy duty stuff,  sprays choked me, some of the deodorant sticks contained too much perfume</li>
            <li> At age fifteen I had a reaction to Regular drug store deoderant and developed large one inch cysts all underneath my arms.</li>
            <li> There is no gooey, gummy feeling like I get from clear, stick deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I definitely have to clean my underarms daily and sometimes clean up at noon time depending on how active I am or whether I&#x27;ve been outside.---I could go a second day with the Mitchem,  </li>
            <li> The only downside is you really have to completely slather it all over your underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally settled on Mitchem only to find that in time it didn&#x27;t work--especially here in Florida --and especially when I most needed it such as in dance class.  </li>
            <li> this product was nearly depleted, I bought [[ASIN:B001FB5HFQ</li>
            <li> This deodorant i like that its all natural, plus it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million natural (aluminum and paraben-free) deodorants - Tom&#x27;s, Desert Essence, JASON...</li>
            <li> I am a VERY oily person and have always been extra sweaty/hormonal</li>
            <li> So all in all, knowing that this product is much safer than the ones out there and with how well it worked for me, I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> and it is natural.  </li>
            <li> Another thing to note is the majority of natural deodorants have this ingredient.</li>
            <li> My ex and I decided to try some natural products when we were still together, and this is the one that stuck.  </li>
            <li> Like lots of others here, I have wanted to change to a natural deodorant product for years.</li>
            <li> I also use certain dry at night and it&#x27;s helped me stay fresh - although certain dry took two months to finally work, it&#x27;s officially saved my life!</li>
            <li> First it is wet</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s so wet when you put it on</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s weird though is usually my right armpit smells more than my left</li>
            <li> but this product keeps me feeling and smelling fresh all day when other natural products weakened mid day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend over all the other natural deodorants, even Tom&#x27;s of Maine new roll-on version.</li>
            <li> It also has a strange, foul stink to it when you first apply it, however the smell wears off completely shortly after application.</li>
            <li> However, the ingredients and mechanism are actually quite different: the main ingredient in the stick is some sort of \\&quot;natural vegetable</li>
            <li> I really like this deoderant that I ordered over other natural brands.</li>
            <li> Only natural roll-on deodorant I will use.  </li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant which has worked for me.</li>
            <li> I think the trade off for a natural product, and letting my body actually sweat, is A-OK.</li>
            <li> One of the other reviewers said that they really slathered it on, which I wasn&#x27;t doing.  </li>
            <li> This goes on quite wet, but once it drys it really help keep me dry and not stink!</li>
            <li> It washes off easily at night and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or pasty residue that is hard to come off like any other deodorant.</li>
            <li> I use this daily plus use the Certain Dri liquid roll on (which goes on at night) for a couple of days every few months and it keeps my sweating under control.</li>
            <li> (For the record, I also like the stick by Tom&#x27;s, which is the only other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s maybe not quite as harmful as other aluminum, it&#x27;s still the same ingredient 90% of people that go towards natural deodorants are trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> Due to allergies, I have to use natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Kiss My Face Natural Active Life</li>
            <li> As other reviews state it goes on heavy, which is necessary, but it dries quickly, a lot faster than other liquid roll on types I have used.</li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t do its job with lasting long at all.</li>
            <li> The Tom&#x27;s Long Lasting (24 hr) unscented stick deodorant was like putting on water.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it takes a while for the deodorant to dry.  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t show on my pits at all, and there have been no marks on my clothes so far, even my black shirts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat much with it, and even if I do, there is hardly any body odor, this deodorant covers it up.</li>
            <li> Works well, lasts long.  </li>
            <li> The product lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t sting after shaving.  </li>
            <li> The day I was at the imaging center for my second mammogram</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time &amp; doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li> It rolls on wet just like a regular Roll on product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and no issues...</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to dry and it didn&#x27;t deodorize.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others and have always been very disappointed, but have kept trying to find a winner; this one, when applied generously, keeps me smelling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I have used other deodoants such as Tom&#x27;s of Maine that didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> The con is that the roll-on takes awhile to dry</li>
            <li> I apply it generously on dry skin, after my morning shower.  </li>
            <li> You do need to let it dry after you put it on, of course.</li>
            <li> I put this on as soon as I&#x27;m dry after my shower.</li>
            <li> It glides on, I would recommend covering the entire area and beyond, while holding the bottle upside down, so that the liquid gets dispersed by the ball.</li>
            <li> The only con is that takes takes a bit to dry, so I usually hit it with my hair dryer on a low setting before I get dressed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are other disadvantages to this liquid, as well: the solvent is water, which can take a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> it also isn&#x27;t long lasting and reapplication is needed after a few hours.</li>
            <li> It just goes on very wet, it needs time to dry before you put clothes on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this unscented deodorant on and off for the last few weeks and it does not work.</li>
            <li> I just roll it on and get dressed, it leaves no stains or residues even if it is still wet.</li>
            <li> sweat pretty heavily, and I&#x27;m not dainty in the personal odor department.  </li>
            <li> I was curious, so I looked it up.</li>
            <li> Other aluminum-free deodorants never worked for me.</li>
            <li> I wear this to avoid the chemicals in other deodorants and because wear a cologne with it.  </li>
            <li> Tricky little - well, not so little - increase in price per unit with a totally unreasonable postal charge!!!  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to dry, but that&#x27;s not a problem because I can do my hair or put my makeup on while it&#x27;s drying.</li>
            <li> My Face Scented Active Enzyme Stick Deodorant, 2.48-Ounce</li>
            <li> My Face Active Life stick deodorant and it smells way better than this crap.</li>
            <li> I work hard, I sweat, and sometimes I smell (especially if I&#x27;ve been drinking coffee).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my Mo had purchased the same kind in the Patchouli scent and it was so so bad</li>
            <li> If my worst smell was 10, this will let me get to a 1 or at most a 3, where as a regular antiperspirant will keep me at 0.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about still sweating since it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, however, I&#x27;m sweating less since using it.  </li>
            <li> I had used this brand previously and never had any issues with it leaving me unprotected.</li>
            <li> I am very active at work even though I have to wear dress suits</li>
            <li> I still perspire when nervous and there is a bit of a smell that dissipates quickly but makes me nervous about whether I smell bad at times.</li>
            <li> Wish price would be little cheaper.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a lot if you think about how little of ingredients this deodorant has.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really shocked this natural deodorant product actually works!</li>
            <li> I tried applying it HEAVILY and what an improvement.  </li>
            <li> My Face product works for your everyday office or work setting.</li>
            <li> I have try a few deodorants without aluminum and they always made my underarms sticky.</li>
            <li> On the recommendation of my dear friend the yoga instructor, I gave my body a few weeks to acclimate to each and none of them ever worked.  </li>
            <li> I have read a large number of reviews saying this &amp;#34;fragance-free&amp;#34; roll on smells awful, so when I was in the deodorant aisle the other day I opened one up and tried the old sniff test.</li>
            <li> Since I am allergic to the active ingredient in all antiperspirants, I have a difficult time finding a product that does not cause irritation and actually works.</li>
            <li> I really hate added fragrances in body products: too many smells, and some of them are frankly irritating to allergies.</li>
            <li> This shipping was horribly slow, it took almost 2 weeks to get to me from just a few states away..</li>
            <li> but somehow it helped him in that area and there were no more issues.  </li>
            <li> So, no more Liquid Rock either.</li>
            <li> get a little tired of the green flag waving.</li>
            <li> The scented one smells nasty,,,,at least to me.</li>
            <li> It did not prevent body odor, the fragrance free smelled terrible (like rotten alcohol if that were a thing).</li>
            <li> This definitely has a fragrance and it is atrocious.</li>
            <li> I prefer to purchase from companies that don&#x27;t test on animals and who keep toxic chemicals to a minimum, at the very least.</li>
            <li> Total misrepresentation and very disappointing....</li>
            <li> I figured that could at least be a backup if the deodorant fails again).</li>
            <li> Anyway, I used to always use Secret and NEVER</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s being stupid, in the other direction.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would have been too faint to notice</li>
            <li> I was so worried I had kidney stones or cancer or something horribly wrong.  </li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e always been skeptical of all these &amp;#34;natural deodorants&amp;#34; that have no odor and kill the root of the smell, bacteria.</li>
            <li> Works well, but unfortunately still irritated my underarms.</li>
            <li> And one of the reasons I won&#x27;t eat oatmeal anymore because with the bran left in, it tastes terrible.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to heal myself.  </li>
            <li> , it smells terrible, seriously awful, but, it goes on clear, does not leave any residue on your shirt and dries with no smell.</li>
            <li> Had used Tom&#x27;s of Maine sticks with bad luck (they were terrible and made me smell worse) and I had used Kiss</li>
            <li> However, my girl friend uses it with bad luck</li>

            <li> About a year ago I started having some bad pains in my kidneys.  </li>
            <li> After being disappointed with Tom&#x27;s brand, we decided to try KMF.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> But the worst of it was all my shirts getting ruined by permanent pit stains from the aluminum in the antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  It&#x27;s a lightweight liquid which dries quickly.  It is non-scented and leaves no stain on clothes.  It works as good as can be expected.</li>
            <li> Only natural roll-on deodorant I will use.  Works well, lasts long.  However, make sure you buy the unscented.  The scented one smells nasty,,,,at least to me.</li>
            <li> The one and only deo that worked for me. Works great all day!</li>
            <li> Finally, a wonderful product with no aluminum ingredient!! This deodorant keeps me dry and fresh all day and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the health problems associated with aluminum. Other aluminum-free deodorants never worked for me. Sooo happy to have found this!!</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry and then it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve put anything on at all.  I was very unimpressed.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good, clear deodorant for a while and this is definitely not it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this unscented deodorant on and off for the last few weeks and it does not work.Cool weather,warm weather,working or doing nothing,it absolutely did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff! It works when nothing else will!</li>
            <li> This is one of the first natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried that works for me. It really is fragrance free. After spending the afternoon mowing in the sun I was still protected. Another great thing is my clothes do not have any odor/fragrance/stain on them and I can hang them back up in the closet. Also, this saves time and money on the laundry bill. The con is that the roll-on takes awhile to dry but I help it along with a hair dryer. I do put a generous amount on. Should I have any problems this summer with the product I&#x27;ll report back.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant which has worked for me. Love it! As other reviews state it goes on heavy, which is necessary, but it dries quickly, a lot faster than other liquid roll on types I have used. I just roll it on and get dressed, it leaves no stains or residues even if it is still wet. I am sensitive to most scents so I use the unscented and have no problem with under arm odor, the scented ones are not necessary. I will never go back to chemical deodorants again.</li>
            <li> Since I am allergic to the active ingredient in all antiperspirants, I have a difficult time finding a product that does not cause irritation and actually works. I found this product as a travel size in the organic section of my grocery store, I tried it and was extremely satisfied. The problem was I could not locate the full size product anywhere locally, until I took my search to amazon, thank goodness for amazon.com</li>
            <li> Due to allergies, I have to use natural deodorants.  Most don&#x27;t work.  This one does.  For most days, I apply this only once (although on very hot days, I might need to apply a second time halfway through the day).  The product lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t sting after shaving.  The only downside is that it takes a while for the deodorant to dry.  Overall, it works well and is a good value.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly love the product</li>
            <li> Had used Tom&#x27;s of Maine sticks with bad luck (they were terrible and made me smell worse) and I had used Kiss My Face shampoo before so I tried their roll on deodorant with high hopes. It glides on, I would recommend covering the entire area and beyond, while holding the bottle upside down, so that the liquid gets dispersed by the ball. I am a male, and my arm hairs always get snagged in the ball which is not fun, but not terrible. The deodorant doesn&#x27;t let me get to a STINK. If my worst smell was 10, this will let me get to a 1 or at most a 3, where as a regular antiperspirant will keep me at 0. I think the trade off for a natural product, and letting my body actually sweat, is A-OK. It also has a strange, foul stink to it when you first apply it, however the smell wears off completely shortly after application. Doesn&#x27;t create any build up. Highly recommend over all the other natural deodorants, even Tom&#x27;s of Maine new roll-on version. However, my girl friend uses it with bad luck (she gets stinky... I suggested it was her application but she tells me otherwise...) So to each his/her own. Try it out! Just make sure you use a LOT and COVER the entire area.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite natural deodorant.  I put it on in the morning and I&#x27;m fine all day long.</li>
            <li> I work hard, I sweat, and sometimes I smell (especially if I&#x27;ve been drinking coffee).  Hey, I&#x27;m a human being.  I&#x27;m also an intelligent human being, so I do not want to stop my body from sweating any more than I&#x27;d try to stop it from digesting food - sweating serves several important purposes.  Finding an effective, natural deodorant was a long trial and error process, but I finally struck gold with this product.  Because the mineral salts are conveniently in liquid, you don&#x27;t have the issue of wetting a crystal or dropping it on the floor to see it shatter into a thousand pieces.  There is no gooey, gummy feeling like I get from clear, stick deodorants.  This one really works with my body chemistry, so it may not work for everyone, as we are all so chemically unique, but I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> I stopped using anti-perspirant years ago because of the aluminum in it.  I have been using \\&quot;regular\\&quot; deodorant and that has not worked for me.  Somewhere about mid-day, I would really start to offend myself.  I am switching to getting rid of toxins in my life so I tried this one based on the reviews.  I have the fragrance free version.  This is fantastic deodorant.  No smell to it and it keeps me smelling fresh all day.  I saw an earlier comment on it being runny.  While it does come out as a liquid, I don&#x27;t put a ton on so that has not been an issue for me.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find this to put on subscription, so I have started my subscription for this product.  [[ASIN:B001FB5H5Q Kiss My Face Natural Active Life Aluminum Free Deodorant, Fragrance Free, 3.1-Oz Sticks (Pack of 6)]]  It is a stick instead of a roll on.  If it doesn&#x27;t work as well then I will just order this manually.</li>
            <li> I grew up having to use a soap called Physohex which my stepfather swore by.  We weren&#x27;t allowed to use reguar deoderant of any kind, so as you might guess, when I graduated and moved out, I went strait for the \\&quot;hard stuff\\&quot;  you know the full aluminum chlorohidrate heavy duty stuff,  sprays choked me, some of the deodorant sticks contained too much perfume, some actually wrecked the underarms of my clothes.  I finally settled on Mitchem only to find that in time it didn&#x27;t work--especially here in Florida --and especially when I most needed it such as in dance class.  Last year, I had an abnormal mamogram which made me think twice about the chemicals I was using in and on my body.  The natural deodorant search began!  I have tried everything and was ready to give up.  The day I was at the imaging center for my second mammogram I read an article a  I read about KMF in a mainstream woman&#x27;s magazine.  I still perspire when nervous and there is a bit of a smell that dissipates quickly but makes me nervous about whether I smell bad at times. I definitely have to clean my underarms daily and sometimes clean up at noon time depending on how active I am or whether I&#x27;ve been outside.---I could go a second day with the Mitchem,  I have found that using A LOT works the best, but I still use a scented lotion or perfume just to cover anything the deodorant does not. (which I understand defeats the idea of using fewer chemicals on my body.)  So my next try is the lavender scented KMF--that could be the ticket!  this is definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!  One of the other reviewers said that they really slathered it on, which I wasn&#x27;t doing.  I tried applying it HEAVILY and what an improvement.  Today I went to a luncheon, it was ninety degrees, and I wore a white sleeveless sheath with confidence.  It is now four hours later...tons of hugs and still no smell.  Now, just so you know, there was still wetness.  But I am much more confident with this product and am glad to have found something natural that works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a profuse sweater when I&#x27;m working or nervous.  I had been using Old Spice deodorant/antiperspirant for the longest time and while I liked the scent, I would still sweat buckets and I&#x27;d smell funky after a full day.  But the worst of it was all my shirts getting ruined by permanent pit stains from the aluminum in the antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;Did some research and found KMF roll on deo was highly rated for killing smell and not leaving stains.  I was nervous about still sweating since it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, however, I&#x27;m sweating less since using it.  I suspect using an antiperspirant caused my body to over-compensate by producing more sweat to cool off.  While I still sweat with this product a bit, it&#x27;s not as much, I don&#x27;t have pit stains, and best of all there&#x27;s no odor all day long.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worked on our property in Las Vegas&#x27; 110 degree heat all day and not smelled later in the day.  Great stuff in my opinion!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t always seem to work for me. I could notice body odor on myself, and my significant other even mentioned to me that I smelled--and not in a good way. (I hope my coworkers didn&#x27;t notice, but I suspect they did, too.) I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and I believe some days are better than others, but I still feel worried when I wear this, especially if I&#x27;m doing any activity where I&#x27;ll sweat a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this product was nearly depleted, I bought [[ASIN:B001FB5HFQ Kiss My Face Scented Active Enzyme Stick Deodorant, 2.48-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 6)]], which is ostensibly a stick version of this deodorant (although scented--I figured that could at least be a backup if the deodorant fails again). However, the ingredients and mechanism are actually quite different: the main ingredient in the stick is some sort of \\&quot;natural vegetable enzyme,\\&quot; although it contains corn starch and \\&quot;clay\\&quot; (presumably the ingredient listed as kaolin); the liquid version here is primarily potassium alum (an antiseptic, which should really work but just doesn&#x27;t seem to for me), although there are other ingredients. In any case, the two are quite different products, and I find that the stick works better. (For the record, I also like the stick by Tom&#x27;s, which is the only other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other disadvantages to this liquid, as well: the solvent is water, which can take a long time to dry. (I know alcohol dries out some people&#x27;s skin, but that&#x27;s not a problem for me.) I practically have to walk around for a couple minutes with my arms in the air or blow into my underarms to speed evaporation, either of which is potentially embarrassing in a locker room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I appreciate the intent behind this product: a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant, no added scents (although I wonder if the scented version might seem to work better), and a recyclable bottle. Unfortunately, three stars is the best I can give this due to its lack of consistent effectiveness. In the future, I will continue to opt for the stick, but keep in mind that different products might work better for different people--plenty of people use potassium alum-based deodorants with good luck, but I must not be one of them.ack of consistent effectiveness. In the future, I will continue to opt for the stick, but keep in mind that different products might work better for different people--plenty of people use potassium alum-based deodorants with good luck, but I must not be one of them.</li>
            <li> Wife has been using this for several years. she likes it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  NOT sticky and it WORKS!!</li>
            <li> This deodorant i like that its all natural, plus it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. However it doesn&#x27;t do its job with lasting long at all. I think it lasts prob 30 min and thats it. I&#x27;m on the search for a better all natural deodrant that actually works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million natural (aluminum and paraben-free) deodorants - Tom&#x27;s, Desert Essence, JASON... none of them worked until now. I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and it ROCKS (hah).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sweat pretty heavily, and I&#x27;m not dainty in the personal odor department.  I don&#x27;t find my personal odor offensive, but since I&#x27;m often sweating in exercise classes or at the gym or on hot dance floors I want to be considerate of my neighbors. With this deodorant I feel confident raising my arms again.  The true test was a day that I put the deodorant on after a shower at 3:00pm, then went out dancing late into the night, then had one of those sleeps full of sweaty tossing and turning. When I woke up the next morning, my pits still didn&#x27;t smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deets:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m using the unscented, but traditionally have found KMF&#x27;s scents pleasant (I use the lavender-shea lotion daily) so I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to try one.&lt;br /&gt;- The roll on works just fine, it doesn&#x27;t show on my pits at all, and there have been no marks on my clothes so far, even my black shirts.&lt;br /&gt;- The only con is that takes takes a bit to dry, so I usually hit it with my hair dryer on a low setting before I get dressed.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodarant I use, and the only one I found without all the chemicals that work. I did read and I believe it is true, that once you stop using traditional deodarant and antiperspants it takes a while for your body to clean out the pores and stop smelling, as the other products actually block your pores, once I went thru this stage I can go a whole day, doing anything and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I think it is good for the winter months, but during the summer it only lasts for a few hours. It&#x27;s odor is neutral which is something I like but I think I have to remind my self it is a deodorant and not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know. Maybe I&#x27;m just picky. But this stuff smelled like... I don&#x27;t know, maybe vinegar. I couldn&#x27;t stand it. Maybe it would have been too faint to notice once I put a shirt on, and maybe it would have kept my arm pits from smelling bad. But the minute I put it on, I wiped it off and threw the stuff away.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stop the sweat but it stops the smell for about one day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t deodorize as promised</li>
            <li> Really works.  No allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I AM SO GLAD I FOUND THIS!!!  About a year ago I started having some bad pains in my kidneys.  I was so worried I had kidney stones or cancer or something horribly wrong.  I went to the doctor, who sent me to the kidney specialist, who sent me for ultrasounds, CT scan, etc etc.  It all racked up quite a tab on my insurance, the doctors had no answers, and still my back pains persisted.  I was desperate to heal myself.  I gave up on the doctors and tried an experiment on my own.  I found that when I quit using antiperspirant, the pains disappeared.  Thank you God!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only now I smelled of BO.  I live in the desert where it is hot, and I have a physical, outdoor job.  I SWEAT.  So while I was happy to be pain free, now I was embarrassed and self-conscious about my stinkiness.  I went looking for a new deodorant and saw the great reviews this one was getting and gave it a try.  I can not believe how well this works.  I apply it generously on dry skin, after my morning shower.  I use the fragrance free version which to me smells a bit of witch hazel, but it&#x27;s not too noticeable.  It doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume, and I&#x27;d certainly rather smell a bit of witch hazel than BO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always grateful for products that work.  This is easy to use, affordable, and has solved my problems.  Thank you Kiss My Face, and PLEASE don&#x27;t stop making this!</li>
            <li> If you sweat a lot and smell like bo, this deodorant is for you! It washes off easily at night and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or pasty residue that is hard to come off like any other deodorant. I use this during the day and pat some off after applying for a better  affect. I also use certain dry at night and it&#x27;s helped me stay fresh - although certain dry took two months to finally work, it&#x27;s officially saved my life!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because traditional antiperspirants make me itch. The problem is that while this stuff didn&#x27;t make me itch, it also did nothing else. It did not prevent body odor, the fragrance free smelled terrible (like rotten alcohol if that were a thing). I might as well have worn absolutely nothing, and paid $7 for it. Don&#x27;t buy this, just don&#x27;t. I think that i&#x27;ll just itch until I find something that works, because unless you didn&#x27;t get my point, this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is the best deoderant I&#x27;ve ever used. It lasts a long time &amp; doesn&#x27;t stain. It just goes on very wet, it needs time to dry before you put clothes on.</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e always been skeptical of all these &amp;#34;natural deodorants&amp;#34; that have no odor and kill the root of the smell, bacteria. This stuff actually works, I don&#x27;t smell at all, and no pit stains. This shipping was horribly slow, it took almost 2 weeks to get to me from just a few states away.. but the product was good.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff because my Mom told me it works awesome. However, she uses the cucumber and I didn&#x27;t want to smell like cucumbers so I got the fragrance free kind and it smells horrible. I think I would rather smell my own body odor. Unfortunately, my Mo had purchased the same kind in the Patchouli scent and it was so so bad I threw it away! Well, this one has a tinge of that same patchouli scent and I just can&#x27;t handle it. On top of that, I now have to pay for the return shipping! Such a rip off.</li>
            <li> best of all - they are cruelty free- no testing on animals&lt;br /&gt;do you know how many companies abuse animals every day? not this one</li>
            <li> I really hate added fragrances in body products: too many smells, and some of them are frankly irritating to allergies. This KMF product is excellent - almost totally fragrance-free. What smell exists in the product fades as the product dries on your skin. I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for about four years now, and it&#x27;s still my fave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the roll-on and invisible application. No shirt-staining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, This product is only a deodorant, NOT an antiperspirant. You&#x27;ll still sweat, you just won&#x27;t smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I prefer just a deodorant. When I&#x27;ve worn drugstore antiperspirants, my shirts develop gross yellow stains that cannot be bleached out. I&#x27;ve read that this is an effect of  - some lucky people&#x27;s - sweat interacting with antiperspirant. Haven&#x27;t had a problem with pit stains since switching to simple deodorants; now I can buy nicer shirts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works for me in hot weather, and it works all day. I really love it. You do need to let it dry after you put it on, of course.</li>
            <li> I put this on as soon as I&#x27;m dry after my shower. Even if I take my shower the night before, it lasts all day the next day. It takes a little while to dry, but that&#x27;s not a problem because I can do my hair or put my makeup on while it&#x27;s drying.</li>
            <li> I choose a 4 because it has a mild scent and I still sweat some.  So, it isn&#x27;t perfect, but what can I expect.  I wear this to avoid the chemicals in other deodorants and because wear a cologne with it.  It doesn&#x27;t overpower the cologne whatsoever.  I don&#x27;t sweat much with it, and even if I do, there is hardly any body odor, this deodorant covers it up.</li>
            <li> Works well, but unfortunately still irritated my underarms. Switched to Deodomom and have better results.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I&#x27;ve used this for years. Not as much a fan of the scented, so when my local&lt;br /&gt;store stopped carrying it, I went looking for it and found it on Amazon. Doesn&#x27;t make me sore&lt;br /&gt;in armpits like some do, &amp; it works!</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to dry and it didn&#x27;t deodorize.  I switched to Herban Cowboy-Power Greens and got much better results.</li>
            <li> I prefer to purchase from companies that don&#x27;t test on animals and who keep toxic chemicals to a minimum, at the very least. I have used other deodoants such as Tom&#x27;s of Maine that didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I have found that Kiss My Face Liquid Rock works great though.  I have purchased it several times and have always been happy with it.</li>
            <li> Had tried many different types but this one is the best.  Wish price would be little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quite a while now just because I really couldn&#x27;t decide what to say for the review. I guess I&#x27;ll start with the basics, first off, it smells terrible, seriously awful, but, it goes on clear, does not leave any residue on your shirt and dries with no smell. Now, at first it wasn&#x27;t really working for me, by the end of the day I&#x27;d take a sniff and smell pure body odor and would be self conscious. However, I have found that putting it on right after showering (I am a night showerer) and then reapplying in the morning works wayyyy better then leaving bare arms for too long. I am a VERY oily person and have always been extra sweaty/hormonal all that stuff that makes the puberty years suck. Anyway, I used to always use Secret and NEVER did it work for me, I just thought that was as good as it gets for deodorant, smelling like sweat and flowers, which the flowers almost made it worse and it wore off in about 10 minutes. With this deodorant I am left smelling like nothing, or my perfume if I choose to wear it. What&#x27;s weird though is usually my right armpit smells more than my left but anyway, it is quite impressive and even if you do get a little stinky, it really tones it down to wear someone would have to take a big sniff of your armpit to even notice. So all in all, knowing that this product is much safer than the ones out there and with how well it worked for me, I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Love this entire brand!</li>
            <li> I have read a large number of reviews saying this &amp;#34;fragance-free&amp;#34; roll on smells awful, so when I was in the deodorant aisle the other day I opened one up and tried the old sniff test. This definitely has a fragrance and it is atrocious. What would possess anyone to take something that smells like that and put it on their body I will never understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Kiss My Face Active Life stick deodorant and it smells way better than this crap.</li>
            <li> I had used this brand previously and never had any issues with it leaving me unprotected. At age fifteen I had a reaction to Regular drug store deoderant and developed large one inch cysts all underneath my arms. I got them to go away by stopping use of products with those chemicals!! I really like this deoderant that I ordered over other natural brands. It rolls on wet just like a regular Roll on product. First it is wet then it dries. I am very active at work even though I have to wear dress suits but this product keeps me feeling and smelling fresh all day when other natural products weakened mid day.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how well this deodorant works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really shocked this natural deodorant product actually works! I&#x27;ve tried many others and have always been very disappointed, but have kept trying to find a winner; this one, when applied generously, keeps me smelling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> This is a really good natural deodorant. I use this daily plus use the Certain Dri liquid roll on (which goes on at night) for a couple of days every few months and it keeps my sweating under control. Now, if you are at the gym you&#x27;ll still end up sweaty and stinky. But the Kiss My Face product works for your everyday office or work setting.</li>
            <li> Great product, been using it for years - but will never buy from this supplier again.  Tricky little - well, not so little - increase in price per unit with a totally unreasonable postal charge!!!  Buyer beware - figure out the total cost per - that charge is PER UNIT, not total.  Total misrepresentation and very disappointing....</li>
            <li> Works wonderful, and small enough to take with you on vacation in the carry on.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised.  I think this is the best deodorant I have ever used and it is natural.  Will continue buying it</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff because regular deodorant and even clinical protection deodorant just wasn&#x27;t keeping me from smelling. I was scared of the aluminum in the products, so I thought I&#x27;d try more natural products. I found this at Kroger and it was the cheapest out of all of them, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It worked! NO smell whatsoever! The only downside is you really have to completely slather it all over your underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was identifying the ingredients and I saw one called Potassium Alum. I was curious, so I looked it up. Potassium Alum is actually potassium aluminum sulfate. While it&#x27;s maybe not quite as harmful as other aluminum, it&#x27;s still the same ingredient 90% of people that go towards natural deodorants are trying to avoid. Not only that, but it&#x27;s the SECOND ingredient. That&#x27;s a lot if you think about how little of ingredients this deodorant has. Another thing to note is the majority of natural deodorants have this ingredient. So be on the look out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as a deodorant it works, but it is NOT aluminum free! I will continue my search for another deodorant. I&#x27;ll fall back on this one only if there&#x27;s not another one out there aluminum free.</li>
            <li> Great product...SO and I have been using this product for a year now and love it. Very mild, but effective formula.</li>
            <li> I like it ok. My fault..I thought I was ordering the solid. Next time I will read more carefully, but product works fine.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my radiology tech and was so glad to be able to stop using after treatments.  Does not do the job in fighting perspiration odor.  Tried the patchouli fragranced one as well and couldn&#x27;t stand the fragrance.</li>
            <li> most other products, even fragrance free ones, give me a rash. This does not and it works as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have to buy my daughter fragrance free products because she is highly allergic to perfumes and essential oils.  After being disappointed with Tom&#x27;s brand, we decided to try KMF.  KMF Liquid Rock is great!  Even at the end of the day, it is still doing it&#x27;s job.  She is on her third month of using it and she is very happy with it.  We bought 3 more bottles to keep on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello Kiss My Face!  Goodbye Tom&#x27;s!  The Tom&#x27;s Long Lasting (24 hr) unscented stick deodorant was like putting on water.  It didn&#x27;t prevent b.o. and it was embarrasing for our daughter.  Literally, after just 2 hours of Tom&#x27;s, she needed to bathe!  Kiss My Face is number 1!</li>
            <li> I have try a few deodorants without aluminum and they always made my underarms sticky. This goes on quite wet, but once it drys it really help keep me dry and not stink! I think I will purchase the fragrance one next &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great for those with allergies.  I have used this for a long time and no issues... I am allergic to most deodorants.</li>
            <li> My ex and I decided to try some natural products when we were still together, and this is the one that stuck.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 8 years and have no issues with sweat or odor.  We used to use gilette which smells nice, but my ex could not control the sweat and he had stains on his under t-shirts.  This product isn&#x27;t even an antiperspirant but somehow it helped him in that area and there were no more issues.  I use this every day and never have problems.  Highly recommended, although I think the fragrance free is the best.  The others have an odd odor and don&#x27;t seem as effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these at my local grocery store, but finding them there is hit or miss. Was pleased to find them available here. Prevent odor very well, goes on smoothly, is not sloppy. Recommend to anyone tired of gels and solids.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever!  No scent at all and works great for me.</li>
            <li> I had used this product many years ago without any problems but since time the product has changes and irritates my underarms.  this product also has a musty smell that wears off after drying but not too good smelling.  it also isn&#x27;t long lasting and reapplication is needed after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Like lots of others here, I have wanted to change to a natural deodorant product for years. Being a profuse sweater, I tended to use things like Mitchum, which worked great, but which did god only knows what to my health.  Every paraben and aluminum free product I tried left me stinky, and I tried all of them. Every time I found a new one, I tried it. On the recommendation of my dear friend the yoga instructor, I gave my body a few weeks to acclimate to each and none of them ever worked.  Not so with KMF. It works from day one. I can&#x27;t believe how well. Buy it.</li>
            <li> This works well under stress, much better than some I have tried, unsented and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite deodorant. It actually worked, no scent, lasted 2 days, and kept me dry.&lt;br /&gt;Then they took out the parabens. Many, many problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. First, it&#x27;s so wet when you put it on, it looks like you&#x27;re already sweating. Takes a long time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It says \\&quot;unscented,\\&quot; but there&#x27;s a scent in there. And it&#x27;s noticeable and not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It no longer lasts more than 8 hours and isn&#x27;t great with wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People should be given the choice if they want to have \\&quot;parabens,\\&quot; which clogs pores in facial products and supposedly mimics estrogen, though it hasn&#x27;t been proven. They said that it shows up in the bloodstream after applying, but ALL SUBSTANCES YOU PUT ON YOUR SKIN SHOW UP IN YOUR BLOOD AND SALIVA 20 MINUTES AFTER YOU APPLY. PERIOD. According to the FDA, there are no risks in the amounts that they legally allow. So who the heck knows what the real story is. Sometimes I think they make some of this stuff up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of any of this, the product is DOO DOO now, and it was a fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a little tired of the green flag waving. It&#x27;s annoying. If no one has ever had a problem with it because of the parabens, and the product works better with them, then LEAVE THEM IN. A sucky product that checks off all the environmental \\&quot;dos\\&quot; is NOT BETTER than a great product that has a few flaws. It&#x27;s being stupid, in the other direction. And one of the reasons I won&#x27;t eat oatmeal anymore because with the bran left in, it tastes terrible. So, no more Liquid Rock either. This will be my last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice work, people.</li>
