            <li>Just what my daughter wanted--arrived in perfect packaging and in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li>so the color  is perfect for my hair, they are so useful for buns, and all kind of hair styles!, and i use them for my daughter it doesnt hurt her hair either!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I would not rely on these to hold a hairstyle for more that a couple minutes!</li>
            <li>Otherwise the color was nice</li>
            <li>Not the flimsy type thats so popular nowadays.</li>
            <li>i Love them,</li>
            <li>no matter how many I use</li>
            <li>They bend so easily that they won&#x27;t hold even the tiniest bit of hair.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like these at first, but found that they work to hold hair in a bun much better than the flatter style,</li>
            <li>Cheap, don&#x27;t buy them.  </li>
            <li>Great for buns and loose hair style&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I am very well pleased.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>Wish they had some black ones but these are great.</li>
            <li>They just bend far too easily and lose their shape.</li>
            <li>will most definitely be avoiding this brand forever now.</li>
            <li>So much easier to hold stray hairs in a ballerina bun.</li>
            <li>I use these types of hairpins, so I know what they should be capable of, and these just don&#x27;t make the cut.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much the $4</li>
            <li>I am a frequent user of this specific type of hair pin, mostly for updos.</li>
            <li>I would assume a lot of people buying these are dancers (that&#x27;s the main group of people I know of that still buy hair pins, and not just bobby pins.</li>
            <li>They work great for her thick, long hair, and for those times she does her friends&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li>These are a great color for my blonde daughters, but they are a little wide.</li>
            <li>These pins are a little flimsy and are not as strong as regular bobby-pins.  </li>
            <li>I spent that I&#x27;m mad about - more the fact that I now have to make a special trip to the store tonight to buy new hair pins</li>
            <li>it might be because they are so thin and my hair is a lot thicker and has more texture than the pins can handle.</li>
            <li>They bent way to easy, not good for any hair do.</li>
            <li>Decent hair pins but slightly wide.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never encountered a hair pin so cheap and flimsy and useless in my life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> very small pins and can&#x27;t hold much hair</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Other than that they do what they are supposed to do</li>
            <li> As described &amp; expected!</li>
            <li> Have not had this problem with other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like hair is a hard enough substance that it should be bending a metal pin.</li>
            <li> I do have thick hair but even using several pins they just caved under the weight...</li>
            <li> I used them to pin down my daughter&#x27;s ballet bun</li>
            <li> and they just won&#x27;t stay in for even a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> We literally go through a few hundred hair pins a year for ballet.</li>
            <li> They are not the worst hair pins but these bend very easily.</li>
            <li> waste your money on these!</li>
            <li> Not very good quality</li>
            <li> I bought these because they are a hard to find color.</li>
            <li> at least 30 for them to hold my hair do and</li>
            <li> Too thin and don&#x27;t stay in.  </li>
            <li> I think the problem is that the metal is so thin that they don&#x27;t have any tensile integrity.</li>
            <li> Useless, didn&#x27;t even work on thin children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I have seen worse, however!</li>
            <li> These pins are practically worthless unless you are pinning the tiniest section of hair.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in how badly they work for my hair.</li>
            <li> These are horrible - so bad</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re awful.  </li>
            <li> Oh my gosh - I didn&#x27;t think a HAIR PIN could be this awful</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well. Too big</li>
            <li> These pins are a little flimsy and are not as strong as regular bobby-pins.  I have seen worse, however!</li>
            <li> i Love them, im blonde so the color  is perfect for my hair, they are so useful for buns, and all kind of hair styles!, and i use them for my daughter it doesnt hurt her hair either!</li>
            <li> These hold my twist up.</li>
            <li> Decent hair pins but slightly wide. Other than that they do what they are supposed to do</li>
            <li> They are not the worst hair pins but these bend very easily. I used them to pin down my daughter&#x27;s ballet bun and they cannot hold it all in place no matter how many I use. Needless to say, you&#x27;re better off finding something sturdier.</li>
            <li> Love these! So much easier to hold stray hairs in a ballerina bun. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Great for buns and loose hair style&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Too thin and don&#x27;t stay in.  Cheap, don&#x27;t buy them.  They bent way to easy, not good for any hair do.</li>
            <li> very small pins and can&#x27;t hold much hair they constantly pop out of my hair ... it might be because they are so thin and my hair is a lot thicker and has more texture than the pins can handle. Otherwise the color was nice but I felt like I had to stick in at least 30 for them to hold my hair do and even then I had to fix them and push them in all the time.</li>
            <li> Just what my daughter wanted--arrived in perfect packaging and in a timely manner.  They work great for her thick, long hair, and for those times she does her friends&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> As described &amp; expected!</li>
            <li> These pins are practically worthless unless you are pinning the tiniest section of hair.  Tried to use for a chignon hairstyle and they instantly lost their shape and fell out of my hair.  I do have thick hair but even using several pins they just caved under the weight...I would not rely on these to hold a hairstyle for more that a couple minutes!</li>
            <li> These are a great color for my blonde daughters, but they are a little wide.</li>
            <li> As expected. Came quickly.</li>
            <li> I use these types of hairpins, so I know what they should be capable of, and these just don&#x27;t make the cut.  They bend so easily that they won&#x27;t hold even the tiniest bit of hair.  I tried to use them multiple times on my daughter&#x27;s hair (bun about 1 inch diameter!) and they just won&#x27;t stay in for even a few minutes.  They&#x27;re awful.  Have not had this problem with other brands.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent user of this specific type of hair pin, mostly for updos. I bought these because they are a hard to find color. I was very disappointed in how badly they work for my hair. They offer no resistance at all and simply fall out of my hair. I think the problem is that the metal is so thin that they don&#x27;t have any tensile integrity. They just bend far too easily and lose their shape. I like this style of pin as they do not grab the hair; however you need a pin to hold its shape for an updo. These do not.</li>
            <li> Hairpins serves the purpose with no problem.  Used to hold my hair in place and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair falling in my face.</li>
            <li> This are sturdier and finer that what you can find at drugstores in the hair accessory department.  I am very well pleased.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality but you get what you pay for. Will be buying something different.</li>
            <li> Useless, didn&#x27;t even work on thin children&#x27;s hair. Bend out of shape immediately.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like these at first, but found that they work to hold hair in a bun much better than the flatter style,</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh - I didn&#x27;t think a HAIR PIN could be this awful that I would take the time to write a review of it. These are horrible - so bad I almost want to ask for my $4 back! I would assume a lot of people buying these are dancers (that&#x27;s the main group of people I know of that still buy hair pins, and not just bobby pins. Just putting my daughter&#x27;s hair in one bun, we had to throw away 8 of these already because they bent rather than pushing into her hair. Her hair. It&#x27;s not like hair is a hard enough substance that it should be bending a metal pin. We literally go through a few hundred hair pins a year for ballet. I&#x27;ve never encountered a hair pin so cheap and flimsy and useless in my life.&lt;br /&gt;I will most definitely be avoiding this brand forever now. It&#x27;s not so much the $4 I spent that I&#x27;m mad about - more the fact that I now have to make a special trip to the store tonight to buy new hair pins so she&#x27;ll have them for tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on these!</li>
            <li> Wish they had some black ones but these are great. Not the flimsy type thats so popular nowadays.</li>
