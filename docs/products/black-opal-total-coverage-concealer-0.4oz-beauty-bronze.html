            <li> Also I want to add that this concealer is a lot larger than I expected it to be!</li>
            <li> ITS SMALLER THAN THE OTHER CREAM FOUNDATION</li>
            <li> This product was a bit dry, until i scooped it all out, warmed it a bit in the microwave and added a bit of my moisturizer to it.</li>
            <li> I have used so many expensive concealers and foundations and never knew anything about Black Opal until now!</li>
            <li> A little smaller and darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> If you wet the sponge just a bit before applying, it give you a glow.</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t too thick where it still looks natural.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> I usually have allergies to facial products</li>
            <li> as stated in previous reviews, a little goes a LONG way!!</li>
            <li> and once i relieved it i realized it was too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I purchased the black Opal product after seeing it advertising on tv, and I thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> I never used it as a foundation because I just think it will be too thick.</li>
            <li> For some reason I am not good at choosing the correct color for my skin.</li>
            <li> Now I use it everyday, since its creamy (use a stippling brush)!!!</li>
            <li> I have the worst hyperpigmentation on my face, all over!!!</li>

            <li> Concealer works well under makeup giving an almost flawless look.</li>
            <li> Been using this from the day I started wearing making make up which is 10 years ago.... This never failed and I know I will enjoy it in the future</li>
            <li> I used this total coverage foundation only as a concealer, and it did the trick.  The coverage was perfect and the color and tone were a great match for my complexion, therefore I could use it strategically only in the areas that needed coverage, and then simply blend out the edges.  Perfect!  The only problem I had was the ease with which it transferred off of my face onto whatever happened to brush by it.</li>
            <li> This product is darker than my skin tone, therefore I don&#x27;t use it. For some reason I am not good at choosing the correct color for my skin. This is the second one that is not the right color. I cannot much else about it. The overall product is good.</li>
            <li> I have the worst hyperpigmentation on my face, all over!!! This concealer feels like I am wearing nothing on my face. It has amazing coverage and lasts all day!!! It blends perfectly on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Although difficult to find in my local stores, this product is AMAZING!!, perfectly covers FLAWS, leaving a fresh face ( even better than my MAC NC45!) lasts forever( with daily application lasted 2 years!!) as stated in previous reviews, a little goes a LONG way!!</li>
            <li> This concealer is AMAZING!!! I just got mine in the mail today and couldn&#x27;t wait until after my shower to apply it to my face! Omg it blends with my skin tone perfectly!!! I have used so many expensive concealers and foundations and never knew anything about Black Opal until now! I don&#x27;t even need the foundation b/c the concealer does everything! But of course I still purchased the foundation as well and I love this concealer so much that I&#x27;m getting ready to purchase another one! Also I want to add that this concealer is a lot larger than I expected it to be! The ones I&#x27;m use to purchasing comes in smaller pots than this! So saying I&#x27;m satisfied is an understatement! Absolutely Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Black Opal Total Coverage is perfectly designed to bronze brown, chocolate, and all deep skin tones.  Works effortlessly alone or in combination with any liquid, powder, or pressed powder to reveal a flawless finish.  It is certainly the African American go to product so smoothly textured making the application process easy, and for women who love a dewy finish, it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  A little goes a long way. Blemishes and under eye circles disappear and all you&#x27;re left with is a clear complexion.  Put your best face forward with this blended beauty concoction.</li>
            <li> It last all day and blends in very well. It also isn&#x27;t too thick where it still looks natural. It covers spots and dark circles under eyes very well. I never never go back to maybelline or covergirl because the queen collection isn&#x27;t strong and doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
            <li> I ordered beauty bronze online and once i relieved it i realized it was too dark for my skin tone. I was able to blend it with a lighter colored concealer and it covered perfectly.</li>

            <li> as soon i got it in the mail, i tried it on. i love it! i was so scared that it wouldnt match me, online Nutmeg looks more like my color but Beauty Bronze was perfect.

            <li> The coverage is awesome... It covers with no effort.. It leaves a clean applications and smooth appearance. And when adding water to the brush helps it make your skin even prettier.</li>
            <li> Great concealer. I use it to correct hyperpigmentation on my eyelids and it works wonders. I have Beautiful Bronze (I can wear NC50 or NW45 in Mac Studio Foundation). I never used it as a foundation because I just think it will be too thick.I&#x27;d rather have light to medium versus full coverage foundation. The staying power is amazing and it doesn&#x27;t crease (I have applied it under my eyes before). Gives a flawless look and just evens out my skin tone. I do recommend this.</li>
