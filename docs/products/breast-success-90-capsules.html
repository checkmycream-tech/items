    <ol>
            <li> i tried this and i got no changes and no increase in bust size i was so disappointing!</li>
            <li> I dont know if this product worked for others but never for once for me. It came and i used as directed. I later found out you had to buy more bottles to make it work. Who has that much time and money to waste?</li>
            <li> This product really works I have gained 3 cup sizes. I only wish that I had taken pictures first. Wow!</li>
            <li> No noticeable improvement</li>
            <li> So far yes I have been pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> DIDNT DO ANYTHING FOR ME.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was not sure if this product was going to work. After reading several successful reviews I decided to give it a try. After using the product for four days I noticed a different. My breast looked fuller and plump. People noticed a different. My breast always has sagged. I decided that I was not going to continue to live like this. I love the look of my breast now. I have not went up a bra size yet but it shouldn&#x27;t be long. The bra now I&#x27;m wearing is filling up for sure! I love the product and have already purchased a new bottle with two weeks of pills left in my first bottle. The side effects I experience was gas, slight pain in my breast and every now and then  stomach cramps from not eating sometimes before thing the pill. I did not want to do surgery. So give it a try! Take it as is says, 3 pills a day... It worked for me!!!!</li>
            <li> The bottle I received is about three years old . Just keep that in mind when thinking about buying this project.</li>
            <li> UPDATE After my second month, I have not had any further results.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend even trying this product, even though I had a little success with it at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking 3 times daily as instructed in the morning, mid-afternoon and after dinner.  I had little cleavage and even what little there was was sagging after nursing for 13 months.  I have been taking them for less than a month and already have seen a difference.  They are filling out and not as saggy as they were.  I have not had any side effects other than just tenderness in the breast area.  I&#x27;m an avid reviewer and plan to review again when I have taken them longer.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do anything,still not seeing no change iin the size</li>
            <li> I gave five stars b/c this product really works for me. I am a C but after breast feeding the girls are not what they used to be, after using for 2 months consistently I have seen a difference. The girls are firmer and fuller looking. I have also combined with a breast cream that I love</li>
            <li> Is it supposed to make you gain weight everywhere?</li>
            <li> these i have been using for a while  if you stop you lose your fullness  will keep some on hand</li>
            <li> This supplement really works.  You do have to continue taking it though, as soon as I stop, the results drift away.</li>
            <li> This stuff just works - been using it for years, and I have great girls - still!!</li>
