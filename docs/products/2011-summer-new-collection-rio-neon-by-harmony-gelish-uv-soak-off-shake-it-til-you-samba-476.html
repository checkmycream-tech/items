            <li>Absolutely in LOVE with this color.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite gelish color.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments since I painted my nails</li>
            <li>I love gelish however this was NOT the color I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I thought it looked more like a coral color on my screen but</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love the neon collection colors.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails at home with my UV light and nail kit.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love...  </li>
            <li>Get a lot more for your money.  </li>
            <li>] Gelish polishes through Amazon, and I have been 100% satisfied with all sellers and products.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I love it in all lighting.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this gelish color.  </li>
            <li>I think 3 coats would&#x27;ve been better, but I didn&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li>I love the Gelish colors.</li>
            <li>as many colors.  </li>
            <li>Gelish has alot more, so I thought if</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it --</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as bright and fun as I hoped.</li>
            <li>If you love neon you will love this.</li>
            <li>I love neon colored nail polish but its really streaky and too transparent and chips easily, Gelish is a great alternative its glossy.</li>
            <li>I probably would have liked a pink that was bright, but just not this neon-y bright.  </li>
            <li>The color is so bright and pretty.</li>
            <li>Worth it!!</li>
            <li>just the one i wanted its neon pink really bright after 3 layers its great</li>
            <li>I was looking for a spring/summer pink color and this seemed the best out of all the Gelish options.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t say so much &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34;,  will look good with any skin tone.</li>
            <li>and I got it super fast at a great price.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this color if you want something bright and summery!</li>
            <li>This was the perfect summer pink!</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle of UV polish and I love it!</li>
            <li>Super trendy and fun, get compliments on it all the time!  </li>
            <li>It looks super bright when you open it, but the color is actually much nicer on, but definitely bright! :)</li>
            <li>i really like bright polishes and enjoy this color.  </li>
            <li>It is vibrant and bright, but not neon or obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>probably do need 2 coats, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Great price and last a full 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>Bright pink and love it!</li>
            <li>I trust that if you want neon, this is a very pretty color!</li>
            <li>Anyway, if you want a Very bright, neon-y pink, then this color is for you.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of all Gelish polishes.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails and most people think I have them done professionally.  </li>
            <li>You have to buy a light to cure it</li>
            <li>(led curing light, gelish set at amazon.</li>
            <li>big bottle, great color wears well.  </li>
            <li>Applies smooth.</li>
            <li>It is a nice, bright neon pink.</li>
            <li>This was my first time to every apply a gel-polish and it went on so easy!</li>
            <li>Just right. :-)</li>
            <li>It is a nice summer bright pink!</li>
            <li>The perfect shade of hot pink in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect hot pink.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first Gelish color and it went on much better than my Nailuv color did</li>
            <li>Beautiful pink Barbie fun!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for me because I can wear it year round!</li>
            <li>It has gotten me many compliments and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>In sunlight it&#x27;s a beautiful pink color.</li>
            <li>Great color and lasted a long time!</li>
            <li>Great color, same great quality as other gelish polishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to doing my own gel nails after I had it done twice in the salon.</li>
            <li>Love this color for a bright summer pink.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a darker pink bright color.</li>
            <li>I get complimented frequently on the color and most people think my nails are done in a salon when in fact there done at home :)</li>
            <li>great for the summer, and hot pink is always my favorite for the summer months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now!</li>
            <li>This product is as expected, there isn&#x27;t a great deal of science involved,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great neon pink.  </li>
            <li>it hoping that i just didn&#x27;t buff the nail enough to get a good grip and it was a fluke.</li>
            <li>it ship really fast love it,</li>
            <li>I was really thrilled, I even stamped on it with my konad stamper and put a normal top coat on it like normal nail polish as I was told</li>
            <li>I own 5 Gelish colors now and this is by far the runniest, thinnest color I have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are the same, this will work good.  </li>
            <li>the color is very bright and what I would define as a true hot pink!</li>
            <li>I look forward to seeing my nails nice and long from here on out! :)</li>
            <li>the nail polish lasts 2-3 weeks till the growth shows, its also great because when I messed up it wiped clean with a little remover and was still beautiful shiny neon pink!</li>
            <li>For the most part, to me, it looks like a really nice tutti fruitti pink color.</li>
            <li>Its bright pink and cheerful.</li>
            <li>product is the real thing, actual gelish brand which is great.</li>
            <li>This color is fabulous by far my favorite for the summer.</li>
            <li>This is my first Gelish gel color/polish, and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>this is a beautiful hot pink color!</li>
            <li>It is more of a passion pink, which is a color I already own, so now I own two of the same colors.</li>
            <li>Not overly pink and appears more neon in bright natural light (outdoors).</li>
            <li>I love hot pink nail polish and this one has to be at the top of my list!</li>
            <li>The color is great for toes, hot pink.  </li>
            <li>I had been waiting for Gelish to come out with a great hot pink</li>
            <li>I applied it yesterday for the first time and had lots of compliments!</li>
            <li>It is a bright pink but it is so pretty!</li>
            <li>I wish they also made a lighter bright pink, but I guess this will have to do.</li>
            <li>works well with the whole set and UV light.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the color in the posted photos made it appear much more muted.</li>
            <li>This is my absolutely favorite color thus far.</li>
            <li>Gelish is by far my favorite brand of gel polish.</li>
            <li>It definitely looks the most neon in outdoor light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot pink and super bright</li>
            <li>I work at a nursing home and even the older women there have commented on my nail color and how much they love it.</li>
            <li>Bright and Pink!</li>
            <li>compared to traditional polish in neon shades, Gelish&#x27;s neon seems to be more color-saturated; expect to apply three thin coats for the best coverage.</li>
            <li>It makes my natural nails strong.</li>
            <li>I am not good at painting my nails, and they look so good!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Who does your nails?\\&quot; ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a hot fuchsia.</li>
            <li>pretty color.</li>
            <li>I finally was able to get around doing my first gelish mani yesterday</li>
            <li>and it is exactly the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used the Gelish product.  </li>
            <li>I will be back for more colors.</li>
            <li>this was my first time wearing it</li>
            <li>but.... the stuff is pretty runny.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a super cute pink this is it.</li>
            <li>It is dry immediately with a UV dryer, and it&#x27;s easy to remove!  </li>
            <li>When I opened the bottle I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be quite as bright as I&#x27;d hoped, but it really is.</li>
            <li>only purchased this color based on all of the other great reviews about the color being</li>
            <li>Even if you have thin or brittle nails, this polish will make them look beautiful.  </li>
            <li>And I was pleasantly surprised it was a FULL sized bottle for the price of a MINI.</li>
            <li>far as the brand, Gelish is by far my favorite of the gel polishes, I don&#x27;t see myself using any other brand or paying for another manicure as long as Gelish keeps producing quality products and great colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for several special occasions and it is cute and lasts multiple weeks.</li>
            <li>The color is so vibrant!</li>
            <li>Still has a very high shine with no chips.</li>
            <li>color turns out almost peachy in some of the pictures, but it really does seem like a mixture of bright pink with a tiny bit of orange/peach.</li>
            <li>color is very close to &#x27;pool party&#x27; by china  </li>
            <li>It only took 1 coat &amp; looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>I really like this color.</li>
            <li>very close to gossip girl.</li>
            <li>Lint free wipes and cuticle remover and tools at my local drug</li>
            <li>All nails were pink and the ring finger had a layer of gold glitter on top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really confused by the great reviews that everyone was giving this color.</li>
            <li>color is more of a rusty-taupe (reddish with a hint of pink).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very opaque.</li>
            <li>Prettiest pink on olive skin.. Love the color</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this nail polish.</li>
            <li>Stays on really well too.  </li>
            <li>really makes my tan pop ...  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ve never tried this color before and your a pink girl you&#x27;ll love it..</li>
            <li>I LOVE this pink.</li>
            <li>It is the only kind I currently use.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very happy and will definitely try out other colors in the future.</li>
            <li>Hands down the is my most absolute favorite pink.</li>
            <li>I love my pink gel polish!</li>
            <li>this color (more than the other gelish colors I&#x27;ve worn before).</li>
            <li>I live in NYC and you would expect the many salons around me to have neon pink...</li>
            <li>It actually lasts too, unlike most regular polishes!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and color.</li>
            <li>you can do nail art on it just like normal polish and the nail art</li>
            <li>I took it off beacuse the new growth was noticeable.</li>
            <li>but I live in Hawaii, so</li>
            <li>There is a neon pink by China Glaze that I&#x27;m obsessed with, wish it could be more like that and more like the picture/description!</li>
            <li>By far my fav so far!!</li>
            <li>If your looking for some hot shades for the summer to go with your tan, then I definitely recommend this Rio Neon, Shake it</li>
            <li>and like I had them professionally done!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;[I do know, however, that there is counterfeit Gelish floating around on the Internet that falls flat next to genuine Gelish.</li>
            <li>It is true Barbie pink.</li>
            <li>Although this is a very pretty pink, it is no where near neon colored.</li>
            <li>I love pink and this Neon Pink is adorable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can promise you that this shade is so loud that you&#x27;ll be noticed everywhere</li>
            <li>My Nailuv color lasted two weeks and was nowhere near ready to come off, i&#x27;m hoping this lasts just as long.</li>
            <li>It is the exact pink I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Its not dark and its not redish.</li>
            <li>Definately HOT pink neon.</li>
            <li>If you like hot pink, this is for you.</li>
            <li>generally lasts longer because of the surface its applied to, just like when I had acrylic nails</li>
            <li>Not a light hot pink, but still pretty.</li>
            <li>I was not at all disappointed when I received the product - the color is just as beautiful in person as the online pics depict.</li>
            <li>but I am not very happy with the colors that are available through them.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend looking at the pictures that other reviewers have submitted to get a real idea on the color.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought this color, I just wish it weren&#x27;t so thin.</li>
            <li>I am going to have a hard time using my other colors now :)</li>
            <li>I will add, though, in certain lighting, it looked a neon orange...for some odd reason.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use with other Gelish products, the pH buffer, base &amp; top coats.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product looks on my nails, although it is VERY difficult to really tell what a color looks like from a computer.  </li>
            <li>Went on very well, you could even get away with just one coat, but I like to put two on because it gives it a little bit of a deeper color to it.</li>

            <li> Absolutely in LOVE with this color.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite gelish color.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments since I painted my nails</li>
            <li> I love gelish however this was NOT the color I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I thought it looked more like a coral color on my screen but</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love the neon collection colors.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails at home with my UV light and nail kit.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love...  </li>
            <li> Get a lot more for your money.  </li>
            <li> ] Gelish polishes through Amazon, and I have been 100% satisfied with all sellers and products.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I love it in all lighting.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this gelish color.  </li>
            <li> I think 3 coats would&#x27;ve been better, but I didn&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish colors.</li>
            <li> as many colors.  </li>
            <li> Gelish has alot more, so I thought if</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it --</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as bright and fun as I hoped.</li>
            <li> If you love neon you will love this.</li>
            <li> I love neon colored nail polish but its really streaky and too transparent and chips easily, Gelish is a great alternative its glossy.</li>
            <li> I probably would have liked a pink that was bright, but just not this neon-y bright.  </li>
            <li> The color is so bright and pretty.</li>
            <li> Worth it!!</li>
            <li> just the one i wanted its neon pink really bright after 3 layers its great</li>
            <li> I was looking for a spring/summer pink color and this seemed the best out of all the Gelish options.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t say so much &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34;,  will look good with any skin tone.</li>
            <li> and I got it super fast at a great price.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this color if you want something bright and summery!</li>
            <li> This was the perfect summer pink!</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle of UV polish and I love it!</li>
            <li> Super trendy and fun, get compliments on it all the time!  </li>
            <li> It looks super bright when you open it, but the color is actually much nicer on, but definitely bright! :)</li>
            <li> i really like bright polishes and enjoy this color.  </li>
            <li> It is vibrant and bright, but not neon or obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> probably do need 2 coats, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Great price and last a full 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> Bright pink and love it!</li>
            <li> I trust that if you want neon, this is a very pretty color!</li>
            <li> Anyway, if you want a Very bright, neon-y pink, then this color is for you.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of all Gelish polishes.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and most people think I have them done professionally.  </li>
            <li> You have to buy a light to cure it</li>
            <li> (led curing light, gelish set at amazon.</li>
            <li> big bottle, great color wears well.  </li>
            <li> Applies smooth.</li>
            <li> It is a nice, bright neon pink.</li>
            <li> This was my first time to every apply a gel-polish and it went on so easy!</li>
            <li> Just right. :-)</li>
            <li> It is a nice summer bright pink!</li>
            <li> The perfect shade of hot pink in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect hot pink.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first Gelish color and it went on much better than my Nailuv color did</li>
            <li> Beautiful pink Barbie fun!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for me because I can wear it year round!</li>
            <li> It has gotten me many compliments and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> In sunlight it&#x27;s a beautiful pink color.</li>
            <li> Great color and lasted a long time!</li>
            <li> Great color, same great quality as other gelish polishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to doing my own gel nails after I had it done twice in the salon.</li>
            <li> Love this color for a bright summer pink.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a darker pink bright color.</li>
            <li> I get complimented frequently on the color and most people think my nails are done in a salon when in fact there done at home :)</li>
            <li> great for the summer, and hot pink is always my favorite for the summer months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing it right now!</li>
            <li> This product is as expected, there isn&#x27;t a great deal of science involved,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great neon pink.  </li>
            <li> it hoping that i just didn&#x27;t buff the nail enough to get a good grip and it was a fluke.</li>
            <li> it ship really fast love it,</li>
            <li> I was really thrilled, I even stamped on it with my konad stamper and put a normal top coat on it like normal nail polish as I was told</li>
            <li> I own 5 Gelish colors now and this is by far the runniest, thinnest color I have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are the same, this will work good.  </li>
            <li> the color is very bright and what I would define as a true hot pink!</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing my nails nice and long from here on out! :)</li>
            <li> the nail polish lasts 2-3 weeks till the growth shows, its also great because when I messed up it wiped clean with a little remover and was still beautiful shiny neon pink!</li>
            <li> For the most part, to me, it looks like a really nice tutti fruitti pink color.</li>
            <li> Its bright pink and cheerful.</li>
            <li> product is the real thing, actual gelish brand which is great.</li>
            <li> This color is fabulous by far my favorite for the summer.</li>
            <li> This is my first Gelish gel color/polish, and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> this is a beautiful hot pink color!</li>
            <li> It is more of a passion pink, which is a color I already own, so now I own two of the same colors.</li>
            <li> Not overly pink and appears more neon in bright natural light (outdoors).</li>
            <li> I love hot pink nail polish and this one has to be at the top of my list!</li>
            <li> The color is great for toes, hot pink.  </li>
            <li> I had been waiting for Gelish to come out with a great hot pink</li>
            <li> I applied it yesterday for the first time and had lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> It is a bright pink but it is so pretty!</li>
            <li> I wish they also made a lighter bright pink, but I guess this will have to do.</li>
            <li> works well with the whole set and UV light.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the color in the posted photos made it appear much more muted.</li>
            <li> This is my absolutely favorite color thus far.</li>
            <li> Gelish is by far my favorite brand of gel polish.</li>
            <li> It definitely looks the most neon in outdoor light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot pink and super bright</li>
            <li> I work at a nursing home and even the older women there have commented on my nail color and how much they love it.</li>
            <li> Bright and Pink!</li>
            <li> compared to traditional polish in neon shades, Gelish&#x27;s neon seems to be more color-saturated; expect to apply three thin coats for the best coverage.</li>
            <li> It makes my natural nails strong.</li>
            <li> I am not good at painting my nails, and they look so good!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Who does your nails?\\&quot; ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hot fuchsia.</li>
            <li> pretty color.</li>
            <li> I finally was able to get around doing my first gelish mani yesterday</li>
            <li> and it is exactly the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used the Gelish product.  </li>
            <li> I will be back for more colors.</li>
            <li> this was my first time wearing it</li>
            <li> but.... the stuff is pretty runny.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a super cute pink this is it.</li>
            <li> It is dry immediately with a UV dryer, and it&#x27;s easy to remove!  </li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be quite as bright as I&#x27;d hoped, but it really is.</li>
            <li> only purchased this color based on all of the other great reviews about the color being</li>
            <li> Even if you have thin or brittle nails, this polish will make them look beautiful.  </li>
            <li> And I was pleasantly surprised it was a FULL sized bottle for the price of a MINI.</li>
            <li> far as the brand, Gelish is by far my favorite of the gel polishes, I don&#x27;t see myself using any other brand or paying for another manicure as long as Gelish keeps producing quality products and great colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several special occasions and it is cute and lasts multiple weeks.</li>
            <li> The color is so vibrant!</li>
            <li> Still has a very high shine with no chips.</li>
            <li> color turns out almost peachy in some of the pictures, but it really does seem like a mixture of bright pink with a tiny bit of orange/peach.</li>
            <li> color is very close to &#x27;pool party&#x27; by china  </li>
            <li> It only took 1 coat &amp; looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> I really like this color.</li>
            <li> very close to gossip girl.</li>
            <li> Lint free wipes and cuticle remover and tools at my local drug</li>
            <li> All nails were pink and the ring finger had a layer of gold glitter on top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really confused by the great reviews that everyone was giving this color.</li>
            <li> color is more of a rusty-taupe (reddish with a hint of pink).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very opaque.</li>
            <li> Prettiest pink on olive skin.. Love the color</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish.</li>
            <li> Stays on really well too.  </li>
            <li> really makes my tan pop ...  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve never tried this color before and your a pink girl you&#x27;ll love it..</li>
            <li> I LOVE this pink.</li>
            <li> It is the only kind I currently use.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very happy and will definitely try out other colors in the future.</li>
            <li> Hands down the is my most absolute favorite pink.</li>
            <li> I love my pink gel polish!</li>
            <li> this color (more than the other gelish colors I&#x27;ve worn before).</li>
            <li> I live in NYC and you would expect the many salons around me to have neon pink...</li>
            <li> It actually lasts too, unlike most regular polishes!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and color.</li>
            <li> you can do nail art on it just like normal polish and the nail art</li>
            <li> I took it off beacuse the new growth was noticeable.</li>
            <li> but I live in Hawaii, so</li>
            <li> There is a neon pink by China Glaze that I&#x27;m obsessed with, wish it could be more like that and more like the picture/description!</li>
            <li> By far my fav so far!!</li>
            <li> If your looking for some hot shades for the summer to go with your tan, then I definitely recommend this Rio Neon, Shake it</li>
            <li> and like I had them professionally done!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;[I do know, however, that there is counterfeit Gelish floating around on the Internet that falls flat next to genuine Gelish.</li>
            <li> It is true Barbie pink.</li>
            <li> Although this is a very pretty pink, it is no where near neon colored.</li>
            <li> I love pink and this Neon Pink is adorable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can promise you that this shade is so loud that you&#x27;ll be noticed everywhere</li>
            <li> My Nailuv color lasted two weeks and was nowhere near ready to come off, i&#x27;m hoping this lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> It is the exact pink I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Its not dark and its not redish.</li>
            <li> Definately HOT pink neon.</li>
            <li> If you like hot pink, this is for you.</li>
            <li> generally lasts longer because of the surface its applied to, just like when I had acrylic nails</li>
            <li> Not a light hot pink, but still pretty.</li>
            <li> I was not at all disappointed when I received the product - the color is just as beautiful in person as the online pics depict.</li>
            <li> but I am not very happy with the colors that are available through them.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend looking at the pictures that other reviewers have submitted to get a real idea on the color.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought this color, I just wish it weren&#x27;t so thin.</li>
            <li> I am going to have a hard time using my other colors now :)</li>
            <li> I will add, though, in certain lighting, it looked a neon orange...for some odd reason.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use with other Gelish products, the pH buffer, base &amp; top coats.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product looks on my nails, although it is VERY difficult to really tell what a color looks like from a computer.  </li>
            <li> Went on very well, you could even get away with just one coat, but I like to put two on because it gives it a little bit of a deeper color to it.</li>
            <li> They are long lasting (2-3wks) and do not chip like regular nail polishes.</li>
            <li> For me, I&#x27;m not sure I would say this color is really that neon.</li>
            <li> Not a pink pink color like pictured.</li>
            <li> Tried this brand because it costs a little less than CND.&lt;br /&gt;Color is pretty</li>
            <li> I have other colors but always go back to this one!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got multiple compliments on it over the last few days.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can not rate it since I will not be able to use for at least another 6-12 months when I will be going back home.</li>
            <li> Sally sells bottles half the size for same amount of money.  </li>
            <li> You Samba as a less-than-outrageous neon pink.</li>
            <li> Compliments pale skin (can only speak about pale Irish skin) .</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m a little skeptical because one nail started lifting two days after I painted it and peeled right off!</li>
            <li> just not exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I have 2 or 3 other brands of gel, and I find that this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Practically glow in the dark pink.</li>
            <li> It has the usual gelish quality, lasting 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why some of the images and reviews present Shake it</li>
            <li> Fluorescent pink!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy UV polish because the colors are generally very boring and there was only one I had liked, till I looked on Amazon.</li>
            <li> it helps to buff the nails to rough them up a a little before applying.</li>
            <li> I purchased this color,the base and top coat through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to check out the other shades in the Rio Neon collection!</li>
            <li> After 2 coats it&#x27;s still slightly see through.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell you how long it wears but my friend who chips nail polish off real bad is excited to try it and were going to compare how long it lasts between the two of us.</li>
            <li> I wore it to the ocean and was scared the fish would think my fingers were little tropical fish.</li>
            <li> My nails usually split and break if I try to grow them, but with this product I have zero splits or nail breakage.</li>
            <li> Sad to say, but local beauty supply stores don&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> With some of their colors I&#x27;m frustrated because of how thick it is, this one definitely doesn&#x27;t have that</li>
            <li> It is a very dull color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it arrived late since it was shipped to wrong address, and since I was leaving for Europe the gel in the USA .</li>
            <li> Actually, eight including base coat, topcoat, and strengthener</li>
            <li> always with Gelish, apply thinly and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the color!</li>
            <li> disappointed &#x27;shake it til</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this color!!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the color and with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is as expected, there isn&#x27;t a great deal of science involved, either the polish looks and performs as it should or not.  This one does!  A good product and a good seller.</li>
            <li> So I seriously love love love this color. Do not let the word &amp;#34;NEON&amp;#34; detour you. It is a bright pink but it is so pretty! If you are looking for a super cute pink this is it. Great for any season. This is seriously my favorite color of all! Went on very well, you could even get away with just one coat, but I like to put two on because it gives it a little bit of a deeper color to it.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this color!! Bright in sunlight but also can get away with wearing it to work also:)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this  color!  So Summery!  PERFECT! Exactly what I was looking for. Stayed on as well as another creative* shellac brand...  color is very close to &#x27;pool party&#x27; by china  glaze, but it lasts two weeks because its a  UV/ Gel !!! Could not  be more pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this brand of nail polish. It is the only kind I currently use. It makes my natural nails strong. You have to buy a light to cure it but it lasts for a week.</li>
            <li> This is my first Gelish gel color/polish, and it is fantastic. I&#x27;ve now had it on for 12 days and it still looks great! Still has a very high shine with no chips. For me, I&#x27;m not sure I would say this color is really that neon. I would say it depends on lighting. For the most part, to me, it looks like a really nice tutti fruitti pink color. I will add, though, in certain lighting, it looked a neon orange...for some odd reason. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m really, really happy with my first gelish gel color.  My nails usually split and break if I try to grow them, but with this product I have zero splits or nail breakage. They are growing very nicely! This gel product gives my nails a bit more strength. I would recommend Gelish products and this \\&quot;Shake it till you Samba\\&quot; color.  Oh, and people are asking me \\&quot;Who does your nails?\\&quot; ;)</li>
            <li> This color is BRIGHT. It&#x27;s probably more on the neon side. I have fair skin and this was the exact color I wanted, perfect for summer and my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Gelish color and it went on much better than my Nailuv color did but i&#x27;m a little skeptical because one nail started lifting two days after I painted it and peeled right off! I redid it hoping that i just didn&#x27;t buff the nail enough to get a good grip and it was a fluke. My Nailuv color lasted two weeks and was nowhere near ready to come off, i&#x27;m hoping this lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> I love this color. I had to use 2 coats to get the color I wanted. I have used  June Bride over it for a 3rd coat with sparkle.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of all Gelish polishes. They are long lasting (2-3wks) and do not chip like regular nail polishes. I just ordered this color along with the tiki tiki laranga (neon orange) for the summer and am very happy with it. They are very bright and neon. If your looking for some hot shades for the summer to go with your tan, then I definitely recommend this Rio Neon, Shake it Til You Samba!</li>
            <li> This color is PERFECT! It is the exact pink I was looking for. Its not dark and its not redish. It is a nice summer bright pink! This was my first time to every apply a gel-polish and it went on so easy! I am not good at painting my nails, and they look so good! It only took 1 coat &amp; looks fabulous. The consistency of the product is great. Be sure to use with other Gelish products, the pH buffer, base &amp; top coats. Also- it helps to buff the nails to rough them up a a little before applying.</li>
            <li> I love this color. Its bright pink and cheerful. Its great for summer. This is a color that I will be using over and over again.</li>
            <li> I really like this color. It&#x27;s a hot fuchsia. Not a light hot pink, but still pretty. I wish they also made a lighter bright pink, but I guess this will have to do.</li>
            <li> pretty color. very close to gossip girl. disappointed &#x27;shake it til you samba&#x27; isnt a bright neon as described. will definately wear again. i would choose this color over gossip girl. just not exactly what i wanted. love gelish products!</li>
            <li> Love it. This color is nice and bright. I put it on my toes and I swear it stayed on my feet for more than 6 weeks.  I took it off beacuse the new growth was noticeable. I love it!</li>
            <li> just the one i wanted its neon pink really bright after 3 layers its great i love it definitly buying again</li>
            <li> it ship really fast love it,</li>
            <li> The color is great for toes, hot pink.  I was surprised that the color in the posted photos made it appear much more muted.</li>
            <li> Received in the mail on time and as soon as I opened it up, my daughter wanted her nails painted!  Great transaction, great color, love the bright neon gel polish!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful bright/neon pink color that is perfect for Summer wear! I was not at all disappointed when I received the product - the color is just as beautiful in person as the online pics depict.</li>
            <li> Love the color...PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Great color and lasted a long time!</li>
            <li> This exceeded my expectation. The color is so vibrant! Awesome for a tropical vacation or just a fun summer color. The color is a bit more orange than it appears in the picture but I still love it!</li>
            <li> Love this color. I&#x27;m new to doing my own gel nails after I had it done twice in the salon. I bought all I needed (led curing light, gelish set at amazon. Lint free wipes and cuticle remover and tools at my local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions I got from the gelish website ... Works great!</li>
            <li> big bottle, great color wears well.  I have 2 or 3 other brands of gel, and I find that this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I finally was able to get around doing my first gelish mani yesterday and i used this bright color to start! I love hot pink nail polish and this one has to be at the top of my list! the color is very bright and what I would define as a true hot pink! I used this in combination with the Martha Stewart Glitters. All nails were pink and the ring finger had a layer of gold glitter on top. Super happy about my gelish investment! I look forward to seeing my nails nice and long from here on out! :)</li>
            <li> Love this color and works perfect! Will buy more when I run out. I&#x27;ve had about a year and still have a lot left in the bottle. A must try!</li>
            <li> I live in NYC and you would expect the many salons around me to have neon pink...but they didn&#x27;t. I just tried this out and it is exactly the color I was looking for. Definately HOT pink neon.</li>
            <li> I have NO IDEA why anyone would include the word \\&quot;NEON\\&quot; in the title of this color because it is anything BUT \\&quot;neon\\&quot;. I purchased this bottle through Amazon but they won&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s considered hazardous material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even want to give this bottle one star except that I had to in order to post a review. I am very disappointed in the color and with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really confused by the great reviews that everyone was giving this color. Perhaps, Gelish recently changed the color and kept the same name? I have known OPI and Esse to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is more of a rusty-taupe (reddish with a hint of pink). It is a very dull color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only purchased this color based on all of the other great reviews about the color being \\&quot;NEON PINK\\&quot; and \\&quot;great for summer\\&quot;.  As of March 2014, this color is anything but \\&quot;neon pink\\&quot; or \\&quot;great for summer\\&quot;. Buyer ... beware.</li>
            <li> This is a great Gelish color!! It goes on SOO great. It&#x27;s very opaque. This color definitely only takes two coats. I would recommend looking at the pictures that other reviewers have submitted to get a real idea on the color. I purchased mine from Payless and I got it super fast at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used the Gelish product.  I have used Creative Nail Design but I am not very happy with the colors that are available through them.  I did see Gelish samples and really liked the colors.  I purchased this color,the base and top coat through Amazon.  I love the color and the product.  It goes on just like polish and the color is bright and very pretty. I&#x27;m not sure about the durability as this is the first day that I am wearing the product.  So far, I am very happy and will definitely try out other colors in the future.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect summer pink! It was a bright color, but it wasn&#x27;t overly bright. Just right. :-) Very nice.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is I LOVE IT I would def buy another one the best I ever got!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my absolutely favorite color thus far. It is vibrant and bright, but not neon or obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brand, Gelish is by far my favorite of the gel polishes, I don&#x27;t see myself using any other brand or paying for another manicure as long as Gelish keeps producing quality products and great colors.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color for spring and summer. The polish stays on until you decide to take it off. I even got into a tanning bed with it on and it did not harm the color. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product looks on my nails, although it is VERY difficult to really tell what a color looks like from a computer.  This is very neon bright!  I think the next one won&#x27;t be neon.  :)  I trust that if you want neon, this is a very pretty color!</li>
            <li> Beautiful pink Barbie fun!  Love this color for a bright summer pink.  Two coats was plenty to get good coverage over the nail.</li>
            <li> very beautiful color I have always had great experience with Harmony gelish polish. I will be back for more colors. Thanks Harmony for a great product.</li>
            <li> Great color, same great quality as other gelish polishes. Applies smooth. A+ product, will be a return customer no doubt!</li>
            <li> Nice color, really bright!!!</li>
            <li> Gelish is all I use now on my fingernails, and I love this color!  Gelish polish makes my nails look shiny and like I had them professionally done!  It actually lasts too, unlike most regular polishes!  Even if you have thin or brittle nails, this polish will make them look beautiful.  It is dry immediately with a UV dryer, and it&#x27;s easy to remove!  Amazon also has the best prices I&#x27;ve seen for Gelish!</li>
            <li> Great color. Looks good on toes :)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone.  Great quality and the colour rocks the show.  Fantastic for summer toes!!!! Yay.</li>
            <li> Prettiest pink on olive skin.. Love the color</li>
            <li> I had been waiting for Gelish to come out with a great hot pink and this is it! Super great summer color!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great neon pink.  Love the Gelish system and love getting it on Amazon! Sad to say, but local beauty supply stores don&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle of UV polish and I love it! I was hesitant to buy UV polish because the colors are generally very boring and there was only one I had liked, till I looked on Amazon. I love neon colored nail polish but its really streaky and too transparent and chips easily, Gelish is a great alternative its glossy. I only just applied it today so I can&#x27;t tell you how long it wears but my friend who chips nail polish off real bad is excited to try it and were going to compare how long it lasts between the two of us. I was really thrilled, I even stamped on it with my konad stamper and put a normal top coat on it like normal nail polish as I was told you can do nail art on it just like normal polish and the nail art generally lasts longer because of the surface its applied to, just like when I had acrylic nails the nail polish lasts 2-3 weeks till the growth shows, its also great because when I messed up it wiped clean with a little remover and was still beautiful shiny neon pink! I really like it. And I was pleasantly surprised it was a FULL sized bottle for the price of a MINI. I hope to buy more colors.</li>
            <li> This is always my go to color. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s winter or summer. It really looks beautiful with coat of &amp;#34;Good Gossip&amp;#34; on top.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS COLOR!  Harmony gelish polish is great.  I do my own nails and most people think I have them done professionally.  Highly recommend this product and color.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color!  It&#x27;s the same color they have in the salons and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it!  Perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> I probably would have liked a pink that was bright, but just not this neon-y bright.  But my fault I guess since the name did say &amp;#34;Neon&amp;#34;!!  Anyway, if you want a Very bright, neon-y pink, then this color is for you.&lt;br /&gt;As for it&#x27;s performance, it is a Gellish product and that means quality to me!</li>
            <li> this is a beautiful hot pink color! product is the real thing, actual gelish brand which is great. works well with the whole set and UV light. I used only 2 min. for this color to cure</li>
            <li> Although this is a very pretty pink, it is no where near neon colored. I even painted on 3 coats. It is more of a passion pink, which is a color I already own, so now I own two of the same colors. There is a neon pink by China Glaze that I&#x27;m obsessed with, wish it could be more like that and more like the picture/description!</li>
            <li> This color is perfect for summer! I love it!! It looks super bright when you open it, but the color is actually much nicer on, but definitely bright! :)</li>
            <li> I love my pink gel polish! I&#x27;ve used it for several special occasions and it is cute and lasts multiple weeks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in LOVE with this color. Bright and Pink! Not overly pink and appears more neon in bright natural light (outdoors).</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! The perfect shade of hot pink in my opinion. Gelish is by far my favorite brand of gel polish.</li>
            <li> This color is fabulous by far my favorite for the summer. I applied it yesterday for the first time and had lots of compliments! I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Bright pink and love it!</li>
            <li> Hands down the is my most absolute favorite pink. I have eighteeen gelish colors and I have to make myself use the otherswhen all I want to use is this</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite gelish color. It&#x27;s hot pink and super bright but I live in Hawaii, so it&#x27;s perfect for me because I can wear it year round! I have gotten so many compliments since I painted my nails this color (more than the other gelish colors I&#x27;ve worn before). I work at a nursing home and even the older women there have commented on my nail color and how much they love it. I would definitely recommend this color if you want something bright and summery!</li>
            <li> Great product and great price for full sized bottle. I love gelish however this was NOT the color I was expecting. It is true Barbie pink. I thought it looked more like a coral color on my screen but not so. I would suggest looking at a local Beaty supply store their colors and then going back online to find cheaper so you get the color you want at a great price.</li>
            <li> Practically glow in the dark pink. Compliments pale skin (can only speak about pale Irish skin) . If you like hot pink, this is for you. Not subtle, bright!</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish. It is definitely a bargain buying from amazon than from Sally&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve had this for over a year, and it&#x27;s still fairly full!! Worth it!!</li>
            <li> Super trendy and fun, get compliments on it all the time!  Stays on really well too.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> love gelish, but especially love this color! great application, great color etc. probably do need 2 coats, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I love the neon collection colors. Great price and last a full 2 weeks or more. FYI.....I do my own nails at home with my UV light and nail kit.</li>
            <li> I used Shake It Till You Samba today as an accent nail...  this was my first time wearing it and I&#x27;m in love...  it will be my go to color this summer...  really makes my tan pop ...  beautiful color if you like brights and you&#x27;ve never tried this color before and your a pink girl you&#x27;ll love it..</li>
            <li> it arrived late since it was shipped to wrong address, and since I was leaving for Europe the gel in the USA . Unfortunately I can not rate it since I will not be able to use for at least another 6-12 months when I will be going back home.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this color!!! By far my fav so far!! I have other colors but always go back to this one!!! It&#x27;s more of a darker pink bright color. Not a pink pink color like pictured. It&#x27;s awesome! You can&#x27;t go wrong with the color! Looks great on toes too:)</li>
            <li> It is a nice, bright neon pink. It is brighter than shown. I used 2 coats and it covers well.  It has the usual gelish quality, lasting 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT.  Get a lot more for your money.  Sally sells bottles half the size for same amount of money.  Will always buy here</li>
            <li> I am not sure why some of the images and reviews present Shake it Til You Samba as a less-than-outrageous neon pink. I can promise you that this shade is so loud that you&#x27;ll be noticed everywhere you go! Based on the existing reviews and images for this shade, I was quite nervous I&#x27;d be receiving a color that&#x27;s just a couple steps up from a baby pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I do know, however, that there is counterfeit Gelish floating around on the Internet that falls flat next to genuine Gelish. I&#x27;ve purchased five [EDIT: Actually, eight including base coat, topcoat, and strengthener] Gelish polishes through Amazon, and I have been 100% satisfied with all sellers and products.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When compared to traditional polish in neon shades, Gelish&#x27;s neon seems to be more color-saturated; expect to apply three thin coats for the best coverage. I can&#x27;t wait to check out the other shades in the Rio Neon collection!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this pink. It has gotten me many compliments and was exactly what I was looking for. It definitely looks the most neon in outdoor light but I love it in all lighting. I am going to have a hard time using my other colors now :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this gelish color.  It is the perfect hot pink. It looks great with 2 coats and, I have also put June Bride over it, and it looks really cute.</li>
            <li> I love pink and this Neon Pink is adorable.&lt;br /&gt;I used it as an accent color in a burgundy manicure as it&#x27;s winter and I didn&#x27;t want to have all 10 fingers painted in this shade as it is bright and bold.&lt;br /&gt;As always with Gelish, apply thinly and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a spring/summer pink color and this seemed the best out of all the Gelish options. I own 5 Gelish colors now and this is by far the runniest, thinnest color I have. After 2 coats it&#x27;s still slightly see through. I think 3 coats would&#x27;ve been better, but I didn&#x27;t have time. With some of their colors I&#x27;m frustrated because of how thick it is, this one definitely doesn&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color turns out almost peachy in some of the pictures, but it really does seem like a mixture of bright pink with a tiny bit of orange/peach. In sunlight it&#x27;s a beautiful pink color. Overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought this color, I just wish it weren&#x27;t so thin. I&#x27;ve got multiple compliments on it over the last few days.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely shade! I wore it to the ocean and was scared the fish would think my fingers were little tropical fish. The color is so bright and pretty. I love the Gelish colors. They are quality and lasting.</li>
            <li> Tried this brand because it costs a little less than CND.&lt;br /&gt;Color is pretty but.... the stuff is pretty runny.  Not as&lt;br /&gt;thick, and put 3 coats of color on instead of the recommended&lt;br /&gt;2.  You could still see the nail with 2 coats.  CND does not&lt;br /&gt;have as many colors.  Gelish has alot more, so I thought if&lt;br /&gt;they are the same, this will work good.  The consistency of&lt;br /&gt;the polish, I don&#x27;t care for it, but I would buy it again to get&lt;br /&gt;a color I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, bright, happy pink for summer.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it -- I&#x27;m wearing it right now!</li>
            <li> This gelish color is awesome... Fluorescent pink! It&#x27;s just as bright and fun as I hoped. When I opened the bottle I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be quite as bright as I&#x27;d hoped, but it really is. It&#x27;s a great color!</li>
            <li> i really like bright polishes and enjoy this color.  great for the summer, and hot pink is always my favorite for the summer months.</li>
            <li> If you love neon you will love this. I get complimented frequently on the color and most people think my nails are done in a salon when in fact there done at home :)</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful. Very bright but I wouldn&#x27;t say so much &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34;,  will look good with any skin tone.</li>
