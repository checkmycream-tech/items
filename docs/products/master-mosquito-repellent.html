            <li>in turn I would provide my honest opinion.  </li>

            <li>So far it is working great!</li>

            <li>The packs themselves are a nice compact size &amp; have a strong oder to them.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>but Im glad I got to try this out.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than applying any repellents or using the can to spray the ground.</li>
            <li>It was playing outdoors much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than spraying your body with chemicals.</li>
            <li>so I should&#x27;ve purchased 4 of these but didn&#x27;t think I would need that many of them.</li>
            <li>It worked better then I thought.</li>
            <li>it smells a lot better then</li>
            <li>best part, I can take it off when I come back</li>
            <li>then I started seeing more mosquito&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Mosquitoes love this.</li>
            <li>and it sure did help while he was fishing.  </li>
            <li>I think my dog was just as glad that I had the bracelet as I was.</li>
            <li>Just a few bites which is a great win - mosquitoes love me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bracelet is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy as that!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The smell is not to strong either.</li>
            <li>The bait is scented with natural oils, and has a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li>I wear this on my walks at night and it&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li>It could also easily &amp; strongly secure to items like purses, bookbags, &amp; chairs &amp; it will stay in place until removed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s fantastic and it works!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and the nights are absolutely filled to the brim with mosquitoes.</li>
            <li>Works good so far.</li>
            <li>I put it on his ankle so far so good.</li>
            <li>I love this bracelet so much that I am considering purchasing one for everyone in my family!</li>
            <li>Would buy again; it is worth the price to have some relief !  </li>
            <li>and they look cool for my son to wear...</li>
            <li>the sprays, it is comfortable to have on, and the colored band are fun for my kids and myself.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad, but to me personally, it was very strong</li>
            <li>This bug band actually keeps the beasts away from me, and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>hence I move my arm around near the top of my head, or ears, for instance...</li>
            <li>Look at the reviews, almost all the positive reviews are from people who received it free, for their positive review.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t have the bites he usually gets and was so happy.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I am just a great target for mosquitos, but sadly I feel I am better off carrying my spray repellents.</li>
            <li>I first opened the bracelet</li>
            <li>it burned my nostrils from the smell - and I was pretty worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li>For next year I will be buying one for each wrist and two more for my ankles as well.</li>
            <li>I was able to get this during a recent promotion and</li>
            <li>I have used many different wrist mosquito repellents.</li>
            <li>My right hand was free of bites but my left, and my legs weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It works pretty much as advertised.</li>
            <li>The bracelet comes with 2 scent packs that have a strong citronella smell (it must be mixed with other natural oils because it smells really good).  </li>
            <li>Awesome mosquito repellent bracelet and worked very easily.</li>
            <li>I live right on a lake</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>You get 2 free refills that will last over 30 days!</li>
            <li>Even spray on repellents dont help as much as I would like, &amp; they make my skin sticky.</li>
            <li>In the 10-15 mins I was outside that night, with the bracelet securely in place, I got bit 6 times.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot...</li>
            <li>Seemed to work really well on our camping trip to Twin Lakes, Mammoth.</li>
            <li>This one fits snug against my wrist and really kept the mosquitos and nats away.</li>
            <li>This really does not work.</li>
            <li>mosquitoes like too much my blood.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for other ways that would be more convenient than carrying bottles with me everywhere.</li>
            <li>Wish these kinds of repellent devices had been invented, many years ago, wow,  what a great concept !</li>
            <li>I will being getting one for my older son as well and ordering refills.  </li>
            <li>The bracelet itself is very simple &amp; super lightweight.</li>
            <li>so I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>Good for my son his always outside playing  no more worried for me.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida where there are bird size</li>
            <li>But may go to something stronger to wear attached to body vs. on the skin, as am very sensitive to toxins.</li>
            <li>I was outside with my kids, and put it on my wrist, and did not get bitten by any mosquitoes the whole time I was wearing it!</li>
            <li>Since I only have one bracelet, I put it on my toddler&#x27;s ankle, because he is more prone to mosquito bites than any of my other children, and he didn&#x27;t get bitten any, either, while he had it</li>
            <li>Find I need to remain aware of when the bugs are out, and where they are hovering on, or near my body, in relation to my banded</li>
            <li>We put them on our wrists and we never got one mosquito bite the whole time we were outside.</li>
            <li>It is soft &amp; bery comforable to wear.</li>
            <li>I tested it on a day where I knew I would be out late when mosquitos come out more.</li>
            <li>Seems to work as well, so far, but no refills with this one.</li>
            <li>Works for the most part, Mosquitos are really thick here</li>
            <li>Wondering how long first refill will last.</li>
            <li>I put one on my 3 year old and he received a few bits but nothing like it was (20 or more bits in a few minutes).</li>
            <li>best working repellent bracelet I have tried yet</li>
            <li>For anyone who only wants minimal protection, buy this.</li>
            <li>There are similar bracelets if one is not politically opposed to shopping at Walmart and will wear a citronella infused bungee coil directly on skin for $1.00.</li>

            <li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about is that the bracelet isn&#x27;t very stretchy, so if I use it on my ankle instead of my wrist, it fits very snugly.</li>
            <li> I watched one land on my arm, not far from the bracelet, which reinforced my skepticism, but the mosquito immediately flew away without biting me!</li>
            <li> bracelet goes big enough for me and my husband, but small enough for my kids.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I opened the package, inserted the brand new repellent insert, walked outside, and was swarmed by mosquitoes (where there are MANY).</li>
            <li> but no where near the amount I usually get</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it would last, since we just started using it.</li>
            <li> Then I went into my garage (where there are few) and, after a minute or so, felt a mosquito biting me on the back of the arm with the bracelet!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that he still got a few bites, but nowhere near the amount of mosquito bites he usually gets.  </li>
            <li> It worked extremely well for for about four days</li>
            <li> and we both are usually seen bolting to a tree for the dog to pee, then back to the house.</li>
            <li> is so easy for me to do, when I take the dogs out, because the mosquitoes are bad here.</li>
            <li> I received this mosquito repellent bracelet by ArtNaturals at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It was easy to open the package and put the small plastic repellent disc in the mesh part of the band.</li>
            <li> It attaches to your wrist or ankle by velcro, and has a little mesh pocket that the scented bait slips into.</li>
            <li> My little ones</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this bracelet, but was really disappointed in its performance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to spray myself or get eaten up every time I walk out the door, even for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I got a few bites</li>
            <li> So, when I was offered the chance to test &amp; review this repellent bracelet, I was excited.</li>
            <li> I live in north central MN and the Mosquitos have been AWFUL this Summer.</li>
            <li> The disc stays in the band well and easily it isn&#x27;t hard to get the band to stay around your wrist and it works well.</li>
            <li> so it is hard to stop all of them</li>

            <li> I have always been very skeptical of non-spray mosquito repellents, and their ability to keep mosquitoes at bay. To be honest, I have never considered using one. I received this mosquito repellent bracelet by ArtNaturals at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am very happy with the results. I was outside with my kids, and put it on my wrist, and did not get bitten by any mosquitoes the whole time I was wearing it! I watched one land on my arm, not far from the bracelet, which reinforced my skepticism, but the mosquito immediately flew away without biting me! I now am a believer! Since I only have one bracelet, I put it on my toddler&#x27;s ankle, because he is more prone to mosquito bites than any of my other children, and he didn&#x27;t get bitten any, either, while he had it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bracelet is easy to use. It attaches to your wrist or ankle by velcro, and has a little mesh pocket that the scented bait slips into. The bait is scented with natural oils, and has a pleasant odor. I love this bracelet so much that I am considering purchasing one for everyone in my family!</li>
            <li> It worked great.  My husband does landscaping so he is outside all day.  Now we just need one for those pesky yellow flies.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This band actually works! I wasn&#x27;t sure how but Im glad I got to try this out. My backyard is full of mosquitoes and this comes in very handy! This is so much better than applying any repellents or using the can to spray the ground. Love this!!!</li>
            <li> I use it for my late sunset yoga class in the park. Works great! No issues. Not sure how long it would last, since we just started using it. So far it is working great!</li>
            <li> I was not sure this would work when I first opened the product.  But once I opened the scent pack I knew it was going to be a mosquito killer.  The bracelet comes with 2 scent packs that have a strong citronella smell (it must be mixed with other natural oils because it smells really good).  I decided to try this on my dad who&#x27;s the sweetest treat a mosquito could ask for.  He always seems to get bit everytime we&#x27;re outside in the evening.  He wouldn&#x27;t wear the bracelet, so we just hung it on his chair while we saw a concert.  I have to admit that he still got a few bites, but nowhere near the amount of mosquito bites he usually gets.  I would totally recommend this product and will be buying one for myself as well.</li>
            <li> I received this item at a discounted price for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the bracelet it burned my nostrils from the smell - and I was pretty worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work...I was wrong. Works great. Been getting lots of rain - lots of rain equal muggy days with mosquito&#x27;s everywhere. I wear this on my walks at night and it&#x27;s light weight and I don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Completely useless in Illinois!</li>
            <li> I wish I had purchased more!  These are great!  No sprays... and they look cool for my son to wear... so much better than those silicone bracelets!</li>
            <li> My little ones and I always get bite when we play outside in the summer. These bracelets worked wonders! We put them on our wrists and we never got one mosquito bite the whole time we were outside. It was playing outdoors much more enjoyable. The pest repellent these bracelets have are made with natural ingredients. It&#x27;s much better than spraying your body with chemicals. You get 2 free refills that will last over 30 days! I stand by this product and truly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Awesome mosquito repellent bracelet and worked very easily. It was easy to open the package and put the small plastic repellent disc in the mesh part of the band. The disc stays in the band well and easily it isn&#x27;t hard to get the band to stay around your wrist and it works well. I have noticed that mosquitos stay away from me when the band is on. I received this product to share my honest thoughts and opinions about it.</li>
            <li> It protected only around the area where I wore the bracelet. My right hand was free of bites but my left, and my legs weren&#x27;t. There were bites everywhere so I should&#x27;ve purchased 4 of these but didn&#x27;t think I would need that many of them. For anyone who only wants minimal protection, buy this. I&#x27;m kinda disappointed  with this product.</li>
            <li> Works good so far. My family are mosquito magnets especially my youngest son, who is two. I put it on his ankle so far so good. I hope it keeps working. Bought at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Works well. I wore this for about 6 hrs yesterday and didn&#x27;t get bit once.</li>
            <li> best working repellent bracelet I have tried yet</li>
            <li> It worked better then I thought. I live in north central MN and the Mosquitos have been AWFUL this Summer. I hate putting all those chemicals on my children everyday just so they can play outside so I decided to give this a try. I put one on my 3 year old and he received a few bits but nothing like it was (20 or more bits in a few minutes). It is not has effective as the spray but does work. I will being getting one for my older son as well and ordering refills.  ADDED BONUS it smells a lot better then the sprays, it is comfortable to have on, and the colored band are fun for my kids and myself.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to Mosquitos &amp; I tend to get bitten like crazy throughout the summer months. Even spray on repellents dont help as much as I would like, &amp; they make my skin sticky. I have been looking for other ways that would be more convenient than carrying bottles with me everywhere. So, when I was offered the chance to test &amp; review this repellent bracelet, I was excited. This bracelet arrived in simple plastic packaging. The orange color is bright &amp; summer like. The bracelet itself is very simple &amp; super lightweight. It is soft &amp; bery comforable to wear. It could also easily &amp; strongly secure to items like purses, bookbags, &amp; chairs &amp; it will stay in place until removed. There isn&#x27;t much to the item, it has a Velcro closure, &amp; a mesh pouch to place the repellent packs into. The packs themselves are a nice compact size &amp; have a strong oder to them. The smell is not bad, but to me personally, it was very strong so I had high hopes for this product. Unfortunately, for my personal experience these repellent packs were no help. I tested it on a day where I knew I would be out late when mosquitos come out more. In the 10-15 mins I was outside that night, with the bracelet securely in place, I got bit 6 times. Maybe I am just a great target for mosquitos, but sadly I feel I am better off carrying my spray repellents.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic to have around!&lt;br /&gt;You get the protection of a spray, without the nasty residue because you just wear the band!&lt;br /&gt;All you do is simply slide the refil tab into the bracelet, and put it on. Easy as that!&lt;br /&gt;This is so easy for me to do, when I take the dogs out, because the mosquitoes are bad here. I don&#x27;t have to spray myself or get eaten up every time I walk out the door, even for a few minutes. Just put it on and go&lt;br /&gt;The best part, I can take it off when I come back inside!&lt;br /&gt;I put this in a ziplock when not in use. I don&#x27;t know if it helps, but I feel better doing so LOL&lt;br /&gt;This bracelet goes big enough for me and my husband, but small enough for my kids.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s fantastic and it works!&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discount for the purpose of an honest review. MY opinion is my own and is not influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> I am a mosquito&#x27;s favorite meal - no longer!!  This bug band actually keeps the beasts away from me, and smells amazing.  The refill lasted about 2 weeks before I started getting bit again.  Refills are easy to insert, too!  The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about is that the bracelet isn&#x27;t very stretchy, so if I use it on my ankle instead of my wrist, it fits very snugly.</li>
            <li> My wife got two mosquito bites on her arm just above where she was wearing the bracelet within 5 minutes of stepping outside.  It might work for some people but if you are a &amp;#34;mosquito magnet&amp;#34; like my wife look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this for Boy Scout summer camp. It works pretty much as advertised. I had no bites from the waist up. My ankles were a different story. For next year I will be buying one for each wrist and two more for my ankles as well. This product is inexpensive and it works. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Went Back packing on Isle Royale in August.  Prior to the trip I had sprayed all of my clothes with permethrin.  The mosquito&#x27;s still buzzed and bit my head and exposed arms.  Hung this from my baseball cap - mosquito&#x27;s left me alone.  It worked extremely well for for about four days then I started seeing more mosquito&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Mosquitoes love this.It&#x27;s a total west of money.</li>
            <li> It works, not like a miracle, but close enough. Getting one or two bites now,  vs, one or two dozen.  Find I need to remain aware of when the bugs are out, and where they are hovering on, or near my body, in relation to my banded wrist-- hence I move my arm around near the top of my head, or ears, for instance... I am thinking the bright orange color is also a mosquito magnet.  Wondering how long first refill will last. Citronella scent is beginning to fade, has been 10 days... Taking advice from another reviewer, and storing bracelet wrapped in plastic when not in use.  Would buy again; it is worth the price to have some relief !  But may go to something stronger to wear attached to body vs. on the skin, as am very sensitive to toxins. Wish these kinds of repellent devices had been invented, many years ago, wow,  what a great concept ! Thanks a lot... PS: There are similar bracelets if one is not politically opposed to shopping at Walmart and will wear a citronella infused bungee coil directly on skin for $1.00. Seems to work as well, so far, but no refills with this one.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I was able to get this during a recent promotion and in turn I would provide my honest opinion.  I put this on my son when we went camping and it sure did help while he was fishing.  He didn&#x27;t have the bites he usually gets and was so happy.  No obscene smells, just worked!</li>
            <li> Seemed to work really well on our camping trip to Twin Lakes, Mammoth. Just a few bites which is a great win - mosquitoes love me.</li>
            <li> Works for the most part, Mosquitos are really thick here rite now so it is hard to stop all of them but it defiantly helps!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works as advertised. Very happy with the end state.</li>
            <li> Works well with mosquitoes! Only mosquitoes! Smells great!</li>
            <li> Hello. It&#x27;s nice and good protection to my kids .get out of bite mostquitos.  Good for my son his always outside playing  no more worried for me. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have used many different wrist mosquito repellents. This one fits snug against my wrist and really kept the mosquitos and nats away. The smell is not to strong either. We have reused it by putting the band back in the package.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was bitten on my ankles, elbows and wrists.  I must need something stronger.</li>
            <li> It only repellent some of them</li>
            <li> I live in Florida where there are bird size Mosquitos. I took a walk while wearing this band to test how well it would work. I got a few bites but no where near the amount I usually get so I deem it effective!</li>
            <li> I was given this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Having said that, the bracelet works pretty awesome. I live right on a lake and the nights are absolutely filled to the brim with mosquitoes. I walk the dog at night and we both are usually seen bolting to a tree for the dog to pee, then back to the house. I used this last night and didn&#x27;t get bit once. I think my dog was just as glad that I had the bracelet as I was.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this bracelet, but was really disappointed in its performance. I opened the package, inserted the brand new repellent insert, walked outside, and was swarmed by mosquitoes (where there are MANY). Then I went into my garage (where there are few) and, after a minute or so, felt a mosquito biting me on the back of the arm with the bracelet! This really does not work. Look at the reviews, almost all the positive reviews are from people who received it free, for their positive review. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, I guess this year mosquitoes like too much my blood. Nobody else in the family is getting bitten. I did wear for one week and already have been bitten. I am only wearing one bracelet, maybe I should wear four. I will go back to using the spray form of mosquito repellent.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly! It keep all mosquitos away from my skin.</li>
