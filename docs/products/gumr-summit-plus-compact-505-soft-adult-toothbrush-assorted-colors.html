            <li> My dentists and hygienists have always told me to use a compact soft toothbrush. I&#x27;ve tried, but those are hard to find! It&#x27;s getting easier to find soft heads, but not compact. Finally in desperation (why didn&#x27;t I think of this before) I checked Amazon. There were several brands, but the reviews of this model sold me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it on a Monday, with a predicted delivery of that Friday through the following Wednesday, and behold it arrived two days later on Wednesday. I used it for the first time tonight. I may be premature, but I really like it so far. The head is a great size and it really got my teeth clean. As in been to the dentist clean. I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised - I used to buy Gum flossers and liked them the best, but now cannot find them locally. Good news, I see that they are also available through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless it falls apart on me or something equally ridiculous, I definitely see buying more of these in my future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh and best part - even though I didn&#x27;t get a color choice, they actually sent one in my favorite color!).</li>
            <li> After buying 5 different &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes, I FINALLY found one that is actually SOFT!  Feels great, doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  I suppose one should not buy a toothbrush without first seeing it in a pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Simply the most comfortable toothbrush I have ever used. I got my 1st one from my dental hygienist and was hooked. The only bummer is they are not available in any retail stores.</li>
            <li> I have specific gum/teeth issues relating to an auto accident when I was 16. Needless to say, the partial I wear has not been kind to my teeth. After some extensive oral surgery in November 2013, I was given one of these brushes and fell in love with it. If one can really love a toothbrush. It&#x27;s soft, irregular bristles are perfect for getting around and under the edges of the gums. It massages the gums without the usual &amp;#34;poking&amp;#34; of regular toothbrush bristles. I sent one to my daughter but she hasn&#x27;t said whether she likes it or not. If you need a brush that&#x27;s gentle on your mouth then try this one. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have used this type before and was so glad to locate them on line!  I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> My dentist hipped me to these toothbrushes, but I&#x27;ve never seen them in the store. They are very soft but they work well and won&#x27;t make your gums recede (who wants receding gums? By the time you&#x27;re 75 you&#x27;ll look like a donkey) Make small circles and take your time.</li>
            <li> I very rarely write a review, but this toothbrush deserves a 5 star review! I used to use  a sonic toothbrush, but I never had very good checkups. I am prone to plaque, plus I have lots of other issues with my teeth, about a year ago my dental hygenist gave me this type of toothbrush, and  I LOVED it ! My checkups are the best they have ever been, this is all I use now, and as many others have mentioned, you can&#x27;t find this brush In a store? This time I ordered 10 ! I never want to run out , it  cleans my teeth so well, and massages my gums, I am so thankful for this brush.</li>
            <li> My Boyfriend loves this toothbrush! I came on here to buy it for him because we cant find it in any store!</li>
            <li> These work the best for me and they are the ones my dentist gives out with each visit. Not too rough and small enough to get in hard-to-reach places.</li>
            <li> Loved the brush, as its very soft and good for brushing while having braces. Goes in between teeth and braces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every tooth brush I could find, from pure bristle to ones so wide and ergonomically funky, you would think three strokes of the thing and you&#x27;d be done...however, NONE of them can compare with the sense of CLEAN that comes from using this brush, and I mean teeth AND gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering we&#x27;re not sharks, and only get two sets of choppers, is it worth spending a little more for an excellent toothbrush that actually delivers on its promises?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your call.  I&#x27;m getting a 12-pack next time.  These things are so damn awesome.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush, because it&#x27;s very soft, and will not hurt my gum. I&#x27;m using it to brush my teeth and gun as well as gum massage.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is superior to every other toothbrush I have ever used.  The bristle design penetrates the pockets in your gums unlike any other brush.  Of course soft stainless steel is the ultimate utensil in this environ, but for a brush, this thing is the best the human race has developed thus far.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush EVER!  Soft to sensitive gums and cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;High recommend this toothbrush...my hygenist passes it out after&lt;br /&gt;every visit.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is worth every penny.  the bristles get into every nook and cranny.  your gums dont feel scrubbed, just super clean.</li>
            <li> Yes, I absolutely love these toothbrushes!  But, I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere locally.  My first experience was with a freebie from my dentist.  I even thought of calling him to ask if I could purchase one from them,  when mine began showing wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I thought of Amazon.  I was surprised that, not only do they carry this brand, they carry the different size brush heads, as well. And, they are affordable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those not familiar, GUM brushes have very soft bristles, with the ends of the bristles appearing almost feathery.  You don&#x27;t need a medium, or firm brush to clean your teeth effectively.  In fact, I learned this the hard way after damaging the enamel on my teeth by &#x27;over-brushing,&#x27; with a brush that was too firm.  I actually had to have some areas of my front teeth bonded from brushing erosion.  Not good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are just right, which is likely why many dental hygienists offer one post cleaning.  They clean wonderfully and do not irritate, or scratch, your gums.  In fact, they actually massage the gums and are likely a good preventive of gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve hardly even used my nice electric toothbrush since finding GUM brushes.  There is no need.  My checkups have actually shown less tartar AND plaque with the GUM brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel confident endorsing this product.  If you want to be kind to your gums and teeth, give one a try.  You&#x27;re likely to be a convert, too.</li>
            <li> I was so glad when i found these on here and could buy them in bulk! they&#x27;re hard to find in the store and I had actually resorted to asking my dentist for two every time i get my teeth cleaned because I can never find them.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I learned about it from my dental hygienist, but I could never find it at my local drugstore or supermarket.  It&#x27;s soft and has long enough bristles to really get in between my teeth. My teeth always feel so clean after I&#x27;ve finished brushing.  I replace the old with the new every three months.</li>
            <li> When I ordered the brush I wasn&#x27;t sure about the compact head, but it has turned out to be an excellent alternative brush with ease at getting into the cracks and crevices of my teeth.  I highly endorse the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> great product, poor delivery time</li>
            <li> At my last teeth cleaning appointment I got a GUM Summit toothbrush in my care package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the BEST toothbrush I have ever used.  And I&#x27;am 62 years old.  It gets actually between my teeth,  I thought dang its better than flossing!!</li>
            <li> My dentist got me hooked on this brush then quit giving this one so found it on Amazon. Love the small soft head!</li>
            <li> I too have not been able to find this tooth brush (GUM 505 Summit plus, compact soft) in any store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally got one from my dentist. I love this tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;Any dentist will advocate a soft brush so as to not harm your gums, and this brush is soft, but due to the unique feathered bristles it feels so nice and cleans very will.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally it holds up well, even though one should change their brush often (2 to 4 months typically).  I find this one holds up well for 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compact head (it&#x27;s not tiny, just compact) allows reaching in the back corners, and the handle is large making it easy to hold in the shower, or with wet hands at the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad to have found this on Amazon. Now I don&#x27;t have to beg extras from my Dentist, just to give to my adult children and their families.</li>
            <li> my favorite toothbrush in the world. not too hard.</li>
            <li> Has been the most comfortable tooth brush I have ever used.  it is the only one I&#x27;ve used in 3 years.</li>
            <li> I FOUND IT ... I FOUND IT!  LOL, I cannot remember how I ever got ahold of this toothbrush, but I have been in love with it and it feels sooo good in my mouth and I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about it.  But then when I went to Walgreens and King Soopers to find the replacement today... having finally remembered to BRING my brush with me to make sure I got the right one: (and I am not kidding: I was thinking of buying them for stocking stuffers for everyone I know!!) I COULD NOT FIND THEM ANYWHERE.&lt;br /&gt;So, here I am on Amazon.com scrutinizing every GUM toothbrush photo for just the right markings &amp; head.  I FOUND IT! and I am ordering enough to last me awhile &amp; then some for friends.&lt;br /&gt;Who ever buys toothbrushes for friends?  This one is that amazing.  It has sort of feathery bristles that really feel like they are cleaning teeth &amp; gums better than those old stupid kind.  I&#x27;ll never use another toothbrush as long as I can keep getting these delivered to my door, ha!!</li>
            <li> So glad I tried this greAt toothbrush</li>
            <li> Received the toothbrushes as described.  I have not been able to find these &amp;#34;Compact&amp;#34;  brushhead (small) brushes in any of the stores and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My hygenist gave me a GUM tooth brush, which I really like.  Unfortunately, Butler has decided not to label its brushes with the model number or other unique idenitifier. Can&#x27;t find the type I want in my local drug stores, so I keep ordering GUM tooth brushes from Amazon.  Even though I look at the description and brissel pattern on Amazon, still no luck in finding the model my hygenist gave me.  Hope Butler will read this and start putting model numbers on the handles of its brushes.</li>
