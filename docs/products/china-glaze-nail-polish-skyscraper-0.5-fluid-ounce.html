            <li>Great color!</li>
            <li>and this is perfect!</li>
            <li>If you are using just this color it takes about 2 coats but is awesome looking!</li>
            <li>Either way, it was perfect.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>China Glaze is always a very good quality polish.</li>

            <li>This color is gorgeous but no matter the lengths I go to prepare and seal my nails, this polish chips.</li>
            <li>It is a gorgeous purple and if that is what you want, that is what you got.  </li>
            <li>and I loved that even more!</li>

            <li>the color is amazing.</li>

            <li>Coats went on nicely.</li>
            <li>This one specifically is perfect because you can either put it on top of a color with just one coat for a light glitter look, or apply more coats for a heavier glitter look.</li>
            <li>good polish but was expecting a more silvery color</li>
            <li>BEAUTIFUL I love the color so much and it reminds me of a night sky!!</li>

            <li>the &#x27;glitter&#x27; is more of a foil look.</li>

            <li>Love china glaze.</li>

            <li>This is one of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li>love this polish</li>
            <li>this is a must have. :)</li>
            <li>I love sparkle nail polish.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blue is amazingly beautiful, and I adore the fact that the glitter is already in the polish!</li>
            <li>I love that one two</li>
            <li>Came just in time, too :)</li>
            <li>You can get by with one coat, though 2 is better.</li>
            <li>Love the shimmery dimensional look it gives.</li>
            <li>The color captured is true to life and it&#x27;s even more sparkly than pictured!  </li>
            <li>Love the color and how easily it covers.</li>
            <li>Glitters are fine and looks really cool even in the bottle!</li>
            <li>Dark purple with silver accents, perfect for a any occasion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- smooth formula - even with the glitter</li>
            <li>, this polish dries relatively smooth (smoothest glitter polish</li>
            <li>And it stays on longer than the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color, long wear.</li>
            <li>Exactly like the picture!!</li>
            <li>Very nice nail polish, only takes 2-3 coats to cover opaque.</li>
            <li>It is still a beautiful color though and worth the extra coats in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love this color so much!  </li>
            <li>Very good to apply over another coat of nail polish gives glitter with a slight purple tint.</li>
            <li>Full coverage glitter polish in 2-3 coats.  </li>
            <li>Depending on the light, this could be seen as a more purple or more blue of a polish.</li>
            <li>Full coverage in two coats.</li>
            <li>You only need to use two coats and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>Came very quickly and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I love this polish, tons of glitter, though my bottle looks more purple than blue.</li>
            <li>This particular polish is just lovely.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on, it has a very pretty silver-sparkle effect.</li>
            <li>Very pretty polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li>All well, it&#x27;s still pretty and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Formula is great, typical for this brand.</li>
            <li>but this BLUE is my new FAVORITE! :)</li>
            <li>A nice shade of blue</li>
            <li>I was honestly expecting a darker blue when I bought the polish.</li>
            <li>Not too dark, but not crazy bright.</li>
            <li>It is pretty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a China Glaze fan since I bought my first CG polish</li>
            <li>and I love purple and blue nail colors</li>
            <li>and this is more purplish blue</li>
            <li>It is a much lighter shade.</li>
            <li>You have to apply several coats to get a darker look, but when you do, it doesn&#x27;t look smooth because of the glitter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolute must have</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li>Very shimmery &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Very sparkly but still sophisticated enough for an adult to wear to work.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews about what a beautiful blue it was and I am just a bit confused...</li>
            <li>It was exactly the color I wanted, i applied it and dried fast in 3 mn.</li>

            <li> It was exactly the color I wanted, i applied it and dried fast in 3 mn.</li>
            <li> dries quickly and HARD - no need to worry about goopy polish that won&#x27;t dry well</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look between a dark blue and a navy, but in actuality, it is a sheer silver-ish blue.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a dark blue from both the images and the actual swatches I saw of the color.</li>
            <li> Depending upon the number of coats applied, it&#x27;s a translucent smoky blue to a dark and sparkly smoky blue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a long time and the usual &amp;#34;separation&amp;#34; problem with old polishes didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> love china glaze have a ton of colors but this is ugly.</li>
            <li> Not real flashy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a rough exterior</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this was a very sheer color and required a few coats to make it opaque.</li>
            <li> Just not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the sheer side, so you&#x27;ll want at least two layers, maybe even three.</li>
            <li> When it dried it was an odd purple</li>
            <li> Ill be using this bottle quite frequently.</li>
            <li> I also bought the Tree-Mendous Green, with the glitter in it.</li>
            <li> SO NOT TRUE!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using a black or dark purple creme base and then putting two coats of this over it.</li>
            <li> have had the bottle for over a year and it hasn&#x27;t dried out yet!</li>
            <li> If you wanted blue.... too bad for you....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to build this color to be fully opaque.</li>
            <li> This polish goes on thin and does not look like the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The nail polish is very thin</li>
            <li> The jelly base and variance in silver glitter makes it look like a starry night sky.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this polish, tons of glitter, though my bottle looks more purple than blue. It&#x27;s still an amazing color but be prepared.</li>
            <li> Love China Glaze, Love the color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the sheer side, so you&#x27;ll want at least two layers, maybe even three. Other than that, it&#x27;s great. A nice shade of blue that&#x27;s glittery but not gaudy.</li>
            <li> A closer shade to indigo than the lighter blue depicted. Very pretty color. As a lacquer, it needs 1-2 coats more to achieve the desired look. Once it&#x27;s on, it has a very pretty silver-sparkle effect. Quality polish, and perfect for the holidays. I will be ordering this brand again.</li>
            <li> Full coverage glitter polish in 2-3 coats.  Deep royal blue-leaning violet jelly, with blue and silver glitter.  Formula is great, typical for this brand.</li>
            <li> I love this polish for many reasons....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the color is amazing. Bluish, purplish. Not too dark, but not crazy bright. Works for adults, not just teens.&lt;br /&gt;- smooth formula - even with the glitter, this polish dries relatively smooth (smoothest glitter polish I have)&lt;br /&gt;- the &#x27;glitter&#x27; is more of a foil look. Not real flashy.&lt;br /&gt;- dries quickly and HARD - no need to worry about goopy polish that won&#x27;t dry well&lt;br /&gt;- have had the bottle for over a year and it hasn&#x27;t dried out yet!</li>
            <li> I liked it, but had to put about three coats so it would look good.</li>
            <li> This polish goes on thin and does not look like the bottle.  It is a much lighter shade. You have to apply several coats to get a darker look, but when you do, it doesn&#x27;t look smooth because of the glitter.  It is just ok.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a sparkly nail polish, look no further!  The color captured is true to life and it&#x27;s even more sparkly than pictured!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this nailpolish!!!  It&#x27;s an absolute must have if you like glitter polishes or purply-blue color polishes.  The seller took their time to wrap up the bottle nicely with bubble wrap to ensure that the bottle would be intact when I got it.  Would buy from this seller again. A +++++!!!!</li>
            <li> Depending on the light, this could be seen as a more purple or more blue of a polish. The jelly base and variance in silver glitter makes it look like a starry night sky. Full coverage in two coats. Recommended for lovers of jelly polishes, blue/purple polishes, and glitter polishes. One of CG&#x27;s best colors yet!</li>
            <li> Very pretty polish. Love the color and how easily it covers. China Glaze is always a very good quality polish.</li>
            <li> This color is gorgeous but no matter the lengths I go to prepare and seal my nails, this polish chips. The same day, sometimes only hours later.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, long wear.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL I love the color so much and it reminds me of a night sky!! I would buy this color.  It is pretty</li>
            <li> This color is nice, not my favorite one from China Glaze.  When it dried it was an odd purple but it went on well &amp; only needed two coats.</li>
            <li> Love this bluish metallic polish...it&#x27;s fine glitter and looks great with jeans!</li>
            <li> Love china glaze. The polish goes on smooth and lasts with a top coat on my nails it for days!</li>
            <li> I love this color so much!  I&#x27;ve been a China Glaze fan since I bought my first CG polish and I must say this exceeded my expectations.  You only need to use two coats and you&#x27;re good to go.  I would recommend this polish to anyone!</li>
            <li> Came very quickly and was exactly what I wanted. My only complaint is that this was a very sheer color and required a few coats to make it opaque. It is still a beautiful color though and worth the extra coats in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This particular polish is just lovely. It has as bunch of sparkles in it. Which I love sparkles! I highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having the night sky on my toes! It&#x27;s very pretty. Tiny flecks of silver. Not gaudy. Blue purple. Coats went on nicely. I sealed with top coat.</li>
            <li> Very nice nail polish, only takes 2-3 coats to cover opaque. Dark purple with silver accents, perfect for a any occasion. Definitely for the glitter-obsessed person. Glimmers in the light!</li>
            <li> I was honestly expecting a darker blue when I bought the polish. The picture makes it look between a dark blue and a navy, but in actuality, it is a sheer silver-ish blue. It also took me 3 coats to get it opaque. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still love it. Just not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> China Glaze has some of the best glitter nail polishes. This one specifically is perfect because you can either put it on top of a color with just one coat for a light glitter look, or apply more coats for a heavier glitter look. Its not runny and it goes on easily!</li>
            <li> love china glaze have a ton of colors but this is ugly. don&#x27;t buy this color unless ya don&#x27;t care what it looks like on</li>
            <li> Purpley blueish color and I love purple and blue nail colors most so it worked. It has a rough exterior and I loved that even more! Very shimmery &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> good polish but was expecting a more silvery color and this is more purplish blue</li>
            <li> Great color! Also looks good layered!</li>
            <li> It has a sandy, sparkly texture. It was exactly the color I wanted, i applied it and dried fast in 3 mn.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is very thin so three coats does the job. Very good to apply over another coat of nail polish gives glitter with a slight purple tint. Ill be using this bottle quite frequently.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colors. love this polish</li>
            <li> love this color! It&#x27;s the perfect color, it&#x27;s in between blue and purple with beautiful sliver sparkles. There&#x27;s lots of sparkles which personally I love! this is a must have. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s purple! I was expecting a dark blue from both the images and the actual swatches I saw of the color. All well, it&#x27;s still pretty and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I love sparkle nail polish. and this is perfect! If you are using just this color it takes about 2 coats but is awesome looking!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this color!&lt;br /&gt;The blue is amazingly beautiful, and I adore the fact that the glitter is already in the polish! I  know that when you use polish and then glitter on top, the color is difficult to remove.  My nail gal told me this polish would be the same, because of the glitter. SO NOT TRUE! The color came off my toes beautifully. But, even if it had NOT, I would still wear this polish, because it is GORGEOUS! I also bought the Tree-Mendous Green, with the glitter in it. Just finished my toes...I love that one two but this BLUE is my new FAVORITE! :)</li>
            <li> Took a chance on this one, but thought it might match a dress I picked out for my brother&#x27;s wedding.  Depending upon the number of coats applied, it&#x27;s a translucent smoky blue to a dark and sparkly smoky blue.  Either way, it was perfect.  Came just in time, too :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve had it for a long time and the usual &amp;#34;separation&amp;#34; problem with old polishes didn&#x27;t happen. Glitters are fine and looks really cool even in the bottle!</li>
            <li> Awesome polish, dries so FAST!</li>
            <li> This color is gorgeous! Very sparkly but still sophisticated enough for an adult to wear to work. You can get by with one coat, though 2 is better. And it stays on longer than the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the picture!!</li>
            <li> Love the shimmery dimensional look it gives. I highly recommend using a black or dark purple creme base and then putting two coats of this over it. It&#x27;s tough to build this color to be fully opaque.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about what a beautiful blue it was and I am just a bit confused... THIS IS NOT BLUE.  NOT AT ALL.  IT IS PURPLE.  It is a gorgeous purple and if that is what you want, that is what you got.  If you wanted blue.... too bad for you....</li>
