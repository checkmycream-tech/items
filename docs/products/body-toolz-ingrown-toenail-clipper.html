            <li>The product is a good sturdy product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>A recommended sharpening service would be good.</li>
            <li>The product seemed good quality for the price but won&#x27;t cut my nails at all.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a good quality toenail clipper.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>they are a good quality.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought a pair of these about 2 years ago and they were excellent.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived, it looked great and nicely packed in its own case.</li>
            <li>Ok I lied it was intentional, lol.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this extremely handy pair of toenail</li>
            <li>i got it out with the help of this amazing tool.</li>
            <li>Loved them, they work fabulously!</li>
            <li>These are really nice quality.</li>
            <li>Both are made of quality stainless and manufactured excellently.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great price!</li>
            <li>Finding these straight-edged nippers again was a great find, and have already relieved some significant pain a couple of times.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GREAT CLIPPER!</li>
            <li>I have large hands and the dainty women&#x27;s size tools just don&#x27;t cut it, no pun intended.</li>
            <li>It fits my hand nicely, which gives you more control.</li>
            <li>Well, I now have to tool and am happy to say that it worked exactly as I indicated.</li>
            <li>The price was right and it looks great and feels strong.  </li>
            <li>Like you could cut way more than toe nails with it (though I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it).  </li>
            <li>They shatter the nail, more than trim.  </li>
            <li>It requires more force to use than I thought it would, but maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it correctly.  </li>
            <li>The springs hold the jaws open all the time, which is not the best for storing it.</li>
            <li>If they were more durable, I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love this tool.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>The ToiletTree brand is more curvy, whereas the Body Toolz is more pointy.</li>
            <li>Could be sharpened with an appropriate tool.</li>
            <li>In fact, when I clipped the nail, I practically had to rip the nail off by gripping it with the clipper.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this clipper as I&#x27;d be better off clipping my nails with a scissors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase And recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>They hold their edge and ease of use for many years.</li>
            <li>Even most curved toenail can be cut with this.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>is I cannot find a way to storage it safely in my inventory</li>
            <li>I am so glad I discovered this toenail clipper.  </li>
            <li>better quality and price for comp.</li>
            <li>glad I got these</li>
            <li>I think a pair of wire cutters would work better.</li>
            <li>When I was done the tips of the tool were bent more than when they arrived.</li>
            <li>Sure wish I knew what the pro&#x27;s buy.</li>
            <li>my kids love to call his nails eagle tallens.  </li>
            <li>I can walk with ease thanks to this great tool.</li>
            <li>More often than not they go places</li>
            <li>but they crush the nail more than cut them.  </li>
            <li>My husband finds the tool super handy &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is so much better than the cheap version you can get at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>Good quality stainless steel products.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be a good quality stainless</li>
            <li>Precision tool, good qua;ity and clips very well and easily</li>
            <li>With that in mind I would say that its easy to clip your toe nail.</li>
            <li>They have slim jaws and easily get under the nail to be trimmed.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to clip my ingrown toe nail without any hurt</li>
            <li>Easy to use and grip</li>
            <li>It cuts through my granite toenails easily, without splitting them.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Worked fine.</li>
            <li>Not as impressed as I thought I would be for an item with a four star approval rating (quality of workmanship seems a little inferior).  </li>
            <li>A great product that does what regular nail clippers won&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S A GREAT TOOL ESPECIALLY FOR INGROWN NAIL PROBLEMS.  </li>
            <li>they would be chrome, but they appear to be cheap pot metal.  </li>
            <li>but i can tell you that it really is a precise instrument, and that it has worked well for me.</li>
            <li>clippers available localy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>unless it would turn out to be one of those good ideas that don&#x27;t work in the real world, it was worth the try, I thought.</li>
            <li>i love clipper,it is rare, this one is to big for my purpose, but still is good for ingrown toenail as the product say.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Useful, far superior to the $5 junky ones in Rite Aid...</li>
            <li>However, when trying to trim my toenails, the clipper would not make a clean cut.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product for the money.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and were packaged well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometime precision tools wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>Makes a quick job of what they are designed for.</li>
            <li>Quick service</li>
            <li>Very sharp and works great.</li>
            <li>You can really cut to the edge with this tool, I should have owned one years ago, Now I won&#x27;t want to live with out one of these, anyone who does their own toes should buy one of these.</li>
            <li>Great little nail clipper.</li>
            <li>I am a manicurist and this a must have for all professional nail techs I bought 3 of them !!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s precise and you can really get it in to the sides of your toenails.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Perhaps other brands are as good as this brand, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>&quot; She was right.</li>
            <li>And the cutter would be right there at the tip where the clipper had reached the furthest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A tool at this price should do everything right.</li>
            <li>Product works great for it purpose, and extremely sharp!!&lt;br /&gt;PS don&#x27;t dump the product out of its case onto you hand!!!</li>
            <li>Did a great job trimming the nails on the feet , especially on a older person with thick nails.</li>
            <li>Works just as stated, really a great value, and definitely not cheap construction!</li>
            <li>find that these clippers with the significantly smaller head when compared to a standard pair of toenail clippers are just much more handy to use.</li>
            <li>Good quality steel, and very sharp.  </li>
            <li>I have only used them once, but they are pretty good as far as nail clippers go.  </li>
            <li>They are very sharp (which is good) but be careful as it is very easy to cut yourself when trimming.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as Advertised.</li>
            <li>&amp; I was able to receive it the next day</li>
            <li>She told me, \\&quot;you men don&#x27;t understand that you need more that one universal nail clipper to do the job of nail clipping.\\</li>
            <li>My sample does not have a smooth spring action.</li>
            <li>The quality on this clipper is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>I actually caused more damage to my toe/nail area when I used this.</li>
            <li>I poked my hand many times when trying to cut my big toe nail and cut the skin around the nail.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for for my decade-old ingrown toenail problem.</li>
            <li>I threw it away and bought a strong one at one of the stores of a major drugstore chain.</li>
            <li>They tore the nail slightly, but the design was great with slim long tips and large handles making them easy to handle.</li>
            <li>these are the best we have ever bought... but be careful they are VERY sharp.. just what we needed....</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>Not as sharp as I would&#x27;ve liked it.</li>
            <li>Well, this tool seemed had a much narrower tip than my regular toenail clippers, so it could sink into the flesh deeper with more ease.</li>
            <li>Excellent tool with straight and sharp blades with angled tips to reach in those tight corners.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality isn&#x27;t German, by any means, it fact it looks like Indian or Pakistan, but it is high quality grinding for the most part, and it works well.</li>
            <li>These certainly do the job.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s certain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit tricky to use because it must be held at a certain angle; otherwise, the customer will think that it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend to friends.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without!!</li>
            <li>, this small thing fits into a cable guy&#x27;s toolbox better, I hope it can come with some kind of protector if possible.</li>
            <li>Regular toenail clippers would not work on all my toenails, so I purchased these and they seem to work fine.</li>
            <li>When dealing with a super sharp tip you want to be able to focus on exact position as well as use left or right hand.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Anazing quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>The shape and style of the blades on these clippers makes it so much easier to work with ingrown nails, and cuts down&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>Since pedicure health is extremely important (otherwise you could get an infection that, if it goes out of control, could result in an amputation of a toe or entire foot), you don&#x27;t want to neglect these issues.    </li>
            <li>Works like it&#x27;s supposed to, there really isn&#x27;t much to say about it.</li>
            <li>bought these because my toenails have become too curled to fit into regular nail nippers</li>
            <li>And I wanted the straight edge as opposed to the curved cutters like the Seki.</li>
            <li>I bought it to cut my toenail straight across</li>
            <li>Very durable and well built in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I got a similar one made by SBX Solutions which worked great, but of course it was more expensive.</li>
            <li>I purchased a set of curved cutters that work very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very helpful in relieving the pain in my toe.</li>
            <li>Then I clip and shape the nail with the clipper without too much pain.</li>
            <li>I probably should have returned them, but that&#x27;s more trouble than they&#x27;re worth.  </li>
            <li>The built quality is good, they are solid metal with sharp edges on the cutter.</li>
            <li>the super bargain price of slightly less than $8.00 with free shipping as an Amazon.com Prime add-on item</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re machined stainless steel and have some weight to them like any decent tool should.</li>
            <li>This toenail clipper works perfectly, and it very sharp which helps to cut the ingrown nails that are hard to reach otherwise.</li>
            <li>I do agree that this tool really works for an ingrown nail, it is very strong and the blades are long enough to get into the curve of the toe and cut the nail.  </li>
            <li>These clippers work better than more expensive ones I have owned.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and simple, easy-to-open packaging.</li>
            <li>Would have been even better if the sharp tips had some kind of safety cover or ball tip to prevent injury when sliding it down a severely ingrown toenail deep into the side.  </li>
            <li>The purpose of buying both tools, by the way (other than getting free shipping of $35) was to make sure if one didn&#x27;t work, the other would.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s struggling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if you suffer from ingrown toenails as I do.</li>
            <li>They are nice and sharp and are shaped in such a fashion that i no longer stab myself trying to cut out in grown nails.</li>
            <li>i need a little  more muscle to cut it.</li>
            <li>There are gaps in the blades when closed and held to the light.  </li>
            <li>I read complaints you can see the light of day through the blades when closed.</li>
            <li>Quality item, worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this clipper is the only clipper that is both easy and actually works on his toes!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the smaller, pointy head with sharp, slender blades on this 4.5 inch all stainless steel nipper are just what the doctor ordered to painlessly and without injury cut beneath undercurled toenails which are on their way to becoming ingrown and a major problem, I have found that this set of clippers has become my overall favorite such tool to use on most if not all of the nails - especially any fungal nails - on my upper and lower</li>
            <li>With the new toenail clippers there was no pain.</li>
            <li>:New Update::</li>
            <li>Although it works and is as described I do not think I received a new product.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still very useful and contoured well enough to take care of any potential ingrown nails.</li>
            <li>Very long, straight nippers that remove exactly what you need.</li>
            <li>The new version is slightly longer than the older one (not a bad thing), however the tool is blunt.</li>
            <li>useing this clipper with a lifter works really well also works great for thick big toe nails andd other problems</li>
            <li>This clipper is large enough to get leverage and cut vertically.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp also</li>
            <li>Finally I found a sharp strong clippers</li>
            <li>the tips taper to a thin, fine point and let u get right under the problem area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the fault of the product, it&#x27;s just that if you want to clear it all out you will have to shove these things under the toenail.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like using old pliers.  </li>
            <li>you know how sensitive that skin is under there.</li>
            <li>This tool is a must if you want a professional clipper to do your nails.</li>
            <li>When held properly, it works very well.</li>
            <li>This clipper is pretty much identical &amp; works just as well, but cost less</li>
            <li>These are nice and sharp, only problem is I can&#x27;t lock them close, so just have to be careful when handling them.</li>
            <li>If you close them tightly, you can barely see any light.</li>
            <li>Very effective for getting under, lifting up and cutting the offending nail.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>looks good on the picture but don&#x27;t buy it because it is very poor quality</li>
            <li>Other than that it is useful</li>
            <li>I suppose my admiration is mainly towards the tool itself and not necessarily its brand.</li>
            <li>Nearly Twenty dollars not wisely spent.</li>
            <li>Upgraded to 4 stars b/c binding action has worn in after some use and I actually like a hinge action with no slop!</li>
            <li>I have 41 year old cuticle nippers made in Germany that are just as sharp today as they were when I first got them.</li>
            <li>The needle nose design allows you to clip right up the outside of the big toe nail, which you cannot do with regular toenail clippers.</li>
            <li>For years I have had problems with ingrown toenails and this tool is very good at clipping the problem toenail before it gets bad enough to need doctor&#x27;s assistance.</li>
            <li>Gets in deep and has a super sharp tip.</li>
            <li>It meant it could do what I had been doing with great pain with my regular clippers,, and that was pushing my clippers against the flesh on my toes beneath the nails, then grabbing the nail inside the flesh, then cutting it.</li>
            <li>But I was not able to get all the nail cleanly, or even completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Somewhat hard for me to grip (too smooth).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like after you squeeze hard enough on the handles the nail is pinched between the blades and finally separates to become a mini missile.</li>
            <li>Be careful, the tool is really sharrrrrrrp.</li>
            <li>used only a couple of times so far and tool works well..</li>
            <li>Digs deep and makes concise cuts.</li>
            <li>The product is not heavy duty enough to do the job for me.  </li>
            <li>There are at least as good as the Revelon if not better.</li>
            <li>The tool, I had noticed in the picture, that had very pointed sharp ends.</li>
            <li>The other looks really well made in the packaging</li>
            <li>Hinge action binds significantly near the closed position on the unit we received.  </li>
            <li>Even dropped it several times and it landed point down first and it dented the wood flooring, metal didn&#x27;t deform</li>
            <li>Well made but not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>Mine are probably bad enough that I need a professional but these will work more than fine for your average ingrown toenail off.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a bit expensive, but for what it does in clipping ingrown toe nails and just hard to cut nails, we love it!</li>
            <li>The nose is very sharp and easy to wedge into those really hard to reach spots near the root of your nail.</li>
            <li>It is very sharp and works very well.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to use than my previous tools.</li>
            <li>It really gets down under the nail and gets my ingrown nail out!  </li>

            <li> Arrived promptly and a good price.</li>

            <li> these fit that perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The product is a good sturdy product.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> A recommended sharpening service would be good.</li>
            <li> The product seemed good quality for the price but won&#x27;t cut my nails at all.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good quality toenail clipper.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> they are a good quality.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought a pair of these about 2 years ago and they were excellent.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived, it looked great and nicely packed in its own case.</li>
            <li> Ok I lied it was intentional, lol.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this extremely handy pair of toenail</li>
            <li> i got it out with the help of this amazing tool.</li>
            <li> Loved them, they work fabulously!</li>
            <li> These are really nice quality.</li>
            <li> Both are made of quality stainless and manufactured excellently.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great price!</li>
            <li> Finding these straight-edged nippers again was a great find, and have already relieved some significant pain a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GREAT CLIPPER!</li>
            <li> I have large hands and the dainty women&#x27;s size tools just don&#x27;t cut it, no pun intended.</li>
            <li> It fits my hand nicely, which gives you more control.</li>
            <li> Well, I now have to tool and am happy to say that it worked exactly as I indicated.</li>
            <li> The price was right and it looks great and feels strong.  </li>
            <li> Like you could cut way more than toe nails with it (though I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it).  </li>
            <li> They shatter the nail, more than trim.  </li>
            <li> It requires more force to use than I thought it would, but maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it correctly.  </li>
            <li> The springs hold the jaws open all the time, which is not the best for storing it.</li>
            <li> If they were more durable, I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love this tool.</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> The ToiletTree brand is more curvy, whereas the Body Toolz is more pointy.</li>
            <li> Could be sharpened with an appropriate tool.</li>
            <li> In fact, when I clipped the nail, I practically had to rip the nail off by gripping it with the clipper.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this clipper as I&#x27;d be better off clipping my nails with a scissors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase And recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> They hold their edge and ease of use for many years.</li>
            <li> Even most curved toenail can be cut with this.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> is I cannot find a way to storage it safely in my inventory</li>
            <li> I am so glad I discovered this toenail clipper.  </li>
            <li> better quality and price for comp.</li>
            <li> glad I got these</li>
            <li> I think a pair of wire cutters would work better.</li>
            <li> When I was done the tips of the tool were bent more than when they arrived.</li>
            <li> Sure wish I knew what the pro&#x27;s buy.</li>
            <li> my kids love to call his nails eagle tallens.  </li>
            <li> I can walk with ease thanks to this great tool.</li>
            <li> More often than not they go places</li>
            <li> but they crush the nail more than cut them.  </li>
            <li> My husband finds the tool super handy &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This is so much better than the cheap version you can get at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> Good quality stainless steel products.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a good quality stainless</li>
            <li> Precision tool, good qua;ity and clips very well and easily</li>
            <li> With that in mind I would say that its easy to clip your toe nail.</li>
            <li> They have slim jaws and easily get under the nail to be trimmed.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to clip my ingrown toe nail without any hurt</li>
            <li> Easy to use and grip</li>
            <li> It cuts through my granite toenails easily, without splitting them.</li>
            <li> Easy to grip, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Worked fine.</li>
            <li> Not as impressed as I thought I would be for an item with a four star approval rating (quality of workmanship seems a little inferior).  </li>
            <li> A great product that does what regular nail clippers won&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A GREAT TOOL ESPECIALLY FOR INGROWN NAIL PROBLEMS.  </li>
            <li> they would be chrome, but they appear to be cheap pot metal.  </li>
            <li> but i can tell you that it really is a precise instrument, and that it has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> clippers available localy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> unless it would turn out to be one of those good ideas that don&#x27;t work in the real world, it was worth the try, I thought.</li>
            <li> i love clipper,it is rare, this one is to big for my purpose, but still is good for ingrown toenail as the product say.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Useful, far superior to the $5 junky ones in Rite Aid...</li>
            <li> However, when trying to trim my toenails, the clipper would not make a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product for the money.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and were packaged well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometime precision tools wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> Makes a quick job of what they are designed for.</li>
            <li> Quick service</li>
            <li> Very sharp and works great.</li>
            <li> You can really cut to the edge with this tool, I should have owned one years ago, Now I won&#x27;t want to live with out one of these, anyone who does their own toes should buy one of these.</li>
            <li> Great little nail clipper.</li>
            <li> I am a manicurist and this a must have for all professional nail techs I bought 3 of them !!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s precise and you can really get it in to the sides of your toenails.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Perhaps other brands are as good as this brand, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> &quot; She was right.</li>
            <li> And the cutter would be right there at the tip where the clipper had reached the furthest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A tool at this price should do everything right.</li>
            <li> Product works great for it purpose, and extremely sharp!!&lt;br /&gt;PS don&#x27;t dump the product out of its case onto you hand!!!</li>
            <li> Did a great job trimming the nails on the feet , especially on a older person with thick nails.</li>
            <li> Works just as stated, really a great value, and definitely not cheap construction!</li>
            <li> find that these clippers with the significantly smaller head when compared to a standard pair of toenail clippers are just much more handy to use.</li>
            <li> Good quality steel, and very sharp.  </li>
            <li> I have only used them once, but they are pretty good as far as nail clippers go.  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp (which is good) but be careful as it is very easy to cut yourself when trimming.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as Advertised.</li>
            <li> &amp; I was able to receive it the next day</li>
            <li> She told me, \\&quot;you men don&#x27;t understand that you need more that one universal nail clipper to do the job of nail clipping.\\</li>
            <li> My sample does not have a smooth spring action.</li>
            <li> The quality on this clipper is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> I actually caused more damage to my toe/nail area when I used this.</li>
            <li> I poked my hand many times when trying to cut my big toe nail and cut the skin around the nail.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for for my decade-old ingrown toenail problem.</li>
            <li> I threw it away and bought a strong one at one of the stores of a major drugstore chain.</li>
            <li> They tore the nail slightly, but the design was great with slim long tips and large handles making them easy to handle.</li>
            <li> these are the best we have ever bought... but be careful they are VERY sharp.. just what we needed....</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as I would&#x27;ve liked it.</li>
            <li> Well, this tool seemed had a much narrower tip than my regular toenail clippers, so it could sink into the flesh deeper with more ease.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool with straight and sharp blades with angled tips to reach in those tight corners.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality isn&#x27;t German, by any means, it fact it looks like Indian or Pakistan, but it is high quality grinding for the most part, and it works well.</li>
            <li> These certainly do the job.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s certain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit tricky to use because it must be held at a certain angle; otherwise, the customer will think that it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Would certainly recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without!!</li>
            <li> , this small thing fits into a cable guy&#x27;s toolbox better, I hope it can come with some kind of protector if possible.</li>
            <li> Regular toenail clippers would not work on all my toenails, so I purchased these and they seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> When dealing with a super sharp tip you want to be able to focus on exact position as well as use left or right hand.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Anazing quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> The shape and style of the blades on these clippers makes it so much easier to work with ingrown nails, and cuts down&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> Since pedicure health is extremely important (otherwise you could get an infection that, if it goes out of control, could result in an amputation of a toe or entire foot), you don&#x27;t want to neglect these issues.    </li>
            <li> Works like it&#x27;s supposed to, there really isn&#x27;t much to say about it.</li>
            <li> bought these because my toenails have become too curled to fit into regular nail nippers</li>
            <li> And I wanted the straight edge as opposed to the curved cutters like the Seki.</li>
            <li> I bought it to cut my toenail straight across</li>
            <li> Very durable and well built in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I got a similar one made by SBX Solutions which worked great, but of course it was more expensive.</li>
            <li> I purchased a set of curved cutters that work very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very helpful in relieving the pain in my toe.</li>
            <li> Then I clip and shape the nail with the clipper without too much pain.</li>
            <li> I probably should have returned them, but that&#x27;s more trouble than they&#x27;re worth.  </li>
            <li> The built quality is good, they are solid metal with sharp edges on the cutter.</li>
            <li> the super bargain price of slightly less than $8.00 with free shipping as an Amazon.com Prime add-on item</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re machined stainless steel and have some weight to them like any decent tool should.</li>
            <li> This toenail clipper works perfectly, and it very sharp which helps to cut the ingrown nails that are hard to reach otherwise.</li>
            <li> I do agree that this tool really works for an ingrown nail, it is very strong and the blades are long enough to get into the curve of the toe and cut the nail.  </li>
            <li> These clippers work better than more expensive ones I have owned.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and simple, easy-to-open packaging.</li>
            <li> Would have been even better if the sharp tips had some kind of safety cover or ball tip to prevent injury when sliding it down a severely ingrown toenail deep into the side.  </li>
            <li> The purpose of buying both tools, by the way (other than getting free shipping of $35) was to make sure if one didn&#x27;t work, the other would.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s struggling.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if you suffer from ingrown toenails as I do.</li>
            <li> They are nice and sharp and are shaped in such a fashion that i no longer stab myself trying to cut out in grown nails.</li>
            <li> i need a little  more muscle to cut it.</li>
            <li> There are gaps in the blades when closed and held to the light.  </li>
            <li> I read complaints you can see the light of day through the blades when closed.</li>
            <li> Quality item, worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this clipper is the only clipper that is both easy and actually works on his toes!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the smaller, pointy head with sharp, slender blades on this 4.5 inch all stainless steel nipper are just what the doctor ordered to painlessly and without injury cut beneath undercurled toenails which are on their way to becoming ingrown and a major problem, I have found that this set of clippers has become my overall favorite such tool to use on most if not all of the nails - especially any fungal nails - on my upper and lower</li>
            <li> With the new toenail clippers there was no pain.</li>
            <li> :New Update::</li>
            <li> Although it works and is as described I do not think I received a new product.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still very useful and contoured well enough to take care of any potential ingrown nails.</li>
            <li> Very long, straight nippers that remove exactly what you need.</li>
            <li> The new version is slightly longer than the older one (not a bad thing), however the tool is blunt.</li>
            <li> useing this clipper with a lifter works really well also works great for thick big toe nails andd other problems</li>
            <li> This clipper is large enough to get leverage and cut vertically.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp also</li>
            <li> Finally I found a sharp strong clippers</li>
            <li> the tips taper to a thin, fine point and let u get right under the problem area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the fault of the product, it&#x27;s just that if you want to clear it all out you will have to shove these things under the toenail.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like using old pliers.  </li>
            <li> you know how sensitive that skin is under there.</li>
            <li> This tool is a must if you want a professional clipper to do your nails.</li>
            <li> When held properly, it works very well.</li>
            <li> This clipper is pretty much identical &amp; works just as well, but cost less</li>
            <li> These are nice and sharp, only problem is I can&#x27;t lock them close, so just have to be careful when handling them.</li>
            <li> If you close them tightly, you can barely see any light.</li>
            <li> Very effective for getting under, lifting up and cutting the offending nail.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> looks good on the picture but don&#x27;t buy it because it is very poor quality</li>
            <li> Other than that it is useful</li>
            <li> I suppose my admiration is mainly towards the tool itself and not necessarily its brand.</li>
            <li> Nearly Twenty dollars not wisely spent.</li>
            <li> Upgraded to 4 stars b/c binding action has worn in after some use and I actually like a hinge action with no slop!</li>
            <li> I have 41 year old cuticle nippers made in Germany that are just as sharp today as they were when I first got them.</li>
            <li> The needle nose design allows you to clip right up the outside of the big toe nail, which you cannot do with regular toenail clippers.</li>
            <li> For years I have had problems with ingrown toenails and this tool is very good at clipping the problem toenail before it gets bad enough to need doctor&#x27;s assistance.</li>
            <li> Gets in deep and has a super sharp tip.</li>
            <li> It meant it could do what I had been doing with great pain with my regular clippers,, and that was pushing my clippers against the flesh on my toes beneath the nails, then grabbing the nail inside the flesh, then cutting it.</li>
            <li> But I was not able to get all the nail cleanly, or even completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Somewhat hard for me to grip (too smooth).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like after you squeeze hard enough on the handles the nail is pinched between the blades and finally separates to become a mini missile.</li>
            <li> Be careful, the tool is really sharrrrrrrp.</li>
            <li> used only a couple of times so far and tool works well..</li>
            <li> Digs deep and makes concise cuts.</li>
            <li> The product is not heavy duty enough to do the job for me.  </li>
            <li> There are at least as good as the Revelon if not better.</li>
            <li> The tool, I had noticed in the picture, that had very pointed sharp ends.</li>
            <li> The other looks really well made in the packaging</li>
            <li> Hinge action binds significantly near the closed position on the unit we received.  </li>
            <li> Even dropped it several times and it landed point down first and it dented the wood flooring, metal didn&#x27;t deform</li>
            <li> Well made but not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Mine are probably bad enough that I need a professional but these will work more than fine for your average ingrown toenail off.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a bit expensive, but for what it does in clipping ingrown toe nails and just hard to cut nails, we love it!</li>
            <li> The nose is very sharp and easy to wedge into those really hard to reach spots near the root of your nail.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and works very well.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to use than my previous tools.</li>
            <li> It really gets down under the nail and gets my ingrown nail out!  </li>
            <li> I have owned much more expensive clippers that were not nearly as pointed.</li>
            <li> I had a previous clipper that worked really well; it was slightly curved and not sharp and pointy on the end.</li>
            <li> A bit large for those with small hands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have toenails of steel (though they are pretty hard), but after a couple of uses, I noticed that the tips are bent and no longer meet.</li>
            <li> They open wide enough to get access to thicker nails.</li>
            <li> My Body Toolz is new, only I have used it 3 times in the past 4 months.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after total dissatisfaction with what I presently had, two other clippers.</li>
            <li> that a larger pair can&#x27;t and are simply a pleasure to use with their extremely sharp blades on both toenails and fingernails.</li>
            <li> Excellent for cutting ingrown toenails or cutting back toenails during fungus treatment.</li>
            <li> Have not had long so can not speak as to long term.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to its long term durability</li>
            <li> No potting metal here...should keep an edge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> If only it had a locking mechanism to keep it locked in the closed position...</li>
            <li> Waited too long to try and couldn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> Was a little awkward to handle at first because I was not sure how to angle it, but I got the hang of it and all worked out ok.</li>
            <li> lo-and-behold a couple months after my visit I had another ingrown toenail on the OTHER side of that same toe.</li>
            <li> The edge of the spring is sharp and can cut your hand, it has to be pushed back into place after a couple of cuts.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would equal what the podiatrst has at my other home.</li>
            <li> Only sharp thing about this is the point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering buying a second for just having around the house for other tasks.  </li>
            <li> Not as sharp to cut my big toe nail.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be a very minor improvement.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a great tool for his poor unfortunate feet!</li>
            <li> I could only trim half of it with a pair of conventional toenail clippers (the ones that pinch together similar to fingernail clippers).</li>
            <li> my podiatrist uses these same ones and he gets DOWN into the edge of the ingrown toenail to cut it out.</li>
            <li> but  I seriously doubt that this particular tool is &amp;#34;used by Podiatrist and Pedicurists&amp;#34; as the description states.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and aligned well, and the metal has stood up to repeated use for as long as I&#x27;ve owned it.</li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s a little bit bigger than i wanted.  </li>
            <li> The clipper is just a little bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> great tool for cutting difficult toenails..</li>
            <li> I can bear to wear closed in shoes now.</li>
            <li> The left side of my big toe toenail is 1/4-inch (0.25) thick (and I kid you not).</li>
            <li> I left the ToiletTree Toenail Nipper in the packaging for now, and decided to start with the Body Toolz toenail nipper for ingrown nails (since this thick toenail was starting to turn threateningly toward my skin, and might have grown inward).</li>
            <li> This is not fun because the doctor actually slices open your already infected toe and starts clipping away, so walking is pretty painful for about a week afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I have never been more disappointed in a product I ordered from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also sharp and maintain their edge over time.</li>
            <li> They are not as sharp as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> They are sharp &amp; enable me to cut off ingrown nails before they began causing me pain.  </li>
            <li> The points of the clipper are too sharp in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Other than that the item is quite well made.</li>
            <li> and like I said they are sharp</li>
            <li> Did not come with instructions but it is sharp and does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have tossed out my any other toe nail clipper.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them to someone with thick toenails like myself who is fed up with the store bought clippers that barely work.</li>
            <li> You need to be very careful because of their pointed end</li>
            <li> so one must be very very careful.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and built well, I wish they had a clasp to keep them closed.</li>
            <li> Very sharp as well so be careful.</li>
            <li> Be careful, they are very sharp, but that is what you need sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Spend way too much for a simple cutting tool.  </li>
            <li> This toenail clipper is way to weak to cut adult, withered toenails.</li>
            <li> Their sharp point allows you to get to tight spots and clip the nail out among other virtues.</li>
            <li> I hardly at all use a standard pair of toenail clippers anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> The spring is too firm and keeps slipping out after each cut.</li>
            <li> The cutting power is just not as good as Green Bell clippers from Japan, so they are useless for me.</li>
            <li> Now upon inspection on Christmas, the 2 screws which attach the spring to the handles, slightly protrude, creating a sharp edge on both sides of the handles, also the ends of the handles are unevenly shaped and sharp.</li>
            <li> I filed them down to rounded points.</li>
            <li> relief without having to dig for that sharp little shard of nail that hurts like the dickens.</li>
            <li> INGROWN TOENAIL CLIPPER IS WELL MADE &amp; VERY SHARP.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Its everything advertised but I have to say that its very sharp point keeps me from clipping close to skin.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp</li>
            <li> Also the pointed ends of the clipper blades are very sharply pointed.</li>
            <li> This toenail clipper would not cut a piece of paper much less an ingrown toenail.  </li>
            <li> So the cutting edge is only near the tip.</li>
            <li> Needs to be slightly rounded in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheap piece of plastic :(</li>
            <li> Would suggest adding rubber to the grip and a little to the length of them.</li>
            <li> It would not cut my big toenails, which aren&#x27;t very thick at all.</li>
            <li> They got so bad I actually had to go to the doctor&#x27;s and have it removed professionally after a night of agony.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy construction - the flexors broke almost immediately and the blades are awkwardly beveled.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty toenail clippers.</li>
            <li> it seems to blunt and makes messy cuts.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have ingrown toe nails, but I was looking for a straight-edged, heavy duty clipper to cut my toe nails straighter (to prevent ingrown toe nails), and</li>
            <li> After changing nail clippers a few times to no avail I decided to ask someone who was well versed in the art of pedicure.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much larger my only complaint is that the parts in the center that you can adjust for when your cutting don&#x27;t move they are on a stud meant to swivel</li>
            <li> I did NOT want to go the hospital again an limp around for a week, so I looked for something I could fix it with myself.</li>
            <li> This was totally a waste of money.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a cheap alloy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on it.</li>
            <li> In order to properly cut and maintain them I must basely remove the whole nail.  </li>
            <li> Ours were a little bit stiff.</li>
            <li> It is a little stiff to manipulate</li>
            <li> The handles are long giving you ample leverage to cut those tough nails.  </li>
            <li> It took only a few seconds to do what used to take several painful minutes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little hard to cut -</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem is</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that the tip of the clippers are sharp so when you try to dig in a little it can be quite painful.</li>
            <li> The sharp and very thin tips were already slightly bent on arrival, and machined joints are third-world</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re tough even down to the precision point at the end.  </li>
            <li> It works well, hurts less and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a deformed, ugly looking toenail like the medical procedure will.</li>
            <li> but they are dull and don&#x27;t cut well.  </li>
            <li> hard to work on your nails yourself</li>
            <li> The tool is absolutely dull.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s dull as a rock.</li>
            <li> sturdy made and gets the job done well with thick, hard toe-nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived dirty and scratched up obviously used ...</li>
            <li> I have ingrowns and this level cutting is the only thing that works for me.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have thick nails.    </li>
            <li> will cut thick toe nails without any problem.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to receiving this clipper as my toe nails are so thick.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on the couple of thick nails I have.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when I got this product, it feels very heavy and tough.  </li>
            <li> it is very very heavy duty!  </li>
            <li> After several failed attempts, I realized what I had done wrong.  </li>
            <li> Previous toenail clippers that cut horizontally were unable to get alongside my toenails to cut out the ingrown part.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In use on toenails, the angle of the cutting edge is so steep that there isn&#x27;t really a cutting action.</li>
            <li> Also, there is a gap at the very tip making it useless to clip things at their base.</li>
            <li> Watch your eye when cutting your toe nails, these babies are sharp!</li>
            <li> Poor leverage or blade type.</li>
            <li> Forget nails - it can&#x27;t cut paper or the thin plastic pouch it arrived in.</li>
            <li> These little bad boys do the trick.  </li>
            <li> thing I find a little annoying</li>
            <li> It was difficult to get to the corner of the toe nail with clippers bought from the Department stores.</li>
            <li> This product is useless.</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought them.  </li>
            <li> Having battled ingrown toenails for so long, and even though I had the worst two taken care of by a podiatrist, I still have a couple of toenail problems and now an ingrown thumbnail - go figure.</li>
            <li> making my life a lot less painful!!</li>
            <li> The longer pointed ends make it easier to get the edges of the toenail without cutting the skin.</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s a gap between cutting blades</li>
            <li> When cutting toenails it was a painful ordeal.</li>
            <li> My poor husband suffers from terrible ingrown toenails.  </li>
            <li> It looks like the factory has either lost the craftsmen/women who know how to hone blades/edges or their quality control is bad.  </li>
            <li> Had a really bad en-grown toenail and even though it was painful</li>
            <li> My husband has terrible toe nails that are impossible to clip.  </li>
            <li> Now I can keep it trimmed instead of going to the doctor after it gets bad once a year!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have terrible toes that plague me with ingrown nails every couple months.</li>
            <li> to get rid of that digging-in-to-your-toe pain that makes every step miserable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great. Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> Works just as stated, really a great value, and definitely not cheap construction!</li>
            <li> The clipper does the job and seems to be well made would buy another one.Have not had long so can not speak as to long term.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and built well, I wish they had a clasp to keep them closed. Best clippers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> i love clipper,it is rare, this one is to big for my purpose, but still is good for ingrown toenail as the product say.</li>
            <li> I have only used them once, but they are pretty good as far as nail clippers go.  I would recommend them to someone with thick toenails like myself who is fed up with the store bought clippers that barely work.</li>
            <li> This is the toenail that I was needing.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I have never been more disappointed in a product I ordered from Amazon.  This toenail clipper would not cut a piece of paper much less an ingrown toenail.  I sent them back immediately after opening them and giving them a try.  Unless I got a defective pair, which is possible, I cannot explain this product or imagine how anyone could use it. Amazon was great in accommodating the return.</li>
            <li> A great product that does what regular nail clippers won&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> This works wonders on my ingrown toenails on my big toes. Now I can keep it trimmed instead of going to the doctor after it gets bad once a year!</li>
            <li> THE BODY TOOLZ INGROWN TOENAIL CLIPPER IS WELL MADE &amp; VERY SHARP. IT&#x27;S A GREAT TOOL ESPECIALLY FOR INGROWN NAIL PROBLEMS.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GREAT CLIPPER!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Good quality stainless steel products.  Toolz worked as advertised and as anticipated. Arrived promptly and a good price.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty toenail clippers. These certainly do the job. They open wide enough to get access to thicker nails. Good grip. Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Product works great for it purpose, and extremely sharp!!&lt;br /&gt;PS don&#x27;t dump the product out of its case onto you hand!!!</li>
            <li> Hinge action binds significantly near the closed position on the unit we received.  Not as impressed as I thought I would be for an item with a four star approval rating (quality of workmanship seems a little inferior).  Update:  Upgraded to 4 stars b/c binding action has worn in after some use and I actually like a hinge action with no slop!</li>
            <li> I have two &amp;#34;pinky&amp;#34; toes that have nails which grow up instead of out. In order to properly cut and maintain them I must basely remove the whole nail.  These Clipper&#x27;s allow me to do just that</li>
            <li> Great clipper at a great price</li>
            <li> i bought this after having a finger injury to keep the nail groomed.  it seems to blunt and makes messy cuts.  I try to use traditional clippers when I can.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when I got this product, it feels very heavy and tough.  Like you could cut way more than toe nails with it (though I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it).  I don&#x27;t have ingrown toe nails, but I was looking for a straight-edged, heavy duty clipper to cut my toe nails straighter (to prevent ingrown toe nails), and these fit that perfectly.  They&#x27;re tough even down to the precision point at the end.  I expect these will last for years, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I suffer ingrown toenails and needed a tool like this to clip the sides of the nails.  They look like they should do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I used these twice now and can kick myself for not buying them years ago.  The needle nose design allows you to clip right up the outside of the big toe nail, which you cannot do with regular toenail clippers.</li>
            <li> I had ingrown nail for years. It was difficult to get to the corner of the toe nail with clippers bought from the Department stores. I saw this on Amazon and took a chance with it. It worked wonders. Now I no longer have aching toe problem.</li>
            <li> Finally I found a sharp strong clippers which and handle my fungus infected toenails.  Their sharp point allows you to get to tight spots and clip the nail out among other virtues.</li>
            <li> Loved them, they work fabulously! Definately worth the money. They are nice and sharp and are shaped in such a fashion that i no longer stab myself trying to cut out in grown nails.</li>
            <li> Its everything advertised but I have to say that its very sharp point keeps me from clipping close to skin.With that in mind I would say that its easy to clip your toe nail.Not a bad product for the money.</li>
            <li> Exactly as Advertised.</li>
            <li> Arrived dirty and scratched up obviously used ... Gross</li>
            <li> The product is a good sturdy product. The only issue I have is that the tip of the clippers are sharp so when you try to dig in a little it can be quite painful. Other than that it is useful</li>
            <li> For years I have had problems with ingrown toenails and this tool is very good at clipping the problem toenail before it gets bad enough to need doctor&#x27;s assistance. I have owned much more expensive clippers that were not nearly as pointed. You need to be very careful because of their pointed end but that is what is needed. Excellent tool for the price. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace a \\&quot;LaCross\\&quot; clipper that I had for over 15 years.  The looked to be the same online......but not even close.    There are gaps in the blades when closed and held to the light.  When you clip with them it&#x27;s like using old pliers.  They shatter the nail, more than trim.  And I don&#x27;t have thick nails.    I probably should have returned them, but that&#x27;s more trouble than they&#x27;re worth.  I *assumed* they would be chrome, but they appear to be cheap pot metal.  Buyer beware....</li>
            <li> My poor husband suffers from terrible ingrown toenails.  I bought him a similar product from Sephora about a year ago, but when he accidentally dropped it, one of the tips bent, &amp; it was time to replace it.  This clipper is pretty much identical &amp; works just as well, but cost less &amp; I was able to receive it the next day (thank goodness for my Amazon Prime Membership!)  My husband finds the tool super handy &amp; easy to use.  It is definitely a great tool for his poor unfortunate feet!</li>
            <li> great just what I wanted !!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s alot bigger than the pic shows, but it performs. my podiatrist uses these same ones and he gets DOWN into the edge of the ingrown toenail to cut it out. the tips taper to a thin, fine point and let u get right under the problem area. takes practice to use but once u figure it out, you&#x27;ll be all smiles cuz u won&#x27;t have ta pay anymore for an office visit just to have your toenails cut.</li>
            <li> When cutting toenails it was a painful ordeal. With the new toenail clippers there was no pain. Be careful, the tool is really sharrrrrrrp.</li>
            <li> This product works o.k.  It requires more force to use than I thought it would, but maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it correctly.  The springs hold the jaws open all the time, which is not the best for storing it.</li>
            <li> These are not made in Germany, as one reviewer claimed, but in Pakistan.  I do agree that this tool really works for an ingrown nail, it is very strong and the blades are long enough to get into the curve of the toe and cut the nail.  I actually no longer have an ingrown toenail, although I have had it for over 20 years.  I used this tool in combination with Kerasal Nail Fungus Treatment.  I still can&#x27;t believe that toe nail is now painless and gone!</li>
            <li> These are really nice quality. They&#x27;re machined stainless steel and have some weight to them like any decent tool should. They&#x27;re also sharp and maintain their edge over time. All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These clippers work better than more expensive ones I have owned. They arrived quickly and were packaged well. The longer pointed ends make it easier to get the edges of the toenail without cutting the skin.</li>
            <li> Joy to have purchased.  Anazing quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This does the job that I bought it for.  It is very sturdy.  I would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> The shape and style of the blades on these clippers makes it so much easier to work with ingrown nails, and cuts down&lt;br /&gt;on the pain that can be involved too.  Very effective for getting under, lifting up and cutting the offending nail.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For years I suffered from a couple of ingrown toenails. After changing nail clippers a few times to no avail I decided to ask someone who was well versed in the art of pedicure. She told me, \\&quot;you men don&#x27;t understand that you need more that one universal nail clipper to do the job of nail clipping.\\&quot; She was right. I used my toenail clipper to dig into the flesh and perform all kinds of carvings. But I was not able to get all the nail cleanly, or even completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Toolz Ingrown Toenail Clipper looked like a wire cutter. It did not seem be the answer for my need, but it was. The tool, I had noticed in the picture, that had very pointed sharp ends. It meant it could do what I had been doing with great pain with my regular clippers,, and that was pushing my clippers against the flesh on my toes beneath the nails, then grabbing the nail inside the flesh, then cutting it. Well, this tool seemed had a much narrower tip than my regular toenail clippers, so it could sink into the flesh deeper with more ease. And the cutter would be right there at the tip where the clipper had reached the furthest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I Thought I will take a chance on this tool. unless it would turn out to be one of those good ideas that don&#x27;t work in the real world, it was worth the try, I thought. Well, I now have to tool and am happy to say that it worked exactly as I indicated. It&#x27;s shape allows it to reach to the furthest part of the nail and it snaps the nail deep inside the flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometime precision tools wear out quickly. My Body Toolz is new, only I have used it 3 times in the past 4 months. I can&#x27;t speak to its long term durability but i can tell you that it really is a precise instrument, and that it has worked well for me. Perhaps other brands are as good as this brand, I don&#x27;t know. I suppose my admiration is mainly towards the tool itself and not necessarily its brand.</li>
            <li> these are the best for clipping my crusty curvy nasty toe nails.</li>
            <li> This tool worked great by painlessly removing ingrown toenails. It took only a few seconds to do what used to take several painful minutes.</li>
            <li> Not a standard size you would see in a drug store it&#x27;s much larger my only complaint is that the parts in the center that you can adjust for when your cutting don&#x27;t move they are on a stud meant to swivel but they don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> A tool at this price should do everything right. It&#x27;s not surgical grade that&#x27;s certain. My sample does not have a smooth spring action. When dealing with a super sharp tip you want to be able to focus on exact position as well as use left or right hand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have toenails of steel (though they are pretty hard), but after a couple of uses, I noticed that the tips are bent and no longer meet. They are very sharp (which is good) but be careful as it is very easy to cut yourself when trimming. If they were more durable, I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have terrible toes that plague me with ingrown nails every couple months. They got so bad I actually had to go to the doctor&#x27;s and have it removed professionally after a night of agony. This is not fun because the doctor actually slices open your already infected toe and starts clipping away, so walking is pretty painful for about a week afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well lo-and-behold a couple months after my visit I had another ingrown toenail on the OTHER side of that same toe. I did NOT want to go the hospital again an limp around for a week, so I looked for something I could fix it with myself. I found these clippers and bought them immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did. They work great, and do what is advertised. The nose is very sharp and easy to wedge into those really hard to reach spots near the root of your nail. The built quality is good, they are solid metal with sharp edges on the cutter. The only downside of them is, it will still hurt to remove an ingrown toenail. It&#x27;s not the fault of the product, it&#x27;s just that if you want to clear it all out you will have to shove these things under the toenail. If you&#x27;ve ever cut your fingernails too short you know how sensitive that skin is under there. For that reason keep everything sanitary and put a bandage on after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend these over a doctors visit. It works well, hurts less and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a deformed, ugly looking toenail like the medical procedure will.</li>
            <li> I have ingrowns on my toenails, and this product is a miracle worker!  I highly recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s struggling.</li>
            <li> This toenail clipper is way to weak to cut adult, withered toenails. I threw it away and bought a strong one at one of the stores of a major drugstore chain.</li>
            <li> Poor leverage or blade type. Requires a lot of effort to cut just fingernails.  Too short.  The spring is too firm and keeps slipping out after each cut. The edge of the spring is sharp and can cut your hand, it has to be pushed back into place after a couple of cuts.</li>
            <li> Great tool for what it does. Seems to be a good quality stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;The pouch... Cheap piece of plastic :(</li>
            <li> Bought this to deal with an ingrown big toe nail. They are not as sharp as I was hoping for. They tore the nail slightly, but the design was great with slim long tips and large handles making them easy to handle. I have large hands and the dainty women&#x27;s size tools just don&#x27;t cut it, no pun intended. Ok I lied it was intentional, lol. Anyway they got the job done. Sigh, what a relief.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this but is not the same product that is shown in the pic.</li>
            <li> Regular toenail clippers would not work on all my toenails, so I purchased these and they seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> The price was right and it looks great and feels strong.  But it wouldn&#x27;t cut the nails of my big toes.</li>
            <li> This product is useless. It simply CANNOT cut my toe nail. Maybe it CAN cut a piece of paper. This was totally a waste of money. Please, please, please read my review and do not but it!!!!</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers I have every owned.  They have slim jaws and easily get under the nail to be trimmed.  The handles are long giving you ample leverage to cut those tough nails.  This tool is a must if you want a professional clipper to do your nails.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to clip my ingrown toe nail without any hurt</li>
            <li> I use this for trimming my patient&#x27;s hardened and thickened toe nail with onychomycosis (fungus). Precision tool, good qua;ity and clips very well and easily</li>
            <li> Great quality.  They are sharp &amp; enable me to cut off ingrown nails before they began causing me pain.  Love this tool.</li>
            <li> Good quality steel, and very sharp.  No potting metal here...should keep an edge for a long time.  Useful, far superior to the $5 junky ones in Rite Aid...</li>
            <li> Watch your eye when cutting your toe nails, these babies are sharp! Your nails go flying xD.  They are heavy and look very durable. Ours were a little bit stiff.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Body Toolz Ingrown Toenail Clipper (along with a separate Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Toenail Nipper by ToiletTree Products).    This Body Toolz nipper works great. The left side of my big toe toenail is 1/4-inch (0.25) thick (and I kid you not). I could only trim half of it with a pair of conventional toenail clippers (the ones that pinch together similar to fingernail clippers). The left side was growing like a pyramid! Since pedicure health is extremely important (otherwise you could get an infection that, if it goes out of control, could result in an amputation of a toe or entire foot), you don&#x27;t want to neglect these issues.    I left the ToiletTree Toenail Nipper in the packaging for now, and decided to start with the Body Toolz toenail nipper for ingrown nails (since this thick toenail was starting to turn threateningly toward my skin, and might have grown inward). Glad I did. The purpose of buying both tools, by the way (other than getting free shipping of $35) was to make sure if one didn&#x27;t work, the other would. They are both shaped slightly differently. The ToiletTree brand is more curvy, whereas the Body Toolz is more pointy. I can see how different tools could serve different purposes depending on the nail in question.    This is not an exacting science, but I think both will work well! Both are made of quality stainless and manufactured excellently. I read complaints you can see the light of day through the blades when closed. If you close them tightly, you can barely see any light. I think people are nit picking (which is par for the course on Amazon and eBay).    I would recommend you to get both pairs, but I can only vouch for this one pair. The other looks really well made in the packaging but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. This Body Toolz toenail clipper works great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful!!! two thumbs up</li>
            <li> Good product. Excellent service.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy construction - the flexors broke almost immediately and the blades are awkwardly beveled.</li>
            <li> Well made but not sharp enough. Usable with great force. Could be sharpened with an appropriate tool. A recommended sharpening service would be good.</li>
            <li> I  thought these would be ideal but they are dull and don&#x27;t cut well.  Sorry I bought them.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The quality on this clipper is mediocre at best. When it arrived, it looked great and nicely packed in its own case. However, when trying to trim my toenails, the clipper would not make a clean cut. In fact, when I clipped the nail, I practically had to rip the nail off by gripping it with the clipper. I would not recommend this clipper as I&#x27;d be better off clipping my nails with a scissors.</li>
            <li> The problem may be me, but I couldn&#x27;t work with it.</li>
            <li> Clipper works well.  It is a little stiff to manipulate so I am hoping it will loosen up with time.</li>
            <li> Works like it&#x27;s supposed to, there really isn&#x27;t much to say about it. It&#x27;s made of metal, has springmetal to bring it back to an open state and cuts toenails...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit tricky to use because it must be held at a certain angle; otherwise, the customer will think that it doesn&#x27;t work.  After several failed attempts, I realized what I had done wrong.  When held properly, it works very well.</li>
            <li> Got this fr father&#x27;s day because it&#x27;s what he asked for. He loves them and they work great.</li>
            <li> The points of the clipper are too sharp in my opinion. I filed them down to rounded points. Also the blade edges do not meet toward the axis. So the cutting edge is only near the tip. Other than that the item is quite well made.</li>
            <li> These clippers do the job! Easy to use and grip and like I said they are sharp will cut thick toe nails without any problem.</li>
            <li> the size an shape are ideal,&lt;br /&gt;but, there&#x27;s a gap between cutting blades&lt;br /&gt;and they are not sharpened correctly.&lt;br /&gt;needs to be replaced</li>
            <li> I originally bought a pair of these about 2 years ago and they were excellent.  Wanting another pair to leave in my gym bag, I decided to buy another pair.  The new version is slightly longer than the older one (not a bad thing), however the tool is blunt. It looks like the factory has either lost the craftsmen/women who know how to hone blades/edges or their quality control is bad.  Anyway, I&#x27;d advise spending your money elsewhere unless you want a sharpening project!!</li>
            <li> It fits my hand nicely, which gives you more control. It cuts through my granite toenails easily, without splitting them. I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase And recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;From my experience, clippers, nippers, scissors made in Germany are The BEST! They hold their edge and ease of use for many years. I have 41 year old cuticle nippers made in Germany that are just as sharp today as they were when I first got them.</li>
            <li> Worked fine. Was a little awkward to handle at first because I was not sure how to angle it, but I got the hang of it and all worked out ok.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool with straight and sharp blades with angled tips to reach in those tight corners.  Excellent for cutting ingrown toenails or cutting back toenails during fungus treatment.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and works great.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after total dissatisfaction with what I presently had, two other clippers. I found this product to be a very minor improvement. I wanted something that would equal what the podiatrst has at my other home. Cost was not a factor. Here in Kingman,Az. I have no medicare approved podiatrist that could serve me for over two months. Over fifty miles to the next possibility.&lt;br /&gt;  I could have done as well at WalMart without shipping costs. Nearly Twenty dollars not wisely spent.</li>
            <li> hard to work on your nails yourself but this is a quality product and recommend it for anyone who is needing to cut thinker nails or ingrown.</li>
            <li> Worked well, if you know how to use it. Even most curved toenail can be cut with this.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I find a little annoying is I cannot find a way to storage it safely in my inventory, this small thing fits into a cable guy&#x27;s toolbox better, I hope it can come with some kind of protector if possible.</li>
            <li> Great product. The blades are sharp and aligned well, and the metal has stood up to repeated use for as long as I&#x27;ve owned it. Quick shipping and simple, easy-to-open packaging. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to receiving this clipper as my toe nails are so thick. The product seemed good quality for the price but won&#x27;t cut my nails at all.</li>
            <li> Very good clippers. Very sharp and easy to use. Definitely helped with my toenail trimming. Even dropped it several times and it landed point down first and it dented the wood flooring, metal didn&#x27;t deform so it&#x27;s not a cheap alloy.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good quality toenail clipper. A bit large for those with small hands. That is the only disadvantage I see in them.</li>
            <li> Does what it was designed to do.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I discovered this toenail clipper.  It really gets down under the nail and gets my ingrown nail out!  It is very sharp and works very well.  I highly recommend if you suffer from ingrown toenails as I do.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with ingrown toenails for years. This is the best toenail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. Finally...relief without having to dig for that sharp little shard of nail that hurts like the dickens. Am very happy with this product! Fast shipping and great price!</li>
            <li> great tool for cutting difficult toenails..better quality and price for comp. clippers available localy.  glad I got these,makes dealing with my nail issues manageable. used only a couple of times so far and tool works well..</li>
            <li> Previous toenail clippers that cut horizontally were unable to get alongside my toenails to cut out the ingrown part.  This clipper is large enough to get leverage and cut vertically.  Very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> The tool is absolutely dull. Forget nails - it can&#x27;t cut paper or the thin plastic pouch it arrived in. Resembles pliers. Don&#x27;t waste money on it.</li>
            <li> looks good on the picture but don&#x27;t buy it because it is very poor quality</li>
            <li> Well I thought I&#x27;d take a chance but these arrived with flimsy steel written all over them. The sharp and very thin tips were already slightly bent on arrival, and machined joints are third-world looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use on toenails, the angle of the cutting edge is so steep that there isn&#x27;t really a cutting action. It&#x27;s more like after you squeeze hard enough on the handles the nail is pinched between the blades and finally separates to become a mini missile. I think a pair of wire cutters would work better. When I was done the tips of the tool were bent more than when they arrived. And yes, I soak my nails before cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these because my toenails have become too curled to fit into regular nail nippers so I need something else. And I wanted the straight edge as opposed to the curved cutters like the Seki. I&#x27;ve never used this style of clipper before but  I seriously doubt that this particular tool is &amp;#34;used by Podiatrist and Pedicurists&amp;#34; as the description states. Sure wish I knew what the pro&#x27;s buy. Maybe I&#x27;ll try the wire cutters.</li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s a little bit bigger than i wanted.  I think I&#x27;ll buy a smaller one.  I bought it to cut my toenail straight across and it&#x27;s a little hard to cut - i need a little  more muscle to cut it.</li>
            <li> Looks like what my podiatrist used.  Much easier to use than my previous tools.</li>
            <li> I  had a pedicure and the manicurist used this type of clippers.  They are the best!! Everyone should have one of theses.</li>
            <li> Very good quality........works great!</li>
            <li> This is a one-trick pony but it does its trick.  Totally worth the price to get rid of that digging-in-to-your-toe pain that makes every step miserable.</li>
            <li> Had a really bad en-grown toenail and even though it was painful i got it out with the help of this amazing tool. Very durable and well built in my opinion. Very sharp as well so be careful.</li>
            <li> I used this tool once and don&#x27;t dare to use it again. I had a previous clipper that worked really well; it was slightly curved and not sharp and pointy on the end. I actually caused more damage to my toe/nail area when I used this. I poked my hand many times when trying to cut my big toe nail and cut the skin around the nail.</li>
            <li> Having battled ingrown toenails for so long, and even though I had the worst two taken care of by a podiatrist, I still have a couple of toenail problems and now an ingrown thumbnail - go figure. I had lost my pair of straight-edged nippers some years back and we&#x27;d bought a pair of shape-edged nippers, but they just didn&#x27;t set things up properly and never quite did the trick. Finding these straight-edged nippers again was a great find, and have already relieved some significant pain a couple of times. No replacement for a podiatrist, but a big help until you can see one!</li>
            <li> Yes.  It works.  It does the job it was meant to do. I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to use it.  ThanX!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s precise and you can really get it in to the sides of your toenails. Easy to grip, easy to use. Would have been even better if the sharp tips had some kind of safety cover or ball tip to prevent injury when sliding it down a severely ingrown toenail deep into the side.  Mine are probably bad enough that I need a professional but these will work more than fine for your average ingrown toenail off. Very sharp.</li>
            <li> This toenail clipper works perfectly, and it very sharp which helps to cut the ingrown nails that are hard to reach otherwise.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the cheap version you can get at the grocery store.  Quality item, worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> This may be o.k.( gift ) But a price reduction from $14.08 to $ 9.75 makes this company ( Body Toolz ) unacceptable to me. ::New Update:: Now upon inspection on Christmas, the 2 screws which attach the spring to the handles, slightly protrude, creating a sharp edge on both sides of the handles, also the ends of the handles are unevenly shaped and sharp. Not good. Returned.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product</li>
            <li> Did a great job trimming the nails on the feet , especially on a older person with thick nails.My husband said its a winner !</li>
            <li> Works great at removing ingrown toenails. Very long, straight nippers that remove exactly what you need. My go-to problem solver tool now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality isn&#x27;t German, by any means, it fact it looks like Indian or Pakistan, but it is high quality grinding for the most part, and it works well. I bought the Body Toolz tweezer set too, and I like those a lot.</li>
            <li> making my life a lot less painful!!</li>
            <li> It seems to work well once you figure out how to maneuver it around the nail. Did not come with instructions but it is sharp and does the trick.</li>
            <li> You can really cut to the edge with this tool, I should have owned one years ago, Now I won&#x27;t want to live with out one of these, anyone who does their own toes should buy one of these.</li>
            <li> The only clipper you will ever need.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Works wonders on the couple of thick nails I have. I only wished I had bought one years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> useing this clipper with a lifter works really well also works great for thick big toe nails andd other problems</li>
            <li> My husband has terrible toe nails that are impossible to clip.  my kids love to call his nails eagle tallens.  Anyway, this clipper is the only clipper that is both easy and actually works on his toes!!!  It is very sharp so one must be very very careful.  it is very very heavy duty!  At first I thought it was a bit expensive, but for what it does in clipping ingrown toe nails and just hard to cut nails, we love it!</li>
            <li> It is bigger than it appears in the picture.</li>
            <li> Only sharp thing about this is the point. Otherwise it&#x27;s dull as a rock. Also, there is a gap at the very tip making it useless to clip things at their base.</li>
            <li> If only it had a locking mechanism to keep it locked in the closed position...</li>
            <li> Up-Side:&lt;br /&gt;Very sturdy made and gets the job done well with thick, hard toe-nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down Side:&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat hard for me to grip (too smooth). Would suggest adding rubber to the grip and a little to the length of them. Also the pointed ends of the clipper blades are very sharply pointed. Needs to be slightly rounded in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend the Clipper.</li>
            <li> These little bad boys do the trick.  Be careful, they are very sharp, but that is what you need sometimes.  Easy to keep clean. Durable.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as I would&#x27;ve liked it. It&#x27;s still very useful and contoured well enough to take care of any potential ingrown nails.</li>
            <li> Gets in deep and has a super sharp tip. Great grip on the ingrown nail. The clipper is just a little bigger than I expected and that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome.  Great construction.  Very sturdy.  I&#x27;m considering buying a second for just having around the house for other tasks.  It helped my solve my ingrown toenail issue.  I can walk with ease thanks to this great tool.</li>
            <li> I have ingrowns and this level cutting is the only thing that works for me.  There are at least as good as the Revelon if not better.</li>
            <li> Although it works and is as described I do not think I received a new product. It had dirt and hairs stuck in it by the blades. Used some disinfecting wipes before using it.</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived in excellent condition thank you</li>
            <li> The cutting power is just not as good as Green Bell clippers from Japan, so they are useless for me.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for for my decade-old ingrown toenail problem. Digs deep and makes concise cuts.</li>
            <li> Great choice in removing in grown toe nails.  No problem in removing and feeling relief.  Would certainly recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Lost it&#x27;s sharpenss after a couple cuttings.</li>
            <li> Wished I had bought these sooner. Makes a quick job of what they are designed for. Super sharp also</li>
            <li> This is now the third item by Body Toolz that I have purchased and like the curette double-angle nail cleaner and the ingrown toenail file (see my reviews) I am very pleased with this extremely handy pair of toenail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the smaller, pointy head with sharp, slender blades on this 4.5 inch all stainless steel nipper are just what the doctor ordered to painlessly and without injury cut beneath undercurled toenails which are on their way to becoming ingrown and a major problem, I have found that this set of clippers has become my overall favorite such tool to use on most if not all of the nails - especially any fungal nails - on my upper and lower extremities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that these clippers with the significantly smaller head when compared to a standard pair of toenail clippers are just much more handy to use. More often than not they go places that a larger pair can&#x27;t and are simply a pleasure to use with their extremely sharp blades on both toenails and fingernails. I hardly at all use a standard pair of toenail clippers anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the super bargain price of slightly less than $8.00 with free shipping as an Amazon.com Prime add-on item, you really can&#x27;t go wrong by purchasing this high-quality item which is bound to provide you with many years of beneficial use.</li>
            <li> I am a manicurist and this a must have for all professional nail techs I bought 3 of them !!!!!</li>
            <li> These are nice and sharp, only problem is I can&#x27;t lock them close, so just have to be careful when handling them.</li>
            <li> Spend way too much for a simple cutting tool.  Not as sharp to cut my big toe nail.  Waited too long to try and couldn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> Within moments for receiving this pair of clippers I had relief!  It is the only way to go if you have ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> these are the best we have ever bought... but be careful they are VERY sharp.. just what we needed....</li>
            <li> Great little nail clipper.</li>
            <li> This is junk. It would not cut my big toenails, which aren&#x27;t very thick at all. I got a similar one made by SBX Solutions which worked great, but of course it was more expensive.</li>
            <li> This seems to be made well and sturdy. It was purchased for my mom, and she wanted something different, so it&#x27;s in the process of being returned.</li>
            <li> These do no seem to do a very good job on my toe nails.  Not sure what the problem is but they crush the nail more than cut them.  I purchased a set of curved cutters that work very well.  http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B009NYTFTG?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00</li>
            <li> Very good for my husband</li>
            <li> Helpul tool for around toenail edges.</li>
            <li> I use this on my ingrown toenail. It&#x27;s very helpful in relieving the pain in my toe. I get under the toenail to file it using a two headed toe nail file. Then I clip and shape the nail with the clipper without too much pain. I can bear to wear closed in shoes now. For people with diabetes, please seek your doctor&#x27;s advice before using.</li>
            <li> Good product. Quick service</li>
            <li> This is much smaller and lighter construction than I had envisioned.</li>
            <li> I have tossed out my any other toe nail clipper. It&#x27;s a pain if you have ingrown toenail. But this one saves my life! Can&#x27;t live without!!</li>
            <li> The product is not heavy duty enough to do the job for me.  they are a good quality.  Thank you</li>
