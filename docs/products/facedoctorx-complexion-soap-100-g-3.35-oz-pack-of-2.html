            <li>After sticking with the morning and evening washing regimen for about 3 weeks, I saw a clear improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and rosacea.  </li>
            <li>I washed twice a day (morning and evening) and used an organic all natural ultra-light moisturizer in the daytime and evening.</li>
            <li>but I abandoned it because it was too much effort for me to use daily theme</li>
            <li>it leaves my face feeling really soft after i rinse it off with water.</li>
            <li>will update again soon if my face completely clears up.</li>
            <li>My skin is ultra sensitive</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, we who are sensitive, must try to reduce them at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one measure I&#x27;ve taken that really helped (besides this soap) has been using mite proof allergy dust covers on the pillows, under the pillowcase, and changing the pillowcase daily.</li>

            <li>but this is the exact same soap here just sold under a different name...</li>
            <li>Without it, my face has huge  ruby red patches and little pimples.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now and see major improvements.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had an issue with cystic acne for the last 5 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed nothing special about this soap except it seems to last a long time and doesn&#x27;t get slimy like some other soaps do.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this one to try something new, but when I received it and opened it up, it was the exact same bar I have been using for the past year just under a different name but twice the price!</li>
            <li>If you have Rosacea, try this soap and stick with it for at least a month to see the full affects.</li>
            <li>&gt; (A well reputed dermatologist told me that a small percentage of the population - often with Celtic genes but not exclusively - lacks the enzyme that breaks down mite waste products - thus the reactivity that can take many unsightly forms!).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It cleans my face, but havent noticed a difference in skin quality or acne reduction</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a week now and am really happy with it. I have sensitive skin and have had an issue with cystic acne for the last 5 years. This is the first thing that has helped with my acne. At first I thought I was breaking out worse but it really it appears like the soap was helping pull the oil and dirt that was trapped under my skin to the surface. The soap helps clear up the zits that have surfaced and they heal really fast. It can be a little drying so make sure you put on moisturizer right after.</li>
            <li> I love the soap. I&#x27;ve suffered from rosacea for decades. This is the first so that I can see a noticeable difference over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different facial cleansers and this product has worked the best for me so far. I still get breakouts, but this product helps to clear up breakouts quicker than other products. My skin is really sensitive and this product has been great at not drying out my face. It doesn&#x27;t burn or itch, and it helps to calm redness.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and rosacea.  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for almost 2 years now.  It is a bit drying, but it keeps my skin clear and has really helped with the rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap morning and night for two months.  I&#x27;ve noticed nothing special about this soap except it seems to last a long time and doesn&#x27;t get slimy like some other soaps do.  It hasn&#x27;t had any affect on my complexion positive or negative. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> this stuff is simply amazing. After a lifetime of issues my skin looks normal and is glowing. In roughly 2 months of continued use, and this bar lasts really long. I washed twice a day (morning and evening) and used an organic all natural ultra-light moisturizer in the daytime and evening. it was perfect, did as advertised and I could&#x27;nt be happier. If they ever discontinued this soap I&#x27;d cry.</li>
            <li> I was looking for Chang Sheng soap and kept reading about Doctor X as some sort of replacement. It&#x27;s NOT the same. While still a very nice product on its own merits, it is not an equivalent to Chang Sheng soap. I used to buy Chang Sheng soap for 1/2 the price listed for it on Amazon, but my supplier has vanished, so I bought Doctor X instead. Although not disappointed with my purchase, It&#x27;s not as strong as the original Chang Sheng soap, it does clean your face well. Next time, I&#x27;ll be sure to get Chang Sheng. Good luck to all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different types of soap bars trying to control my rosacea and acne. I ordered this one to try something new, but when I received it and opened it up, it was the exact same bar I have been using for the past year just under a different name but twice the price! The soap bars are exactly the same with the exact same smell and inscriptions on it. The other one I usually buy goes buy &amp;#34;chang sheng soap&amp;#34;. It works good and I like it, but this is the exact same soap here just sold under a different name...</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about 5 years. I have used it through 4 pregnancies and the subsequent breastfeeding that makes hormones (and acne) go nuts. People tell me I glow. My complexion has never been better. It is true that it can cause burning and dryness at first, but I kept using it and my skin grew accustomed to it. My skin tends to be dry anyway, so I just follow up with a very light application of organic virgin coconut oil. As for the expense, it lasts me for between 4 and 6 months, and I use it once or twice a day (depending on how many showers this busy mommy is allowed!). I don&#x27;t consider the price extravagant for something that lasts so long, especially considering the price of other acne systems on the market.</li>
            <li> This soap is the first thing that has healed my face since the rosacea began about 10+ years ago.  I have been to the dermatologist, and the only option with them was laser treatment which insurance won&#x27;t pay for...  I happened across a description of this soap and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I had no idea about the skin mite issue.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 6 weeks and the skin is coming in clear, soft, smooth!  The guy who cuts my hair noticed right away and I hadn&#x27;t told him anything about the new treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE give the soap time to do its thing and let the skin grow in.  It is not a drying soap after your face is dry.  Your skin is softer from day one.  Also, I rub it continuously on the affected areas during the 30 secs it&#x27;s supposed to be on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day, and have never felt like my face was tight afterward.  I am so happy with this!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, totally smooths out skin and eliminates redness. I highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now and see major improvements.</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK... ACTUALLY MADE IT WORSE AND DRIER... NOW I HAVE TO GET IT CALMED DOWN! NOT HAPPY . DON&#x27;T WASTE THE MONEY</li>
            <li> I have rosacea problem (as i was diagnosed, but not sure if it is),&lt;br /&gt;the entire soap bar is washed out and it did not help to reduce my skin problem (itchy, red cheeks, and some small pimples with little white puss heads). After using this soap my skin gets more red and irritated. But soap&#x27;s fume is nice.&lt;br /&gt;I put one start because some one in reviews asked to use it for rosacea problem.  But this product did not help me.</li>
            <li> This product may or may not work, I won&#x27;t try! The package I was shipped was opened and in very rough shape! Definitely NOT &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; and it smells awful!. I did not receive the soap pictured but a different box, not sure it&#x27;s the same stuff.</li>
            <li> I have roseasa and this makes my complexion less bumpy and more vibrant.  It also lessens the redness.  I wish it was sold in my area, I have to send away for it.  It&#x27;s a wonderful gift for anybody!</li>
            <li> Does to do what it promises? Yes and no. Yes it does kill the demodex mite and improve skins appearance. But it is too drying for me. You have to leave it on for at least 1-3 minutes as directed on box. That is a long time. Not quite sure why you must let it sit. I can&#x27;t use it myself it&#x27;s to drying for my skin. It smells lovely. I was able to see improvements in redness and bumps but I abandoned it because it was too much effort for me to use daily theme have to slather on lotion to counteract the drying effect. It did and does stop my skin itching very well. I use it on an as needed basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 10 yrs now I think.  Maybe 8.  I&#x27;d tried everything for rosacea and excema.  I wouldn&#x27;t say this cures it, but it lessens the symptoms.  Well, the eczema is gone, but the rosacea is not as noticeable.  Any other soap I use flares it up. .I used to pay $17 for one bar of soap at the beginning.  Glad the price has gone down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update.  I&#x27;ve bought this 29 times (sometimes a 2 pack) since I believe 2008 (or 2006) I&#x27;ve tried similar named ones, but this is the best one.</li>
            <li> Washing my face in the past has always dried it out and made it red. I&#x27;ve used Purpose liquid face wash and even that was too harsh. This one is different. Very mild but still cleans and makes your face feel fresh. Lasts for ever too. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible skin but a pimple here or there, and some congestion. But after a random bout of perioral dermatitis came and went, I picked this soap up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suddenly got acne flare ups for 6-8 weeks after that: cystic, deep, uncomfortable, irritated skin, mostly in the chin/cheek/jawbone area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not comfortable, but I also read that this was expected behavior. And its true, it did clear up for me eve eventually.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me after a month. Made my skin a bit more irritated and I broke out a lot more while I was on it. Dont like the fragrence in it. Wish better luck to everyone else</li>
            <li> been using this for the past 4 days, twice a day morning and night. already saw improvements on my skin(i have serious acne on my cheeks ). it leaves my face feeling really soft after i rinse it off with water. will update again soon if my face completely clears up.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever.. I been use this face doctor bar soap for 15years now. This bar soap is the only face soap that I use. Please keep it up more more more!!!! Love it sooooooo much :)  if my face rash or pimple I use it in the night next morning it&#x27;s gone... My face very soft and radian, everyone want to know about it... I tell every one that I know about this product...</li>
            <li> Skin was smoother but did not clear up or prevent breakouts.  Ive tried everything for acne, just another failed test.</li>
            <li> My skin is ultra sensitive its been impossible for me to find cleaners that work.  I have Rosacea as well.  I had been using cetaphil, but it didn&#x27;t do a great job of removing my makeup and I was breaking out.  This gets my skin clean, but doesn&#x27;t irritate it.  It made my pores look better too. I&#x27;ve been so happy with it I&#x27;ve just ordered more from this line.</li>
            <li> Really great to treat oily pimply skin. Excellent for teenagers and anyone to attack occasional pimple. Just wet, treat  on each spot and leave even under make up or overnight. You will see it working!</li>
            <li> I use this soap morning and night.  Without it, my face has huge  ruby red patches and little pimples.  I don&#x27;t need medication or special lotions when using this product.  People I tell about it can&#x27;t believe I have problem skin. Isn&#x27;t that the idea?</li>
            <li> I rated this product 4 stars, because my face is softer it seems to be less red and&lt;br /&gt;clearer. I use it once a day twice would be to much and  harsh on my skin. I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;Face Doctor to anyone with acne prone skin or just want a softer, clearer completion.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my skin. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Worst soap ever for your skin. It makes acne worst with all the bad chemical .</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have written but I felt I needed to do so because this product is so good. I have had Rosacea for years with both breakouts and redness. This soap is the only product that has cleared up my Rosacea and that includes using prescription medication.  After the first couple of days it helped to clear up my breakouts and then I did have a flare up for about a week or so. After sticking with the morning and evening washing regimen for about 3 weeks, I saw a clear improvement.  I have been using this soap for about 8 weeks and it has cleared my face of all breakouts and redness. Now that my Rosacea is under control, I have stopped using my prescription medications to treat it saving me a lot of money.  If you have Rosacea, try this soap and stick with it for at least a month to see the full affects. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> I was dissapointed that the soap really didnt help with my rosacea at all.  It feels good and I&#x27;ll keep using it till it&#x27;s gone but I would not buy another one.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say this also breaks my face out. I was hoping for it to help with my face problems. However, it didnt help, yet it caused the break outs.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  I tried many high end products until I found  this&lt;br /&gt;Works for me, happy with it</li>
            <li> I waited awhile to review this soap, making sure to allow some time for any reactions that might crop up. I&#x27;ve been undergoing a systemic campaign to reduce my facial redness (in response to high stress or irritating products I can erupt in pimple like bumps and red patches.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my obsessive campaign to reduce the redness, I came to the conclusion from my research that it was probably a reaction to mites (that are everywhere, on everyone&#x27;s skins, they always will be), or rather the &#x27;end products&#x27; of the mites! When one&#x27;s immune system is under stress, from emotions or illness etc, the reaction to the mites, or possibly their populations themselves, increase. These tiny creatures have been implicated in MANY serious skin conditions, (Rosacea, psoriasis, exczema, etc) and in some animals also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (A well reputed dermatologist told me that a small percentage of the population - often with Celtic genes but not exclusively - lacks the enzyme that breaks down mite waste products - thus the reactivity that can take many unsightly forms!). They can even be responsible for a certain sweet musky odor that can show up in bedrooms where the bedding is not washed frequently. I know that is all pretty gross to realize, and makes one squeamish.  But it&#x27;s nothing personal, just nature, in its complex glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These little hitchhikers apparently hide out in our hair follicle areas (and sometimes in the eyebrows and eyelashes) and come out at night to &#x27;feed&#x27; in areas on the face!  Once I found this out I really got freaked out and started looking at myself with magnifying glasses etc at night, because apparently sometimes they can be seen &#x27;emerging&#x27;! Never saw anything like that thank goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the thing is they can&#x27;t be totally eliminated - but at least reduced in numbers. Science may one day prove they are &#x27;helping&#x27; us somehow, in a symbiotic fashion. In the meantime, we who are sensitive, must try to reduce them at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap has sea buckthorn and other ingredients which have been shown to reduce the mites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I began laundering my pillowcases more often, using Borax (which helps kill off mites) in the laundry, and even spraying around the bed area with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and Borax. The one measure I&#x27;ve taken that really helped (besides this soap) has been using mite proof allergy dust covers on the pillows, under the pillowcase, and changing the pillowcase daily. In two weeks I&#x27;ve seen a HUGE improvement in my skin doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is fair tending to ruddiness, reactive.  I typically use a gentle cleanser to melt the makeup first if I&#x27;m wearing any (Armani Mineral melt is my latest, previously used Burt&#x27;s Bees Cleanser for sensitive skin, I liked that too), then I&#x27;ve followed with this soap - but I found it too drying to use daily so now more like every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap doesn&#x27;t have much lather, and not much scent, but what there is is mild. I notice an immediate reduction of redness after using it. Again, its a little drying but would be perfect if you are oily. My own skin is in the &#x27;normal&#x27; range especially in the T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product and recommended. Good luck in your search for clear skin and especially in the fight with the old &#x27;epidermal hitchhikers&#x27;.soap has sea buckthorn and other ingredients which have been shown to reduce the mites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I began laundering my pillowcases more often, using Borax (which helps kill off mites) in the laundry, and even spraying around the bed area with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and Borax.

            <li> This soap is fantastic!  Want to feel super clean??  This is your product!  Helps my roseacia go away faster</li>
            <li> Great product .  Not all Face Doctor soap on amazon is the real deal.  This is .</li>
            <li> Works great for Roseacea like symptoms.  Makes skin feel great too!</li>
            <li> This soap is the greatest I have ever used for roseacea. It takes time for so debilitating a condition to repair, but this seems to stop the breakouts and red bumps to a degree that is hopeful and rewarding.</li>
            <li> I gave this soap a try to attempt to reduce redness on my cheeks from rosacea.  I didn&#x27;t notice any change after 4 weeks of daily use, though the soap cleaned acceptably.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I have periodic acne as well as severe &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; and this has pretty much cleared both of them up. Understand I HAVE tried every product on the market for Keratosis Pilaris, including prescription steroids and meds, this treats it better than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple. It contain salicylic acid. Is it worth 9 bucks? Yes, I think so. It last for quite some time and works. It does leave your skin very dry but isn&#x27;t a problem for me as I always follow it with an in-shower skin oil.</li>
