            <li> The only shortcoming I&#x27;ve had so far (after several months) with this is that the mattress still has to be burped every few weeks.</li>
            <li> our water bed is at least 15 years old , I put the salutation in every 6 months and add some water some time.</li>
            <li> NO PROBLEMS -- RECEIVED AS PROMISED, IN FACT FASTER THAN EXPECTED.  </li>
            <li> Item came just as expected from this place</li>
            <li> I needed this amount and got the 5 bottles for less than 1 would sell for at another source.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll let you know if one day something out of a B-rated soylent green flick osmosisizes out of the bed.</li>
            <li> This is such a difficult item to find.  </li>
            <li> water bed conditioner is getting harder to find and when you do, it can be very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Besides, thinking about only a thin layer of plastic between me and nasty putrid water isn&#x27;t something I care to consider...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Water beds are out of popularity, making finding chemicals difficult.  </li>
            <li> After shocking my waterbed, I added some of this conditioner and have had no problems with smell or air bubbles forming...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what I needed. Thanks</li>
            <li> Arrived ahead of schedule</li>
            <li> I could not find Blue Magic locally for my waterbed.  This was a great buy, 5 bottles for what 1 would have been locally, if they&#x27;d had it in stock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  It actually made my wife&#x27;s hair look a little better but we don&#x27;t feel it held up to it&#x27;s claim.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well...this is a must for waterbeds.  I apply every 6 months to the water and it eliminates bubbles and odors.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to receive as promised the 5 bottles of water bed conditioner.  They were sealed properly and as I opened each one to add to the water they had the same color, smell, and familiarity as I remembered the Blue Magic product.  I felt confident my purchase was secure and had no buyers remorse.</li>
            <li> This blue magic water conditioner did what it was supposed to do, the bed smelled much better the very next day.thanks</li>
            <li> Have had a waterbed for many years and have always treated the water with this product.  It works!</li>
            <li> i needed conditioner.  This was available.  How do you really know if it works?  If you don&#x27;t use it will the mattress explode?  I would rather use the conditioner than find out.</li>
            <li> We ordered 5 bottles of Blue Magic Waterbed Conditioner because we couldn&#x27;t find any in town any more. The bottles came within 7-10 days. Only we ordered them in December and the bottles came frozen. They didn&#x27;t expload or anything we just had to let them thaw out. So just remember when ordering don&#x27;t order anything that can&#x27;t be frozen without being ruined. Overall we were very satisfied with everything. Easy going through Amazon.com. We will order this product again.</li>
            <li> NO PROBLEMS -- RECEIVED AS PROMISED, IN FACT FASTER THAN EXPECTED.  EASY TO USE. GOOD PRICE WITH NO CONCERNS.</li>
            <li> needed it found it on amazon and we ordered it not problems and all good</li>

            <li> I had just emptied my bed to repair the frame.  I figured this would be a good time to add the conditioner.  Unfortunatly no one in town carries waterbed conditioner. Did some checking on line and found this on Amazon, of course!&lt;br /&gt;The box arrived faster than expected and was at a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I was excited to find the product I need on amazon--and for such a reasonable price. Received accurate product,as advertized &amp; order was received in an extremely timely manner!</li>

            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not eating my waterbed.  And neither does it smell.  So it must be doing its job.  Used it in my fiberbed since 2003.  Still is a great</li>
            <li> This is the conditioner I have been using for my beds.  Don&#x27;t plan on changing and can ger it here at a great price!</li>
            <li> I PAID THE SAME FOR 5 BOTTLES THAT MY BROTHER PAID FOR 1. I RECEIVED IN GOOD CONDITION IN A REASONABLE LENGTH OF TIME.</li>
            <li> This is a real bargain.  I needed this amount and got the 5 bottles for less than 1 would sell for at another source.</li>
            <li> In the past I have purchased larger bottles from the store, it is nice that these are more concentrated and I can keep a stock so I don&#x27;t have to run out and buy them all the time.</li>
            <li> If you love your waterbed, use this.</li>
            <li> Finding this type of product in stores is becoming more and more difficult. I ordered it and it arrived in a timely manor. I have used this product in the past and rely on it to keep my mattress in good condition for years to come.</li>
            <li> The Blue Magic Waterbed Conditioner arrived quickly and met my expectations. I have used this brand for many years and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Did the job and a good price</li>
            <li> The only shortcoming I&#x27;ve had so far (after several months) with this is that the mattress still has to be burped every few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have a waterbed and this is what I bought for it, works good. more words and stuff. 2 more.</li>
            <li> Product appears as advertised.  Would prefer that directions be in larger print and more explicit -- what size mattress does 1-4oz bottle treat for 12 or 18 months?</li>
            <li> seems to be what the seller offered and what I needed at a great price.  I love my waterbed.</li>
            <li> Works fine, prompt delivery</li>
            <li> I have been using Blue Magic since the 70&#x27;s when I got my waterbed.  Seems to do the trick</li>
            <li> our water bed is at least 15 years old , I put the salutation in every 6 months and add some water some time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that anyone who owns a waterbed to be sure to use a conditioner.  It does help especially when you need to open the valve for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Everything was as stated in ad, got the conditioner fast, packaged well, works excellent! This is a good Service! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good buy on waterbed conditioner. But, should come as a six pack, for three applications in a king size waterbed.</li>
            <li> good quality and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Quick response and shipment. Price was good and low. Product was exactly what was advertised and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> DID WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. SHIP TIME WAS QUICK.A A A A A A A A A A</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of conditioner for many years, and  have been pleased with it.  I can no longer purchase it anywhere in our area, thus the reason for ordering.  I have recommended this to my friends.  I will order again, when I need more conditioner. Shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li> This product keeps your mattress fresh and mold free as promised and is a great value in general.  I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Great price on this product.  Seems to do it&#x27;s job. I had no issues with this product.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> This waterbed conditioner is easy to use, and since our local source is no longer in business, the ability to purchase online is great.</li>
            <li> Use it about once a quarter...good for waterbed.  Doesn&#x27;t smell, keeps the bubbles out of the bed.  Good buy, hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This is a good value, Thanks again</li>
            <li> Gem find..not many waterbed owners left..so finding this conditioner was a steal..</li>
            <li> I use these every six months for our son&#x27;s waterbed.  these work well and are easy to use. Will be buying them again.</li>
            <li> Since I can&#x27;t find this in any local store, this is a really easy way to take care of my bed.</li>
            <li> Just  what I needed to maintain my  water  in my waterbed.</li>
            <li> this works great on acne very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Great price.. great product.</li>
            <li> Waterbed fluid.  It works great.</li>
            <li> Item was easy to use Thank you so much! Item came just as expected from this place would order from again in the future. My household still has a water bed in it and I can&#x27;t say that I love the new mattresses out their. The bottles will come in handy when it comes time to use again! Just put the contents of  1 bottle in the waterbed and add more water and you will have a nice waterbed.</li>
            <li> This product seem to be better than the one I was using before I bought this one. It is cheaper too.</li>
            <li> water bed conditioner is getting harder to find and when you do, it can be very expensive.  So I was happy to find a choice on Amazon that would work.  They arrived fast and are what is needed for someone with a waterbed.</li>
            <li> I need to order more.  This is such a difficult item to find.  How nice it is to have a 5 pack.</li>
            <li> Who knows if this really works cuz let&#x27;s face it, I&#x27;m not going to pour out some water and drink it or anything. But there&#x27;s no smell or discoloration of the water so I&#x27;m taking it on faith that it works. Besides, thinking about only a thin layer of plastic between me and nasty putrid water isn&#x27;t something I care to consider...so in my mind, this is working beyond excellently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll let you know if one day something out of a B-rated soylent green flick osmosisizes out of the bed. Then I&#x27;ll definitely change my rating...well, if I have time to get to the computer before my fingers dissolve on the keyboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must...not...op0000oooo0000ooooooooooarrrrgggggg..............</li>
            <li> i paid less and got more. I filled my cal king bed up once and i still have 3 bottles to spare. Not to minchin my package is delevered on time.</li>
            <li> Water beds are out of popularity, making finding chemicals difficult.  This is the right stuff and I am thankful that it is still available.</li>
            <li> The seller did a good job of selling their great product to me.</li>
            <li> Have finally gotten my new waterbed  mattress on and put Blue Magic in the water.Have used Blue Magic for years. Keeps the water clear and smelling ok</li>
            <li> Product was as promised, at a fair price, and delivered promptly.  Would by again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have using Blue Magic for years in my soft sided waterbed and have no problems with it. Seems to do as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great price,not available in stores. Workes to keep water clear also to keep waterbed material soft and plyable.One bottle last up to six months.</li>
            <li> Yup! It&#x27;s waterbed conditioner... It worked like it should work.  Boy I am thrilled? How much can you say about waterbed conditioner?</li>
            <li> It did well contring the water</li>
