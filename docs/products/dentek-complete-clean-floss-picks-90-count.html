            <li>Make flossing my teeth much, much more pleasant.</li>

            <li>It is Excellent, I received on time and the quality is great work as It’s required and I will give 5 stars, it’s just Wonderful, better impossible</li>
            <li>Great price and does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Preferred Mart, through Amazon, got them to me quickly and packaging was environmentally good.</li>
            <li>I have so many of these now that I have to floss.</li>
            <li>I love the floss part.</li>
            <li>My dentist has told me that I need to floss more</li>
            <li>I love these and not everyone carries them.</li>
            <li>Love them and so do all my friends.</li>
            <li>I use to be able to purchase them at the drug store.</li>
            <li>This time, since I was purchasing from Amazon (which I love), I bought this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the two in one features...</li>
            <li>It would be much more convenient to use if the floss were mounted in a &amp;#34;Y&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>(as before) rather than the more cumbersome &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; bracket.  </li>
            <li>; change to the pick end as well as the more resistant floss</li>
            <li>I wish they would beef it up with more plastic and lengthen the handle.  </li>
            <li>I bought many bags to keep them in car, purse, desk, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ve tried many flosses before, none are as sturdy as this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of floss picks, these are the best for sure, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another type again</li>
            <li>Im glad i found these.</li>
            <li>really pleased with these</li>
            <li>I wish more products were as magical.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re more discreet than floss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having much better luck with G.U.M. flossers.</li>
            <li>I thought these picks were the best thing since sliced bread, but after a recent dentist visit....not so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great deal - high quality</li>
            <li>I strongly endorse this vendor: the right product and the best price AND fast delivery</li>
            <li>I feel like it gets my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are wider than most, the floss is strong, and he loves the picks at the end of the handles.</li>
            <li>I got way more than I expected which was awesome.</li>
            <li>the second I buy this floss, very good.</li>
            <li>that didn&#x27;t break easily during use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing based on my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the floss seems to be coated and super strong, so it is able to easily get between my tightly-spaced teeth, and I have never had the floss</li>
            <li>The floss is fine and strong.  </li>
            <li>We have tried just about every floss stick on the market, and this one is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Nothing like clean teeth and nothing better than a clean floss pick to do the job after eating.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the best dental reports, especially with tarter reduction between teeth, ever since I started using this particular Dentek style.</li>
            <li>that gently clean between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>These are the best of all flosses, and hard to find in drug stores.</li>
            <li>You do really get a pack of (# however many you choose) with 90 peices per package.</li>
            <li>They are the best flosser I&#x27;ve found, and I have tried several different kinds.</li>
            <li>If your teeth have adequate space in between, this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, but if you&#x27;ve spent money on braces, crowns, or caps to get your teeth straight and beautifully aligned, forget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Floss stays tight and the tip is great for in between the teeth.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and great for the occasional need when I don&#x27;t feel like breaking out the standard floss with which I always feel the need to do all of my choppers.</li>
            <li>These things are amazing, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>My teeth a have never been cleaner and my breath is kissable fresh.</li>
            <li>The floss rarely breaks and never shreds.</li>
            <li>They can be used to clean small chambers out very effectively.</li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t right?  </li>
            <li>The size and tautness of the floss is perfect and it so much easier to use floss picks than plain old floss.</li>
            <li>The end side is very gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li>Besides having the floss element, there&#x27;s a neat brush at the end of the handle, for brushing between teeth, at the gum-line.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Dentek Complete Floss is not found in too many stores, where I live, thus, amazon,com!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find floss sticks with the great cleaning bristles on the end.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be ordering multiple 6-packs of this item to make sure I have an ample supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The floss part is great, but the the pick part SUCKS compared to others.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s a personal opinion, but I love buying in bulk.</li>
            <li>It does the job very well!</li>
            <li>Better than regular floss.</li>
            <li>, the pick part has kind of a burr on it -- which I think is too rough for gums.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty flimsy and do shred a bit.  </li>
            <li>I like the pick end of the flosser, but both sides do the job pretty well.</li>
            <li>work okay, but are not wide and strong enough to lift the material from between your teeth.</li>
            <li>Good: tight and strong floss string, low price.</li>
            <li>I would not buy any other kind</li>
            <li>They do not shred or break like every other kind I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>So, I purchased the Dentek Complete Clean Floss Picks.  </li>
            <li>floss is pretty tought and doesn&#x27;t strip very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are amazing- with other brands I seldom use one more than 2 or 3 days before they break, or pull loose from the holder.</li>
            <li>Well, the Complete Clean floss picks from Dentek appear to live up to the advertisement of shed-proof.</li>
            <li>I have never broken one in over a year of use.</li>
            <li>This allows me to use both hands and really work the floss below the gum line.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t  think they can serve as reasonable alternatives to a real tongue  scraper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended for anyone who wants a break-proof floss pick.</li>
            <li>also really like these.</li>
            <li>They shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Really gets in between my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Floss plus a very efficient, saw-toothed pick.</li>
            <li>It is really just a preference thing.</li>
            <li>I will go back to my cheap store brand floss.</li>
            <li>After a while - the tip of my thumb and index fingers hurt from holding it since I don&#x27;t have much surface to grip on.  </li>
            <li>Now, that I have fully recovered from my surgery, I continue to use these floss picks as I find them very convenient; and I like not wrapping floss material around my fingers and sticking both fingers in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using these up as fast as I can</li>
            <li>Really fast service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tired a LOT of different brands and styles of these things, and these are the best in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I love the bristled pick at the other end.  </li>
            <li>Love the additional pic on the other end for getting between spaces and stimulating the gums.</li>
            <li>Better than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The floss breaks too easily and the &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; end is too flimsy to get between even widely spaced teeth.</li>
            <li>After trying the many different styles of floss picks, I finally settled on this style of Dentek picks.</li>
            <li>, I was checking many different and similar of this one</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Strong and doesn&#x27;t break like other brand have.</li>
            <li>so I can go to the ones with a more firm handle.</li>
            <li>The little barbed end is cool, even though some people see it and think it looks funny.</li>
            <li>The floss part is gentle enough to get the job done, without shredding your gums.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those who do not like managing traditional dental floss.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also gets to the hard to reach places a lot easily</li>
            <li>but at least the floss is strong.</li>
            <li>I recommended it most for small hands and loosely gapped teeth.</li>
            <li>Compared to other picks these are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I went to a website the other day that calculated how old I will live.  </li>
            <li>I have large hand and also some of my teeth are tightly spaced.</li>
            <li>They work really well on tight teeth and</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My dentist has told me that I need to floss more</li>
            <li> I love these and not everyone carries them.</li>
            <li> Love them and so do all my friends.</li>
            <li> I use to be able to purchase them at the drug store.</li>
            <li> This time, since I was purchasing from Amazon (which I love), I bought this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the two in one features...</li>
            <li> It would be much more convenient to use if the floss were mounted in a &amp;#34;Y&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> (as before) rather than the more cumbersome &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; bracket.  </li>
            <li> ; change to the pick end as well as the more resistant floss</li>
            <li> I wish they would beef it up with more plastic and lengthen the handle.  </li>
            <li> I bought many bags to keep them in car, purse, desk, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ve tried many flosses before, none are as sturdy as this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of floss picks, these are the best for sure, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another type again</li>
            <li> Im glad i found these.</li>
            <li> really pleased with these</li>
            <li> I wish more products were as magical.  </li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re more discreet than floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having much better luck with G.U.M. flossers.</li>
            <li> I thought these picks were the best thing since sliced bread, but after a recent dentist visit....not so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great deal - high quality</li>
            <li> I strongly endorse this vendor: the right product and the best price AND fast delivery</li>
            <li> I feel like it gets my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are wider than most, the floss is strong, and he loves the picks at the end of the handles.</li>
            <li> I got way more than I expected which was awesome.</li>
            <li> the second I buy this floss, very good.</li>
            <li> that didn&#x27;t break easily during use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing based on my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the floss seems to be coated and super strong, so it is able to easily get between my tightly-spaced teeth, and I have never had the floss</li>
            <li> The floss is fine and strong.  </li>
            <li> We have tried just about every floss stick on the market, and this one is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> Nothing like clean teeth and nothing better than a clean floss pick to do the job after eating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the best dental reports, especially with tarter reduction between teeth, ever since I started using this particular Dentek style.</li>
            <li> that gently clean between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> These are the best of all flosses, and hard to find in drug stores.</li>
            <li> You do really get a pack of (# however many you choose) with 90 peices per package.</li>
            <li> They are the best flosser I&#x27;ve found, and I have tried several different kinds.</li>
            <li> If your teeth have adequate space in between, this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, but if you&#x27;ve spent money on braces, crowns, or caps to get your teeth straight and beautifully aligned, forget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Floss stays tight and the tip is great for in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and great for the occasional need when I don&#x27;t feel like breaking out the standard floss with which I always feel the need to do all of my choppers.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> My teeth a have never been cleaner and my breath is kissable fresh.</li>
            <li> The floss rarely breaks and never shreds.</li>
            <li> They can be used to clean small chambers out very effectively.</li>
            <li> the price is right.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t right?  </li>
            <li> The size and tautness of the floss is perfect and it so much easier to use floss picks than plain old floss.</li>
            <li> The end side is very gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li> Besides having the floss element, there&#x27;s a neat brush at the end of the handle, for brushing between teeth, at the gum-line.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Dentek Complete Floss is not found in too many stores, where I live, thus, amazon,com!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find floss sticks with the great cleaning bristles on the end.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be ordering multiple 6-packs of this item to make sure I have an ample supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The floss part is great, but the the pick part SUCKS compared to others.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a personal opinion, but I love buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> It does the job very well!</li>
            <li> Better than regular floss.</li>
            <li> , the pick part has kind of a burr on it -- which I think is too rough for gums.  </li>
            <li> These are pretty flimsy and do shred a bit.  </li>
            <li> I like the pick end of the flosser, but both sides do the job pretty well.</li>
            <li> work okay, but are not wide and strong enough to lift the material from between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Good: tight and strong floss string, low price.</li>
            <li> I would not buy any other kind</li>
            <li> They do not shred or break like every other kind I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> So, I purchased the Dentek Complete Clean Floss Picks.  </li>
            <li> floss is pretty tought and doesn&#x27;t strip very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are amazing- with other brands I seldom use one more than 2 or 3 days before they break, or pull loose from the holder.</li>
            <li> Well, the Complete Clean floss picks from Dentek appear to live up to the advertisement of shed-proof.</li>
            <li> I have never broken one in over a year of use.</li>
            <li> This allows me to use both hands and really work the floss below the gum line.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t  think they can serve as reasonable alternatives to a real tongue  scraper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended for anyone who wants a break-proof floss pick.</li>
            <li> also really like these.</li>
            <li> They shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Really gets in between my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Floss plus a very efficient, saw-toothed pick.</li>
            <li> It is really just a preference thing.</li>
            <li> I will go back to my cheap store brand floss.</li>
            <li> After a while - the tip of my thumb and index fingers hurt from holding it since I don&#x27;t have much surface to grip on.  </li>
            <li> Now, that I have fully recovered from my surgery, I continue to use these floss picks as I find them very convenient; and I like not wrapping floss material around my fingers and sticking both fingers in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these up as fast as I can</li>
            <li> Really fast service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired a LOT of different brands and styles of these things, and these are the best in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I love the bristled pick at the other end.  </li>
            <li> Love the additional pic on the other end for getting between spaces and stimulating the gums.</li>
            <li> Better than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks too easily and the &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; end is too flimsy to get between even widely spaced teeth.</li>
            <li> After trying the many different styles of floss picks, I finally settled on this style of Dentek picks.</li>
            <li> , I was checking many different and similar of this one</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Strong and doesn&#x27;t break like other brand have.</li>
            <li> so I can go to the ones with a more firm handle.</li>
            <li> The little barbed end is cool, even though some people see it and think it looks funny.</li>
            <li> The floss part is gentle enough to get the job done, without shredding your gums.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those who do not like managing traditional dental floss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also gets to the hard to reach places a lot easily</li>
            <li> but at least the floss is strong.</li>
            <li> I recommended it most for small hands and loosely gapped teeth.</li>
            <li> Compared to other picks these are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I went to a website the other day that calculated how old I will live.  </li>
            <li> I have large hand and also some of my teeth are tightly spaced.</li>
            <li> They work really well on tight teeth and</li>
            <li> I have been flossing daily using these dental picks for a long time now.</li>
            <li> if you have a tight gap in between your teeth, this is the only floss thin and strong enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> They work okay, but if you have tori the angle is a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> It stands up to rough use and is simple to use.</li>
            <li> Flosser is wide enough for molars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it cleans any better or worse</li>
            <li> I preferred the flat plastic part of other applicators but these still work well, don&#x27;t break, and get between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Although the floss has thinned down, I am into my 2nd week of use on my 1st pick!</li>
            <li> It looks long in the picture but the pointy tip is so thin you can&#x27;t really grip it there.</li>
            <li> These are the only flossers I can get between my tightly spaced teeth</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t seem to pick out as much plaque as the previous brand I had, and their smaller size makes it difficult to fully get to the back molars.</li>
            <li> They are really flimsy ( thin)</li>
            <li> is the wide space between the ends the floss is attached to.</li>
            <li> These were competitively priced and are as expected.</li>
            <li> They work as expected and you can&#x27;t be the price anywhere.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with the pick end not to scuff up the tissues or use them too roughly as you might develop a dentin exposure and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> not really what I wanted</li>
            <li> a few other similar Dentek Floss Picks - these are the best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other brands of flossers that break and get stuck in my teeth-</li>
            <li> I have used other floss sticks in the past and they always snapped when I tried to get the floss between my back teeth.</li>
            <li> The string does not break like the other brands.</li>
            <li> the floss is stronger than other brands.</li>
            <li> and I have even had a cleaning where they did not need to floss due to the hygiene of my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> Bad: as mentioned by one of the previous reviews, the handle is too short and soft (easily bent), inconvenient for big hands</li>
            <li> Hard to find in local stores in some reasons.</li>
            <li> I discovered these floss picks by accident, and typically buy them at Walmart, but for some reason, I can no longer find them there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used others that break half way through flossing.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed less plaque chipping away with this version though so for that reason I will give it 4 stars vs 5.</li>
            <li> When I was preparing for shoulder surgery, I realized that during my recovery, I would be unable to floss with traditional flossing ribbon as I would only have one functional arm.  </li>
            <li> There should be a little bit of friction to stimulate the gums and pick up pieces of food etc.</li>
            <li> Plus, I like the little tooth-pick on the end of the handle.</li>
            <li> It is teeny little &amp;#34;brushes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very satisfying to floss with as it just slides through your teeth with no friction at all.  </li>
            <li> Other picks are to thick; this one is thin but this allows it to bend if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> My family was definitely tired of me sending them to look for &amp;#34;the red bag of flossers&amp;#34; everywhere we went.</li>
            <li> I tried this product a few months ago, recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I am still experimenting with the tip and don&#x27;t use it everyday, but it too has remained intact.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the pick is useless as it is 100% completely flimsy and will not suite as a toothpick.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve always purchased the cheapest one in the store -- usually the store brand.  </li>
            <li> This is small and the edges cuts your gums sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> small and because of that, its difficult to get to places at the back of your teeth..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this!</li>
            <li> the handle/toothpick part is a little weak.</li>
            <li> and they are near impossible to find anywhere.</li>
            <li> Flossing teeth can be a drudge and some floss feels like the teeth are pulled too hard.</li>
            <li> Now that my braces are off, its hard for me to floss my bottom teeth because of the permanent retainer.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find.</li>
            <li> Often, it would take at least two floss picks to get the job done.</li>
            <li> The sensation of food particles trapped between my teeth is irritating.</li>
            <li> I mean, they either work or</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually quite disappointed in these floss picks.</li>
            <li> I see in the store that are worse quality.</li>
            <li> These floss picks have really thin floss.  </li>
            <li> Floss is too thin.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t broken one yet (30 days of 2x picks per day usage).</li>
            <li> I use to just pickup a random bag at the grocery store, but I got tired of having them break during use.</li>
            <li> The unpleasant feeling is distracting to say the least.</li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> Too bad it came in a pack of six, because now I&#x27;m stuck using these for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I could never use those annoying loops.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, this was a very bad experience.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely worthless!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They are really flimsy ( thin) the floss doesn&#x27;t break as specified. When flossing they have to be held close to the floss for it not to bend.</li>
            <li> These are GREAT! The floss is almost indestructible. Recommended, especially for former REACH users.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never looked so good.  The size and tautness of the floss is perfect and it so much easier to use floss picks than plain old floss.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find floss sticks with the great cleaning bristles on the end. These work great for clean feeling teeth and the price is right.</li>
            <li> great deal - high quality</li>
            <li> I have so many of these now that I have to floss. Work great and don&#x27;t break easily!</li>
            <li> Great price and does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> These floss picks work great. I have never broken one in over a year of use. I use to just pickup a random bag at the grocery store, but I got tired of having them break during use. These are best I have found.</li>
            <li> I discovered these floss picks by accident, and typically buy them at Walmart, but for some reason, I can no longer find them there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best about them is the wide space between the ends the floss is attached to. This allows me to use both hands and really work the floss below the gum line. Also, the floss seems to be coated and super strong, so it is able to easily get between my tightly-spaced teeth, and I have never had the floss break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering multiple 6-packs of this item to make sure I have an ample supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly hope they aren&#x27;t being discontinued, because they are the best of this type of product on the market.</li>
            <li> These were competitively priced and are as expected. However, I don&#x27;t  think they can serve as reasonable alternatives to a real tongue  scraper.</li>
            <li> Cant seem to find them in the store. These work and feel great and do a great job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using floss picks for a few years now as I find them much easier to use than regular floss. Over the years, however, I haven&#x27;t found a specific brand and model (?) that didn&#x27;t break easily during use. Often, it would take at least two floss picks to get the job done. Well, the Complete Clean floss picks from Dentek appear to live up to the advertisement of shed-proof. I&#x27;ve almost cleared one entire bag, and I&#x27;ve had no breaks. Pretty amazing based on my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for anyone who wants a break-proof floss pick.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss picks what I ever used. That is great and beyond my expectation. This is 2nd purchase. Highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li> You do really get a pack of (# however many you choose) with 90 peices per package. Lots of em! The floss part is great, but the the pick part SUCKS compared to others. Seriously, the pick is useless as it is 100% completely flimsy and will not suite as a toothpick. You can floss your teeth but CANNOT use these as a pick. Buyer beware of that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had one break. They&#x27;re also cheaper than the floss picks I see in the store that are worse quality.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even notice this was a pack of 6 - 90 count floss picks. I got way more than I expected which was awesome. They work as expected and you can&#x27;t be the price anywhere.</li>
            <li> This is great. Maybe it&#x27;s a personal opinion, but I love buying in bulk. I carry a pack in my purse, in my car, and in my bathroom. It should last me forever. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;I also really like these. The little barbed end is cool, even though some people see it and think it looks funny. It does the job very well!</li>
            <li> Those are great. Hard to find in local stores in some reasons.</li>
            <li> Work great. Better than regular floss. Don&#x27;t break, don&#x27;t shred. My teeth a have never been cleaner and my breath is kissable fresh.</li>
            <li> Floss on my way to and from work. Good use of time.</li>
            <li> Nothing like clean teeth and nothing better than a clean floss pick to do the job after eating.  Highly recommended for those who do not like managing traditional dental floss.</li>
            <li> The sensation of food particles trapped between my teeth is irritating. The unpleasant feeling is distracting to say the least. After trying the many different styles of floss picks, I finally settled on this style of Dentek picks. The tapered brush at one end is a superior tool, while the floss I found is the most durable of them all.</li>
            <li> i like the shape of pick. The end looks like it has barbs which is great for getting food stuck in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> And these are the only ones that my husband and kids can use to get between their teeth.  The floss part is gentle enough to get the job done, without shredding your gums.</li>
            <li> Great product, for a good price.</li>
            <li> I love the floss part. Strong and doesn&#x27;t break like other brand have. I just don&#x27;t like the tooth pick part. Completely useless.</li>
            <li> The floss picks work great! I have used others that break half way through flossing. Not these!</li>
            <li> My dentist has told me that I need to floss more and I find regular floss cumbersome to use. I bought this after reading some of the reviews and this product works great. It stands up to rough use and is simple to use.</li>
            <li> They shipped fast. I love these and not everyone carries them. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is Excellent, I received on time and the quality is great work as It’s required and I will give 5 stars, it’s just Wonderful, better impossible, I was checking many different and similar of this one and I couldn’t find someone like this.</li>
            <li> These make interdental cleaning and flossing a breeze!  Just be careful with the pick end not to scuff up the tissues or use them too roughly as you might develop a dentin exposure and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores.  Great product.</li>
            <li> The Dentek sticks show in your picture is what I ordered this is not what I received. I was going to return instead will give away at Christmas as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> Flossing teeth can be a drudge and some floss feels like the teeth are pulled too hard. This floss glides in and out between the teeth with ease</li>
            <li> We have tried just about every floss stick on the market, and this one is hands down the best. The floss doesn&#x27;t fray, or disconnect from the handle. I feel like it gets my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> buy in bulk, save. good purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired a LOT of different brands and styles of these things, and these are the best in my opinion.  I love the bristled pick at the other end.  The floss rarely breaks and never shreds.</li>
            <li> strongest floss picks! good price! all like this one.</li>
            <li> These are the only flossers I can get between my tightly spaced teeth and they are near impossible to find anywhere. My family was definitely tired of me sending them to look for &amp;#34;the red bag of flossers&amp;#34; everywhere we went. Now I&#x27;m set for a while.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what it was like to have 6 packs (90 count) of anything until these arrived. I expect that they will last me for the duration. They are easy to use and great for the occasional need when I don&#x27;t feel like breaking out the standard floss with which I always feel the need to do all of my choppers.</li>
            <li> These work great! Love the additional pic on the other end for getting between spaces and stimulating the gums. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> These are great but I don&#x27;t only use them for my teeth.  They can be used to clean small chambers out very effectively.</li>
            <li> Really gets in between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss is pretty tought and doesn&#x27;t strip very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also gets to the hard to reach places a lot easily</li>
            <li> Probably the best floss sticks ever. I never got in the habit of flossing, especially once I got braces on. I could never use those annoying loops. Now that my braces are off, its hard for me to floss my bottom teeth because of the permanent retainer. I tried everything to get into the habit of flossing but nothing worked with me until I came across these. I LOVE THESE THINGS! I keep a bag in my purse at all times. I couldn&#x27;t find them in stores, but this is probably the best deal you&#x27;ll find on them anyway!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other brands of flossers that break and get stuck in my teeth- these don&#x27;t do that! Great purchase</li>
            <li> Floss plus a very efficient, saw-toothed pick. Use it every day and there&#x27;s no chance for plaque to build up.</li>
            <li> I have used other floss sticks in the past and they always snapped when I tried to get the floss between my back teeth. I have been using these for a week now and have not had even 1 come close to snapping. I am not a fan of the burr on the end of the stick part though. I preferred the flat plastic part of other applicators but these still work well, don&#x27;t break, and get between my teeth. It is really just a preference thing. I&#x27;m not sure if it cleans any better or worse but I have noticed less plaque chipping away with this version though so for that reason I will give it 4 stars vs 5.</li>
            <li> Been trying to find these locally but couldn&#x27;t.  But, now I&#x27;ve found them at Amazon and am a happy purchaser.  These are the perfect toothpick/flosser.  Love them and so do all my friends.</li>
            <li> Works great, searched around the web for the best on the market and found these to be just what was needed. They  arrived as described.</li>
            <li> Great price for bulk flossers</li>
            <li> Its floss part gets between the teeth but the handle/toothpick part is a little weak.</li>
            <li> I have used these Picks on my teeth for a couple of years. They are hard to find. Hope they keep making them.</li>
            <li> These are the best picks on the market. I use to be able to purchase them at the drug store. I was so happy to find them on Amazon. The flexible pick is really what makes it the best.</li>
            <li> I would not buy any other kind</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like that the pick end has bristles on it . . . but at least the floss is strong.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would write a review about floss picks.  I mean, they either work or they don&#x27;t right?  Well, I&#x27;ve always purchased the cheapest one in the store -- usually the store brand.  This time, since I was purchasing from Amazon (which I love), I bought this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the store brands, these are SOOOOOooo fragile.  If the floss doesn&#x27;t break, the tool bends when you stick the floss in between your teeth, and when that happens the sides of the plastic bite you!  I&#x27;m not kidding!  If your teeth have adequate space in between, this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, but if you&#x27;ve spent money on braces, crowns, or caps to get your teeth straight and beautifully aligned, forget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the pick part has kind of a burr on it -- which I think is too rough for gums.  Just my opinion.  I will go back to my cheap store brand floss.</li>
            <li> These work well for my teeth. The string does not break like the other brands. I regularly use them several times a day. The end side is very gentle on my gums. Best floss/picks I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have continually ordered these; they are the only ones that don&#x27;t break or have any issues. They are the best flosser I&#x27;ve found, and I have tried several different kinds.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product and an amazing price, your gums will appreciate them.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Good quality, and a ton of them for the money!</li>
            <li> Everything as pictured &amp; delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> Almost perfect.  Other picks are to thick; this one is thin but this allows it to bend if you&#x27;re not careful.  Flosser is wide enough for molars.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but I bought a package which as supposed to contain six smaller packages of 90 picks each. However, the larger package had been opened and only three 90-count packages were inside. At best, someone packing the order wasn&#x27;t paying attention. I&#x27;m hoping this wasn&#x27;t intentional. Nevertheless, this was a very bad experience.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. Delevered on time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these in my stores anymore, so I order them on Amazon now.  I went to a website the other day that calculated how old I will live.  It asked 4 pages of questions, one was how often did I floss.  Because of these flossers I could say that I floss every day, all through the day.  It&#x27;s the brush on the end of the flossers that I like so well.</li>
            <li> Get stuck between teeth.  Prefer Glide.</li>
            <li> I tried this product a few months ago, recommended by my dentist. Great product. Love the two in one features...I highly recommend. Cheers, Laura</li>
            <li> My husband says these are the best &amp;#34;flossers&amp;#34; he has ever used.  They are wider than most, the floss is strong, and he loves the picks at the end of the handles.</li>
            <li> It would be much more convenient to use if the floss were mounted in a &amp;#34;Y&amp;#34; bracket (as before) rather than the more cumbersome &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; bracket.  The &amp;#34;Christmas tree&amp;#34; change to the pick end as well as the more resistant floss are both welcome improvements.  Altogether, this floss pick is a proficient tool.</li>
            <li> not really what I wanted but it was the Closest to what I wanted</li>
            <li> I tried a few other similar Dentek Floss Picks - these are the best.&lt;br /&gt;They are definitely Shred  proof floss.</li>
            <li> Good: tight and strong floss string, low price. Bad: as mentioned by one of the previous reviews, the handle is too short and soft (easily bent), inconvenient for big hands</li>
            <li> These floss picks have really thin floss.  My kids don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s not very satisfying to floss with as it just slides through your teeth with no friction at all.  There should be a little bit of friction to stimulate the gums and pick up pieces of food etc.</li>
            <li> The plastic handle is short and flimsy. It looks long in the picture but the pointy tip is so thin you can&#x27;t really grip it there. I have large hand and also some of my teeth are tightly spaced. That makes it a challenge to hold and manipulate around my mouth w/o The handle bending and twisting.  i have to hold it very close to the string to keep it firm. After a while - the tip of my thumb and index fingers hurt from holding it since I don&#x27;t have much surface to grip on.  I wish they would beef it up with more plastic and lengthen the handle.  I recommended it most for small hands and loosely gapped teeth.</li>
            <li> Great! It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Compared to other picks these are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> When I was preparing for shoulder surgery, I realized that during my recovery, I would be unable to floss with traditional flossing ribbon as I would only have one functional arm.  So, I purchased the Dentek Complete Clean Floss Picks.  These worked out perfect for me as I could floss with one hand.  Now, that I have fully recovered from my surgery, I continue to use these floss picks as I find them very convenient; and I like not wrapping floss material around my fingers and sticking both fingers in my mouth.  Plus, I like the little tooth-pick on the end of the handle.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use. Floss stays tight and the tip is great for in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> These are the best of all flosses, and hard to find in drug stores.</li>
            <li> These are pretty flimsy and do shred a bit.  The Plackers brand has a firmer handle.  I&#x27;m using these up as fast as I can so I can go to the ones with a more firm handle.</li>
            <li> Really fast service. good quality</li>
            <li> This is small and the edges cuts your gums sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Its small and because of that, its difficult to get to places at the back of your teeth..&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Plackers Twin Line Whitening Floss on Amazon..&lt;br /&gt;I do, however like the floss picks at the tip though.. THats perhaps the only saving grace..</li>
            <li> I like these. They don&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> I strongly endorse this vendor: the right product and the best price AND fast delivery &#x3D; A+.</li>
            <li> These are great picks with floss and scraper.  Best on the market.</li>
            <li> Good quality and extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> Never going to run out of tooth pick flossers</li>
            <li> Great price for these DenTek dental floss picks. I bought many bags to keep them in car, purse, desk, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually quite disappointed in these floss picks. I was using a different brand before that was made of stronger plastic and had a larger flossing area/floss string. These don&#x27;t seem to pick out as much plaque as the previous brand I had, and their smaller size makes it difficult to fully get to the back molars. Too bad it came in a pack of six, because now I&#x27;m stuck using these for quite a while.</li>
            <li> what the title said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve tried many flosses before, none are as sturdy as this. if you have a tight gap in between your teeth, this is the only floss thin and strong enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of floss picks, these are the best for sure, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another type again</li>
            <li> My family uses so many of these! Im glad i found these. Work just as well as any brand!</li>
            <li> These are great. Make flossing my teeth much, much more pleasant. I have been flossing daily using these dental picks for a long time now.</li>
            <li> really pleased with these and I haven&#x27;t had one break yet!! thats a miracle (as all others I have ever tried break as I try to get them through my teeth)!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li> So glad I tried these wonderful piks.  They get everything.</li>
            <li> works great, good price</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I&#x27;ve had the best dental reports, especially with tarter reduction between teeth, ever since I started using this particular Dentek style. It&#x27;s very comfortable and easy to use. Besides having the floss element, there&#x27;s a neat brush at the end of the handle, for brushing between teeth, at the gum-line.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Dentek Complete Floss is not found in too many stores, where I live, thus, amazon,com!</li>
            <li> Floss is too thin. Buy the blue picks with a wider flies.</li>
            <li> My teeth can cut through the ass of a rhino, yet the floss doesn&#x27;t fray.  I wish more products were as magical.  Top quality, fast shipping and great price!</li>
            <li> Great floss pick. They work really well on tight teeth and the floss is stronger than other brands.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite flossers, so I was very happy to find them in bulk! They do not shred or break like every other kind I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Awesome set of flossing picks.  Have a set in my truck, a set at the office and one at home.</li>
            <li> I like the pick end of the flosser, but both sides do the job pretty well. Better than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> i am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Awesome floss picks.  The don&#x27;t shred between my teeth and the pick part is awesome for removing that stubborn meat at the roots.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the second I buy this floss, very good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the end of the dental pick that makes this so great. It is teeny little &amp;#34;brushes&amp;#34; that gently clean between the teeth.  The floss is fine and strong.  I can&#x27;t find them in the local stores anymore so I stocked up with six packs of 90!  Preferred Mart, through Amazon, got them to me quickly and packaging was environmentally good.</li>
            <li> They work okay, but if you have tori the angle is a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years. Used to buy it at Meijer but they left our area. I think this is a great product and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these anymore at my drugstore. I love them. They&#x27;re more discreet than floss.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing, especially for the price. So easy to use and I haven&#x27;t broken one yet (30 days of 2x picks per day usage). Very good to keep in your desk/wallet/car.</li>
            <li> These are amazing- with other brands I seldom use one more than 2 or 3 days before they break, or pull loose from the holder. Although the floss has thinned down, I am into my 2nd week of use on my 1st pick! I am still experimenting with the tip and don&#x27;t use it everyday, but it too has remained intact.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely worthless! The floss breaks too easily and the &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; end is too flimsy to get between even widely spaced teeth. I&#x27;m having much better luck with G.U.M. flossers. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this!</li>
            <li> I thought these picks were the best thing since sliced bread, but after a recent dentist visit....not so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work okay, but are not wide and strong enough to lift the material from between your teeth. My dentist actually discourages use of these and similar picks. He suggests using regular floss or use regular floss with a plastic flosser through which you string standard floss around.</li>
            <li> Best floss I have even used.  It has three ways to floss.  Please read the directions to understand how to get the best out of this.  I go to the dentist once a year for cleaning and every time I go, the assistant(s) always compliment on the flossing and I have even had a cleaning where they did not need to floss due to the hygiene of my gums and teeth.</li>
