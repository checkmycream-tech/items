            <li>glad I got this :)</li>
            <li>You could find better makeup at the dollar store.</li>
            <li>love when the advertised product doesn&#x27;t come.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I ended up giving it away to my friend who likes it better.</li>
            <li>Seriously love this.</li>
            <li>I wish it has a mirror inside the palette but overall a great buy!</li>
            <li>my grand daughter</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and the colors palette are great.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think you will need ANY more colors, unless you are very, very fair, in which case, this may be too dark for skin tone shade concealer.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a good cheap buffing brush to use with creams and liquids and this got the job done its also very soft!!!</li>
            <li>It works really well keep you looking good for 8-10hours</li>
            <li>I really like it,the colors are good</li>
            <li>Other then that,  great product!  </li>
            <li>but it definitely works good with a foundation and the brush is a plus!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy</li>
            <li>The case is cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>This item is extremely cheap and would never buy this again.</li>
            <li>Its so soft and the pallette is good too works well to contour</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied for now;) but what can I use if colors don&#x27;t go o or blend easily????</li>
            <li>It rubs off easily and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Not a bad item</li>
            <li>Came way sooner then predicted the colors are very pigmented and smooth and blend able and the brush is incredibly soft</li>
            <li>but there is a distinct chemical smell, almost like a burnt plastic smell.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t think this is good for an every day full face because it does feel quite heavy</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, no weird smells and nothing damaged or melted.</li>
            <li>but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>If any of you have bought the BH Cosmetics eyeshadow pallettes, know that this is SMALLER in size than those - which I love.</li>
            <li>Fiance absolutely loves it</li>
            <li>I really like and would buy it again</li>
            <li>Cheap the only good thin was the brush.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY reccomend</li>
            <li>Was super excited to use this :/</li>
            <li>this is worth a try especially if you&#x27;re a beginner at contouring</li>
            <li>By playing around with the colors, I was able yo totally cover up my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>The brush is SO soft and it doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t stick and hard to blend as it comes off easily.</li>
            <li>Although I would recommend getting a different brush cause the one that comes with it is very soft</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I wish it came with a guide to help with the different colors such as the pink, and blue.</li>
            <li> The only words that describe this product are &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;cheap plastic.&amp;#34; The brush was missing.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, first there&#x27;s hardly anynproduvt in the wells, second the hair started falling out of the brush after the first use.</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s a little pasty.</li>
            <li> i use it everyday</li>
            <li> Not to heavy , creammyy but not to oily , must have!</li>
            <li> N don&#x27;t buy it not good at all.</li>
            <li> Ill give it another chance.</li>

            <li> I wish it came with a guide to help with the different colors such as the pink, and blue. Other then that,  great product!  I love the brush!!</li>
            <li> I love the brush. Its so soft and the pallette is good too works well to contour just haven&#x27;t figured out what the blues for I use the punk for blush nice color for blush.</li>

            <li> Love it i use it everyday</li>
            <li> so this as a foundation cream type thing is a no go but it definitely works good with a foundation and the brush is a plus! I had been looking for a good cheap buffing brush to use with creams and liquids and this got the job done its also very soft!!! this is worth a try especially if you&#x27;re a beginner at contouring this is really cheap and works pretty good ! but i don&#x27;t think this is good for an every day full face because it does feel quite heavy also recommend using a setting powder! well hope this helps someone!!</li>
            <li> Hate it. Cheap the only good thin was the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied for now;) but what can I use if colors don&#x27;t go o or blend easily???? Lotion? Oil?</li>
            <li> The only words that describe this product are &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;cheap plastic.&amp;#34; The brush was missing. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in the foundation but there is a distinct chemical smell, almost like a burnt plastic smell. The &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; does not conceal. There is a tint in the cream but the cream has no adhering qualities. It rubs off easily and fades quickly. The case is cheap plastic. Don&#x27;t buy this. There&#x27;s no getting a refund from these people because it&#x27;s a third-party seller from the place that doesn&#x27;t believe in refunds: China.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> glad I got this :)&lt;br /&gt;this is a good concealer for my contour.&lt;br /&gt;came in good condition no smells or melts. tyvm</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this!!! You could find better makeup at the dollar store. Mine didn&#x27;t even come with a brush...love when the advertised product doesn&#x27;t come.</li>
            <li> The colors blend okay I guess but it&#x27;s a little pasty.</li>
            <li> good for make up begginers</li>
            <li> Came way sooner then predicted the colors are very pigmented and smooth and blend able and the brush is incredibly soft</li>
            <li> Love love love it! And the brush is awesome as well</li>
            <li> Very thin and flimsy compact, the brush loses hair at each use, cheap dollar store makeup and it took FOREVER to arrive, wont make that mistake again,..</li>
            <li> I know its cream concealer, but it just felt so oily on my skin... I didn&#x27;t like it at all. I ended up giving it away to my friend who likes it better. I don&#x27;t know if she uses it often though. All I know is that it was super oily, not very pigmented, and hard to spread.</li>
            <li> I love it! The brush is very soft and the colors palette are great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cake up works great and my skin is very light and it matches perfectly</li>
            <li> This item is extremely cheap and would never buy this again. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, first there&#x27;s hardly anynproduvt in the wells, second the hair started falling out of the brush after the first use. Was super excited to use this :/</li>
            <li> This is nice I really like it,the colors are good</li>
            <li> I really like and would buy it again</li>
            <li> It took forever to get here but it works pretty well. Although I would recommend getting a different brush cause the one that comes with it is very soft</li>
            <li> This is a lovely concealer palette! If any of you have bought the BH Cosmetics eyeshadow pallettes, know that this is SMALLER in size than those - which I love. It is a perfect size to carry around! Seriously love this. The brush is SO soft and it doesn&#x27;t shed. The concealers apply sheerly-- but can be built up in pigmentation. I honestly don&#x27;t think you will need ANY more colors, unless you are very, very fair, in which case, this may be too dark for skin tone shade concealer. I HIGHLY reccomend</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! Not a bad item</li>
            <li> Very nice . Not to heavy , creammyy but not to oily , must have!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, no weird smells and nothing damaged or melted. I wish it has a mirror inside the palette but overall a great buy!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t buy this 4 me I got this 4 my grand daughter 2 use she said that she need it 4 her face she choose this color 4 her face she likes it she use it every morning before she go 2 school she use it as make up base on her face</li>
            <li> Plz save ur money!! N don&#x27;t buy it not good at all.</li>
            <li> By playing around with the colors, I was able yo totally cover up my dark circles.  Love this</li>
