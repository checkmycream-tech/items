            <li>Good value for the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with how inexpensive they are but how does that help when now I just need to buy more?  </li>
            <li>Great price and comfortable</li>
            <li>Nice for the trial.</li>
            <li>These are nice sleep masks.</li>
            <li>Was very excited at first for this seemingly good buy!  </li>
            <li>My granddaughters love to use them as well.  </li>
            <li>Good fit and blocked out light.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve received the merchandise, most of them broke within two wears.  </li>
            <li>Quantity really is better than quality when you can never find a damn sleep mask.  </li>
            <li>More disposable type</li>
            <li>Best part is, around the nose where there is normally a gap which allows light to seep in, there is a flap which blocks the light.</li>
            <li>shipped quicker than i expected and was great in my goodie bags!</li>
            <li>these are the most comfortable sleep masks i have worn.  </li>
            <li>does well with keeping the light out and letting me sleep in</li>
            <li>and they block out any light</li>
            <li>They do have light order from material, but im sure they just need to be aired out.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality, exactly what you would expect for the money.</li>
            <li>They also shipped out very fast too!</li>
            <li>I bought these for myself and overall it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li>very lightweight and keeps the light out.  </li>
            <li>Took about 3-4 weeks for delivery, but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>OK, but expected better</li>
            <li>but the other 9 were and are still good.</li>
            <li>when they first arrived i took one out of the ziplock bag</li>
            <li>Be aware that if you order these they will take four plus weeks to arrive.  </li>
            <li>They smell pretty plasticky when they first come out.  </li>
            <li>Got exactly what was advertised in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>I use two at a time typically to get better peripheral blockage of light.  </li>
            <li>You can gently tug them and the straps will come right off.</li>
            <li>These are so simple and inexpensive and really do help me sleep better.  </li>
            <li>Simple inexpensive eye masks Good for the cost, but not high quality.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these blindfolds!</li>
            <li>Fortunately I could bleach the stains out of the white pillow cases and sheet.  </li>
            <li>They feel better than the other ones I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several more, all with the same result ...</li>
            <li>just make sure to buy a few and not just one mask.  </li>
            <li>When I tried them on, there was light leak not only around the edges, but through the weave of the actual fabric.  </li>
            <li>However, after the first use the dye had bled all over my white pillow cases.  </li>
            <li>When ordered I was actually expecting a much inferior product.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>not solid enough, lets a little light through</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> These are so simple and inexpensive and really do help me sleep better.  My granddaughters love to use them as well.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent deal--best price you&#x27;ll find on eyeshades!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. If you are going to use these for sports games, you need two eye covers (one over the eyes, and one over the nose) and it will work well.</li>
            <li> Took longer than expected to arrive, but they are what I needed and can use them moving forward.</li>
            <li> Great price and comfortable</li>
            <li> shipped quicker than i expected and was great in my goodie bags! does well with keeping the light out and letting me sleep in</li>
            <li> Awesome price. Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The price for these was excellent.  They aren&#x27;t very thick, which I didn&#x27;t expect to matter.  When I tried them on, there was light leak not only around the edges, but through the weave of the actual fabric.  You had one job, eye shades.  One job!</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself and overall it&#x27;s pretty good HOWEVER when they first arrived i took one out of the ziplock bag it came in and it immediately broke before it was half way out and i thought...oh boy.. but the other 9 were and are still good. They feel better than the other ones I&#x27;ve bought. They don&#x27;t feel like paper! But they don&#x27;t feel like silk, get it? Its good though. I&#x27;d get it again.</li>
            <li> these are the most comfortable sleep masks i have worn.  very lightweight and keeps the light out.  the only issue is that occasionally the strap will break, but at this price who cares.  i still give it 4 stars.  just make sure to buy a few and not just one mask.  i just stocked up and am good to go.</li>
            <li> came weeks earlier than expected. They do have light order from material, but im sure they just need to be aired out. Good fit and blocked out light.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality, exactly what you would expect for the money.</li>
            <li> These make for very nice blindfolds! We used these for a Charity &amp;#34;Blind Miniature Golf Tournament&amp;#34;! For the price they simply can not be beat! They also shipped out very fast too! I highly recommend these blindfolds! ***** Indeed!</li>
            <li> How can you beat the price?  Took about 3-4 weeks for delivery, but it was worth it.  I will buy these again, assuming I wear out, or the dog chews, all ten!</li>
            <li> A great deal!  They come out to be less that .40 cents per mask.</li>
            <li> Be aware that if you order these they will take four plus weeks to arrive.  I didn&#x27;t realize that when I ordered them and have a time frame I need them within that won&#x27;t be met now so I have to figure something else out.  I&#x27;m happy with how inexpensive they are but how does that help when now I just need to buy more?  If you have time to wait then do.  If you don&#x27;t have a month to wait look for another brand</li>
            <li> works great for therapy. would recommend.</li>
            <li> Was very excited at first for this seemingly good buy!  However, after the first use the dye had bled all over my white pillow cases.  I&#x27;ve used several more, all with the same result ... Fortunately I could bleach the stains out of the white pillow cases and sheet.  Although none rubbed off on my face that I could tell, my next obvious concern was whatever toxic effect this dye would have on my eye lids, skin.... SO, I&#x27;ve tossed them.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.  A little thin - light comes through just a bit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s. OK, but expected better</li>
            <li> not solid enough, lets a little light through</li>
            <li> Poor product.  Since I&#x27;ve received the merchandise, most of them broke within two wears.  No, my head is not big...it&#x27;s just poorly made.  You can gently tug them and the straps will come right off.</li>
            <li> They smell pretty plasticky when they first come out.  You should probably air them out.  I use two at a time typically to get better peripheral blockage of light.  Quantity really is better than quality when you can never find a damn sleep mask.  They are like socks.</li>
            <li> Nice for the trial. I have got it for my family so that they can try and see the benefits of eye mask. Although these are not durable.</li>
            <li> I travel internationally and use them on the plane or in a hotel.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what was advertised in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> the seller got them to me earlyer then the estimated shipping time and i had used sleeping masks before but they always came off as i was sleeping im so happy that doesent happen with these and they block out any light im so happy with these !!!!</li>
            <li> These are nice sleep masks. When ordered I was actually expecting a much inferior product. Best part is, around the nose where there is normally a gap which allows light to seep in, there is a flap which blocks the light. Definitely excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li> Simple inexpensive eye masks Good for the cost, but not high quality.  More disposable type</li>
