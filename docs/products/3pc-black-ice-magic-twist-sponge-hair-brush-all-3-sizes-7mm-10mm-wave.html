            <li>This sponge is nice for the hair.you would achieve the look</li>
            <li>Very good product and shipping was fast</li>
            <li>The best thing about these twist brushes are they don&#x27;t make flakes or break down, good quality.</li>
            <li>Even so, I am very happy cosidering the price difference and the fact you get three different brushes.</li>
            <li>I would for sure purchase this product again</li>
            <li>Consistency and patience will give you a cute look.  </li>
            <li>The twist look stunning.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for!ðŸ‘</li>
            <li>Seem to work better.</li>
            <li>I love it and it is easy to do.</li>
            <li>but it works overall really good and good quality</li>
            <li>Great product super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Before this I bought the original Nudged for $35 bucks plus shipping.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nothing super glue can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>Great products by Black Ice, and a better deal to just go ahead and purchase the 3 pack combo in my opinion since the sponges normally go for $7.99-$9.99 per sponge brush.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for several hair types, and textures, and I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to add a bit a depth to their natural hair.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is the foam piece that has the Magic Twist logo.</li>
            <li>direction on how to use the twist sponge were on the box and it was very simple and easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One sponge, I really like the effect</li>
            <li>The quality of the brush is better than I expected, although not as durable as Nudred.</li>
            <li>I love this product and works as expected.</li>
            <li>Only needs a light circular motion to coil up the curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s apparent that it is super glued on and seems to be peeling off just with one use.</li>
            <li>They give texture to his natural hair style and help bring out his natural curls...</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting my natural cut every month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had numerous complements, even my sister, who is very conservative and not into wearing short naturals or braids.</li>
            <li>It only takes a couple of rotating soft rolls over my hair with the hair sponge.</li>
            <li>Along with the sponge i use conditioner, curling gel, and pink lotion as this keeps the curl all day, especially when it&#x27;s hot outside.</li>

            <li> Definitely twists my hair in the way I expected.</li>
            <li> I like the twist brushes from Black Ice Sponges because they do not shed in my hair like the bigger one from another company.</li>
            <li> I have course and rough hair</li>
            <li> You can curl your hair dry or slightly damp in my experience.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that the material of the sponge is slightly tearing apart but not enough that I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I gave the other two away and kept one for myself.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a quick thing.  </li>
            <li> I still think the material could be a little firmer for people who have thick, course, and rough hair.</li>
            <li> I use these almost everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little skeptical of the quality but decided to try this collection since all three brushes cost less than Nudred, and might offer different styles.</li>
            <li> and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>

            <li> now these are truly awesome. each one does a different thing to my short hair. and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>

            <li> I purchase this item and easy to use and my hair looks great</li>
            <li> Awesome just need a the hell to make it work the right way.... Make a package with the gel</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband and he loves them! They give texture to his natural hair style and help bring out his natural curls...</li>
            <li> Great variety and value. The best thing about these twist brushes are they don&#x27;t make flakes or break down, good quality.</li>
            <li> worked great. I would for sure purchase this product again</li>
            <li> I like the twist brushes from Black Ice Sponges because they do not shed in my hair like the bigger one from another company. I have course and rough hair and I needed a product that was sturdy enough for my hair. I still think the material could be a little firmer for people who have thick, course, and rough hair.</li>
            <li> I love what they do to my salt  n pepper hair!</li>
            <li> very good products. I have introduced them to my next generation.</li>
            <li> I tried several of these twist brushes, and out of the ones that I tried - I truly like the versatility of this product. This is a great product for several hair types, and textures, and I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to add a bit a depth to their natural hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son and he loved it! Works great. Good price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and Service</li>
            <li> My son loves this product.</li>
            <li> Great and easy to use</li>
            <li> This sponge is nice for the hair.you would achieve the look your going for.each one gives a different curl pattern.</li>
            <li> Very good product and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> The sponges definitely work; however, it takes about 20 minutes for my texture hair - it&#x27;s not a quick thing.  Consistency and patience will give you a cute look.  The different sponges give you a slightly different look depending on the length of your car.</li>
            <li> I use these almost everyday. Love them!</li>
            <li> Worked so well I recommended this product to friends and co-workers.</li>
            <li> Great my mom loves it!</li>
            <li> Great product! Definitely twists my hair in the way I expected. The only downfall is the foam piece that has the Magic Twist logo. It&#x27;s apparent that it is super glued on and seems to be peeling off just with one use. However, I am only seeing this on one of the sponges and it&#x27;s nothing super glue can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> This gives my hair a different textured look. I love it and it is easy to do.</li>
            <li> My twist sponges were delivered on schedule within the time frame specified.&lt;br /&gt;The direction on how to use the twist sponge were on the box and it was very simple and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks amazing. I&#x27;ve had numerous complements, even my sister, who is very conservative and not into wearing short naturals or braids. She immediately said my hair looked amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting my natural cut every month. The twist sponge works on long or short Afros. This simple product will save me lots of time when shaping my hair. It only takes a couple of rotating soft rolls over my hair with the hair sponge. I always wanted to try wearing hair twist. The twist look stunning. How could I have lived without this simple product. It&#x27;s a must have for women or men. I&#x27;m elated.</li>
            <li> Great product super fast shipping. What more could I ask for!ðŸ‘</li>
            <li> Great sponge but they sent me two of the same sponge but it works overall really good and good quality</li>
            <li> Did what it said it would do. I prefer the sponges with the holes over the ones with ridges. Seem to work better. Only needs a light circular motion to coil up the curls.</li>
