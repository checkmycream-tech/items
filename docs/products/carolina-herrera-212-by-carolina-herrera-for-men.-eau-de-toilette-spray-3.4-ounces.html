            <li>that&#x27;s kind of why I have a large selection of cologne.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as from macy&#x27;s, smell is muted but original.</li>
            <li>Bought this fantastic smelling cologne</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT</li>
            <li>That means you have got a genuine 212 Men.     </li>
            <li>Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li>arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
            <li>This is the genuine thing.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd bottle and it is great.</li>
            <li>Although Amazon&#x27;s support is great when dealing with such scenarios.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet or too strong.</li>
            <li>amazing.,....not my last order for sure!!</li>
            <li>Feels very fresh during any season.</li>
            <li>The magnetic cap is very nice as well, same with the packaging.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>this is not an original version</li>
            <li>I purchased this originally for my husband</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t original</li>
            <li>Buy 212 Men without the NYC on the box to get the original scent.</li>
            <li>Great perfume, I have been using it for a very long time, probably changed 4th bottle already:-).&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me, to be honest, this actually smells more like antiperspirant than cologne.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t already know this smell is ever so slightly sweet and has a smooth cool flavor to it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance reminds of clean cut grass.</li>
            <li>,,,what was even better was the free really fast delivery ...</li>
            <li>, THE BOTTLE IS A BEAUTIFUL GREY CYLINDER WITH AN EXCITING MAGNETIC CAP, THE WORD &amp;#34;MEN&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really liked this product, the smell keeps over my body across the whole day long and it feels really good</li>
            <li>,it is already full but l can&#x27;t spray it with some reason.pls help to replays</li>
            <li>This is just ok, I really wanted to like this with all the hype I have seen but just doesnt do it for me.  </li>
            <li>It is like the bottle is full of water and because of the the return restrictions I am stuck with a 54.00 bottle of something that smells like water</li>
            <li>Nevertheless the cologne is still really good and smells the same as the testers.</li>
            <li>Kind of an old cologne  </li>
            <li>The bottle looks cool and the cap is magnetic</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents and my girlfriend absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>everything was ok,  fast ....</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>its  authentic, the bar code matches with the box..which can be found on the top right near the nozzle spray section inside the magnetic cap.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get a genuine, the knockoffs smell completely</li>
            <li>:) Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Very rich fragance, a classic</li>
            <li>but i am sure that i will like it , the packing was in a original box and shipped in a good hard carton ,</li>
            <li>This colonge is unlike any other smell it is excellent for a mans colonge not over powering sweet and metal mixed .</li>
            <li>you get in trouble and have to sleep on the couch lol.</li>
            <li>It smell fresh.</li>
            <li>only downfall is that it&#x27;s kind of pricey; $60.</li>
            <li>Make him come to bed wearing this and a smile</li>
            <li>I have to buy this right</li>
            <li>The top notes off this smells like fresh tangarin/oranges, then middle notes smells like peppers.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>The item shipped fast as well!</li>
            <li>You should have this one because womans really like the smell!</li>
            <li>if you married then dont wear it</li>
            <li>ok , see you the next year!</li>
            <li>I was buying this cologne when I was in Europe, so I know exactly how it smells.</li>
            <li>I am glad to have bought it because it brings me such a burst of confidence!  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this!</li>
            <li>This is a great cologne has been one of my long time favorites since I was younger.</li>
            <li>I ordered for my Love and can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li>Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Totally worth every buck, or should I say, every single penny. :)</li>
            <li>Original packaging it seems, sealed in the clear plastic still.</li>
            <li>I suspect that this product is not official , it does not have the fragrance of 212, is pure alcohol ,</li>
            <li>My girlfriend wont stop telling me how much she loves this product.</li>
            <li>l said l am ready to send the the one you sent me.thx</li>
            <li>I like so much</li>
            <li>I am very disaponited</li>
            <li>, Someone smells very good.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>so be careful not to over apply and enjoy!</li>
            <li>I really really like the fragrance..</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Alot of compliments, one girl at work really loves it when i walk by her and even at the dentist office i have had</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot</li>
            <li>When he opened it, his response was, &amp;#34;You know how much cucaloo I can get with this?!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Really crappy.</li>
            <li>I am really pissed off .</li>
            <li>: Please make sure when you buy online that your box (bottom) has an engraved serial number and the same serial number should be on the bottle neck, near the sprayer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily, the owner was nice enough to give me a discount and when he did, there was no turning back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fresh and mysterious smell with wood undertones.</li>
            <li>You never go wrong with Carolina Herrera, very nice traditional perfume , I just love</li>
            <li>The first time i bought this was in New York&lt;br</li>
            <li>My other favorite is Kenneth cole Reaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whether you use it for special occasions or in a daily basis, this perfume with exceed your expectations.</li>
            <li>Was surprised when I found this on Amazon as I hadn&#x27;t used this in a few years, forgot how much I enjoyed the scent!</li>
            <li>but if you like citric and sweet fragrances this one is very likely to be one of your favorites.</li>
            <li>It had too much of a black pepper smell to it which sort of gave me a headache throughout the day and was overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Classic 212 for me</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I boult this product because of the the high reviews .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The new formulation simply  doesn&#x27;t last more than two hours on the skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne mainly based on reviews, figured I would try something new.</li>
            <li>i love it, and the scent last all day long, my friend wear it every day even to work.</li>
            <li>It is pretty much the only one i wear now.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great scent that&#x27;s both masculine yet subtle and scintillating.</li>
            <li>I get the feeling to get a new one....</li>
            <li>I would say it works well for young and older men.</li>
            <li>Fragrance doesn&#x27;t smell quite as strong or last as long as the bottle I am replacing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous other&#x27;s including Kenneth Cole&#x27;s &amp;#34;BLACK&amp;#34;, Ralph Lauren&#x27;s &amp;#34;Romance&amp;#34;, and many others.  </li>
            <li>This Fragance just last 2 or 3 hours as much!</li>
            <li>From a mother&#x27;s perspective: I asked that he use it sparingly as I thought the scent a little strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid more for less with the same product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cleaner than clean, smoother than smooth and subtle enough not to over power the smeller&#x27;s nostrils.</li>
            <li>it stays long and it is very modern and manly.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>did notice that the testers in various retailers were much stronger and lasted longer than the one I received from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple, musky, woodsy smell once it settles in, but it really lasts.  </li>
            <li>in recent years has actually dropped to my second favorite cologne though, only to be surpassed by Kenneth Cole Reaction, check that out if you like this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle yet sexy.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s exactly what you get with this cologne, so much so that I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li>THIS PERFUME FOLLOWS THE STYLE OF THE NEW YORK CITY, A COSMOPOLITAN YOUNG FRAGANCE</li>
            <li>I usually wear Armani Code, Polo Black, Dunhill Desire, etc..., but I may have another favorite now!</li>
            <li>i tried to return the package ( i just wanted to refuse the box since I had not opened it), but apparently they can ship &amp;#34;flammable objects&amp;#34; but you can&#x27;t return them.</li>
            <li>the Fragrance is gone, the other one that i bough in NY was not lasting either but was a little more than this&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>However, just like all of the colognes in this website, it has been altered since the scent only last a short time and its not true to the original.</li>
            <li>you are not sure what collogne to buy or if you are ready for something new, then this is your next item to purchase.</li>
            <li>This a cologne that last all day long and its worth the price and time just a few sprays and its stays .</li>

            <li> This is the genuine thing.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle and it is great.</li>
            <li> Although Amazon&#x27;s support is great when dealing with such scenarios.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet or too strong.</li>
            <li> amazing.,....not my last order for sure!!</li>
            <li> Feels very fresh during any season.</li>
            <li> The magnetic cap is very nice as well, same with the packaging.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> this is not an original version</li>
            <li> I purchased this originally for my husband</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t original</li>
            <li> Buy 212 Men without the NYC on the box to get the original scent.</li>
            <li> Great perfume, I have been using it for a very long time, probably changed 4th bottle already:-).&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me, to be honest, this actually smells more like antiperspirant than cologne.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t already know this smell is ever so slightly sweet and has a smooth cool flavor to it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance reminds of clean cut grass.</li>
            <li> ,,,what was even better was the free really fast delivery ...</li>
            <li> , THE BOTTLE IS A BEAUTIFUL GREY CYLINDER WITH AN EXCITING MAGNETIC CAP, THE WORD &amp;#34;MEN&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, the smell keeps over my body across the whole day long and it feels really good</li>
            <li> ,it is already full but l can&#x27;t spray it with some reason.pls help to replays</li>
            <li> This is just ok, I really wanted to like this with all the hype I have seen but just doesnt do it for me.  </li>
            <li> It is like the bottle is full of water and because of the the return restrictions I am stuck with a 54.00 bottle of something that smells like water</li>
            <li> Nevertheless the cologne is still really good and smells the same as the testers.</li>
            <li> Kind of an old cologne  </li>
            <li> The bottle looks cool and the cap is magnetic</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents and my girlfriend absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> everything was ok,  fast ....</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> its  authentic, the bar code matches with the box..which can be found on the top right near the nozzle spray section inside the magnetic cap.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you get a genuine, the knockoffs smell completely</li>
            <li> :) Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very rich fragance, a classic</li>
            <li> but i am sure that i will like it , the packing was in a original box and shipped in a good hard carton ,</li>
            <li> This colonge is unlike any other smell it is excellent for a mans colonge not over powering sweet and metal mixed .</li>
            <li> you get in trouble and have to sleep on the couch lol.</li>
            <li> It smell fresh.</li>
            <li> only downfall is that it&#x27;s kind of pricey; $60.</li>
            <li> Make him come to bed wearing this and a smile</li>
            <li> I have to buy this right</li>
            <li> The top notes off this smells like fresh tangarin/oranges, then middle notes smells like peppers.</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> The item shipped fast as well!</li>
            <li> You should have this one because womans really like the smell!</li>
            <li> if you married then dont wear it</li>
            <li> ok , see you the next year!</li>
            <li> I was buying this cologne when I was in Europe, so I know exactly how it smells.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this!</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne has been one of my long time favorites since I was younger.</li>
            <li> I ordered for my Love and can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Totally worth every buck, or should I say, every single penny. :)</li>
            <li> Original packaging it seems, sealed in the clear plastic still.</li>
            <li> I suspect that this product is not official , it does not have the fragrance of 212, is pure alcohol ,</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wont stop telling me how much she loves this product.</li>
            <li> l said l am ready to send the the one you sent me.thx</li>
            <li> I like so much</li>
            <li> I am very disaponited</li>
            <li> , Someone smells very good.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> so be careful not to over apply and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I really really like the fragrance..</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Alot of compliments, one girl at work really loves it when i walk by her and even at the dentist office i have had</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> When he opened it, his response was, &amp;#34;You know how much cucaloo I can get with this?!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Really crappy.</li>
            <li> I am really pissed off .</li>
            <li> : Please make sure when you buy online that your box (bottom) has an engraved serial number and the same serial number should be on the bottle neck, near the sprayer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily, the owner was nice enough to give me a discount and when he did, there was no turning back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very fresh and mysterious smell with wood undertones.</li>
            <li> You never go wrong with Carolina Herrera, very nice traditional perfume , I just love</li>
            <li> The first time i bought this was in New York&lt;br</li>
            <li> My other favorite is Kenneth cole Reaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether you use it for special occasions or in a daily basis, this perfume with exceed your expectations.</li>
            <li> Was surprised when I found this on Amazon as I hadn&#x27;t used this in a few years, forgot how much I enjoyed the scent!</li>
            <li> but if you like citric and sweet fragrances this one is very likely to be one of your favorites.</li>
            <li> It had too much of a black pepper smell to it which sort of gave me a headache throughout the day and was overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Classic 212 for me</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I boult this product because of the the high reviews .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The new formulation simply  doesn&#x27;t last more than two hours on the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne mainly based on reviews, figured I would try something new.</li>
            <li> i love it, and the scent last all day long, my friend wear it every day even to work.</li>
            <li> It is pretty much the only one i wear now.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great scent that&#x27;s both masculine yet subtle and scintillating.</li>
            <li> I get the feeling to get a new one....</li>
            <li> I would say it works well for young and older men.</li>
            <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t smell quite as strong or last as long as the bottle I am replacing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous other&#x27;s including Kenneth Cole&#x27;s &amp;#34;BLACK&amp;#34;, Ralph Lauren&#x27;s &amp;#34;Romance&amp;#34;, and many others.  </li>
            <li> This Fragance just last 2 or 3 hours as much!</li>
            <li> From a mother&#x27;s perspective: I asked that he use it sparingly as I thought the scent a little strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid more for less with the same product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cleaner than clean, smoother than smooth and subtle enough not to over power the smeller&#x27;s nostrils.</li>
            <li> it stays long and it is very modern and manly.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> did notice that the testers in various retailers were much stronger and lasted longer than the one I received from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple, musky, woodsy smell once it settles in, but it really lasts.  </li>
            <li> in recent years has actually dropped to my second favorite cologne though, only to be surpassed by Kenneth Cole Reaction, check that out if you like this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle yet sexy.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s exactly what you get with this cologne, so much so that I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME FOLLOWS THE STYLE OF THE NEW YORK CITY, A COSMOPOLITAN YOUNG FRAGANCE</li>
            <li> I usually wear Armani Code, Polo Black, Dunhill Desire, etc..., but I may have another favorite now!</li>
            <li> i tried to return the package ( i just wanted to refuse the box since I had not opened it), but apparently they can ship &amp;#34;flammable objects&amp;#34; but you can&#x27;t return them.</li>
            <li> the Fragrance is gone, the other one that i bough in NY was not lasting either but was a little more than this&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> However, just like all of the colognes in this website, it has been altered since the scent only last a short time and its not true to the original.</li>
            <li> you are not sure what collogne to buy or if you are ready for something new, then this is your next item to purchase.</li>
            <li> This a cologne that last all day long and its worth the price and time just a few sprays and its stays .</li>
            <li> Single, dating, married, confused, straight, lesbian, short, tall, skinny, fat, transgender, it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> The base note is fantastic, clean musky and woody vetiver fragrance.    </li>
            <li> This is my first cologne as I am only in my late teens.  </li>
            <li> 5 star for smell and very long lasting</li>
            <li> I have been using this for past 3 years and every time I open a new pack</li>
            <li> And you need to be ready to fight off the jealous suckers who AREN&#x27;T wearing this s</li>
            <li> Long lasting and smells as expected</li>
            <li> Anyway a fragrance is a very personal thing but off the previous strength of my multiple Dots purchase i got this and</li>
            <li> however it also cause a lot of trouble for e.g my wife and i went out to hilton private lounge area for private dinning</li>
            <li> Take my advice if you single then</li>
            <li> Not very much to say about it...</li>
            <li> a random gal said I smelt great and wanted to do the dirty...</li>
            <li> Online worked for me on this, be careful which store you buy from.</li>
            <li> I have zero regrets.</li>
            <li> The product dries down to an incense musk scent that later becomes heavy.  </li>
            <li> , a little goes a long ways</li>
            <li> Although not my favourite i wear it for one reason i like the attention i get from other ladies.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it as well as some other ladies I know.  </li>
            <li> Top notes are spices, petit grain, lavender, green notes, grapefruit and bergamot; middle notes are ginger, green pepper, gardenia, violet and sage; base notes are labdanum, sandalwood, musk, guaiac wood, vetiver and incense.     </li>
            <li> It is definitely for casual or club use, not for the office or a formal event and definitely not for church services or weddings.  </li>
            <li> Got a little shot of it from a friend</li>
            <li> A woody floral musk scented with green notes, spices, ginger and grapefruit.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you about this trouble in a bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands everyday cologne.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I like how the product wears long-term.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it for dating.</li>
            <li> No more to say. . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I used to wear it in the past and now that I am using it again</li>
            <li> Not sure if its the 212</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very humble guy</li>
            <li> Using this in conjunction with the showering gel/aftershave and your one hard guy not to compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if I was 3 years late on it.  </li>
            <li> Have been wearing it for at least 10 years now.</li>
            <li> i mean she paid for it</li>
            <li> mean while my wife knew i didnt ordered it</li>
            <li> Macy&#x27;s stopped selling them and Sephora&#x27;s prices are ridiculous.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it was not original  .</li>
            <li> I usually wear this cologne when I go out at night, and will wear it during the day if i know ill be out and</li>
            <li> not happy about that.</li>
            <li> My wife turned to me annoyed</li>
            <li> Needless to say that I bought him a replacement but</li>
            <li> is that wrong?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an awesome collogne. My girlfriend wont stop telling me how much she loves this product. Girls i meet give me compliments.if you are not sure what collogne to buy or if you are ready for something new, then this is your next item to purchase.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and seller.</li>
            <li> hello good night thanks for your service 100 % good deal makers recommend them thank you</li>
            <li> Long lasting and smells as expected</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i feel that it lacks odor i feel is more alcohol and you do not stay all day with the smell of the scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t Know if Carolina Herrera changed the formula o this is not an original version</li>
            <li> I love the magnetic cap and design of the bottle.  The scent starts out floral, with gardenia, grapefruit, and garden scents.  The product dries down to an incense musk scent that later becomes heavy.  I am not sure I like how the product wears long-term.  To me, to be honest, this actually smells more like antiperspirant than cologne.  It is definitely for casual or club use, not for the office or a formal event and definitely not for church services or weddings.  Goes good with jeans and polo shirts or tee shirts.  It is definitely not my signature scent.  For me it is too linear and metallic.  Would I purchase this one again?  Maybe.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Father for Christmas.  He and my Mother love it.  I usually wear Armani Code, Polo Black, Dunhill Desire, etc..., but I may have another favorite now!</li>
            <li> 5 star for smell and very long lasting</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s exactly what you get with this cologne, so much so that I wear it everyday. It&#x27;s cleaner than clean, smoother than smooth and subtle enough not to over power the smeller&#x27;s nostrils. For lack of better words this thing is THE BOMB!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go get it now!</li>
            <li> Carolina is a great fragrance for men, totally recommended, it is my favorite fragrance with Bulgary, both are excellent choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
            <li> This is an awesome collogne. I have bought it so many times already. Women always compliment it a lot when I am wearing it. This one IS a women hunter ! :) Highly recommended. Try it, you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> It was a great gift, he loves it!!</li>
            <li> deserves 2 thumbs up. love the captivating scents....it&#x27;s like  potpurri for the senses.....definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great scent that&#x27;s both masculine yet subtle and scintillating.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best fragrance for men.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous other&#x27;s including Kenneth Cole&#x27;s &amp;#34;BLACK&amp;#34;, Ralph Lauren&#x27;s &amp;#34;Romance&amp;#34;, and many others.  This is the most unique fragrance I&#x27;ve worn.  I constantly get asked what I&#x27;m wearing, but I&#x27;ve never told anyone what it is for fear of others going out to try and copy my swag... This stuff is excellent.</li>
            <li> Good cologne when going out at night. People comment nicely upon it</li>
            <li> I have used Men 212 for years and over the years I have had many women ask me what I was wearing</li>
            <li> 212 Men is definitely a favorite. Fresh scent, good for both day and night. Getting lots of compliments on this famous smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance I&#x27;ve been able to get, of course in terms of fragrances everithing is not objective but if you like citric and sweet fragrances this one is very likely to be one of your favorites.</li>
            <li> this cologne is off the chain. I don&#x27;t care if I was 3 years late on it.  Everyone always tells me that im killing it when I wear this</li>
            <li> Great stuff.. Love the scent, reminds me of spring.</li>
            <li> It was really great good but recently not sprying l guess there is a problem with the head l don&#x27;t know why.l can return the item l don&#x27;t mind coz,it is already full but l can&#x27;t spray it with some reason.pls help to replays it.as l said l am ready to send the the one you sent me.thx</li>
            <li> Thank you. Well done and always happy when ordering this product!!</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas present about 5 years ago. It&#x27;s the only scent I use. I receive compliments all the time!</li>
            <li> I think it is a good perfum. I gave as a gift to my sister and she loved it</li>
            <li> Personally is one of the best man lotion. I use this 5 years ago. The essence is durable all day. I like so much</li>
            <li> This is just ok, I really wanted to like this with all the hype I have seen but just doesnt do it for me.  For the price there are much better scents.</li>
            <li> Smells real good on him üòç</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I looked online for the best smelling colognes in the world and this tops em all. Props. My other favorite is Kenneth cole Reaction. The ladies die for this stuff. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Great product! This a cologne that last all day long and its worth the price and time just a few sprays and its stays .</li>
            <li> were very good my products, this again could buy more, provided the committee recommends .. the quality is awesome .. thank you very much</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift for my brother.  The scent is amazing and he gets compliments every time he wears it.  Very nice light summer scent.  The product was delivered in a timely manner and in good condition.</li>
            <li> This is one of my husband&#x27;s favorite colognes. it stays long and it is very modern and manly. After i purchased it i found a cheaper one locally. i tried to return the package ( i just wanted to refuse the box since I had not opened it), but apparently they can ship &amp;#34;flammable objects&amp;#34; but you can&#x27;t return them. not happy about that.</li>
            <li> Great! Great size for an awesome price. I&#x27;ve paid more for less with the same product. The item shipped fast as well! If you don&#x27;t already know this smell is ever so slightly sweet and has a smooth cool flavor to it.</li>
            <li> This cologne lasts all day. It&#x27;s a very fresh and mysterious smell with wood undertones. One of my favorites. The sillage(area of effect) is moderate and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re playing with fire with this delectable fragrance here.. If you wear this cologne, be warned that women WILL throw themselves at you. Single, dating, married, confused, straight, lesbian, short, tall, skinny, fat, transgender, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Women will want the D. And you need to be ready to fight off the jealous suckers who AREN&#x27;T wearing this s*** when you step up in the building. So, have a \\&quot;get in, get out\\&quot; mentality with this one gents, cause it&#x27;s gonna be one helluva ride!</li>
            <li> Great calogne! Wish they would bring back to stores!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> I boult this product because of the the high reviews . Let me tell you I am very disaponited it has no smell at all It is like the bottle is full of water and because of the the return restrictions I am stuck with a 54.00 bottle of something that smells like water .do not buy this product</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne mainly based on reviews, figured I would try something new. It was a mistake in this case, the scent was just not for me. It had too much of a black pepper smell to it which sort of gave me a headache throughout the day and was overwhelming.</li>
            <li> excelente producto recomendado</li>
            <li> Adidas Dynamic Pulse By Adidas For Men, Eau De Toilette Spray, 3.4-Ounce Bottle&lt;br /&gt;Adidas Dynamic Pulse By Adidas For Men, Eau De Toilette Spray, 3.4-Ounce Bottle&lt;br /&gt;Adidas Dynamic Pulse By Adidas For Men, Eau De Toilette Spray, 3.4-Ounce Bottle</li>
            <li> Bought this fantastic smelling cologne and I was happy to find it at such a great price. Nice bottle too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Carolina Herrera 212!!!! It smells so good... I would say it&#x27;s irresistible...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People always ask me wich perfum i am using... Perfect for using during the day... and night too...</li>
            <li> I suspect that this product is not official , it does not have the fragrance of 212, is pure alcohol , in minutes you do not feel the smell of anything</li>
            <li> The first time i bought this was in New York&lt;br /&gt;the second time here in Amazon, but i don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening but this one is not lasting after 30 minutes the Fragrance is gone, the other one that i bough in NY was not lasting either but was a little more than this&lt;br /&gt;i just compared both bottles if was the same or any difference but it seems  they are the same&lt;br /&gt;so i don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening and the fragrance is the same the only thing this one is not lasting</li>
            <li> Original packaging it seems, sealed in the clear plastic still. It&#x27;s a gift I haven&#x27;t given yet so it&#x27;s not yet opened so I can&#x27;t say further than that at this point.</li>
            <li> I smell like a man whore! And this smells great too!</li>
            <li> excellent product recommended .</li>
            <li> I aways heard about it, but didn&#x27;t know that it is so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was a great buy! I recommend.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband for Spring and Summer--just wonderful!!  A woody floral musk scented with green notes, spices, ginger and grapefruit.  I love this one!  Good sillage and longevity, too.</li>
            <li> I tried this at Sephora and loved it. Didn&#x27;t buy it there because the 1.7oz bottle was around $57. The fragrance is very fresh and clean. It will work great in Summer. I am not the type of person who follows season for fragrance, I wear 212 Men even in winter and it smells great. The fragrance reminds of clean cut grass. The top notes off this smells like fresh tangarin/oranges, then middle notes smells like peppers. The base note is fantastic, clean musky and woody vetiver fragrance.    Top notes are spices, petit grain, lavender, green notes, grapefruit and bergamot; middle notes are ginger, green pepper, gardenia, violet and sage; base notes are labdanum, sandalwood, musk, guaiac wood, vetiver and incense.     Longevity is awesome, lasts atleast 6-8 hours. Projection is great, I apply about 4 sprays (2 on neck, 1 on each wrists). Even if you do 6 sprays, it will not offend anyone.     IMPORTANT: Please make sure when you buy online that your box (bottom) has an engraved serial number and the same serial number should be on the bottle neck, near the sprayer. Both these numbers are engraved in the box and bottle. That means you have got a genuine 212 Men.     Macy&#x27;s stopped selling them and Sephora&#x27;s prices are ridiculous. Online worked for me on this, be careful which store you buy from.</li>
            <li> Thee best cologne I have ever tried. Girls seem to love this scent, and always approach me and ask what I&#x27;m wearing... worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne for my husband - cheaper price, same amazing smell!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this scent on my man!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. A fragrance of excellent quality. Good product price relationship.</li>
            <li> This spray is amazing. It smells very nice and it gets me very good compliments every time I use it. I would recommend this spray to anyone that is wanting to smell very good. I&#x27;m going to buy it again once my spray runs out because I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne! You should have this one because womans really like the smell!</li>
            <li> I recommend it arrived all well greetings from Venezuela.</li>
            <li> This is awesome! Amazing smell. Feels very fresh during any season. A Must Have for any guy! Totally love it.</li>
            <li> Love it and the price</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything like this out there! Have been wearing it for at least 10 years now. Been getting nothing but compliments.</li>
            <li> Great perfume, I have been using it for a very long time, probably changed 4th bottle already:-).&lt;br /&gt;The one I ordered this time was of same quality I used to.</li>
            <li> It has a delicious smell. I recommend it</li>
            <li> I love this cologne!!!  I purchased this originally for my husband but then I changed my mind and I used it instead. Needless to say that I bought him a replacement but he still wanted mine...</li>
            <li> Very good product. It was good to buy it. It has a good price and an excellent smell. I recommend it</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. Our favorite.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne after testing it out. I was very impressed with the scent, smells very good, but not too potent, as well as lasts all day. I constantly had people saying, \\&quot;Wow, Someone smells very good.\\&quot; The magnetic cap is very nice as well, same with the packaging. 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> After some time I cannot perceive the odor, I don&#x27;t know if I got used to it or it just faded away...</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described. Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li> Great seller. Recommended 100%</li>
            <li> Awesome calogne, I love it. It has a very elegant touch to it. I highly recommend it. I would say it works well for young and older men.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Most women they like it. I usually use it for dating. It smell fresh. This is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Excellent shoes really happy with what I buy</li>
            <li> Let me tell you about this trouble in a bottle. This colonge is unlike any other smell it is excellent for a mans colonge not over powering sweet and metal mixed . Although not my favourite i wear it for one reason i like the attention i get from other ladies. This is what i used to get my wife however it also cause a lot of trouble for e.g my wife and i went out to hilton private lounge area for private dinning i went to get some food and a waitress came over and sniff my neck and ask &amp;#34; is that 212? Gazing me in the eyes i was saying what the heck shes got to see my wedding ring any way i went to my seat and the waitress bought a drink for me i mean she paid for it brought it across to my table in front of my wife mean while my wife knew i didnt ordered it so i said that was nice of her. My wife turned to me annoyed lol dont let me see u wearing that colonge again lol. She said that b.....h is disrespectful lol. Take my advice if you single then this is will get you a woman they put something in this if you married then dont wear it you get in trouble and have to sleep on the couch lol.</li>
            <li> I love this product.. Now, all the girls love me! jaja, very thanks my friends, that&#x27;s very fine! ok , see you the next year!</li>
            <li> Very good item , until now i did not try the fragance but i am sure that i will like it , the packing was in a original box and shipped in a good hard carton ,</li>
            <li> This is a nice fragrance to my nostrils. I know I should be wearing this for the ladies which I do but I like it too......is that wrong? Anyway a fragrance is a very personal thing but off the previous strength of my multiple Dots purchase i got this and man do I love it and think you will too, a little goes a long ways so be careful not to over apply and enjoy!</li>
            <li> i love it, and the scent last all day long, my friend wear it every day even to work. two thumbs up for 212 for men.</li>
            <li> excelent 100% + + + + +</li>

            <li> Awesomeness in a bottle! My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is so good!!!  My wife loves it as well as some other ladies I know.  I get lots of compliments .</li>

            <li> excellent choise. Great fragance for men. i recomend it. No more to say. . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I love this product from CH. I always trust Amazon has done good research and quality checks before it lists those products on their website. This product meets those quality checks. I really really like the fragrance..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that the testers in various retailers were much stronger and lasted longer than the one I received from Amazon. Nevertheless the cologne is still really good and smells the same as the testers.</li>
            <li> I was buying this cologne when I was in Europe, so I know exactly how it smells. This is the genuine thing. Kind of an old cologne  but I like it.</li>
            <li> You will love this, I always get compliments</li>
            <li> i just started collecting colognes/ perfumes, ...and this is way up there in the list.,...very good fresh flowery type scent ....i love it. its  authentic, the bar code matches with the box..which can be found on the top right near the nozzle spray section inside the magnetic cap.,,,what was even better was the free really fast delivery ...i placed my order on o5/08/13 morning and got my order the very next morning....thats amazing when you conceder it was free!!...amazing.,....not my last order for sure!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.. my girlfriend love it too!</li>
            <li> I bought mine at a nearby mall after smelling 10-15 different brands of cologne samples. That being said, the moment when I smelled the sample for this, I instantly thought, \\&quot;Mabye I should buy this.. Wait, no. I have to buy this right now!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, the owner was nice enough to give me a discount and when he did, there was no turning back. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is really nice; if you like the scent of oranges then that&#x27;s a plus. The bottle looks cool and the cap is magnetic so it&#x27;s easy to close whenever you&#x27;re done using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is that it&#x27;s kind of pricey; $60. But I guarantee you that you&#x27;ll feel extremely satisfied after buying it. Totally worth every buck, or should I say, every single penny. :)</li>
            <li> This a great product, i&#x27;m very happy with it.I &#x27;ll go bay again. This fragrance is delicious. That is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very humble guy but you have to love it when people compliment you because of your good scent, even guys.</li>
            <li> This is my first cologne as I am only in my late teens.  I am glad to have bought it because it brings me such a burst of confidence!  It&#x27;s a simple, musky, woodsy smell once it settles in, but it really lasts.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for past 3 years and every time I open a new pack I get the feeling to get a new one....</li>
            <li> Not as strong as from macy&#x27;s, smell is muted but original.</li>
            <li> 212 is definitely a breath taking  fragrance.  I used to wear it in the past and now that I am using it again I don&#x27;t know with I stop buying it.  I receive a lot of compliments all the time... and I am a very, very happy costumer.</li>
            <li> Was surprised when I found this on Amazon as I hadn&#x27;t used this in a few years, forgot how much I enjoyed the scent! Classic 212 for me and it lasts all day. Product arrived in perfect condition and its legit</li>
            <li> i received just at time, the product was totally fine in their package, and now i enjoy it a lot , it smells so good, it&#x27;s exquisite , thanks :)!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! And it smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents and my girlfriend absolutely loves it. However, just like all of the colognes in this website, it has been altered since the scent only last a short time and its not true to the original. The scent is there but does not stay. I would get item somewhere else.</li>
            <li> everything was ok,  fast ....thanks</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne! This is my husbands everyday cologne. It&#x27;s subtle yet sexy. Not overbearing at all and lasts on him ALL day!</li>
            <li> You never go wrong with Carolina Herrera, very nice traditional perfume , I just love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Whether you use it for special occasions or in a daily basis, this perfume with exceed your expectations.</li>
            <li> have been using this for years. love the smell, never tiring, always very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Fake. This Fragance just last 2 or 3 hours as much!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because this is some of the best cologne I have ever purchased.  I would recommend this to any of my friends or family.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping good product</li>
            <li> Love this scent. It is pretty much the only one i wear now. This is my 2nd bottle and it is great. It is authentic and if you need reassurance just look for the serial number by the circle where it sprays out. Alot of compliments, one girl at work really loves it when i walk by her and even at the dentist office i have had compliments/</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME FOLLOWS THE STYLE OF THE NEW YORK CITY, A COSMOPOLITAN YOUNG FRAGANCE THAT CAN BE PERFECTLY WORE BY PEOPLE OF ALL AGES, THE BOTTLE IS A BEAUTIFUL GREY CYLINDER WITH AN EXCITING MAGNETIC CAP, THE WORD &amp;#34;MEN&amp;#34; IN TRANSPARENT BLUE COLOR AND THE NUMBERS &amp;#34;212&amp;#34; IN TRANSPPARENT BLUE TOO. THE FRAGANCE IS REALLY EXQUISITE AND DELICIOUS, I ABSOLUTLY RECOMEND IT 100 PERCENT...</li>
            <li> Excellent and responsible seller. Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this! Got a little shot of it from a friend and omg this is no joke later that day a random gal said I smelt great and wanted to do the dirty... Not sure if its the 212 but I will be buying a gallon of this stuff!</li>
            <li> Buy 212 Men without the NYC on the box to get the original scent. The new formulation simply  doesn&#x27;t last more than two hours on the skin. I own two bottles of 212 Men and both are tester bottles.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating for the simple reason that the fragrance is just what I needed at the right time, is completely original, it is simply perfect. The fragrance is very good quality, I would say excellent quality, really recommend to anyone wanting to have a good and lasting smell for hours anywhere</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne has been one of my long time favorites since I was younger. The cologne itself has a nice aquatic/fresh with citrus smell which I get complimented a lot on. I usually wear this cologne when I go out at night, and will wear it during the day if i know ill be out and about a lot. Another plus about this cologne is that its not overpowering but will last awhile. Using this in conjunction with the showering gel/aftershave and your one hard guy not to compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This in recent years has actually dropped to my second favorite cologne though, only to be surpassed by Kenneth Cole Reaction, check that out if you like this. Just make sure you get a genuine, the knockoffs smell completely off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a oddity I guess, I don&#x27;t like to stick with just one cologne. I wear for the occasion and that&#x27;s kind of why I have a large selection of cologne. I do stick with what works and tend to use the more trusted ones for important occasions, so i still wear this one a lot.</li>
            <li> Very rich fragance, a classic</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, the smell keeps over my body across the whole day long and it feels really good</li>
            <li> Espectacular este perfume.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. Need to buy another one already. I&#x27;ve always had this in my cologne repertoire. It&#x27;s a must!</li>
            <li> My son chose this for a gift.  He is in his 20&#x27;s.  He loves the scent.  From a mother&#x27;s perspective: I asked that he use it sparingly as I thought the scent a little strong.</li>
            <li> I have not an excellent product, and very good attention to the estimated. I recommend it to all the public</li>
            <li> This is a panty-dropping fragrance! I ordered for my Love and can&#x27;t get enough of it. This is the 2nd bottle I ordered and time for another. When he opened it, his response was, &amp;#34;You know how much cucaloo I can get with this?!&amp;#34; Yes, I know. But no worries. Pets may stray but good men stay. I love the attention he gets when he wears it. It confirms I have good taste in him and the fragrance. It&#x27;s said to have human pheromones that attract the opposite sex so the men&#x27;s fragrance actually appeals to heterosexual women and homosexual men. It&#x27;s a good buy. I have zero regrets. Ladies, this fragrance sets an intoxicating mood. Make him come to bed wearing this and a smile and it is a good night.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, era lo que en realidad estaba esperando, me llego a tiempo, excelente compra, .) :) :) :) :)</li>
            <li> excellent attention thanks</li>
            <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t smell quite as strong or last as long as the bottle I am replacing. It appears to be a weaker formula or different all together. I will not buy this this product online again.</li>
            <li> Product very good and as secified</li>
            <li> Excellent buy, very good quality</li>
            <li> Really crappy. Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last for more than 10 minutes. Although Amazon&#x27;s support is great when dealing with such scenarios.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and soft. Not too sweet or too strong. Just perfect! Not very much to say about it...</li>
            <li> It really is a good product, I recommend the expectations openly summit, which requires the consumer, I Facino an excellent article.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites but unfortunately it was not original  . I wont stay for more than 10 minutes . I am really pissed off . However , the delivery was acceptable .</li>
            <li> buen productos gracias</li>
            <li> Really great cologne!</li>
