            <li>The price is right :) and the product works great!</li>
            <li>love it, I wish can be cheaper.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product itself</li>
            <li>I love this an will br buying more.</li>
            <li>It seems that some hairs will continue to grow no matter how many times they are treated and others appear to be gone forever.</li>
            <li>but they have made the problem more manageable for me.</li>
            <li>so you might need more treatments, but laser costs more.  </li>
            <li>have been using for more than a year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>These cartridges work as well as the original ones that came with the machine.</li>
            <li>With In using the first cartridge Ive already noticed s huge difference.</li>
            <li>Much more convenient to order through Amazon and price was at least as good as anything else I found.  </li>
            <li>I hope that in the future Silk&#x27;n can become more sustainable.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping exactly as describe</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed much slower hair growth.</li>
            <li>and I see a lot of inprovements, but I believe they are VERY overpriced, and the price is going up every month.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>very convenient.</li>
            <li>These last longer than the original BellaLite.</li>
            <li>I trust Amazon more than any other online retailer.  </li>
            <li>I was a little nervous when the product showed up not in the original packaging, but so far it has been fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all about patience and realistic expectations.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but man do I love not shaving any more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing any miracles with them but slow steady improvement in hair reduction over many months of weekly treatments.</li>
            <li>I like them, they are bright and least for long.</li>
            <li>less shaving and more time spent on the beach.</li>

            <li> Got what I needed for my Costco purchased BellaLite.</li>
            <li> Truly cannot believe these are so expensive considering I only paid 200 for the whole machine and 3 replacement bulbs.</li>
            <li> Silk&#x27;n SN-007 BellaLite All-Over Hair Removal ECO Lamp Cartridges (3-Pack) arrived on time. They work well as expected.</li>
            <li> Great deal--the cartridges do the job. I&#x27;ve noticed much slower hair growth.</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous when the product showed up not in the original packaging, but so far it has been fine.</li>
            <li> These last longer than the original BellaLite. I recommend these</li>
            <li> love it, I wish can be cheaper.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product itself and I see a lot of inprovements, but I believe they are VERY overpriced, and the price is going up every month. I dont know for what reason they cannot keep the same price for one month and they increase 1$ per month. I don&#x27;t like this kind of policy.</li>
            <li> With In using the first cartridge Ive already noticed s huge difference. I love this an will br buying more.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Bella Lite for about a year, and it removed my hair from unwanted places. I am very happy with this product. Now I use it every once in a while for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a while and I don&#x27;t know why amazon is selling it so expensive. You should just go to silkn website and buy it cheaper over there. Besides, if you go to google and search for silkn coupon you should get additional percent off. I ended up buying 6 cartridges for just about $200.</li>
            <li> I like the product overall, it has served me well and has actually visibly reduced my hair on my legs, bikini line and underarms. However the cartridges themselves are not recyclable which I find to be disappointing in this day and age and just one time I put one of these cartridges in and not even a few blasts in it blew and was unusable. It did happen only once but still a loss of about $50, so I am only giving them a satisfactory review. I hope that in the future Silk&#x27;n can become more sustainable.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement cartridges.  Shipping was prompt and item arrived in good condition.  Note that the cartridges I received were the 1500 pulse type.</li>
            <li> These cartridges work as well as the original ones that came with the machine. I&#x27;m not seeing any miracles with them but slow steady improvement in hair reduction over many months of weekly treatments. I will continue to buy them as long as I am seeing some improvement. It&#x27;s all about patience and realistic expectations. It seems that some hairs will continue to grow no matter how many times they are treated and others appear to be gone forever. The remaining hairs seem to be finer, softer, less noticeable, and slower growing, but I may eventually have to turn to electrolysis if I want to get rid of those completely. I don&#x27;t think these cartridges are the cure for unwanted body hair but they have made the problem more manageable for me.</li>
            <li> This s the only way to replace these cartridges. The price is right :) and the product works great! Bellalite is a great machine.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the originals. Saved a lot buying a 3-pack.</li>
            <li> We have used the silken system for over a year now and are very pleased with the way it works it works as advertised</li>
            <li> Fast shipping exactly as describe</li>
            <li> This product really works. I was skeptical but man do I love not shaving any more. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like them, they are bright and least for long. But it does not have something that i would like.</li>
            <li> Much more convenient to order through Amazon and price was at least as good as anything else I found.  Even at same price I trust Amazon more than any other online retailer.  My wife uses theses and they aren&#x27;t miracle hair erasers, but they do work if you keep up with it and have dark hair.  I have white/gray and it didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> device works well, each bulb lasts a long time, and its not too uncomfortable (little zap, gets warm if used rapidly, no big deal).  it&#x27;s not quite the same as laser so you might need more treatments, but laser costs more.  I&#x27;m trying to eliminate my beard, so i don&#x27;t have to shave, and there&#x27;s been a ton of progress to that goal, although now I&#x27;m stuck with grays i&#x27;ll need electrolysis for.</li>
            <li> it takes time but there is definitely visual proof. less shaving and more time spent on the beach. very convenient.</li>
            <li> Very effective, easy to use. have been using for more than a year. the cartridge also long lasting. need replacement only once a year.</li>
            <li> Got the machine last year at Costco Online with three heads.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good way to keep off hair- just replace the heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
