            <li>Absolutely in love with Baredfaced!!</li>

            <li>That&#x27;s so nice!</li>
            <li>Purchase at your own risk!</li>
            <li>I believe this is a wonderful business that cares about consumers &amp; as a very satisfied customer, I am more than happy to give them my support.</li>
            <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest, but all mud masks--the good ones at least--are like that.</li>
            <li>Nothing pleasant, or anything you would want to put on your face.</li>
            <li>recommend this, and I will warn about the smell, it isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li>The smell was actually mostly pleasant to me</li>
            <li>For now, I honestly believe that in six months, as this product claims, my skin will be \\&quot;beautifully barefaced.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>The mud mask came off easily, and the result was great!</li>
            <li>Great product and feels amazing on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Amazing mud mask, my skin feels great after using it.</li>
            <li>It will get rid of that dullness leaving your face looking bright and</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s good to know what you are putting on</li>
            <li>A good marketing strategy deserves a 5-star.</li>
            <li>This feels really good on my face..</li>
            <li>I loved the smell.  </li>
            <li>As someone who doesn&#x27;t like overly fragrant products, that was actually a good thing for me.</li>
            <li>and I loved the results.</li>
            <li>(However, I have had skin reactions with those that smell good, and that could be the underlining factor.</li>
            <li>So that is good ...</li>
            <li>I washed it off and my face felt so good ...</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Just switched from GlamGlow to this, and I loved the feel of my skin afterward with Barefaced.  </li>
            <li>and we both loved it.  </li>
            <li>I loved how well</li>

            <li>I absolutely loved this mask.</li>

            <li>Good mask.</li>
            <li>Tried this today and loved it.</li>
            <li>It is a good size jar plastic jar.</li>
            <li>But it is nothing a good non oily moisturizer</li>
            <li>Wonderful mask - I appreciate that the ingredients are all straightforward and good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>It helps clean your skin and feels great on it!.</li>

            <li>Super impressed.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly after ordering and came packaged perfectly, which was a relief, I&#x27;ve had places that just threw products in a box and went for it.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>This mask, from all-natural ingredients, worked great with refreshing my skin without over-drying it.</li>

            <li>It would make a wonderful gift, and also would be a lot of fun to do at a sleepover or after a girl&#x27;s night out.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely and feels great on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Fells nice, smells good, face visibly clearer</li>
            <li>Its a good mask and works nicely.</li>
            <li>Coming across the jar was a pleasant surprise, but not as much of a surprise of how wonderful my face felt after the treatment!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a wonderful scent, but what would you expect salty mud to smell like right?</li>

            <li>Skin feels nice after use.</li>
            <li>I received this mask for the purpose of review, but the opinions within are my own.</li>
            <li>I wanted a nice mask that I DIDNT have to mix.</li>
            <li>It feels nice going on</li>
            <li>It kind of reminded me of lemons.</li>
            <li>and he loved it too. : )</li>
            <li>I also liked the texture of this product -</li>
            <li>I liked the removal process.</li>
            <li>Also liked the smell.</li>
            <li>It has a nice aroma.</li>
            <li>After the 15 minutes, I used warm water and a wash cloth to remove the mud.</li>
            <li>This mask is excellent for a deep-pore cleanse and really softens the skin.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.  </li>
            <li>To me the mud is kind of watery which isn&#x27;t how mud is suppose to be, when I apply a product to my face I would like it to stay put and not be all watery feeling.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using the mask and will keep on using it to keep me in a good skin routine.</li>
            <li>I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Oh as its drying my face feels tighter and its still tingling but mostly in spots where I had blemishes, looking good</li>
            <li>all the oils and extracts are so nice.</li>
            <li>I will expect more good results with continued usage.</li>
            <li>I was given this product in return for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Honestly, Amazon, do you bother checking the reviews on here before they are posted?</li>
            <li>This had a nice clean feel to it and is a great way to treat yourself a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li>This mask feels great on and washes away clean.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery, feels great, smells great, love the design and didnt break out afterwards.</li>
            <li>Loved this product loved the way it made my face feel and just felt really refreshed!!</li>
            <li>I was very happy to give this product a try because I am always looking for the masks that provide a fresh face with smooth skin and also works like cleaning pores and removing dirt/oil.</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell super great</li>
            <li>Great product, came extremely fast and good quality.</li>
            <li>It has got a good strong smell...</li>
            <li>This mask has a very nice earthy aroma and feels cool on the face.</li>
            <li>The consistency seems a bit slimy but it applies very easy on skin.</li>
            <li>When I applied it the scent is still very strong to me, but it fades a bit as it dries.</li>
            <li>The tub it comes in is great, using a bear for the logo since this is &amp;#34;Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask&amp;#34; is very cute, and helps to make this a perfect beauty gift for a friend.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason a bear is on the tub of this mud mask is because it is made with a unique combination of minerals and salts that are great for our skin!eally love the smell of the mudmask.</li>
            <li>It was ok, nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li>I have used all sorts of mud mask, but this by far the best!</li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face the rest of the evening.</li>

            <li>I would happily try again once it runs out, thanks!</li>
            <li>and I felt very comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>She couldn&#x27;t stop touching her face and saying exactly how great it felt</li>
            <li>The clean sensation was nice but the soft, silkiness was awesome.    </li>
            <li>The mask was easy for her use and had a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Dries and then easily wipes off with a warm wash cloth.</li>
            <li>Smooth, and refreshingly tingly!  </li>
            <li>Dries super fast and smells great too :) Use it about once a week and immediately improves my skin and feel so good afterwards.</li>

            <li>It is so refreshing</li>
            <li>What I like most is that it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s because it helps the blood flow for a better the complection.</li>
            <li>I love the tingle.</li>
            <li>I did feel a lot of tingling but it was focused more on my problem areas.</li>
            <li>With just one use, I have noticed a more even skin tone and softer skin.</li>

            <li>, you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Its not horrible by any means</li>
            <li>Probably has to do more with me being &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li>I have used it a couple of times now and am a fan for sure.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this mask.</li>
            <li>Face never felt better</li>
            <li>At the age of 44, I&#x27;ve come to realize I need to treat my skin better than I have until this point.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li>mud mask dries to a more of a brown color.</li>
            <li>I just free balled it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works ok for oily skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a disgusting scent though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a spa day for me at home whenever I use it :)</li>
            <li>I also think being able to stir it is a plus to mix the mud.</li>
            <li>How cute is that packaging?</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the earthy, herbal smell.</li>
            <li>also, bears are cute.</li>
            <li>And the price is much better.  </li>
            <li>I like this even more because of the chemicals, or lack thereof, in the ingredients list.</li>
            <li>Great product, for the whole family.</li>
            <li>The texture looking much better</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing minty smell, which I am assuming is a combination of the Lavender, Aloe Vera, and Eucalyptus.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients,the scent and how it makes my skin look and feel, what more can you ask for from a mask??</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>I love the results from the face mud.  </li>
            <li>I love this face mud.</li>
            <li>so when I got the chance to try out the Barefaced one I jumped on the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned my face real good before using the mud mask, applied, and left on around 10 minutes as per the instructions.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
            <li>All and all in pretty impressed and cannot wait to see the results on both of us with some consistent use.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I decided to take better care of my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible but not something I want to deal with anymore.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer, healthier, and just looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li>Please continue to put out such a great quality product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the mud very creamy and it felt great going on my skin.</li>
            <li>I will keep using it, but I seem to get better results from philosophy masks.  </li>
            <li>I would love to buy it again.</li>
            <li>I decided I wanted to try it out, and I couldn&#x27;t be more grateful.</li>
            <li>My skin felt incredibly supple and soft, and the size of my pores has visibly been reduced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 57 and have okay skin.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin looks and feels afterwards,</li>
            <li>When I opened the jar this morning, the top layer was covered in fuzzy mold.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer, clearer, and the coloring is somehow better.</li>
            <li>and it had mold all over the top.</li>
            <li>Most of all, it really does a great job on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the smell of it, wasn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product for free, but all thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Note just because an item isn&#x27;t a favorite of mine</li>
            <li>and she ended up convincing me to give it a go as well</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m hoping the more</li>
            <li>I received this mud mask free to try in return for an honest product review.</li>
            <li>When I looked into the product a bit more I found that it has all organic ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this to come off one more before shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I swear I&#x27;m going to break out more</li>
            <li>I keep touching my face though.</li>
            <li>-Reviewstuffzp touching my face though.</li>
            <li>It had a nice scent to it, very earthy with botanical undertones, which include sunflower, lavender, aloe, and eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing my face, I followed up with a Vitamin C serum, and a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product free for review purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Love A++ in my book</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel smooth!</li>
            <li>My wife was also looking for ways to better control oil and break outs.</li>
            <li>Formula is not moisturizing, an appropriate moisturizer should follow removal.</li>
            <li>Most efficient removal is in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a licensed Esthetician and industry educator with a decade of hands on experience, I come across a ton of product, most of which is hype and loaded with extraneous ingredients.</li>
            <li>After I use it, my skin looks and feels better.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>, it leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshed!</li>
            <li>Better than borghese mud.</li>
            <li>I love this mask.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I give it four stars is because it doesn&#x27;t smell awesome.  </li>

            <li>I was given the chance to review this awesome Dead Sea Mud Mask from Barefaced Skincare, and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>(no painful burning or stinging though, just a nice tingly feeling).</li>

            <li>This mud is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>When I first opened this jar, a nice smell drifted out that had me all amped up to try this mask.</li>
            <li>Honestly when I first bought it I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I have heard good things about dead sea treatments and this really has impressed me!</li>

            <li>this is a really nice mask with very nice ingredients but this might not be the right mask for super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>smell wasn&#x27;t exactly the most appealing.</li>
            <li>it applies easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Smells fine too.</li>
            <li>its fine</li>
            <li>It felt great, and my skin afterwards feel soft and clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>(Okay... I&#x27;m super sweaty.)</li>
            <li>Super cute package too….</li>
            <li>it has a specific scent, which is ok for me, the consistency is quite surprising and jelly, easy to apply and after it dries it is also easy to wash it off.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the most appealing LOOKING, but if you can get over the initial texture, you will be very pleased.</li>
            <li>Great value for the cost, very high quality, and positive customer care.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a slight (good) tingle, and it smells good.</li>
            <li>I felt a difference in my son after the very first time!</li>
            <li>It was fairly easy to wash off and it even came out of our hair pretty easily too, which I was worried about when I accidentally got some in my hair at the top of my forehead.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Montagne Jeunesse men&#x27;s masks</li>
            <li>HUGE for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use this mask once a week from now on to make sure my skin is nice and clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with frequent use it will look amazing.</li>
            <li>Great product that I&#x27;ll definitely use again!</li>
            <li>It was such a great price</li>
            <li>I now finally have found something that I&#x27;m really happy to use &amp; is much more economical than the Montagne Jeunesse ones</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>Skin was smooth and refreshed after.</li>
            <li>My skin feels refreshed and smooth like I&#x27;ve just been to the spa.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth &amp; supple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll tighten on your face and after about 15 minutes you&#x27;re free to wash it off.</li>
            <li>a fantastic job of getting all the dirt out of your pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try just about anything that will keep me blemish and wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great product</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s great stuff</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell, but if you are opposed to putting mud on your face then this is not a product for you.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel SOOOO smooth.</li>
            <li>but fortunately it was time to remove it.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and when I washed it off, my face felt so clean.</li>
            <li>I tend to look for products at a great price, so I decided I would see what Amazon had to offer in terms of facial masks.</li>
            <li>Fantastic mask.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and almost has a whipped texture to it.</li>
            <li>The tingle is fantastic and your skin will truly recover overnight.</li>
            <li>From a mother of three boys on a budget and don&#x27;t have time for facials at salons this will fit your bill.</li>
            <li>Was really happy with it and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>and this mask did an fantastic job in helping healing some of those.</li>
            <li>My face also felt so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, works wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>got it within 48 hours my order despite the fact that my order was under Free Shipping</li>
            <li>the price, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect that much.</li>
            <li>I had a minor acne breakout after the very first use, but after the very first use, it just kept my skin perfect!</li>
            <li>My face felt smooth.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Having such good luck with that made me even more excited about this</li>
            <li>I wish I could use the product  everyday , its a wonderful mask, its gentle on my very sensitive skin , and it smells superb, very earthy, this product not only makes me happy, but my face as well.</li>
            <li>thanks barefaced skincare!!!</li>
            <li>I really liked this mud mask, it really makes your face feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Feels good when applied and leaves skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>At that site I could not find where to get a free jar.. but not disappointed with product</li>
            <li>However, I used it that night, and was amazed at how smooth, clean, and balanced my acne prone/oily skin felt.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and rinses off clean.  </li>
            <li>and I have pretty sensitive skin, but it felt great on my skin</li>
            <li>but I also really wanted to try something new, &amp; I was happy with the results that I saw -</li>
            <li>makes my face feel very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast on your face and skin feels amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li>When I first smelled it in the jar, I wasn&#x27;t so sure, but once I had it on it</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Omg so I was excited to try this out because of the rave reviews</li>
            <li>Been using it for a couple weeks and am pretty pleased.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I really love this mask as a whole!</li>
            <li>The texture is a mud/gel-like feel which is quite strange, but does a great job as a mask as you would expect.</li>
            <li>I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I loved it!</li>
            <li>It has lavender oil, and eucalyptus, which is probably why I love this mask so much!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for my girlfriend</li>
            <li>💙💙 makes my face feel so fresh!</li>
            <li>It does help clean out the pores.  </li>
            <li>It made my face feel really smooth and the shipping was really quick</li>
            <li>and then I can easily clean my face with towel.</li>
            <li>Leaves face feeling clean with a noticeable difference after a week or so of using.</li>
            <li>The mask left my skin feeling so clean and soft and it smells great!</li>
            <li>my face feels clean</li>
            <li>my face feels clean</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, works great so far.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, made my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I used this today for the first time, it smelled good, rinsed clean and my skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a light tingle while it&#x27;s working its magic (no harsh burn) and it comes off easily with water and a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>The clean sensation was nice but the soft, silkiness was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that this particular mask addresses those needs, however, I must speak to the way it made my skin look immediately renewed upon use!</li>
            <li>Has definitely cleared my skin up and given it a healthy smooth glow, there is definitely some beautiful natural magic in here !</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and clean right away.</li>
            <li>but I would say it&#x27;s more of a slate grey kind of color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great for people who don&#x27;t have such sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I liked how all the ingredients are natural and organic.</li>
            <li>It has a cool feeling when applied and improves the appearance of skin.</li>
            <li>I had a face-full of Barefaced mud within days of placing my order, which only started things out on a good foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After drying my face and heading to bed, I woke up with smooth, fresh, and glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The NEXT DAY my skin still feels and looks good.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel good for the day and can see pores on nose have got smaller.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the intense minty feeling it has while its drying.</li>
            <li>But I primarily liked it because of the end result: silky soft skin.    </li>
            <li>I am a face mask aficionado and I have tried mud masks that would feel good upon initial use and then start burning as it dries on your face.</li>
            <li>For full product reviews, please check out my blog: laceituplove.blotspot.com</li>
            <li>A good facial is just about as close to a spa day as I can get.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but loved the tingle</li>
            <li>I loved it, I have only used it once, and I can&lt;br /</li>
            <li>So I only buy things on Amazon if they have good reviews.</li>
            <li>but I waited the full recommended 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Smells good, feels terrific -</li>
            <li>As a licensed aesthetician, I&#x27;m constantly looking for good skin products to try on myself before I recommend them to anyone else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the decision to purchase this product as it has proved very beneficial.</li>
            <li>Also it leaves it silky feeling, after years of sun exposure its nice to have soft skin.</li>
            <li>My oily skin doesn&#x27;t respond well to many masks and this made my pores so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I just like something quick &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>I use it both as a spot treatment for pimples that pop up or as a full restorative mask when I feel like my skin needs a reset.</li>
            <li>No bad residue or smell.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply, quickly dried and the fragrance when rinsing was great.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply, quickly dried and the fragrance when rinsing was great.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a natural, easy to use mask and this was one of the top results.</li>
            <li>The scent is extremely strong, but after the first use it is easier to get used to.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After you let the mask dry you just wash it off with warm water!</li>
            <li>I chose this one due to the great price</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a great product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, compared to other mud masks, this one has a competitive price and is a great value.</li>
            <li>Fresh, and Clean.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the entire Barefaced Mud Mask experience from the application to my skin, feeling the mask cleaning and exfoliating, and leaving my face even more radiant.</li>
            <li>Like my cheeks are super tender</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and nourished after using, and love how natural the product is.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t go through this rather quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Texture: As I said, I&#x27;ve tried several and this one has more of a goopy texture than many of the others.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It came quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and it seems to do a good job at keeping my skin clear along with a healthy diet and clean pillow cases regularly.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and thick, smells really good for a mud mask as well.</li>
            <li>Loved this mask so much it made my face feel soft and detoxified.</li>
            <li>This is a quick skin treatment that I look forward to using.</li>
            <li>I found my face felt very clean and tight (in a good way) afterwards.</li>
            <li>There was a healthy glow and was very soft!</li>
            <li>I will mostly repurchase and add this to my normal skin routine going forward.</li>
            <li>I have only used the mask twice, so I&#x27;m unsure if it prevents or treats breakouts and/or aging, but I can say that after I use it my skin is glowing and looks very healthy.  </li>
            <li>, I am not so impressed at all because this mask gave me rashes on my skin and there was no good effect about it.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased and will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li>Also, the smell was very mild, which is nice since I try to avoid highly fragrant products on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great product that left my skin feeling clean and clear!</li>
            <li>Love the fresh clean smell and it helped to clear some blemishes!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty large tub and even better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance to try a new product and the results have been wonderful!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is probably my new favorite mask.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I have a new favorite.</li>
            <li>I found that it does not have a strong scent, which I really prefer, if I am going to be leaving a mask on my face for fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li>In regards to the actual product, i love it!</li>
            <li>My skin felt so refreshed after the first use!  </li>
            <li>Mud masks are excellent to incorporate in to your skincare routine because Dead Sea mud is full of nutrients, salt and natural minerals that are shown to have healing properties for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I must admit I felt kinda funny smearing &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; on my face although it is a practice that has been used for ages!</li>
            <li>My pores size has reduced significantly and my skin is much clearer!  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>so I was pretty excited about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this all natural product!  </li>
            <li>Just after the first use!</li>
            <li>I love the way it dries and tightens and when I was it off, my skin appears fresh and new.</li>
            <li>Potent in smell but super natural.</li>
            <li>However if you can deal with the wonky smell for 15 minutes to achieve beautiful hydrated skin then it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li>least this will smell pleasant!</li>
            <li>It is great for an at home spa day or a little face pick me up.</li>
            <li>After leaving it on for recommended amount of time, I was very pleased at how easy it was to remove even though it had harden upon drying (which is typical of masks).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mask to anyone who is looking for a weekly skin treatment that is simple and effective!</li>
            <li>Happy all round and well worth a try, would recommend.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel great and removes excess dirt and dead skin.  </li>
            <li>However, for those of us with mature skin, I would not recommend using this more than once a week.  </li>
            <li>A thin layer works best.</li>
            <li>Best kept secret is this face mask.</li>
            <li>Left my face feeling soft and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to have a mud mask every once in a while.</li>
            <li>Feels soft, smooth and refreshed!</li>
            <li>Smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I originally liked this product because of the bear as a joke, but decided to actually try it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really liked the product.</li>
            <li>I am thankful that I received a complimentary sample for review purposes.</li>
            <li>&gt; always love to find products that are 100% natural.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth investing in.</li>
            <li>Where when you smile, it feels like your face is flaking off?</li>
            <li>To apply, just add the mud to a freshly cleansed face and leave on for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I love that it is made with 100% Natural &amp; Organic ingredients and the value is unbeatable.  </li>
            <li>You will have a lot of fun doing it.  </li>
            <li>These results are worth dealing with the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was not really crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once a week for 4 weeks and it works ok to clear my pores a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for organic, cruelty free products and Barefaced Facial Mud Mask was just that and more.  </li>
            <li>I also have eczema so that makes my skin even more sensitive.</li>
            <li>I had never tried any kind of facial or mud mask before ordering this.</li>
            <li>but I think the essential oils they use to scent it counteract that nicely so its not an issue</li>
            <li>but I think the essential oils they use to scent it counteract that nicely so its not an issue</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using tomoson.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh feeling of mint and eucalyptus, which stays after you rinse the mas off.</li>
            <li>first impression when using this was, “WOW”- the scent is STRONG!</li>
            <li>This product is great used with my facial oils ( rose hip &amp; raw coconut), and is now a permanent resident in my face care regime.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, it did not burn like most other things I have tried on my face and was actually enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li>However I am realistic that it will take a few uses and nothing is a miracle worker, but I&#x27;m sure it will do some good in that aspect as well.</li>
            <li>But it has a refreshing scent with a dark colored clay that was very smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin which Is the main cause for my acne, but my skin has drastically gotten better with this product.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft, clean and looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It left my skin feeling clean and so smooth!</li>
            <li>Smooth, smells clean, made my skin soft and pores visibly cleaner/smaller.</li>
            <li>in fact, I think it is very clean and natural smelling.  </li>
            <li>Got here fast, excited to use it.</li>
            <li>Again, I see this as a good thing, as it ensures that the effective ingredients are getting deep down where they need to be to do their thing.</li>
            <li>but I would prefer something nicer as I use this right before I go to bed</li>
            <li>Cleared my psoriasis right up.</li>
            <li>skin has never been healthier than it is right</li>
            <li>It has an interesting smell, not bad enough to bother me or anything.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and clean my skin is after I remove the mask with a warm, wet wash cloth!!</li>
            <li>, that means you need to take all of these high reviews with a grain of salt since everyone is getting a free jar for reviewing...</li>
            <li>My face is so soft and clean!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wash off and leaves the skin fresh, soft, and silky.</li>
            <li>Its smooth and has a real natural scent.</li>
            <li>I have had great experiences with mud masks in the past, so I jumped at the opportunity to review this one.</li>
            <li>so I followed up with my normal nightly moisturizer and it feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>Its fair priced compared to other products in this category and does exactly what it advertises, no gimmicks, just results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once so far, but my face felt cool, clean, and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as other products at 3X the price!</li>
            <li>It wiped off extremely easily, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance: Many other reviewers said they could smell lavender.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using beauty products and trying new things</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product and company, especially with their great and responsive costumer service.</li>
            <li>We moved to Louisiana recently and my once great skin turned in to that of a teen going through puberty!</li>
            <li>Mild because I will start oozing oil out of my pores with too much lotion,</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free jar of Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>The main difference is when you clean it off your face.</li>
            <li>The packaging says to keep the mask on for 15 minutes and rinse dry with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my skin felt super soft and really clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This mask really tightens quickly.</li>
            <li>This not only is that it also smells amazing, really get the mint.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes, I washed it off with warm water and patted my face dry.</li>
            <li>He said there was no problem removing it and loved the feel after and thought his razor burn looked less irritated on his neck from shaving that morning.</li>
            <li>BUT NOT for my sensitive &amp; finicky skin, my skin is still bright red</li>
            <li>I recently tried an exfoliator with salt from the dead sea and it has been wonderful for my skin.</li>
            <li>The container says to apply with dry hands and to let the mud mask stay on your face for 10 minutes, then rinse with warm water and pat</li>
            <li>It has a cool,  slightly tingling feeling, but I liked it.  </li>
            <li>It has a very VERY VERY earthy scent.</li>
            <li>I have to scrub a little with warm water to get my face clean.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy facial masks and my favorite are ones that contain Dead Sea mud, this one has it and its the first ingredient, all ingredients are amazing.</li>
            <li>Barefaced was nice enough to send me their Dead Sea Mud Mask to test out for them and I have to say I really love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Will post another review after a few more uses, but so far, I love it!</li>
            <li>My skin felt really clean, fresh, and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it only once, but my face feels unbelievably clean, smooth and tingly.</li>
            <li>After my first use today, my skin feels smoother and is glowing.</li>
            <li>and I was used to paying loads more for similar products.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much smoother after one use!</li>
            <li>My skin feels much happier after a mask!</li>
            <li>- just remember to not use too much of it though!</li>
            <li>I really like!</li>
            <li>Definitely going to make my boyfriend use it :)</li>
            <li>So many different masks on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have had acne for many years and its persistent, if I let up it will come back, but this keeps it at bay the longest compared to anything I&#x27;ve used (and thats a lot of products)</li>
            <li>First time trying a mud mask- smells minty and has a cooling factor on my face.</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever using any type of &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; mask</li>
            <li>I have pretty acne prone skin that I have been battling since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>It was shipped pretty fast!</li>
            <li>First thing</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I have lost ages just after first use, wrinkles visible got softer and pores almost disappear.</li>
            <li>You can either use a warm wet towel or washed without towel, it&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li>I love when you can feel that in a facial product.</li>
            <li>I could tell after the first use that my skin was smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li>The mud mask isn&#x27;t too overwhelming and the effect is equivalent to a spa facial.</li>
            <li>What immediately stood out to me about this mud mask was definitely the cute bear on the tub of it.</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing!</li>
            <li>When I first went to use this, I almost couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Really earthy...like mud!</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed a difference in the appearance of my pores after the first application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered 2 to last me.</li>
            <li>It has been four weeks since I&#x27;ve been consistently using their product, and I can already see immediate results.</li>
            <li>In lieu of all these benefits, I haven&#x27;t really experienced any negative effects.</li>
            <li>There are no weird sounding ingredients in here, that any consumer should be worried about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Everywhere I looked, I saw outstanding reviews, and I saw claims that it helped with acne and facial imperfections.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Apologies to Barefaced Skincare who seem genuinely interested in pleasing their customers....</li>
            <li>Will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Alright see y&#x27;all in well the pm most likely since its am now lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Alright see y&#x27;all in well the pm most likely since its am now lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to others, thanks a million Barefaced!</li>
            <li>After rinsing my skin felt smooth and soft and I noticed a reduction in the size of my pores.  </li>
            <li>Used this mud mask for the first time tonight</li>
            <li>In my first try, my skin got irritated and became reddish all over.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I was not a fan of the scent at first</li>
            <li>Sometimes, you just need to pamper yourself ;)</li>
            <li>Application was very easy, and it almost leaves you with a serene spa-like feeling as you wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li>The mask took about 15 minutes to dry and was very easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li>However, it works really really well, and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>And everyone is right, you don&#x27;t need as much as you think you do.</li>
            <li>My normal routine consists of alternating face wash and exfoliaters, followed by a mild moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The mask has a small lite pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It was initially easy to apply, but if you don&#x27;t apply it fast enough while massaging, it will start to crack, so work quickly and try not to go over areas you have already gotten.</li>
            <li>It dried pretty quick and clean up was easy.</li>
            <li>After I take it off, my skin feels very soft and noticeable looks more even toned, good for dark spots left by acne.</li>
            <li>Smelled much better than previously used mud masks and my face felt clean and renewed after using.</li>
            <li>It washed off easily with a soft cloth and left me skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Immediately after using the mask my skin felt clean and soft.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to use it more to really see the lasting benefits.</li>
            <li>I would recommend, if you have sensitive skin to test an area on your face first before leave it on for the full 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>It did not take much of the product to be able to cover my face entirely.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice product--love how it makes my skin soft and pores smaller!</li>
            <li>the lavender oil seems to be the most obvious which I really like.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>A little more than I would usually spend, but I&#x27;m happy to have finally found a mask that I really enjoy using!</li>
            <li>The smooth, creamy mask goes on smoothly and evenly, unlike a lot of other mud masks I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>: This is the first mask I have tried that said to gently massage the product into the skin.</li>
            <li>As for my gigantic pores, I have not seen much of a change there, although I noticed that other reviewers have claimed to see a nice</li>
            <li>Stings your skin while on and during removal, but leaves your skill felling cool soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It just feels fresh and clean as soon as you open the jar.</li>
            <li>The jar has many treatments in it as well, so once a week is realistic, and it will last awhile.</li>
            <li>did receive this product complimentary to give my full and honest opinion, whether it be positive or negative!</li>
            <li>I have used Dead Sea Facial Mud Mask 4 times now, my facial tone is much better, pore size has reduced and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t pass it up all the way because then I&#x27;ll get lovely dry skin flakes.</li>
            <li>Relaxing scent and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Been looking for an all-natural mud mask that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like SO many others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I honestly feel my pores are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it five stars if it didn&#x27;t have such a strong scent to it.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong eculyptus odor, it did make my eyes water a little the first couple of times I used it, and definitely cleared my sinus lol, by the 3rd time</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase this again</li>
            <li>I am certainly adding this to my beauty regime.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the #1 smart aging product on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can say I&#x27;ve seen absolutely zero positive results.</li>
            <li>Another positive is the shipping was really fast</li>
            <li>I have SUPER sensitive skin, so I was very tentative when I tried this.</li>
            <li>Firstly there&#x27;s loads in this jar so I&#x27;ll definitely get my moneys worth out of this this stuff!</li>
            <li>Another PLUS, when you order, they give you a 50 % code off your next purchase for just being loyal!</li>
            <li>Another PLUS, when you order, they give you a 50 % code off your next purchase for just being loyal!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new product to replace an old favorite for rainy days—the Barefaced Dead Sea Mask fits the bill and more.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Overall, its a fantastic product that leaves my skin feeling pure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little astringent, which is great for teenage skin</li>
            <li>Mud may be manipulated lightly over skin while formula is still creamy, to experience a gentle physical exfoliation.</li>
            <li>that after searching and buying expensive products for something that can help clear my skin, a once or twice a week regiment has helped me find the perfect skin balance that I have always wanted.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how much I recommmend this mask-</li>
            <li>Thanks for creating a quality skin care product that lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li>My face felt very refreshed</li>
            <li>only problem is it comes with a card offering a free jar if you go to the Web site.</li>
            <li>My skin felt much softer &amp; smoother after use</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend buying this mask.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and creamy..not gritty at all.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li>It has a citrus smell that is really pleseant.</li>
            <li>I have been using the mask for 3 weeks now and the texture of my skin has really improved.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My skin was noticeably softer and I didn&#x27;t need to layer on an intense moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference after the 1st application but</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t have any issues with acne</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need to use that much</li>
            <li>It left my face refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>I can see some already but highly recommend to any guys out there!</li>
            <li>I really like this mask.  </li>
            <li>not helpful at all, smell so bed and very greasy after use it.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, which can get very oily in warmer weather.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much</li>
            <li>and you really feel it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another thing I noticed, isn&#x27;t really something you should ...</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Another thing I noticed, isn&#x27;t really something you should ...</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny, as it works like a champ on my sensitive and problematic skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and then straightly went to shower.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for the required amount of time, and yes I can really feel it working.</li>
            <li>It leaves a silky smooth feeling where you feel like a moisturizer is not really necessary.  </li>
            <li>The texture has a bit of grittiness to it and it dries rather fast, within 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have to moisturize after using although this is pretty normal with face masks in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Also a really reasonable price for the quality you get.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by telling you that this Mud Mask is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This has a very earthy scent that lingers for some time.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your face, so the jar lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>and her skin was much smoother after she used it.</li>
            <li>and it was much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for men who like to take care of their skin in a manly way!</li>
            <li>In addition, the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>This mask is the real deal...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>now it doesn&#x27;t look like much in the photos, but</li>
            <li>but it has no artificial fragrances so its completely &amp;#34;bare-ble&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It really cleans my skin, it helped me a lot with my whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask.</li>
            <li>Get ready to either hold your breath for 15 minutes or spend that time gagging.</li>
            <li>Works really well with my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real deal I just got it today</li>
            <li>I will be getting another one soon because my mother wants it .</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I personally really like the smell</li>
            <li>This works very well for both.</li>
            <li>LOVE that so many of the ingredients are organic, and that the mud is actually from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li>and we both really like it.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try it twice before I gave a review to really see how my skin would react.</li>
            <li>Product arrived fast and as described.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin</li>
            <li>I could really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit that it didn&#x27;t have much of a smell-</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It has an earthy scent, which I expect of a mud mask, because it lets me know that it is real.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Your follow up regarding my feedback is appreciated.</li>
            <li>I really like this mud mask.</li>
            <li>and I have to use twice as much moisturizer now.</li>
            <li>Ultra fast delivery</li>
            <li>My face feels very refreshed after using this.  </li>
            <li>There are all natural ingredients and the smell is interesting and soothing at the same time.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, as soon as I got it wet 15 minutes later to rinse, I LOVED the scent</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I have always liked anything with dead sea mud.</li>
            <li>I was actually expecting more of a glow from something so natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing because the mask absorbed all that nastiness out of them as it dried and my skin feels nice and soft and</li>
            <li>first couple of uses, as any new product introduced to the skin could.</li>
            <li>The 2nd week and on I left it on for the full 15 minutes since everything was fine after the 1st use.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li>but I have learned that this is good because it usually means it has all natural products with no perfumes in it!</li>
            <li>, I pretty much used what was left on the jar cover for my first application, not even really dipping into the jar itself!</li>
            <li>In particular, my acne scars are even becoming less noticeable and I&#x27;ve mostly stopped breaking-out with regular use of this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products, BUT I am in love with the way my face looks and feels after using this mud mask!</li>
            <li>When I first apply it to my face it feels tingly and after washing off my skin is SO SOFT!</li>
            <li>Unlike other mud masks that have irritated my skin during application, this one does not, and I love the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to continue using this product, and I would recommend this to anyone thinking of buy a facial mask.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to  continue trying it once a week to see how my skin feels after multiple uses!</li>
            <li>Upon using the mud mask and waking up the next morning, I noticed a significant difference on the impact that it had on the acne.</li>
            <li>I have never been fond of the ones that have so many other ingredients in them, that they just smell like fragrance.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve received the mud mask about a week and half ago and so far, I love it!</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve had much better success using a sulfur-based masks for acne-prevention.</li>
            <li>The mask works great and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Barefaced Dead Sea Mud mask has a gel-like consistency and very easy to apply, no runs, prefect coverage.</li>
            <li>The shipping was also very fast and even arrived a day early.</li>
            <li>This product is being offered free in exchange positive reviews by hundreds of bloggers - be careful when you see so many positive reviews in such a short space of time! -</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and the mask applies very easily and comes off with little effort, unlike other masks that seem to become part of your face only to find out later in the day that you had a huge chunk of it still on you.</li>
            <li>Washed off easily and agreed that it made his face feel a lot softer and his facial hair feel incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Plus, the sellers are super friendly and back thier product with a 100% money back garentee.</li>
            <li>This is the first product like this I have used, but my face felt incredibly soft after using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it multiple times and it looks like the jar is still full.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt; to see it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li>When I receive, the inner lip was open, the smell is strong, and my face feel hot after apply it.</li>
            <li>it is a bit of a strange smell &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell mixed with the fresh scent of eucalyptus but when I apply it on my face the scent is not that strong anymore.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying it out with the new scent!</li>
            <li>Left my face a little dry but did a great job cleaning up pores and left my face feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m sure this won&#x27;t apply to other people.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and was completely dry in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Then, mom said it is because the mud takes out the hidden sebum from skin, so I should try a couple more times.</li>
            <li>but my main reason for ordering this was because I have always had clogged pores in my nose/mouth area.</li>
            <li>Made with all natural ingredients &amp; left my skin feeling smooth and visably clearer.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a clay mask that you don&#x27;t have to mix together - not messy at all if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t particularly fond of it.</li>
            <li>Particularly, my arms and shoulders.</li>
            <li>Particularly, my arms and shoulders.</li>
            <li>When I remove it, I can see the black heads come to the surface of my skin and my skin feels so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I was only able to try this product once since their instructions claim it should only be used once per week.  </li>
            <li>I felt a tingle, mainly around my mouth as that&#x27;s my &amp;#34;problem area&amp;#34; but it didn&#x27;t burn and I like that feel as it signifies to me that it is doing something.</li>
            <li>This is a 6oz jar so it would last many uses with the proper application.</li>
            <li>First of all I love that it has Dead Sea Salt in it!</li>
            <li>My face felt so soft and smooth, and by the next morning, some of my blemishes were already gone.</li>
            <li>I am not a huge fan of the Barefaced Mud Mask, I have tried another one similar to this one and loved it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any adverse reactions, and it really helped clear out my skin and make it smoother!</li>
            <li>, I will put it on later, but for right now, this very moment, after having JUST washed it off my face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this mud mask to my friends.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this mask</li>
            <li>The mask wasn&#x27;t too tight on my face, which made for a pretty comfortable experience.</li>
            <li>If you are feeling a little more indulging you can use it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not recommend it if you have sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li>I could feel a little bit of tingling, which reassured me that it was working its magic.</li>
            <li>This mask left my skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>It feels relaxing, I love the scent, I love how it makes my face feel tight as it dries and how I can feel it pulling out all the stuff that&#x27;s trapped in my skin.</li>
            <li>More even skin tone, blemishes are few and far between, skin feels tight (in a good way) and pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li>The mud mask by Barefaced Skin Care is extremely soothing and leaves my skin feeling a whole new level of smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>the great smell started smelling stale and rancid...</li>
            <li>Great for random weekend relaxing nights.</li>
            <li>and this really helps heal the spots and make my skin SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin as it is very stimulating.</li>
            <li>He really loves products that leave his face soft without making them oily.</li>
            <li>But it applies very nicely, not as thick as it looks.</li>
            <li>I will never purchase a different brand as long as barefaced is available!</li>
            <li>I continued applying the mask to my face thinking this was normal.</li>
            <li>Have to use it a few more times.</li>
            <li>It was my normal face color, no welts.</li>
            <li>Relaxing, and it made my face feel fresh and deep cleaned afterwards.</li>
            <li>, I can not wait to get a few more uses out of it</li>
            <li>Hopefully--although I&#x27;m not sure if the product can do this--my acne scares can become completely effaced from my face and that the product continues to be just as effective.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it definitely makes my skin feel fresh and smooth!</li>
            <li>I wish I had read the 5 star reviews more closely and realized that they were not written by everyday Amazon shoppers who have purchased this mud mask.</li>
            <li>I cant wait to see the results from using the mask a few more times.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for over a week and guess what, I have broken out in the upper lip area after many many years</li>
            <li>After trying many many different mask on the market and finding them all to be full of false claims and irritating chemicals I am glad to say that I have found the one that I will be sticking with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was nice and thick, not runny at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a bit scared to be honest because some mud masks are very harsh and not recommended for sensitive skin, like I have.</li>
            <li>my face was super soft afterwards, pores visibly smaller and skin was not irritated.</li>
            <li>Most masks leave my face feeling overly taught and dry, but Barefaced is different.</li>
            <li>I honestly forgot I had it on, left it on for an hour and a half, instead of just the 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I left it on for about 10 minutes I made sure it was completely dry.</li>
            <li>It started to dry fairly quickly and turned kind of hard when done.  </li>
            <li>3 stars only because my skin is not the right type for this mask.</li>
            <li>Taking off the product was very simple as well, it came right off, with no fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased a jar right before my son was born, and it was left forgotten in a drawer in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I was definitely a little nervous about using it since I had never used any kind of facial product before</li>
            <li>I was an honest customer and this product was like throwing money down the toilet.</li>
            <li>However, I’m willing to try anything that helps me get a deep pore cleaning and helps with my high shine face and acne prone skin, and this face mask does just</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to try something new (nothing has ever worked for my skin) and</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying it out with the new scent!using</li>
            <li>Now I live in the desert where it is over 100 degrees this month.</li>
            <li>I am always trying to find a new mask to review.</li>
            <li>it tingles, and after you rinse it off you feel like you&#x27;re wearing brand new skin.  </li>
            <li>The new batch is still &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smelling, but does have a hint of mint scent that does improve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those lucky people, blessed with both the driest, Sahara Desert dry, and Oily, like BP oil spill oily skin types.</li>
            <li>I washed my face with a mild exfoliator, patted my skin dry, and went for this mud mask.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic dead sea product, highly recommend to men or women!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered that I like lotions, creams and serums for daily use and enjoy masks for occasional \\&quot;repair\\&quot; work.</li>
            <li>That was really the only thing I didn&#x27;t really like about the product.</li>
            <li>That was really the only thing I didn&#x27;t really like about the product.</li>
            <li>mask itself leaves my face very soft and visibly clears skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin was very soft and I believe it did was was described</li>
            <li>but I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, but this mask was a nightmare for me.</li>
            <li>It was easy to remove without leaving any mess.</li>
            <li>I have mentioned before the first thing I do when I get a new beauty product is open it and smell it.</li>
            <li>I applied the mask and it dried pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face once to twice a week, and my skin has never been this clear!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen results in my overall skin&#x27;s appearance since my first use.</li>
            <li>Finally finished my first jar</li>
            <li>First of all, my product was shipped almost instantly!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>So far, I am a fan!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started purchasing higher quality makeup products but also looking at various haircare and skincare products.</li>
            <li>Also I have really sensitive skin and had zero irritation from it!</li>
            <li>This is the first face mask that I have used where after I washed it off, my face was NOT red and irritated.</li>
            <li>Then mixed with a few organic ingredients, the mud is ready to work magic for your skin.</li>
            <li>If you are into masks with mostly natural ingredients and would like to try playing with mud on your face, then give this a try!  </li>
            <li>From the first time I used it my pores looked smaller and clearer.</li>
            <li>I love Dead Sea Mud Masks!</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, so I was worried that this would upset my skin, but it worked wonders!</li>
            <li>I usually never have a problem</li>
            <li>I only have experience of how my skin feels the same day, but I will update my review if I have any significant reactions or problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was SO soft!</li>
            <li>I would 100% recommend this product to other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brother: Into personal hygeine and takes more time than the basics.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mother: Had the exact same response as I did.</li>
            <li>I have combo skin and this product was exactly what I needed to bring back the dewiness and health to my face!</li>
            <li>The biggest difference that I noticed was the copious amounts of blackheads on my nose were nearly all the way gone!</li>
            <li>Use a dark towel for removal to avoid staining light fabrics.</li>
            <li>After I washed off the mask my skin was glowing and baby soft!</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft and I&#x27;ve stopped breaking out!  </li>
            <li>and I am far from being a teenager!</li>
            <li>I get a super dry feeling, like I have completely stripped my face of any oil traces.</li>
            <li>Dried within 15 minutes and washed off easily.</li>
            <li>a couple more times before I&#x27;m through anyway and as its actually midnight and therefore dark as heck</li>
            <li>It is thick enough to not drip during application but it seemed like I wasn&#x27;t able to apply very much at a time.</li>
            <li>Once I got past that initial reaction the cream was cool to my face which felt lovely in this hot hot weather lately</li>
            <li>As a mom with a limited income, I rarely get the chance to pamper myself.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After washing off the mask and lightly patting it dry, I saw that my skin was instantly brighter and glowing.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth... havent been using long enough to see long term results, but hoping it is all it promises to be, especially with winter coming</li>
            <li>Leaves  my skin feeling  smooth  and  tight</li>
            <li>time, as I used this product each week, I feel that I noticed a gradual increase in softness, and maybe even a more balanced skin tone with less redness, though it is hard to pinpoint since I use many facial products.</li>
            <li>Have previously used a dead sea mud mask and when I put it on, it actually felt like it was burning, so to not get the burning sensation was great.</li>
            <li>Usually masks like the &amp;#34;Queen Helene Facial Masque&amp;#34; or other pore refining masks, leave my skin very dry and cause flaking, but this mask leaves my skin perfectly moisturized.</li>
            <li>Used 1-3x weekly, and paired with a smart home care regimen, this mask is a deep cleansing, pore refining, skin brightening genius.</li>
            <li>It helped clear up my skin</li>
            <li>This Dead Sea mask is all natural and organic ingredients and Paraben free.  </li>
            <li>My face is clear and baby-smooth.</li>
            <li>Really cleansed my skin and left it so soft.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really having the opposite effect so far.</li>
            <li>Barefaced clearly cares about their product and customers.</li>
            <li>For some reason I started to break out before using this product however this product help clear up my face and stop the break outs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times, and I can tell that it really controls the oiliness of my skin and helps razor bumps disappear.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my face is radiant and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product twice and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>The mud took me about five minutes to wipe off completely.</li>
            <li>I gently touched my skin, and was instantly blinded, the pain fuzzing up my vision.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after each use.</li>
            <li>My face actually feels really refreshed after.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the container is quite big.</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old.  </li>
            <li>I have oily yet sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The next morning is when I really saw the results...</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>so you know it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft.</li>
            <li>I have developed some &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Not just soft... silky.</li>
            <li>silky soft skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this one was all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>I use the mask once a week and noticed after one use that my whiteheads were nearly gone.</li>
            <li>face will be smooth, firm and brighter!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>My face is as soft as a babies bottom.</li>
            <li>I do have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients are a plus for me.</li>
            <li>and it never ever irritated my extremely sensitive skin on all the times that I used it.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft.</li>
            <li>and it did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I had kept on my face until complete dryness, about 25 min.</li>
            <li>The consistency is also not as gross as real mud.</li>
            <li>My face felt refreshed after using the mask and my nose, which is constantly clogged with sebum, felt much smoother and clearer.  </li>
            <li>mud mask is 99% natural with one ingredient that isn&#x27;t natural.  </li>
            <li>If anything, I say my skin appears to have been breaking out slightly more than normal (could be due to other factors though).</li>
            <li>[I do not have sensitive skin though!!]&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>I sweat frequently as I move about outdoors.</li>
            <li>I like natural products that do not cause irritation of flakiness.</li>
            <li>I have tried this mud mask a few times now and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>My skin was soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling SO soft and</li>
            <li>My skin was soft to the touch, and it almost had a tingly feeling to it.</li>
            <li>This mask made my skin feel soft and supple after using it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need eucalyptus and mint on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say I have noticed any drastic changes but upon rinsing it off my face did feel a bit smoother and soft.</li>
            <li>After two times using, my skin feels soft and moristure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice so far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with acne that appears every now and then.</li>
            <li>Another thing about this mask is that it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>have oily/combination skin, so when I put this mask on, I was surprised how soothing this mask was.</li>
            <li>I opened up the mud mask and was pleasantly surprised by the smell.</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all - it&#x27;s a natural mud smell and texture.</li>
            <li>and it stimulated blood flow to my skin without making it sensitive afterwards.</li>
            <li>After using it, my skin feels so soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a complete bust</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this might be one mask that would work</li>
            <li>So far it seems it has helped with controlling eczema and break outs.</li>
            <li>That did not happen, so if you&#x27;re anything like me (with sensitive combination skin) you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far and have already seen a difference in the feel of my face.</li>
            <li>The mud mask made my face tingle and so soft.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s for: Non inflamed, non sensitive skin types in need of pore purging and skin</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the extra customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Also my 13 year old daughter used it and it helped with her acne.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li>– I advice that if you are scent sensitive, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>So I am a big of how much it has been doing for my skin and acne.</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients are what attracted me to it.</li>
            <li>Not harsh nor did I break out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 26 year old male who decided that I would start taking better care of my body and skin and ordered the Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>and while I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, my acne prone skin does seem to have gotten much better.</li>
            <li>In the last 2 years I have noticed considerable dullness of my skin, but so many products are too harsh for me.  </li>
            <li>Barefaced Mud Mask is all natural, organic, and paraben free Dead Sea</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft, smooth, toned, and my face hasn&#x27;t been oily in mornings since I started using Barefaced Dead Sea mud mask.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really enjoyed Barefaced Skincare&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>I do feel like my acne has lessened overall, and that my skin feels more firm in the 24 hours post-mask.</li>
            <li>when you take it off, its more like you just put on a thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It came off pretty easy except on the sides of my face where I had to scrub a little harder.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t a favorite to you.</li>
            <li>It goes on a slightly greenish color and smells quite nice with a minty fragrance and a slight tingle on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t achieved any positive long term changes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try a new skin care product!</li>
            <li>If I have a zit pop up at all, I just put a little on that one area, and it clears it right up!</li>
            <li>I did notice a little bit of a burning sensation as I let the mud sit on my face but nothing more than what I normally feel with any other type of mask.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer, face is less red, and just an overall healthy glow to my face.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling really clean without making it feel dried out.</li>
            <li>It left my face red at first</li>
            <li>I am a really big fan of this particular mud mask.</li>
            <li>Once it is on your face for the first few moments, your nose adapts and it doesn&#x27;t bother you too much.</li>
            <li>but i recently had a clogged pore that was pretty deep</li>
            <li>super tight</li>
            <li>I was glad, because at first I wondered if the thick texture might actually clog my pores and dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>I have an oily face and in the morning it still felt smooth, and not as oily as it usually would.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, so I was a little worried at first, but I just kept an eye on it, followed the directions, and it worked wonders!</li>
            <li>Dries hard, but is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I kept this is a cool dry place, only used it twice, got it out to use a third time</li>
            <li>t has this really dark mud color and after applying it I got right away this tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>I tend to massage it on with gentle circular motions and let it dry then rinse it off in the shower.</li>
            <li>was gentle enough to agree with my rosacea, so rosacea sufferers should definitely give this product a try.</li>
            <li>Feels fresh, and oddly MOISTERIZED.</li>
            <li>recommend Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask to anyone who wants to have fast result for almost no money.</li>
            <li>I have also got a lot less breakouts and as the ingredients are all natural its very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but the results are immediately noticeable!</li>
            <li>Probably because of the real dead sea mud and all the organic ingredients! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean up was a breeze (which is not always the case when it comes to washing dried mud off your face!).</li>
            <li>What it is: Deep pore cleansing mask formulated with mineral rich dead sea mud</li>
            <li>my lip was a little too sensitive for it and the first time i used it</li>
            <li>I noticed after about 3 uses, or a week and a half, my skin was much more clear and less acne was actually starting to form.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of face masks, mud masks and any other type of mask that I can sit back in the tub and let dry while I relax in my bubble bath or use a bath bomb.</li>
            <li>I felt a very tingly, warm sensation but not unbearable or unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>Seems to keep my face clear using only once a week!</li>
            <li>Smooth a small amount of mud over entire face, avoiding eye area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this mask twice, but i like it so far.</li>
            <li>It left my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>When I opened the jar I was surprised that this actually was mud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>You can simply feel your pores being naturally cleansed within seconds.</li>
            <li>I like the mask but was surprised the second time I opened</li>
            <li>/&gt;Formulas this stimulating tend to encourage pore purging - be prepared to experience occasional breakouts as skin purges, but look forward to experiencing far fewer breakouts when used as maintenance post adjustment</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after using - will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>but I could not get past the smell -- too honey sweet offish.  </li>
            <li>My face is pretty clean and I am ready to apply layer of mad mask.</li>
            <li>Absolutely helped my skin look noticeably clearer within the first few days, and I can&#x27;t wait to see that long term results!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure of its effectiveness because I only use it very rarely...</li>
            <li>Barefaced was SO responsive that they actually sent me a new batch that has a slightly different smell!</li>
            <li>I had hoped for more Dead Sea content and less fillers that irritate my face.</li>
            <li>It gave my skin very soft and deep moisturized feeling after only putting it for two days in a row.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not strong at all but is very clean and fresh and the mud itself is very thick</li>
            <li>I have a small acne breakout after the first use, but after that, it kept my skin really clear, and it looked like I was glowing!</li>
            <li>When I first opened it, I was slightly distracted by the consistency.</li>
            <li>At first, when I applied it to my face, I noticed a slight burning/tingling sensation on my lower chin/face area...</li>
            <li>and I noticed a slight improvement after my first try.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smoother and not dry!</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft and smooth,  not dry or tight like a lot of other masks tend to do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is stronger than other masks I tried and it really worked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t a negative comment nor a positive - it&#x27;s simply stating that if you prefer a certain texture, keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The texture and delicate scent alone are so luxurious and for once I really felt like I was using the real deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 25yr old male and this product definitely helped me!</li>
            <li>Plus, it is a deep, dark, greenish-brown color so you can see exactly where you placed it.</li>
            <li>a definite plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the product once so far</li>
            <li>A short time later my skin still felt soft and a bit dryer</li>
            <li>I applied the mud to my face, massaged slightly, and left it to dry for roughly 15 minutes, before rinsing it with warm water, and patting my face dry.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after I use it, and after only 3 uses, I can tell the pores around my nose are getting smaller, and I think the wrinkles on my forehead are a bit smoother.  </li>
            <li>Plus, with all natural and mostly organic ingredients, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>The mud actually feels like gooey and it doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh scent like the previous one I have tried which I mainly love about it.</li>
            <li>5-6 minutes is enough time to reap full benefit, 15 minutes is excessive.</li>
            <li>It did not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>After just 1 10-minute application of the Barefaced Mud Mask, my skin was very soft and my dry patches were almost non-existent.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little off-putting at first, but you learn tog et used to it.</li>
            <li>The mask itself dries very quickly and very hard.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling much softer and clearer than a lot of other face masks out there.  </li>
            <li>When I applied this product for the first time I found that the mask dried rapidly.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a noticeable difference in my skin after the first few uses.  </li>
            <li>It has pretty much dried out my skin</li>
            <li>Fast forward to today - baby is down for a nap</li>
            <li>The mask itself is very thick (think pudding), which makes it easy to cover your face.</li>
            <li>People with rosacea or broken blood vessels should not scrub those areas due to the masks grainy texture but can smooth it on gently.</li>
            <li>I waited for 15 minutes to completely let it dry</li>
            <li>but I have dry patch &amp; really sensitive around my cheeks</li>
            <li>After my face felt completely rid of the mud I patted my face dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried plenty of dead sea products in the past and this is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time trying new product because my skin is very prone to breaking out.  </li>
            <li>I really like they way it felt on my skin as it dried, like it was sucking all the bad stuff right out of my pores and my skin felt so soft and smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>and it certainly felt like it helped me apply it evenly and acknowledge the little crevices here</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who is suffering from acne, aging, dark spots, oil skin, dry skin, or for anyone that just wants a pick me up on their skin!</li>
            <li>I woke up with two of my preexisting blemishes dried out and a clearer, less blackhead filled nose.  </li>
            <li>After 15 minutes, I could feel the mask was tight and ready to wash off.</li>
            <li>It really makes your face feel tight and</li>
            <li>It only takes a little to cover the whole face and washes off with ease.</li>
            <li>This did make it hard to move your face and my dad had a laugh at me as I tried to eat a piece of bread.</li>
            <li>This stuff ... gets good and bad marks from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Absolutely in love with Baredfaced!!</li>
            <li> This product also has a very nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Very effective mask.</li>
            <li> But the results were very nice.</li>
            <li> Very nice texture.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing mask!</li>
            <li> This is amazing!</li>

            <li> This product has a really nice smell as well!</li>
            <li> Loved it!!Truly worked wonders!!!&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s so nice!</li>
            <li> Purchase at your own risk!</li>
            <li> I believe this is a wonderful business that cares about consumers &amp; as a very satisfied customer, I am more than happy to give them my support.</li>
            <li> Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest, but all mud masks--the good ones at least--are like that.</li>
            <li> Nothing pleasant, or anything you would want to put on your face.</li>
            <li> recommend this, and I will warn about the smell, it isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li> The smell was actually mostly pleasant to me</li>
            <li> For now, I honestly believe that in six months, as this product claims, my skin will be \\&quot;beautifully barefaced.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> The mud mask came off easily, and the result was great!</li>
            <li> Great product and feels amazing on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Amazing mud mask, my skin feels great after using it.</li>
            <li> It will get rid of that dullness leaving your face looking bright and</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s good to know what you are putting on</li>
            <li> A good marketing strategy deserves a 5-star.</li>
            <li> This feels really good on my face..</li>
            <li> I loved the smell.  </li>
            <li> As someone who doesn&#x27;t like overly fragrant products, that was actually a good thing for me.</li>
            <li> and I loved the results.</li>
            <li> (However, I have had skin reactions with those that smell good, and that could be the underlining factor.</li>
            <li> So that is good ...</li>
            <li> I washed it off and my face felt so good ...</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> Just switched from GlamGlow to this, and I loved the feel of my skin afterward with Barefaced.  </li>
            <li> and we both loved it.  </li>
            <li> I loved how well</li>
            <li> This is a good mud mask.</li>
            <li> I loved using it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this mask.</li>
            <li> For one it feels good when applied to my face, and neck area.</li>
            <li> Good mask.</li>
            <li> Tried this today and loved it.</li>
            <li> It is a good size jar plastic jar.</li>
            <li> But it is nothing a good non oily moisturizer</li>
            <li> Wonderful mask - I appreciate that the ingredients are all straightforward and good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> It helps clean your skin and feels great on it!.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that wants beautiful skin with beautiful results!</li>

            <li> I actually really liked the feel of it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really liked the product.</li>
            <li> But I primarily liked it because of the end result:</li>
            <li> Im loving this product.  </li>
            <li> The mask smells nice and earthy and</li>
            <li> and I kept the mask on for 15 minutes then rinsed it off in the sink with warm water.  </li>
            <li> To be honest I didn&#x27;t see any difference after washing off the mask.</li>
            <li> All opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
            <li> it smelled like nice spa smell.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice mask and feels spa quality.</li>
            <li> I was given this product in exchange for an honest review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> know I love a good facemask</li>
            <li> Skin feels nice after use.</li>
            <li> I received this mask for the purpose of review, but the opinions within are my own.</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice mask that I DIDNT have to mix.</li>
            <li> It feels nice going on</li>
            <li> It kind of reminded me of lemons.</li>
            <li> and he loved it too. : )</li>
            <li> I also liked the texture of this product -</li>
            <li> I liked the removal process.</li>
            <li> Also liked the smell.</li>
            <li> It has a nice aroma.</li>
            <li> After the 15 minutes, I used warm water and a wash cloth to remove the mud.</li>
            <li> This mask is excellent for a deep-pore cleanse and really softens the skin.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.  </li>
            <li> To me the mud is kind of watery which isn&#x27;t how mud is suppose to be, when I apply a product to my face I would like it to stay put and not be all watery feeling.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using the mask and will keep on using it to keep me in a good skin routine.</li>
            <li> I liked it.  </li>
            <li> Oh as its drying my face feels tighter and its still tingling but mostly in spots where I had blemishes, looking good</li>
            <li> all the oils and extracts are so nice.</li>
            <li> I will expect more good results with continued usage.</li>
            <li> I was given this product in return for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Honestly, Amazon, do you bother checking the reviews on here before they are posted?</li>
            <li> This had a nice clean feel to it and is a great way to treat yourself a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> This mask feels great on and washes away clean.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery, feels great, smells great, love the design and didnt break out afterwards.</li>
            <li> Loved this product loved the way it made my face feel and just felt really refreshed!!</li>
            <li> I was very happy to give this product a try because I am always looking for the masks that provide a fresh face with smooth skin and also works like cleaning pores and removing dirt/oil.</li>
            <li> &amp; I was extremely happy to have received it this quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am super happy with this.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact she loved it so much she stole it lol.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell super great</li>
            <li> Great product, came extremely fast and good quality.</li>
            <li> It has got a good strong smell...</li>
            <li> This mask has a very nice earthy aroma and feels cool on the face.</li>
            <li> The consistency seems a bit slimy but it applies very easy on skin.</li>
            <li> When I applied it the scent is still very strong to me, but it fades a bit as it dries.</li>
            <li> The tub it comes in is great, using a bear for the logo since this is &amp;#34;Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask&amp;#34; is very cute, and helps to make this a perfect beauty gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason a bear is on the tub of this mud mask is because it is made with a unique combination of minerals and salts that are great for our skin!eally love the smell of the mudmask.</li>
            <li> It was ok, nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li> I have used all sorts of mud mask, but this by far the best!</li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face the rest of the evening.</li>
            <li> my acne is getting better every time and the surface of my skin just looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I found that it worked perfectly for my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> It washes off easy!</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love love love this mask!</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> It smells good and comes off cleanly.</li>
            <li> smells good, but does not feel as clean as the cleanser should be.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about mud masks, but Great mud mask that smells nice and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> All of my client&#x27;s skin looked incredibly radiant after using Bearfaced mud mask and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to treat their face well.</li>
            <li> The company&#x27;s communication is honest and friendly, which is nice to see.</li>
            <li> I would happily try again once it runs out, thanks!</li>
            <li> and I felt very comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> She couldn&#x27;t stop touching her face and saying exactly how great it felt</li>
            <li> The clean sensation was nice but the soft, silkiness was awesome.    </li>
            <li> The mask was easy for her use and had a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Dries and then easily wipes off with a warm wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Smooth, and refreshingly tingly!  </li>
            <li> Dries super fast and smells great too :) Use it about once a week and immediately improves my skin and feel so good afterwards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You receive a HUGE tub of this mud mask!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan!</li>
            <li> For 15 minutes :) I love how it comes on as well as it comes off.</li>

            <li> Love the way my face feels after using this.  </li>
            <li> It is so refreshing</li>
            <li> What I like most is that it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s because it helps the blood flow for a better the complection.</li>
            <li> I love the tingle.</li>
            <li> I did feel a lot of tingling but it was focused more on my problem areas.</li>
            <li> With just one use, I have noticed a more even skin tone and softer skin.</li>
            <li> I still love this mask and am thinking about ordering more.  </li>
            <li> Love this face mask.</li>

            <li> My friend recommended this product and I got it for cheap, so I figured why not!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I could already feel the magic happening.</li>
            <li> Most masks leave you feeling like that for about 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I was able to try for nothing</li>
            <li> I LOVE it and would recommend the Barefaced mask to anyone with all types of skin</li>
            <li> , you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Its not horrible by any means</li>
            <li> Probably has to do more with me being &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will reorder once I reach the bottom.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Barefaced Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> This is just lovely.  </li>
            <li> I use this one the most out of my collection of face masks.</li>
            <li> I have used it a couple of times now and am a fan for sure.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this mask.</li>
            <li> Face never felt better</li>
            <li> At the age of 44, I&#x27;ve come to realize I need to treat my skin better than I have until this point.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li> mud mask dries to a more of a brown color.</li>
            <li> I just free balled it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works ok for oily skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a disgusting scent though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a spa day for me at home whenever I use it :)</li>
            <li> I also think being able to stir it is a plus to mix the mud.</li>
            <li> How cute is that packaging?</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the earthy, herbal smell.</li>
            <li> also, bears are cute.</li>
            <li> And the price is much better.  </li>
            <li> I like this even more because of the chemicals, or lack thereof, in the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> Great product, for the whole family.</li>
            <li> The texture looking much better</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing minty smell, which I am assuming is a combination of the Lavender, Aloe Vera, and Eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients,the scent and how it makes my skin look and feel, what more can you ask for from a mask??</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> I love the results from the face mud.  </li>
            <li> I love this face mud.</li>
            <li> so when I got the chance to try out the Barefaced one I jumped on the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned my face real good before using the mud mask, applied, and left on around 10 minutes as per the instructions.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
            <li> All and all in pretty impressed and cannot wait to see the results on both of us with some consistent use.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I decided to take better care of my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible but not something I want to deal with anymore.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearer, healthier, and just looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li> Please continue to put out such a great quality product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the mud very creamy and it felt great going on my skin.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it, but I seem to get better results from philosophy masks.  </li>
            <li> I would love to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I decided I wanted to try it out, and I couldn&#x27;t be more grateful.</li>
            <li> My skin felt incredibly supple and soft, and the size of my pores has visibly been reduced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 57 and have okay skin.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin looks and feels afterwards,</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar this morning, the top layer was covered in fuzzy mold.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer, clearer, and the coloring is somehow better.</li>
            <li> and it had mold all over the top.</li>
            <li> Most of all, it really does a great job on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed the smell of it, wasn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product for free, but all thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Note just because an item isn&#x27;t a favorite of mine</li>
            <li> and she ended up convincing me to give it a go as well</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hoping the more</li>
            <li> I received this mud mask free to try in return for an honest product review.</li>
            <li> When I looked into the product a bit more I found that it has all organic ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this to come off one more before shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I swear I&#x27;m going to break out more</li>
            <li> I keep touching my face though.</li>
            <li> -Reviewstuffzp touching my face though.</li>
            <li> It had a nice scent to it, very earthy with botanical undertones, which include sunflower, lavender, aloe, and eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing my face, I followed up with a Vitamin C serum, and a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product free for review purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Love A++ in my book</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smooth!</li>
            <li> My wife was also looking for ways to better control oil and break outs.</li>
            <li> Formula is not moisturizing, an appropriate moisturizer should follow removal.</li>
            <li> Most efficient removal is in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a licensed Esthetician and industry educator with a decade of hands on experience, I come across a ton of product, most of which is hype and loaded with extraneous ingredients.</li>
            <li> After I use it, my skin looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing and tingly.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the skin feeling so smooth afterwards!</li>
            <li> My husband even did a mud mask with me:)</li>
            <li> My complexion is brighter and tone is more even.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for a couple of weeks - it&#x27;s just a so-so product, nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> , it leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshed!</li>
            <li> Better than borghese mud.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I give it four stars is because it doesn&#x27;t smell awesome.  </li>

            <li> I love</li>
            <li> but if you have normal to oily skin that does not get irritated quickly this will work awesome.</li>
            <li> but right after the first use it was amazing !!</li>
            <li> will definitely buy more if I ever run out!!!</li>

            <li> I was given the chance to review this awesome Dead Sea Mud Mask from Barefaced Skincare, and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> (no painful burning or stinging though, just a nice tingly feeling).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice thick mask that clears out your skin and does an awesome job exfoliating your face since it has a grainy kind of texture.</li>

            <li> yet I was able to apply it easily</li>
            <li> I do want to add though if you are a type who can&#x27;t be around strong potent smells</li>
            <li> After I use it my face feels so smooth, moisturized, like I magically acquired better skin for the rest of the night.  </li>

            <li> Using the mask, I didn&#x27;t have any skin irritation, and after washing it off (which is easy to do)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply on your face.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and apply.</li>
            <li> My skin looked so healthy, hydrated, and incredibly clean.</li>
            <li> and I could feel a very mild calming tingling going on while it was drying.</li>
            <li> Dries easily.</li>
            <li> Smells strong and you can tell it&#x27;s earthy</li>
            <li> There scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> It has a strong medicinal scent and you can \\&quot;Feel\\&quot;</li>
            <li> After opening up the jar I noticed a strong scent-</li>
            <li> Skin felt smooth and clean afterwards!</li>
            <li> Smells great, good value, cleared up my skin and is very gentle so no nasty burning sensation like I get from other masks.</li>
            <li> This mud is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> When I first opened this jar, a nice smell drifted out that had me all amped up to try this mask.</li>
            <li> Honestly when I first bought it I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I have heard good things about dead sea treatments and this really has impressed me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know exactly what you are applying to your skin.</li>
            <li> It feels so cool and refreshing on the skin</li>
            <li> It feels so cool and refreshing on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and this is my first mask of any kind.</li>
            <li> But the results are impressive and very quick to show - clearer pores and less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I loved this face mask very easy to use and left my skin glowing and softer after just one use.  </li>
            <li> this is a really nice mask with very nice ingredients but this might not be the right mask for super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> smell wasn&#x27;t exactly the most appealing.</li>
            <li> it applies easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Smells fine too.</li>
            <li> its fine</li>
            <li> It felt great, and my skin afterwards feel soft and clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> (Okay... I&#x27;m super sweaty.)</li>
            <li> Super cute package too….</li>
            <li> it has a specific scent, which is ok for me, the consistency is quite surprising and jelly, easy to apply and after it dries it is also easy to wash it off.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the most appealing LOOKING, but if you can get over the initial texture, you will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great value for the cost, very high quality, and positive customer care.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slight (good) tingle, and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I felt a difference in my son after the very first time!</li>
            <li> It was fairly easy to wash off and it even came out of our hair pretty easily too, which I was worried about when I accidentally got some in my hair at the top of my forehead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Montagne Jeunesse men&#x27;s masks</li>
            <li> HUGE for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use this mask once a week from now on to make sure my skin is nice and clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure with frequent use it will look amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product that I&#x27;ll definitely use again!</li>
            <li> It was such a great price</li>
            <li> I now finally have found something that I&#x27;m really happy to use &amp; is much more economical than the Montagne Jeunesse ones</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> Skin was smooth and refreshed after.</li>
            <li> My skin feels refreshed and smooth like I&#x27;ve just been to the spa.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth &amp; supple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll tighten on your face and after about 15 minutes you&#x27;re free to wash it off.</li>
            <li> a fantastic job of getting all the dirt out of your pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try just about anything that will keep me blemish and wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great product</li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s great stuff</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell, but if you are opposed to putting mud on your face then this is not a product for you.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel SOOOO smooth.</li>
            <li> but fortunately it was time to remove it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and when I washed it off, my face felt so clean.</li>
            <li> I tend to look for products at a great price, so I decided I would see what Amazon had to offer in terms of facial masks.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mask.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and almost has a whipped texture to it.</li>
            <li> The tingle is fantastic and your skin will truly recover overnight.</li>
            <li> From a mother of three boys on a budget and don&#x27;t have time for facials at salons this will fit your bill.</li>
            <li> Was really happy with it and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> and this mask did an fantastic job in helping healing some of those.</li>
            <li> My face also felt so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, works wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> got it within 48 hours my order despite the fact that my order was under Free Shipping</li>
            <li> the price, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect that much.</li>
            <li> I had a minor acne breakout after the very first use, but after the very first use, it just kept my skin perfect!</li>
            <li> My face felt smooth.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Having such good luck with that made me even more excited about this</li>
            <li> I wish I could use the product  everyday , its a wonderful mask, its gentle on my very sensitive skin , and it smells superb, very earthy, this product not only makes me happy, but my face as well.</li>
            <li> thanks barefaced skincare!!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this mud mask, it really makes your face feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Feels good when applied and leaves skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> At that site I could not find where to get a free jar.. but not disappointed with product</li>
            <li> However, I used it that night, and was amazed at how smooth, clean, and balanced my acne prone/oily skin felt.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and rinses off clean.  </li>
            <li> and I have pretty sensitive skin, but it felt great on my skin</li>
            <li> but I also really wanted to try something new, &amp; I was happy with the results that I saw -</li>
            <li> makes my face feel very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast on your face and skin feels amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li> When I first smelled it in the jar, I wasn&#x27;t so sure, but once I had it on it</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Omg so I was excited to try this out because of the rave reviews</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple weeks and am pretty pleased.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I really love this mask as a whole!</li>
            <li> The texture is a mud/gel-like feel which is quite strange, but does a great job as a mask as you would expect.</li>
            <li> I was so excited.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I loved it!</li>
            <li> It has lavender oil, and eucalyptus, which is probably why I love this mask so much!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for my girlfriend</li>
            <li> 💙💙 makes my face feel so fresh!</li>
            <li> It does help clean out the pores.  </li>
            <li> It made my face feel really smooth and the shipping was really quick</li>
            <li> and then I can easily clean my face with towel.</li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling clean with a noticeable difference after a week or so of using.</li>
            <li> The mask left my skin feeling so clean and soft and it smells great!</li>
            <li> my face feels clean</li>
            <li> my face feels clean</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, works great so far.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, made my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I used this today for the first time, it smelled good, rinsed clean and my skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a light tingle while it&#x27;s working its magic (no harsh burn) and it comes off easily with water and a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> The clean sensation was nice but the soft, silkiness was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that this particular mask addresses those needs, however, I must speak to the way it made my skin look immediately renewed upon use!</li>
            <li> Has definitely cleared my skin up and given it a healthy smooth glow, there is definitely some beautiful natural magic in here !</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and clean right away.</li>
            <li> but I would say it&#x27;s more of a slate grey kind of color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works great for people who don&#x27;t have such sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I liked how all the ingredients are natural and organic.</li>
            <li> It has a cool feeling when applied and improves the appearance of skin.</li>
            <li> I had a face-full of Barefaced mud within days of placing my order, which only started things out on a good foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After drying my face and heading to bed, I woke up with smooth, fresh, and glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The NEXT DAY my skin still feels and looks good.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel good for the day and can see pores on nose have got smaller.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the intense minty feeling it has while its drying.</li>
            <li> But I primarily liked it because of the end result: silky soft skin.    </li>
            <li> I am a face mask aficionado and I have tried mud masks that would feel good upon initial use and then start burning as it dries on your face.</li>
            <li> For full product reviews, please check out my blog: laceituplove.blotspot.com</li>
            <li> A good facial is just about as close to a spa day as I can get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but loved the tingle</li>
            <li> I loved it, I have only used it once, and I can&lt;br /</li>
            <li> So I only buy things on Amazon if they have good reviews.</li>
            <li> but I waited the full recommended 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels terrific -</li>
            <li> As a licensed aesthetician, I&#x27;m constantly looking for good skin products to try on myself before I recommend them to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made the decision to purchase this product as it has proved very beneficial.</li>
            <li> Also it leaves it silky feeling, after years of sun exposure its nice to have soft skin.</li>
            <li> My oily skin doesn&#x27;t respond well to many masks and this made my pores so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I just like something quick &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> I use it both as a spot treatment for pimples that pop up or as a full restorative mask when I feel like my skin needs a reset.</li>
            <li> No bad residue or smell.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply, quickly dried and the fragrance when rinsing was great.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply, quickly dried and the fragrance when rinsing was great.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a natural, easy to use mask and this was one of the top results.</li>
            <li> The scent is extremely strong, but after the first use it is easier to get used to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After you let the mask dry you just wash it off with warm water!</li>
            <li> I chose this one due to the great price</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a great product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, compared to other mud masks, this one has a competitive price and is a great value.</li>
            <li> Fresh, and Clean.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the entire Barefaced Mud Mask experience from the application to my skin, feeling the mask cleaning and exfoliating, and leaving my face even more radiant.</li>
            <li> Like my cheeks are super tender</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and nourished after using, and love how natural the product is.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t go through this rather quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Texture: As I said, I&#x27;ve tried several and this one has more of a goopy texture than many of the others.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It came quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and it seems to do a good job at keeping my skin clear along with a healthy diet and clean pillow cases regularly.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and thick, smells really good for a mud mask as well.</li>
            <li> Loved this mask so much it made my face feel soft and detoxified.</li>
            <li> This is a quick skin treatment that I look forward to using.</li>
            <li> I found my face felt very clean and tight (in a good way) afterwards.</li>
            <li> There was a healthy glow and was very soft!</li>
            <li> I will mostly repurchase and add this to my normal skin routine going forward.</li>
            <li> I have only used the mask twice, so I&#x27;m unsure if it prevents or treats breakouts and/or aging, but I can say that after I use it my skin is glowing and looks very healthy.  </li>
            <li> , I am not so impressed at all because this mask gave me rashes on my skin and there was no good effect about it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased and will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell was very mild, which is nice since I try to avoid highly fragrant products on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great product that left my skin feeling clean and clear!</li>
            <li> Love the fresh clean smell and it helped to clear some blemishes!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty large tub and even better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance to try a new product and the results have been wonderful!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is probably my new favorite mask.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I have a new favorite.</li>
            <li> I found that it does not have a strong scent, which I really prefer, if I am going to be leaving a mask on my face for fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li> In regards to the actual product, i love it!</li>
            <li> My skin felt so refreshed after the first use!  </li>
            <li> Mud masks are excellent to incorporate in to your skincare routine because Dead Sea mud is full of nutrients, salt and natural minerals that are shown to have healing properties for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I must admit I felt kinda funny smearing &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; on my face although it is a practice that has been used for ages!</li>
            <li> My pores size has reduced significantly and my skin is much clearer!  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> so I was pretty excited about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this all natural product!  </li>
            <li> Just after the first use!</li>
            <li> I love the way it dries and tightens and when I was it off, my skin appears fresh and new.</li>
            <li> Potent in smell but super natural.</li>
            <li> However if you can deal with the wonky smell for 15 minutes to achieve beautiful hydrated skin then it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> least this will smell pleasant!</li>
            <li> It is great for an at home spa day or a little face pick me up.</li>
            <li> After leaving it on for recommended amount of time, I was very pleased at how easy it was to remove even though it had harden upon drying (which is typical of masks).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mask to anyone who is looking for a weekly skin treatment that is simple and effective!</li>
            <li> Happy all round and well worth a try, would recommend.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel great and removes excess dirt and dead skin.  </li>
            <li> However, for those of us with mature skin, I would not recommend using this more than once a week.  </li>
            <li> A thin layer works best.</li>
            <li> Best kept secret is this face mask.</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling soft and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to have a mud mask every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Feels soft, smooth and refreshed!</li>
            <li> Smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I originally liked this product because of the bear as a joke, but decided to actually try it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really liked the product.</li>
            <li> I am thankful that I received a complimentary sample for review purposes.</li>
            <li> &gt; always love to find products that are 100% natural.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth investing in.</li>
            <li> Where when you smile, it feels like your face is flaking off?</li>
            <li> To apply, just add the mud to a freshly cleansed face and leave on for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love that it is made with 100% Natural &amp; Organic ingredients and the value is unbeatable.  </li>
            <li> You will have a lot of fun doing it.  </li>
            <li> These results are worth dealing with the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was not really crazy about the smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once a week for 4 weeks and it works ok to clear my pores a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for organic, cruelty free products and Barefaced Facial Mud Mask was just that and more.  </li>
            <li> I also have eczema so that makes my skin even more sensitive.</li>
            <li> I had never tried any kind of facial or mud mask before ordering this.</li>
            <li> but I think the essential oils they use to scent it counteract that nicely so its not an issue</li>
            <li> but I think the essential oils they use to scent it counteract that nicely so its not an issue</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using tomoson.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh feeling of mint and eucalyptus, which stays after you rinse the mas off.</li>
            <li> first impression when using this was, “WOW”- the scent is STRONG!</li>
            <li> This product is great used with my facial oils ( rose hip &amp; raw coconut), and is now a permanent resident in my face care regime.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, it did not burn like most other things I have tried on my face and was actually enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> However I am realistic that it will take a few uses and nothing is a miracle worker, but I&#x27;m sure it will do some good in that aspect as well.</li>
            <li> But it has a refreshing scent with a dark colored clay that was very smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin which Is the main cause for my acne, but my skin has drastically gotten better with this product.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft, clean and looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It left my skin feeling clean and so smooth!</li>
            <li> Smooth, smells clean, made my skin soft and pores visibly cleaner/smaller.</li>
            <li> in fact, I think it is very clean and natural smelling.  </li>
            <li> Got here fast, excited to use it.</li>
            <li> Again, I see this as a good thing, as it ensures that the effective ingredients are getting deep down where they need to be to do their thing.</li>
            <li> but I would prefer something nicer as I use this right before I go to bed</li>
            <li> Cleared my psoriasis right up.</li>
            <li> skin has never been healthier than it is right</li>
            <li> It has an interesting smell, not bad enough to bother me or anything.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and clean my skin is after I remove the mask with a warm, wet wash cloth!!</li>
            <li> , that means you need to take all of these high reviews with a grain of salt since everyone is getting a free jar for reviewing...</li>
            <li> My face is so soft and clean!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wash off and leaves the skin fresh, soft, and silky.</li>
            <li> Its smooth and has a real natural scent.</li>
            <li> I have had great experiences with mud masks in the past, so I jumped at the opportunity to review this one.</li>
            <li> so I followed up with my normal nightly moisturizer and it feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> Its fair priced compared to other products in this category and does exactly what it advertises, no gimmicks, just results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far, but my face felt cool, clean, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as other products at 3X the price!</li>
            <li> It wiped off extremely easily, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance: Many other reviewers said they could smell lavender.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using beauty products and trying new things</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product and company, especially with their great and responsive costumer service.</li>
            <li> We moved to Louisiana recently and my once great skin turned in to that of a teen going through puberty!</li>
            <li> Mild because I will start oozing oil out of my pores with too much lotion,</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free jar of Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The main difference is when you clean it off your face.</li>
            <li> The packaging says to keep the mask on for 15 minutes and rinse dry with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my skin felt super soft and really clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This mask really tightens quickly.</li>
            <li> This not only is that it also smells amazing, really get the mint.</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes, I washed it off with warm water and patted my face dry.</li>
            <li> He said there was no problem removing it and loved the feel after and thought his razor burn looked less irritated on his neck from shaving that morning.</li>
            <li> BUT NOT for my sensitive &amp; finicky skin, my skin is still bright red</li>
            <li> I recently tried an exfoliator with salt from the dead sea and it has been wonderful for my skin.</li>
            <li> The container says to apply with dry hands and to let the mud mask stay on your face for 10 minutes, then rinse with warm water and pat</li>
            <li> It has a cool,  slightly tingling feeling, but I liked it.  </li>
            <li> It has a very VERY VERY earthy scent.</li>
            <li> I have to scrub a little with warm water to get my face clean.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy facial masks and my favorite are ones that contain Dead Sea mud, this one has it and its the first ingredient, all ingredients are amazing.</li>
            <li> Barefaced was nice enough to send me their Dead Sea Mud Mask to test out for them and I have to say I really love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Will post another review after a few more uses, but so far, I love it!</li>
            <li> My skin felt really clean, fresh, and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it only once, but my face feels unbelievably clean, smooth and tingly.</li>
            <li> After my first use today, my skin feels smoother and is glowing.</li>
            <li> and I was used to paying loads more for similar products.</li>
            <li> My face feels so much smoother after one use!</li>
            <li> My skin feels much happier after a mask!</li>
            <li> - just remember to not use too much of it though!</li>
            <li> I really like!</li>
            <li> Definitely going to make my boyfriend use it :)</li>
            <li> So many different masks on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have had acne for many years and its persistent, if I let up it will come back, but this keeps it at bay the longest compared to anything I&#x27;ve used (and thats a lot of products)</li>
            <li> First time trying a mud mask- smells minty and has a cooling factor on my face.</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using any type of &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; mask</li>
            <li> I have pretty acne prone skin that I have been battling since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> It was shipped pretty fast!</li>
            <li> First thing</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I have lost ages just after first use, wrinkles visible got softer and pores almost disappear.</li>
            <li> You can either use a warm wet towel or washed without towel, it&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li> I love when you can feel that in a facial product.</li>
            <li> I could tell after the first use that my skin was smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li> The mud mask isn&#x27;t too overwhelming and the effect is equivalent to a spa facial.</li>
            <li> What immediately stood out to me about this mud mask was definitely the cute bear on the tub of it.</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing!</li>
            <li> When I first went to use this, I almost couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Really earthy...like mud!</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed a difference in the appearance of my pores after the first application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered 2 to last me.</li>
            <li> It has been four weeks since I&#x27;ve been consistently using their product, and I can already see immediate results.</li>
            <li> In lieu of all these benefits, I haven&#x27;t really experienced any negative effects.</li>
            <li> There are no weird sounding ingredients in here, that any consumer should be worried about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Everywhere I looked, I saw outstanding reviews, and I saw claims that it helped with acne and facial imperfections.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Apologies to Barefaced Skincare who seem genuinely interested in pleasing their customers....</li>
            <li> Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Alright see y&#x27;all in well the pm most likely since its am now lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Alright see y&#x27;all in well the pm most likely since its am now lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to others, thanks a million Barefaced!</li>
            <li> After rinsing my skin felt smooth and soft and I noticed a reduction in the size of my pores.  </li>
            <li> Used this mud mask for the first time tonight</li>
            <li> In my first try, my skin got irritated and became reddish all over.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of the scent at first</li>
            <li> Sometimes, you just need to pamper yourself ;)</li>
            <li> Application was very easy, and it almost leaves you with a serene spa-like feeling as you wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> The mask took about 15 minutes to dry and was very easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li> However, it works really really well, and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> And everyone is right, you don&#x27;t need as much as you think you do.</li>
            <li> My normal routine consists of alternating face wash and exfoliaters, followed by a mild moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The mask has a small lite pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> It was initially easy to apply, but if you don&#x27;t apply it fast enough while massaging, it will start to crack, so work quickly and try not to go over areas you have already gotten.</li>
            <li> It dried pretty quick and clean up was easy.</li>
            <li> After I take it off, my skin feels very soft and noticeable looks more even toned, good for dark spots left by acne.</li>
            <li> Smelled much better than previously used mud masks and my face felt clean and renewed after using.</li>
            <li> It washed off easily with a soft cloth and left me skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Immediately after using the mask my skin felt clean and soft.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to use it more to really see the lasting benefits.</li>
            <li> I would recommend, if you have sensitive skin to test an area on your face first before leave it on for the full 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> It did not take much of the product to be able to cover my face entirely.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product--love how it makes my skin soft and pores smaller!</li>
            <li> the lavender oil seems to be the most obvious which I really like.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> A little more than I would usually spend, but I&#x27;m happy to have finally found a mask that I really enjoy using!</li>
            <li> The smooth, creamy mask goes on smoothly and evenly, unlike a lot of other mud masks I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> : This is the first mask I have tried that said to gently massage the product into the skin.</li>
            <li> As for my gigantic pores, I have not seen much of a change there, although I noticed that other reviewers have claimed to see a nice</li>
            <li> Stings your skin while on and during removal, but leaves your skill felling cool soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It just feels fresh and clean as soon as you open the jar.</li>
            <li> The jar has many treatments in it as well, so once a week is realistic, and it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> did receive this product complimentary to give my full and honest opinion, whether it be positive or negative!</li>
            <li> I have used Dead Sea Facial Mud Mask 4 times now, my facial tone is much better, pore size has reduced and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t pass it up all the way because then I&#x27;ll get lovely dry skin flakes.</li>
            <li> Relaxing scent and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Been looking for an all-natural mud mask that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like SO many others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I honestly feel my pores are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars if it didn&#x27;t have such a strong scent to it.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong eculyptus odor, it did make my eyes water a little the first couple of times I used it, and definitely cleared my sinus lol, by the 3rd time</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase this again</li>
            <li> I am certainly adding this to my beauty regime.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the #1 smart aging product on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can say I&#x27;ve seen absolutely zero positive results.</li>
            <li> Another positive is the shipping was really fast</li>
            <li> I have SUPER sensitive skin, so I was very tentative when I tried this.</li>
            <li> Firstly there&#x27;s loads in this jar so I&#x27;ll definitely get my moneys worth out of this this stuff!</li>
            <li> Another PLUS, when you order, they give you a 50 % code off your next purchase for just being loyal!</li>

            <li> I was looking for a new product to replace an old favorite for rainy days—the Barefaced Dead Sea Mask fits the bill and more.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Overall, its a fantastic product that leaves my skin feeling pure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little astringent, which is great for teenage skin</li>
            <li> Mud may be manipulated lightly over skin while formula is still creamy, to experience a gentle physical exfoliation.</li>
            <li> that after searching and buying expensive products for something that can help clear my skin, a once or twice a week regiment has helped me find the perfect skin balance that I have always wanted.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how much I recommmend this mask-</li>
            <li> Thanks for creating a quality skin care product that lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> My face felt very refreshed</li>
            <li> only problem is it comes with a card offering a free jar if you go to the Web site.</li>
            <li> My skin felt much softer &amp; smoother after use</li>
            <li> Would absolutely recommend buying this mask.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and creamy..not gritty at all.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> It has a citrus smell that is really pleseant.</li>
            <li> I have been using the mask for 3 weeks now and the texture of my skin has really improved.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My skin was noticeably softer and I didn&#x27;t need to layer on an intense moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference after the 1st application but</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t have any issues with acne</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to use that much</li>
            <li> It left my face refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> I can see some already but highly recommend to any guys out there!</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.  </li>
            <li> not helpful at all, smell so bed and very greasy after use it.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, which can get very oily in warmer weather.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much</li>
            <li> and you really feel it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another thing I noticed, isn&#x27;t really something you should ...</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Another thing I noticed, isn&#x27;t really something you should ...</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny, as it works like a champ on my sensitive and problematic skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and then straightly went to shower.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for the required amount of time, and yes I can really feel it working.</li>
            <li> It leaves a silky smooth feeling where you feel like a moisturizer is not really necessary.  </li>
            <li> The texture has a bit of grittiness to it and it dries rather fast, within 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have to moisturize after using although this is pretty normal with face masks in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Also a really reasonable price for the quality you get.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by telling you that this Mud Mask is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This has a very earthy scent that lingers for some time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your face, so the jar lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> and her skin was much smoother after she used it.</li>
            <li> and it was much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for men who like to take care of their skin in a manly way!</li>
            <li> In addition, the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> This mask is the real deal...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> now it doesn&#x27;t look like much in the photos, but</li>
            <li> but it has no artificial fragrances so its completely &amp;#34;bare-ble&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It really cleans my skin, it helped me a lot with my whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.</li>
            <li> Get ready to either hold your breath for 15 minutes or spend that time gagging.</li>
            <li> Works really well with my skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the real deal I just got it today</li>
            <li> I will be getting another one soon because my mother wants it .</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I personally really like the smell</li>
            <li> This works very well for both.</li>
            <li> LOVE that so many of the ingredients are organic, and that the mud is actually from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> and we both really like it.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try it twice before I gave a review to really see how my skin would react.</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast and as described.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I could really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that it didn&#x27;t have much of a smell-</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It has an earthy scent, which I expect of a mud mask, because it lets me know that it is real.</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Your follow up regarding my feedback is appreciated.</li>
            <li> I really like this mud mask.</li>
            <li> and I have to use twice as much moisturizer now.</li>
            <li> Ultra fast delivery</li>
            <li> My face feels very refreshed after using this.  </li>
            <li> There are all natural ingredients and the smell is interesting and soothing at the same time.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, as soon as I got it wet 15 minutes later to rinse, I LOVED the scent</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I have always liked anything with dead sea mud.</li>
            <li> I was actually expecting more of a glow from something so natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing because the mask absorbed all that nastiness out of them as it dried and my skin feels nice and soft and</li>
            <li> first couple of uses, as any new product introduced to the skin could.</li>
            <li> The 2nd week and on I left it on for the full 15 minutes since everything was fine after the 1st use.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li> but I have learned that this is good because it usually means it has all natural products with no perfumes in it!</li>
            <li> , I pretty much used what was left on the jar cover for my first application, not even really dipping into the jar itself!</li>
            <li> In particular, my acne scars are even becoming less noticeable and I&#x27;ve mostly stopped breaking-out with regular use of this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products, BUT I am in love with the way my face looks and feels after using this mud mask!</li>
            <li> When I first apply it to my face it feels tingly and after washing off my skin is SO SOFT!</li>
            <li> Unlike other mud masks that have irritated my skin during application, this one does not, and I love the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to continue using this product, and I would recommend this to anyone thinking of buy a facial mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to  continue trying it once a week to see how my skin feels after multiple uses!</li>
            <li> Upon using the mud mask and waking up the next morning, I noticed a significant difference on the impact that it had on the acne.</li>
            <li> I have never been fond of the ones that have so many other ingredients in them, that they just smell like fragrance.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve received the mud mask about a week and half ago and so far, I love it!</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve had much better success using a sulfur-based masks for acne-prevention.</li>
            <li> The mask works great and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Barefaced Dead Sea Mud mask has a gel-like consistency and very easy to apply, no runs, prefect coverage.</li>
            <li> The shipping was also very fast and even arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> This product is being offered free in exchange positive reviews by hundreds of bloggers - be careful when you see so many positive reviews in such a short space of time! -</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and the mask applies very easily and comes off with little effort, unlike other masks that seem to become part of your face only to find out later in the day that you had a huge chunk of it still on you.</li>
            <li> Washed off easily and agreed that it made his face feel a lot softer and his facial hair feel incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Plus, the sellers are super friendly and back thier product with a 100% money back garentee.</li>
            <li> This is the first product like this I have used, but my face felt incredibly soft after using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it multiple times and it looks like the jar is still full.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt; to see it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li> When I receive, the inner lip was open, the smell is strong, and my face feel hot after apply it.</li>
            <li> it is a bit of a strange smell &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell mixed with the fresh scent of eucalyptus but when I apply it on my face the scent is not that strong anymore.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying it out with the new scent!</li>
            <li> Left my face a little dry but did a great job cleaning up pores and left my face feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m sure this won&#x27;t apply to other people.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly and was completely dry in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Then, mom said it is because the mud takes out the hidden sebum from skin, so I should try a couple more times.</li>
            <li> but my main reason for ordering this was because I have always had clogged pores in my nose/mouth area.</li>
            <li> Made with all natural ingredients &amp; left my skin feeling smooth and visably clearer.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s a clay mask that you don&#x27;t have to mix together - not messy at all if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t particularly fond of it.</li>
            <li> Particularly, my arms and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Particularly, my arms and shoulders.</li>
            <li> When I remove it, I can see the black heads come to the surface of my skin and my skin feels so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I was only able to try this product once since their instructions claim it should only be used once per week.  </li>
            <li> I felt a tingle, mainly around my mouth as that&#x27;s my &amp;#34;problem area&amp;#34; but it didn&#x27;t burn and I like that feel as it signifies to me that it is doing something.</li>
            <li> This is a 6oz jar so it would last many uses with the proper application.</li>
            <li> First of all I love that it has Dead Sea Salt in it!</li>
            <li> My face felt so soft and smooth, and by the next morning, some of my blemishes were already gone.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the Barefaced Mud Mask, I have tried another one similar to this one and loved it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any adverse reactions, and it really helped clear out my skin and make it smoother!</li>
            <li> , I will put it on later, but for right now, this very moment, after having JUST washed it off my face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for anyone looking to cleanse and/or nourish their skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mud mask to my friends.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this mask</li>
            <li> The mask wasn&#x27;t too tight on my face, which made for a pretty comfortable experience.</li>
            <li> If you are feeling a little more indulging you can use it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not recommend it if you have sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li> I could feel a little bit of tingling, which reassured me that it was working its magic.</li>
            <li> This mask left my skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> It feels relaxing, I love the scent, I love how it makes my face feel tight as it dries and how I can feel it pulling out all the stuff that&#x27;s trapped in my skin.</li>
            <li> More even skin tone, blemishes are few and far between, skin feels tight (in a good way) and pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li> The mud mask by Barefaced Skin Care is extremely soothing and leaves my skin feeling a whole new level of smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> the great smell started smelling stale and rancid...</li>
            <li> Great for random weekend relaxing nights.</li>
            <li> and this really helps heal the spots and make my skin SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin as it is very stimulating.</li>
            <li> He really loves products that leave his face soft without making them oily.</li>
            <li> But it applies very nicely, not as thick as it looks.</li>
            <li> I will never purchase a different brand as long as barefaced is available!</li>
            <li> I continued applying the mask to my face thinking this was normal.</li>
            <li> Have to use it a few more times.</li>
            <li> It was my normal face color, no welts.</li>
            <li> Relaxing, and it made my face feel fresh and deep cleaned afterwards.</li>
            <li> , I can not wait to get a few more uses out of it</li>
            <li> Hopefully--although I&#x27;m not sure if the product can do this--my acne scares can become completely effaced from my face and that the product continues to be just as effective.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it definitely makes my skin feel fresh and smooth!</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the 5 star reviews more closely and realized that they were not written by everyday Amazon shoppers who have purchased this mud mask.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to see the results from using the mask a few more times.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a week and guess what, I have broken out in the upper lip area after many many years</li>
            <li> After trying many many different mask on the market and finding them all to be full of false claims and irritating chemicals I am glad to say that I have found the one that I will be sticking with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was nice and thick, not runny at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit scared to be honest because some mud masks are very harsh and not recommended for sensitive skin, like I have.</li>
            <li> my face was super soft afterwards, pores visibly smaller and skin was not irritated.</li>
            <li> Most masks leave my face feeling overly taught and dry, but Barefaced is different.</li>
            <li> I honestly forgot I had it on, left it on for an hour and a half, instead of just the 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 10 minutes I made sure it was completely dry.</li>
            <li> It started to dry fairly quickly and turned kind of hard when done.  </li>
            <li> 3 stars only because my skin is not the right type for this mask.</li>
            <li> Taking off the product was very simple as well, it came right off, with no fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased a jar right before my son was born, and it was left forgotten in a drawer in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I was definitely a little nervous about using it since I had never used any kind of facial product before</li>
            <li> I was an honest customer and this product was like throwing money down the toilet.</li>
            <li> However, I’m willing to try anything that helps me get a deep pore cleaning and helps with my high shine face and acne prone skin, and this face mask does just</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to try something new (nothing has ever worked for my skin) and</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying it out with the new scent!using</li>
            <li> Now I live in the desert where it is over 100 degrees this month.</li>
            <li> I am always trying to find a new mask to review.</li>
            <li> it tingles, and after you rinse it off you feel like you&#x27;re wearing brand new skin.  </li>
            <li> The new batch is still &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smelling, but does have a hint of mint scent that does improve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those lucky people, blessed with both the driest, Sahara Desert dry, and Oily, like BP oil spill oily skin types.</li>
            <li> I washed my face with a mild exfoliator, patted my skin dry, and went for this mud mask.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic dead sea product, highly recommend to men or women!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered that I like lotions, creams and serums for daily use and enjoy masks for occasional \\&quot;repair\\&quot; work.</li>
            <li> That was really the only thing I didn&#x27;t really like about the product.</li>
            <li> That was really the only thing I didn&#x27;t really like about the product.</li>
            <li> mask itself leaves my face very soft and visibly clears skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin was very soft and I believe it did was was described</li>
            <li> but I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, but this mask was a nightmare for me.</li>
            <li> It was easy to remove without leaving any mess.</li>
            <li> I have mentioned before the first thing I do when I get a new beauty product is open it and smell it.</li>
            <li> I applied the mask and it dried pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face once to twice a week, and my skin has never been this clear!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen results in my overall skin&#x27;s appearance since my first use.</li>
            <li> Finally finished my first jar</li>
            <li> First of all, my product was shipped almost instantly!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> So far, I am a fan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started purchasing higher quality makeup products but also looking at various haircare and skincare products.</li>
            <li> Also I have really sensitive skin and had zero irritation from it!</li>
            <li> This is the first face mask that I have used where after I washed it off, my face was NOT red and irritated.</li>
            <li> Then mixed with a few organic ingredients, the mud is ready to work magic for your skin.</li>
            <li> If you are into masks with mostly natural ingredients and would like to try playing with mud on your face, then give this a try!  </li>
            <li> From the first time I used it my pores looked smaller and clearer.</li>
            <li> I love Dead Sea Mud Masks!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, so I was worried that this would upset my skin, but it worked wonders!</li>
            <li> I usually never have a problem</li>
            <li> I only have experience of how my skin feels the same day, but I will update my review if I have any significant reactions or problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was SO soft!</li>
            <li> I would 100% recommend this product to other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brother: Into personal hygeine and takes more time than the basics.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mother: Had the exact same response as I did.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin and this product was exactly what I needed to bring back the dewiness and health to my face!</li>
            <li> The biggest difference that I noticed was the copious amounts of blackheads on my nose were nearly all the way gone!</li>
            <li> Use a dark towel for removal to avoid staining light fabrics.</li>
            <li> After I washed off the mask my skin was glowing and baby soft!</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft and I&#x27;ve stopped breaking out!  </li>
            <li> and I am far from being a teenager!</li>
            <li> I get a super dry feeling, like I have completely stripped my face of any oil traces.</li>
            <li> Dried within 15 minutes and washed off easily.</li>
            <li> a couple more times before I&#x27;m through anyway and as its actually midnight and therefore dark as heck</li>
            <li> It is thick enough to not drip during application but it seemed like I wasn&#x27;t able to apply very much at a time.</li>
            <li> Once I got past that initial reaction the cream was cool to my face which felt lovely in this hot hot weather lately</li>
            <li> As a mom with a limited income, I rarely get the chance to pamper myself.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing off the mask and lightly patting it dry, I saw that my skin was instantly brighter and glowing.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth... havent been using long enough to see long term results, but hoping it is all it promises to be, especially with winter coming</li>
            <li> Leaves  my skin feeling  smooth  and  tight</li>
            <li> time, as I used this product each week, I feel that I noticed a gradual increase in softness, and maybe even a more balanced skin tone with less redness, though it is hard to pinpoint since I use many facial products.</li>
            <li> Have previously used a dead sea mud mask and when I put it on, it actually felt like it was burning, so to not get the burning sensation was great.</li>
            <li> Usually masks like the &amp;#34;Queen Helene Facial Masque&amp;#34; or other pore refining masks, leave my skin very dry and cause flaking, but this mask leaves my skin perfectly moisturized.</li>
            <li> Used 1-3x weekly, and paired with a smart home care regimen, this mask is a deep cleansing, pore refining, skin brightening genius.</li>
            <li> It helped clear up my skin</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea mask is all natural and organic ingredients and Paraben free.  </li>
            <li> My face is clear and baby-smooth.</li>
            <li> Really cleansed my skin and left it so soft.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really having the opposite effect so far.</li>
            <li> Barefaced clearly cares about their product and customers.</li>
            <li> For some reason I started to break out before using this product however this product help clear up my face and stop the break outs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times, and I can tell that it really controls the oiliness of my skin and helps razor bumps disappear.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my face is radiant and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product twice and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> The mud took me about five minutes to wipe off completely.</li>
            <li> I gently touched my skin, and was instantly blinded, the pain fuzzing up my vision.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after each use.</li>
            <li> My face actually feels really refreshed after.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the container is quite big.</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old.  </li>
            <li> I have oily yet sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The next morning is when I really saw the results...</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> so you know it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft.</li>
            <li> I have developed some &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not just soft... silky.</li>
            <li> silky soft skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one was all natural and organic.</li>
            <li> I use the mask once a week and noticed after one use that my whiteheads were nearly gone.</li>
            <li> face will be smooth, firm and brighter!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> My face is as soft as a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> I do have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients are a plus for me.</li>
            <li> and it never ever irritated my extremely sensitive skin on all the times that I used it.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft.</li>
            <li> and it did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had kept on my face until complete dryness, about 25 min.</li>
            <li> The consistency is also not as gross as real mud.</li>
            <li> My face felt refreshed after using the mask and my nose, which is constantly clogged with sebum, felt much smoother and clearer.  </li>
            <li> mud mask is 99% natural with one ingredient that isn&#x27;t natural.  </li>
            <li> If anything, I say my skin appears to have been breaking out slightly more than normal (could be due to other factors though).</li>
            <li> [I do not have sensitive skin though!!]&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> I sweat frequently as I move about outdoors.</li>
            <li> I like natural products that do not cause irritation of flakiness.</li>
            <li> I have tried this mud mask a few times now and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> My skin was soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling SO soft and</li>
            <li> My skin was soft to the touch, and it almost had a tingly feeling to it.</li>
            <li> This mask made my skin feel soft and supple after using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need eucalyptus and mint on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say I have noticed any drastic changes but upon rinsing it off my face did feel a bit smoother and soft.</li>
            <li> After two times using, my skin feels soft and moristure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice so far.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with acne that appears every now and then.</li>
            <li> Another thing about this mask is that it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> have oily/combination skin, so when I put this mask on, I was surprised how soothing this mask was.</li>
            <li> I opened up the mud mask and was pleasantly surprised by the smell.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all - it&#x27;s a natural mud smell and texture.</li>
            <li> and it stimulated blood flow to my skin without making it sensitive afterwards.</li>
            <li> After using it, my skin feels so soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a complete bust</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this might be one mask that would work</li>
            <li> So far it seems it has helped with controlling eczema and break outs.</li>
            <li> That did not happen, so if you&#x27;re anything like me (with sensitive combination skin) you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far and have already seen a difference in the feel of my face.</li>
            <li> The mud mask made my face tingle and so soft.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s for: Non inflamed, non sensitive skin types in need of pore purging and skin</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the extra customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Also my 13 year old daughter used it and it helped with her acne.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li> – I advice that if you are scent sensitive, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> So I am a big of how much it has been doing for my skin and acne.</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients are what attracted me to it.</li>
            <li> Not harsh nor did I break out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 26 year old male who decided that I would start taking better care of my body and skin and ordered the Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> and while I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, my acne prone skin does seem to have gotten much better.</li>
            <li> In the last 2 years I have noticed considerable dullness of my skin, but so many products are too harsh for me.  </li>
            <li> Barefaced Mud Mask is all natural, organic, and paraben free Dead Sea</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft, smooth, toned, and my face hasn&#x27;t been oily in mornings since I started using Barefaced Dead Sea mud mask.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really enjoyed Barefaced Skincare&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> I do feel like my acne has lessened overall, and that my skin feels more firm in the 24 hours post-mask.</li>
            <li> when you take it off, its more like you just put on a thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It came off pretty easy except on the sides of my face where I had to scrub a little harder.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t a favorite to you.</li>
            <li> It goes on a slightly greenish color and smells quite nice with a minty fragrance and a slight tingle on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t achieved any positive long term changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try a new skin care product!</li>
            <li> If I have a zit pop up at all, I just put a little on that one area, and it clears it right up!</li>
            <li> I did notice a little bit of a burning sensation as I let the mud sit on my face but nothing more than what I normally feel with any other type of mask.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearer, face is less red, and just an overall healthy glow to my face.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling really clean without making it feel dried out.</li>
            <li> It left my face red at first</li>
            <li> I am a really big fan of this particular mud mask.</li>
            <li> Once it is on your face for the first few moments, your nose adapts and it doesn&#x27;t bother you too much.</li>
            <li> but i recently had a clogged pore that was pretty deep</li>
            <li> super tight</li>
            <li> I was glad, because at first I wondered if the thick texture might actually clog my pores and dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I have an oily face and in the morning it still felt smooth, and not as oily as it usually would.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, so I was a little worried at first, but I just kept an eye on it, followed the directions, and it worked wonders!</li>
            <li> Dries hard, but is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I kept this is a cool dry place, only used it twice, got it out to use a third time</li>
            <li> t has this really dark mud color and after applying it I got right away this tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> I tend to massage it on with gentle circular motions and let it dry then rinse it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> was gentle enough to agree with my rosacea, so rosacea sufferers should definitely give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Feels fresh, and oddly MOISTERIZED.</li>
            <li> recommend Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask to anyone who wants to have fast result for almost no money.</li>
            <li> I have also got a lot less breakouts and as the ingredients are all natural its very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but the results are immediately noticeable!</li>
            <li> Probably because of the real dead sea mud and all the organic ingredients! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean up was a breeze (which is not always the case when it comes to washing dried mud off your face!).</li>
            <li> What it is: Deep pore cleansing mask formulated with mineral rich dead sea mud</li>
            <li> my lip was a little too sensitive for it and the first time i used it</li>
            <li> I noticed after about 3 uses, or a week and a half, my skin was much more clear and less acne was actually starting to form.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of face masks, mud masks and any other type of mask that I can sit back in the tub and let dry while I relax in my bubble bath or use a bath bomb.</li>
            <li> I felt a very tingly, warm sensation but not unbearable or unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Seems to keep my face clear using only once a week!</li>
            <li> Smooth a small amount of mud over entire face, avoiding eye area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this mask twice, but i like it so far.</li>
            <li> It left my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar I was surprised that this actually was mud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> You can simply feel your pores being naturally cleansed within seconds.</li>
            <li> I like the mask but was surprised the second time I opened</li>
            <li> /&gt;Formulas this stimulating tend to encourage pore purging - be prepared to experience occasional breakouts as skin purges, but look forward to experiencing far fewer breakouts when used as maintenance post adjustment</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after using - will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> but I could not get past the smell -- too honey sweet offish.  </li>
            <li> My face is pretty clean and I am ready to apply layer of mad mask.</li>
            <li> Absolutely helped my skin look noticeably clearer within the first few days, and I can&#x27;t wait to see that long term results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of its effectiveness because I only use it very rarely...</li>
            <li> Barefaced was SO responsive that they actually sent me a new batch that has a slightly different smell!</li>
            <li> I had hoped for more Dead Sea content and less fillers that irritate my face.</li>
            <li> It gave my skin very soft and deep moisturized feeling after only putting it for two days in a row.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not strong at all but is very clean and fresh and the mud itself is very thick</li>
            <li> I have a small acne breakout after the first use, but after that, it kept my skin really clear, and it looked like I was glowing!</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, I was slightly distracted by the consistency.</li>
            <li> At first, when I applied it to my face, I noticed a slight burning/tingling sensation on my lower chin/face area...</li>
            <li> and I noticed a slight improvement after my first try.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smoother and not dry!</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft and smooth,  not dry or tight like a lot of other masks tend to do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is stronger than other masks I tried and it really worked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t a negative comment nor a positive - it&#x27;s simply stating that if you prefer a certain texture, keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The texture and delicate scent alone are so luxurious and for once I really felt like I was using the real deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25yr old male and this product definitely helped me!</li>
            <li> Plus, it is a deep, dark, greenish-brown color so you can see exactly where you placed it.</li>
            <li> a definite plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the product once so far</li>
            <li> A short time later my skin still felt soft and a bit dryer</li>
            <li> I applied the mud to my face, massaged slightly, and left it to dry for roughly 15 minutes, before rinsing it with warm water, and patting my face dry.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after I use it, and after only 3 uses, I can tell the pores around my nose are getting smaller, and I think the wrinkles on my forehead are a bit smoother.  </li>
            <li> Plus, with all natural and mostly organic ingredients, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The mud actually feels like gooey and it doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh scent like the previous one I have tried which I mainly love about it.</li>
            <li> 5-6 minutes is enough time to reap full benefit, 15 minutes is excessive.</li>
            <li> It did not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> After just 1 10-minute application of the Barefaced Mud Mask, my skin was very soft and my dry patches were almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little off-putting at first, but you learn tog et used to it.</li>
            <li> The mask itself dries very quickly and very hard.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling much softer and clearer than a lot of other face masks out there.  </li>
            <li> When I applied this product for the first time I found that the mask dried rapidly.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a noticeable difference in my skin after the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> It has pretty much dried out my skin</li>
            <li> Fast forward to today - baby is down for a nap</li>
            <li> The mask itself is very thick (think pudding), which makes it easy to cover your face.</li>
            <li> People with rosacea or broken blood vessels should not scrub those areas due to the masks grainy texture but can smooth it on gently.</li>
            <li> I waited for 15 minutes to completely let it dry</li>
            <li> but I have dry patch &amp; really sensitive around my cheeks</li>
            <li> After my face felt completely rid of the mud I patted my face dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of dead sea products in the past and this is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time trying new product because my skin is very prone to breaking out.  </li>
            <li> I really like they way it felt on my skin as it dried, like it was sucking all the bad stuff right out of my pores and my skin felt so soft and smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> and it certainly felt like it helped me apply it evenly and acknowledge the little crevices here</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who is suffering from acne, aging, dark spots, oil skin, dry skin, or for anyone that just wants a pick me up on their skin!</li>
            <li> I woke up with two of my preexisting blemishes dried out and a clearer, less blackhead filled nose.  </li>
            <li> After 15 minutes, I could feel the mask was tight and ready to wash off.</li>
            <li> It really makes your face feel tight and</li>
            <li> It only takes a little to cover the whole face and washes off with ease.</li>
            <li> This did make it hard to move your face and my dad had a laugh at me as I tried to eat a piece of bread.</li>
            <li> This stuff ... gets good and bad marks from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> away, I liked that it was thick enough that it stayed where I put it, but not so thick that I had to apply pressure to spread it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who isn&#x27;t responding well to the typical store-bought scrubs and washes.</li>
            <li> And it sucks all impurities right out of my pores.</li>
            <li> The very 1st time I used it I only left in on for 10 minutes because I felt it had gotten very tight</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous based on other reviews because I have sensitive skin, but while it did leave my skin red for a couple of minutes, it did not linger and my skin looked vibrant.</li>
            <li> I will say that I must have put this on pretty thick, as it took a little effort to get off, but if you use a wash cloth, it is much easier.</li>
            <li> My kids like using it, too--there&#x27;s no harsh garbage in it like some other face masks.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really smile because my face muscles were stiff due to the mud mask</li>
            <li> While it has a slight mint scent, there is no weird minty tingle like with other masks.</li>
            <li> Holy cow did my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I tend to have oily skin which is especially noticeable at the end of a long day and this definitely seemed to help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall as long as I have no adverse reaction from here I will definitely be adding this to my weekly skin care routine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been half an hour, and I am still keeping my face completely immobile in fear that a stray hair might touch my face and cause me the immense amount of pain I felt before...</li>
            <li> We were both having the typical daily issues that all 20-somethings have as far as oily skin and problem areas with blackheads</li>
            <li> As expected with a mud mask, as it dried it hardened (fairly quickly in comparison to other mud masks I&#x27;ve used).</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this if you&#x27;re not sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> Follow instructions, I left it too long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick so as I said, you don&#x27;t have to apply a lot.</li>
            <li> mask makes your skin feel really tight (and has a cooling effect) as it dries, and when you rinse it off the gritty texture softly exfoliates the skin.</li>
            <li> and it was funny and didn&#x27;t mean anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Process: It dries stiff but doesn&#x27;t feel like concrete.</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;ve had those where they hang around for a few days just being painful and leaving you helpless to remedy you know how great that is</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is oily while at the same time dry.</li>
            <li> and my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry either, the glycerin helps big time.</li>
            <li> I let my face completely dry and felt it with the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other masks that go on thin and feel like they barely harden, this is a nice thick muddy mix that can be applied as generously as you wish.</li>
            <li> OK this doesn&#x27;t feel half bad its kind of cold and tingly and messy and fun</li>
            <li> I would recommend only keeping it on for 7-10 minutes; the bottle says 15, but it did not take that long to dry.</li>
            <li> It seems that they care about their customers and stand by their product since they&#x27;re willing to take feedback seriously.</li>
            <li> My skin did not break out and it actually helped me with my dry areas!</li>
            <li> Authentic Dead Sea mud will have a slight sulfur odor to it, which is how you know that it is real Dead Sea mud.</li>
            <li> In total I had four people try this product - myself (female, aged 24), my brother (male aged 22), my boyfriend (male, aged 25) and my mother.</li>
            <li> I am a college freshman, and have been really stressed out lately and have been breaking out a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the clearest it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> I never really struggled with big break outs, I&#x27;ll get a pimple here or there</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A jar lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I Imagine it is because of the multiple clarifying, moisturizing and oils in the ingredient list like  Dead Sea Mud, Organic Lavender Essential Oil, Organic Eucalyptus Essential Oil, Hickory Bark Extract, Non GMO Xanthan Gum, Organic Aloe Vera Juice, Water, Kaolin Clay, Organic Shea Butter, Organic Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Organic Calendula Oil  </li>
            <li> I used it while having a long soak in the bath</li>
            <li> it came time to wash my face, I had trouble washing it completely off my face.</li>
            <li> consistency is very slimy and thick looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their mud is harvested straight from the black mud of the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> (typically this happens to me with facial cleansers and skin peels), so that is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little red also when I wipe the mask off but that does not last long.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this will work on very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Once I got past that, wow!</li>
            <li> The one thing I would like to see different due to the texture is either a squeeze tube or a scoop since it is gel like and slippery.</li>
            <li> It was a bit different than other type masks I have tried</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t leave it on too long!    </li>
            <li> but, this was probably due to me shaving earlier in the morning.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry like a mask should.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin</li>
            <li> I suffer from oily combination skin...and am still recovering from dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Rub it on and let it dry.</li>
            <li> Once applied, let sit for 15 minutes so it can dry and work</li>
            <li> With others after washing it off, my face felt dry and I would end up putting on lotions etc.</li>
            <li> In addition, it does tend to leave your skin dry</li>
            <li> After about 6 to 7 minutes it was quite dry</li>
            <li> I suffer from blackheads and have some dry areas.</li>
            <li> I asked someone from the company and they suggested maybe 2 times a week as it can dry out skin</li>
            <li> I did not have acne before nor did I ever have an issue with my skin being too dry.</li>
            <li> I also let it dry all the way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
            <li> I only apply a thin layer each time and you can really feel it work.</li>
            <li> so I open it up and its this green goopy gelatinous substance and the fragrance I instantly place yummm!</li>
            <li> I think the main issue I have with this product is the mud isn&#x27;t all that thick.</li>
            <li> Formula is not suitable for very sensitive skin due to its stimulating nature but could be blended with a hyaluronic acid hydrating gel mask to split the difference between deep cleansing and a saturation of hydration.</li>
            <li> It also is extremely messy and very hard to clean off of anywhere.</li>
            <li> have noticed that my face feels much softer and has had less blemishes than it usually gets in the summer.</li>
            <li> Skin feels tight and smooth..but not dry.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t usually use mud masks but this one definitely surprised me and is now in mh skincare routine.</li>
            <li> at 27 yrs is pretty frustrating to deal.</li>
            <li> In a last ditch effort to find a solution before having to break down and schedule a dermatologist appointment, I found this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I definitely plan to try other Barefaced products!</li>
            <li> When you remove the mask, your face does feel soft but there are no positive or negative visual affects.</li>
            <li> The Barefaced Mud Mask comes in a 6 oz container and will last you quite some time since a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I mean come on, no one looks normal when they have mud on their face.  </li>
            <li> I especially like how I pair it with other dead sea products such as the Adovia Exfoliating Salts that I have reviewed in the past!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a month but see a lot of changes to the texture and black heads.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail a couple of days ago and have only used it once since then, following the directions which recommend to use once a week, but from using it just one time I&#x27;ve noticed a small difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find all natural products that work this well!</li>
            <li> My face was a little pink, but it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Pretty much smells like a kindergarten class room with a sick kid in</li>
            <li> which I am so mad about it right now!!</li>
            <li> I do feel the need to wash my face thoroughly after using it since my skin is very sensitive to any type of oil and there is an oily-ish residue left behind.</li>
            <li> My face felt a little tingly and red after the mask</li>
            <li> , my pores look smaller and every time I use the mask its like a little at home spa day.</li>
            <li> , my pores look smaller and every time I use the mask its like a little at home spa day.</li>
            <li> I applied it weekly 4 times already mad it definitely helps me with mild acne and blemishes.</li>
            <li> My face had turned bright red and a nasty, streaky rash started to appear on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I only like using face products last have the least amount of additives and</li>
            <li> Unknown if it was the product oxidation after being opened.</li>
            <li> I had a few blemishes and acne scars and they have definitely faded since using it.</li>
            <li> For that matter, masks come in all kinds of varieties too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask for the purpose of sharing my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of product from Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> My friend&#x27;s husband was away for a few days last week on a business trip, so one night we decided to try this mud mask out!</li>
            <li> I did notice when I woke up the blackheads on my nose were minimal.</li>
            <li> I found that the Barefaced Skincare Dead Sea Mud Mask made my skin feel instantly softer.</li>
            <li> it came before I expected it too.</li>
            <li> And the next day, I got some rashes on my face (wow!on my cheek side, Holy cow!!)</li>
            <li> This is a little bit different than other mud masks.</li>
            <li> I applied the mud mask and it went on  pretty easily and didn&#x27;t have a horrible chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mixture of dry skin with an oily/acne prone forehead and tend to be very sensitive to products, but did not find this irritating or pore clogging.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that I still have not seen any improvements to my minor acne, but perhaps it&#x27;s just too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> Basically, it requested that before posting a negative review to speak to them first... so hopefully there aren&#x27;t hundreds of repressed negative reviews...</li>
            <li> Any time my skin starts to look a little wonky (and I live in NYC</li>
            <li> is that a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I know the jar says to limit the use of this mask to twice a week, but I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> so I can not compare it to other brands.</li>
            <li> I really never thought masks worked until I tried this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding when I say that after using it on my face, I wanted to slather it on other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> it on my face, I wanted to slather it on other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> The only small downside is the smell.  </li>
            <li> Since other masks I have tried, I always seem to have a reaction to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t know a think about other mud masks, but this one did the trick for her skin.</li>
            <li> I did feel the affects of the oils and other ingredients used to help pull the impurities out and add moisture to your skin.</li>
            <li> Recently I got the opportunity to try this Barefaced Dead Sea Mud mask!</li>
            <li> My product arrived on time and as expected!</li>
            <li> Use of a small spatula is advised to avoid potential contamination of jar contents.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Unlike other delivered items, the packs were tightened by rubber bands so that it was protected not to be shaken over the delivery</li>
            <li> ( I was watching something) and my skin felt a little dry.</li>
            <li> After I rinsed the mask off, my face did have a few areas that were red for a little while.</li>
            <li> Needless to say after a month of using the mask my skin is soft, my pores are smaller and my skin is brighter.</li>
            <li> The mud was a little thinner than I expected</li>
            <li> When I first got this mask, I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> Should last a while too as I&#x27;ve hardly made a dent in it yet.</li>
            <li> It took only about five minutes till it was hard.</li>
            <li> I used the mask last night as my face breaks out a lot and gets very dull and dry looking.</li>
            <li> :) and already i see my face glowing and reducing of this stupid pimples.</li>
            <li> I have used a different Dead Sea mud mask in the past and it does not compare to Barefaced.</li>
            <li> Not worth that price</li>
            <li> I have to give advice to users of mask to choose dark color of wash cloth to wash out mask.</li>
            <li> At least I was expecting an instant result</li>
            <li> This dark brown mask smells just like something out of Aveda.</li>
            <li> but it does nothing for my acne or dark spots.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> It was at least 3 weeks since I last used it.  </li>
            <li> There is no junk it useless fillers, everything is very beneficial to skin.</li>
            <li> This could have possibly been my fault, maybe I added too thick of a layer of mud mask.</li>
            <li> I simply massage my face slowly with a little bit water to loosen up the mask</li>
            <li> Now after a few years as a retail pharmacist and a constant  &amp;#34;you have got to be kidding me face&amp;#34; at 26 I have a few small wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I have not had a bad break out or a bad zit in a month, which is very surprising for me.</li>
            <li> In just a matter of a few minuted the mask started to dry and created a very tight feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> During application, it had a slight fragrance</li>
            <li> Typically I&#x27;ll put it on just before I&#x27;m about to hop in the shower, so that by the time I am done washing my hair and body, I can rinse this off in there.</li>
            <li> It is mud after all so it will smell odd.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended a particular peel-off mask to me, but it was way too expensive.</li>
            <li> This was his first mud mask and thought the tightening feel was awkward.</li>
            <li> Other traditional methods like benzoyl peroxide just weren&#x27;t working, in fact, my skin seemed to be getting worse.</li>
            <li> I sat down on my couch for a few rounds of Don&#x27;t Touch the Spikes.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get too tight like some others I have used before.</li>
            <li> In this picture, the mud has been on for about 5 minutes, and was already feeling tight on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Right</li>
            <li> It gives your face a slight tingling sensation after a few minutes and you can feel it hardening on your face and tightening your skin.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a lavender smell to it.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin tightening and a little bit of a tingle.</li>
            <li> So my pores have been a little clogged.</li>
            <li> so it was a little too drying &amp; stingy for me.</li>
            <li> It burns a little when you apply it but nothing unbearable, plus you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to adhere to my skin as I&#x27;ve found with other products in the past and</li>
            <li> Just spread a little over your skin avoiding eye and mouth areas, let it firm up about 5-6 minutes, and rinse off.</li>
            <li> For me it is a little harsh and begins to burn after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s in it as much as what isn&#x27;t - no parabens, alcohols, lanolin or artificial fragrance/color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ran around my living room in circles a few times, hoping the rushing air would soothe my melting face.</li>
            <li> I decided, hey, what the heck, why don&#x27;t I give it a few minutes then wash it off.</li>
            <li> anyway have tried it a few times now and it works for me.</li>
            <li> considering I never used a mask before I figured I should use it a few times to see if it made a difference</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve abandoned a few tubs like this before</li>
            <li> I have tried masks before which always seemed to leave my face completely dried out.  </li>
            <li> I saw the barefaced Dead Sea mud mask</li>
            <li> Barefaced dead sea mud mask ....</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t happen the few times that I have used this stuff.</li>
            <li> That has never happened on all the times that I used Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> I have start from exfoliating my skin with Dead sea salt and washed out my face of it.</li>
            <li> After I put it on I could feel my skin tightening and tingling as the mud dried on my face.</li>
            <li> since it had dried, it felt like I was also exfoliating my face as well as lathering it.</li>
            <li> I dried my face with a towel and immediately felt a difference.</li>
            <li> This Barefaced Mud Mask, dried out those problem spots over night.</li>
            <li> When using a dead sea mask on the face, the one contribution it has is eliminating toxins.</li>
            <li> I had a few pre zits before putting this on that came to a head</li>
            <li> What have I been missing?  </li>
            <li> The mud mask caused acne and dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> After trying several masks ranging in varying prices, I am seriously addicted to this mud mask.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Key ingredients: Dead Sea mud&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use it: Cleanse skin, leaving it damp.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a waste of my time.</li>
            <li> I mean who wants to be seen all scary looking when not in front of your girlfriends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im going to try the suggested use of once a week and see if all of my black heads will disappear!</li>
            <li> and although it did have a slight &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; aroma it was not overwhelming to me</li>
            <li> No strong odor either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow,&lt;br /&gt;I mix it up a little with my finger and apply it thickly to my already cleansed and slightly damp face.</li>
            <li> it smells pretty bad.</li>
            <li> The smell of this stuff is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s back to red, ugly scars.</li>
            <li> This something you have to have for a little pampering time! A+++</li>
            <li> I keep it on for about 15 minutes, once to twice a week, and if I have a zit pop up, I just use a little dab of it on that area, and it clears it out immediately!</li>
            <li> It is the same color and texture as real dead sea mud!!  </li>
            <li> By this point my skin was feeling tight and the mask was quite dry, it felt as though it would be uncomfortable soon</li>
            <li> and yes I can confirm you don&#x27;t want to keep this past 6 months...</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s helped my skin any, maybe drying.</li>
            <li> Usually face masks</li>
            <li> and I was afraid it was going to make my sensitive skin even drier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it was</li>
            <li> Well, I usually apply mud mask before my bath because you know</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s messy when you wash off your face!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got past the scent and applied this on my face.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would purchase again.  </li>
            <li> I had my sister and my cousin test the mask out and tell me what they thought of it, and they could not get past the scent.</li>
            <li> Had one bad pimple at the time which looked less red a few hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean really difficult to make any facial features without cracking the mask.</li>
            <li> I usually apply a thick layer and let it sit while I do some chores.</li>
            <li> I had to toss this out without hardly any use.  </li>
            <li> and it got really hard</li>
            <li> Since all of the ingredients are natural the smell wasn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell and plan on using this at least a couple of time a week.</li>
            <li> Unable to focus because of the burning of my face, I jumped off the couch, ran to the bathroom, and frantically startes wiping off the mud with a wet kleenex.</li>
            <li> I am just clumsy in all that I do.</li>
            <li> I am just clumsy in all that I do.</li>
            <li> I constantly hear about all the dangerous ingredients and chemicals that people put in the products.</li>
            <li> Will reserve the fifth star for at least a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> this stuff sucks, literally.</li>
            <li> it was thick</li>
            <li> This feeling went away after approximately 30 seconds as the product dried.</li>
            <li> I initially wrote a review saying the smell was unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The mask has a subtle scent that reminds me of lavender mint, but it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It says to store in a cold dry place, which I did.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It turned out that I was too skeptical, and I probably order another one within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Which I am not going to detail how I would like to save those of you with weak stomachs.</li>
            <li> a very hard to explain scent-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super crazy about this product.</li>
            <li> It has, in the very recent past, gotten very bad around my chin area.</li>
            <li> This was a very thick mud mask but still went on like butter.  </li>
            <li> The mask is very thick as a mud mask should be.</li>
            <li> Another thing I can say with certainty is that I haven&#x27;t broken out at all since using the mask.  </li>
            <li> because there is nothing worse than feeling like you have something stiffening your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A thin layer is all you need.</li>
            <li> My pores aren&#x27;t  too terrible thanks to my clarisonic</li>
            <li> I had a problem with another product I reviewed leaving me broken out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the tingle it caused, and did not find it painful as other reviewers did.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s not too terrible, just not pretty smelling like some of the other masks I have tried.</li>
            <li> Planted reviews- not fair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed at all and do not plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li> but Sadly there was nothing I feel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes with a mud mask I find it difficult to rinse off</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but I found it odd.</li>
            <li> Feels like there is a little residue afterwards but that may be because of the horrible moisturizer I was using.</li>
            <li> Although I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the smell, it doesn&#x27;t take away from the use of the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks.  </li>
            <li> Really stinks.  </li>
            <li> I get random break out acne around my cheeks :(</li>
            <li> I had a really horrible experience with this stuff -- and I&#x27;m not sure whether it was just my skin doing a &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m terrified to ever use it again.</li>
            <li> Upon contact with my skin, I felt an unpleasant stinging sensation whenever the mud touched my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant, but some might.</li>
            <li> Not in a unpleasant way-</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.</li>
            <li> my pores were clogged that bad.</li>
            <li> I can, however, say that it smells atrocious.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m still ugly, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to fix</li>
            <li> When I put it my skin, My skin feel painful.</li>
            <li> Omg I hate it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t fond of the smell but didn&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> The apprehension came from the fact that when I was a teenager, I had terrible skin and would have to get glycolic peels which were incredibly painful and some products still irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> and I found that very disgusting</li>
            <li> Smells awful.  </li>
            <li> Horrible smell, nasty taste.</li>
            <li> This mask didn&#x27;t suit on my skin rather gave me bloody rash!!</li>
            <li> It was the worst breakout I&#x27;ve had in my life.</li>
            <li> I used it as well as my boyfriend who has terrible pores (took a before and after that I will attach)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25yr old male and this product definitely helped me! I&#x27;ve used it several times, and I can tell that it really controls the oiliness of my skin and helps razor bumps disappear. This product also has a very nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I personally leave it on longer than the recommended time (about 15 minutes as opposed to 10 minutes) and I don&#x27;t experience any irritation. Great product that I&#x27;ll definitely use again!</li>
            <li> Is like I&#x27;m one with mother nature. For 15 minutes :) I love how it comes on as well as it comes off. I get random break out acne around my cheeks :( at 27 yrs is pretty frustrating to deal. I needed something to make me feel better. I&#x27;ve only use this for three days now. I know the bottle says two but to me 3 is a charm :) and already i see my face glowing and reducing of this stupid pimples. :) I&#x27;ll update 2 months from now.</li>
            <li> I never use any type of face-mask products, and Barefaced mud mask has made me a convert. Love this mask. I&#x27;ve seen results in my overall skin&#x27;s appearance since my first use.</li>
            <li> Nice customer service, natural effective product, am getting more for friends for the holidays</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 26 year old male who decided that I would start taking better care of my body and skin and ordered the Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask. I have used a different Dead Sea mud mask in the past and it does not compare to Barefaced. After my first use today, my skin feels smoother and is glowing. I enjoyed the entire Barefaced Mud Mask experience from the application to my skin, feeling the mask cleaning and exfoliating, and leaving my face even more radiant. I would definitely recommend this product and company, especially with their great and responsive costumer service.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Used it with my boyfriend and we instantly felt a difference after rinsing. Also helped reduce redness of acne and smoothed out skin lines and scars.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> The customer service is awesome and the product is great.&lt;br /&gt;It is stronger than other masks I tried and it really worked.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more if I ever run out!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask. It is the best I have ever used. On top of that, I actually had a customer service representative call me to make sure I was happy with the product and when I told him how much I loved it he offered to send me some more for my time. I didn&#x27;t take him up on it because they are a smaller company and I actually want to support them. Any time my skin starts to look a little wonky (and I live in NYC so this happens from time to time) I use this mask and I swear it resets my skin. I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product.</li>
            <li> When I first got this mask, I was a little skeptical. It was such a great price and I was used to paying loads more for similar products. However, I used it that night, and was amazed at how smooth, clean, and balanced my acne prone/oily skin felt. The following nights I used it as a spot treatment, and by the end of this week my skin is literally glowing. It&#x27;s the clearest it has been in a long time. Plus, the sellers are super friendly and back thier product with a 100% money back garentee. I cannot tell you how much I recommmend this mask- Its natural, it&#x27;s a great value, it works, and it&#x27;s made by people who truly care. Thank you barefaced skincare!!</li>
            <li> After trying many many different mask on the market and finding them all to be full of false claims and irritating chemicals I am glad to say that I have found the one that I will be sticking with. The mud mask by Barefaced Skin Care is extremely soothing and leaves my skin feeling a whole new level of smooth and refreshed. I am 100% satisfied with my purchase and would recommend their products to anyone. The smell is nice and the mask applies very easily and comes off with little effort, unlike other masks that seem to become part of your face only to find out later in the day that you had a huge chunk of it still on you. Not with this mask. Thanks for creating a quality skin care product that lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> Great product!  My face always feel refreshed after using is and it seems to keep me acne under control too!</li>
            <li> My face feels so much smoother after one use!</li>
            <li> I have used Dead Sea Facial Mud Mask 4 times now, my facial tone is much better, pore size has reduced and my skin feels great. It does have a strong eculyptus odor, it did make my eyes water a little the first couple of times I used it, and definitely cleared my sinus lol, by the 3rd time I was use to it and it no longer does that. ( but that&#x27;s me &amp; eucalyptus lol). This product is great used with my facial oils ( rose hip &amp; raw coconut), and is now a permanent resident in my face care regime.</li>
            <li> Awesome value good product</li>
            <li> My face felt very refreshed and I could feel the ingredients working their magic! Afterwards, my face is radiant and soft.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Love it. When I first smelled it in the jar, I wasn&#x27;t so sure, but once I had it on it was actually kind of nice. It felt great, and my skin afterwards feel soft and clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! I have used this product twice and leaves my skin so soft. I like the smell and plan on using this at least a couple of time a week.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful..only problem is it comes with a card offering a free jar if you go to the Web site. At that site I could not find where to get a free jar.. but not disappointed with product</li>
            <li> Wonderful mask - I appreciate that the ingredients are all straightforward and good for your skin.  Nothing that you can&#x27;t pronounce or don&#x27;t understand - it&#x27;s good to know what you are putting on your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask itself leaves my face very soft and visibly clears skin.  My skin feels much happier after a mask!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this product &amp; I was extremely happy to have received it this quickly. I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Montagne Jeunesse men&#x27;s masks but I also really wanted to try something new, &amp; I was happy with the results that I saw - the smell is great &amp; it sets in great too! My skin felt much softer &amp; smoother after use - just remember to not use too much of it though! I now finally have found something that I&#x27;m really happy to use &amp; is much more economical than the Montagne Jeunesse ones I really like!</li>
            <li> It caused my face to turn red and burn; wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This mask smells wonderful and it feels really good on my face. My skin was so soft and shiny after I washed it off and it felt great. I&#x27;m really happy with the product!</li>
            <li> this mud mask is really nice.  it has a specific scent, which is ok for me, the consistency is quite surprising and jelly, easy to apply and after it dries it is also easy to wash it off. my face was super soft afterwards, pores visibly smaller and skin was not irritated. I suppose I&#x27;ll stick to this brand for longer!</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels after using this.  I bought this to reduce my pores, seems to be working.  The smell is soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> The scent is extremely strong, but after the first use it is easier to get used to.  It left my skin feeling much softer and clearer than a lot of other face masks out there.  Definitely a favorite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! I felt a difference in my son after the very first time! Would absolutely recommend buying this mask.  It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Not as great as everyone says. I saw no difference in my face and I used the entire container. It burns when I put it on and it doesn&#x27;t dry like a mask should. It also is extremely messy and very hard to clean off of anywhere.</li>
            <li> I never really struggled with big break outs, I&#x27;ll get a pimple here or there but my main reason for ordering this was because I have always had clogged pores in my nose/mouth area. As soon as I got this I washed my face and put on the mask. It has an interesting smell, not bad enough to bother me or anything. Dries hard, but is easy to remove. Made my skin feel absolutely amazing. Definitely going to make my boyfriend use it :)</li>
            <li> So many different masks on Amazon. I chose this one due to the great price and I liked how all the ingredients are natural and organic. Doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. Seems to be a lot of applications in the jar. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. I see my pores shrinking as well.</li>
            <li> Great product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the mask !</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is so refreshing The mask has a subtle scent that reminds me of lavender mint, but it&#x27;s not overpowering. It has a cool feeling when applied and improves the appearance of skin. What I like most is that it&#x27;s made in the USA. I believe this is a wonderful business that cares about consumers &amp; as a very satisfied customer, I am more than happy to give them my support. I use this product twice a week &amp; I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> When I receive, the inner lip was open, the smell is strong, and my face feel hot after apply it. Now I won&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I will never purchase a different brand as long as barefaced is available! My face looks great and I have a younger appearance! Order number 107-7072221-4895406 - THANK YOU!!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin was very soft and I believe it did was was described but it got moldy and I found that very disgusting so I trashed mine and I wold not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions.  Does as advertised.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful.  It does help clean out the pores.  However, for those of us with mature skin, I would not recommend using this more than once a week.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I only leave it on for about 5-8 minutes, but you can feel it working immediately (no painful burning or stinging though, just a nice tingly feeling). Have used it once a week for 3 weeks and have already noticed a difference. More even skin tone, blemishes are few and far between, skin feels tight (in a good way) and pores appear smaller. Would definitely recommend! And everyone is right, you don&#x27;t need as much as you think you do. A thin layer works best.</li>
            <li> This mask is really, really good for a glowing complection! It left my face red at first but it went away, I think it&#x27;s because it helps the blood flow for a better the complection.</li>
            <li> This is a very great mask. Its simple to put on and take off. After I take it off, my skin feels very soft and noticeable looks more even toned, good for dark spots left by acne. I know the jar says to limit the use of this mask to twice a week, but I use it every other day. Usually masks like the &amp;#34;Queen Helene Facial Masque&amp;#34; or other pore refining masks, leave my skin very dry and cause flaking, but this mask leaves my skin perfectly moisturized. I have very oily skin which Is the main cause for my acne, but my skin has drastically gotten better with this product. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the tingle. It is perfect for my oily skin. I did feel a lot of tingling but it was focused more on my problem areas. I can&#x27;t wait to see my face a month from now!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m sure this won&#x27;t apply to other people. When I first opened this jar, a nice smell drifted out that had me all amped up to try this mask. I cleaned my face, washed my hands, and started to apply the mud to my face. Upon contact with my skin, I felt an unpleasant stinging sensation whenever the mud touched my skin. I continued applying the mask to my face thinking this was normal. However, about fifteen seconds after I finished, I had the sensation of what I can only describe as having your face branded several times repeatedly. I ran around my living room in circles a few times, hoping the rushing air would soothe my melting face. This provided relief for about a milisecond, and then the stinging began again. I cannot even begin to express the pain I felt. I decided, hey, what the heck, why don&#x27;t I give it a few minutes then wash it off. I sat down on my couch for a few rounds of Don&#x27;t Touch the Spikes. Unable to focus because of the burning of my face, I jumped off the couch, ran to the bathroom, and frantically startes wiping off the mud with a wet kleenex. The mud took me about five minutes to wipe off completely. I sighed in relief, and started to leave the bathroom. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught my face in the mirror. My face had turned bright red and a nasty, streaky rash started to appear on my cheeks. I gently touched my skin, and was instantly blinded, the pain fuzzing up my vision. It&#x27;s been half an hour, and I am still keeping my face completely immobile in fear that a stray hair might touch my face and cause me the immense amount of pain I felt before...</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. It has a pleasant scent and texture, and it really cleared up my blemishes. With just one use, I have noticed a more even skin tone and softer skin.</li>
            <li> Great mud mask.  Smells terrific!  Goes on smooth and creamy..not gritty at all. Skin feels tight and smooth..but not dry. Highly recommend.  7/2016 Update on the Barefaced mask.  I still love this mask and am thinking about ordering more.  I do want to confirm that this product DOES have a shelf life.  I should have refrigerated mine..as about 1/2 way thru the jar, I noticed after 6 months...the great smell started smelling stale and rancid...Unknown if it was the product oxidation after being opened. I do see on one of the questions about shelf life..and yes I can confirm you don&#x27;t want to keep this past 6 months... I do like having the product..so I&#x27;m going to see if refrigeration will help extend the shelf life. I also saw others posting about burning sensation...I never had that with mine purchased in 2014.....but I also noted they have a &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; formula..so I&#x27;m thinking they have added some type of menthol or eucalyptus oils that make the skin tingle?  We will see.</li>
            <li> Love this face mask. My skin feels so soft after each use.</li>
            <li> I received my order promptly and I&#x27;ve tried the mud mask a couple times. It seems like a very good product and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. I would recommend it to friends. I appreciate the company contacting me directly to see if I was happy with my order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this mask twice, but i like it so far. Nice smell, made my skin feel very soft. Will continue to use and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a month but see a lot of changes to the texture and black heads. I really can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> IT WORKS SO WELL AND SMELLS SO NICE</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> Omg so I was excited to try this out because of the rave reviews but Omg I hate it. Smells awful.  Smell stays with you throughout the day but most importantly it burned my skin. Like my cheeks are super tender and I got bumbs all over after using this mask.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Easy to apply and makes skin brighter.  No bad residue or smell.</li>
            <li> I love this face mask! I feel so refreshed afterwards and while I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, my acne prone skin does seem to have gotten much better. I will mostly repurchase and add this to my normal skin routine going forward.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my skin every time I use it! You can feel it working as it hits all your pores. Finally finished my first jar and it goes a long way. Has definitely cleared my skin up and given it a healthy smooth glow, there is definitely some beautiful natural magic in here ! If your on the fence to buy it, just pull the trigger. Its fair priced compared to other products in this category and does exactly what it advertises, no gimmicks, just results. I have had acne for many years and its persistent, if I let up it will come back, but this keeps it at bay the longest compared to anything I&#x27;ve used (and thats a lot of products)</li>
            <li> I was searching for a natural, easy to use mask and this was one of the top results. The company&#x27;s communication is honest and friendly, which is nice to see. In regards to the actual product, i love it! Application was very easy, and it almost leaves you with a serene spa-like feeling as you wait for it to dry. There&#x27;s a slight (good) tingle, and it smells good. I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this mask!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products, BUT I am in love with the way my face looks and feels after using this mud mask! I bought two because they had a discount when you bought two, and I&#x27;m am so glad I did! We moved to Louisiana recently and my once great skin turned in to that of a teen going through puberty! This mud mask has given me back my great sling after just two uses!! I will certainly purchase this again and I hope they come out with something like this as a body wash!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!! It made my face feel really smooth and the shipping was really quick</li>
            <li> First time trying a mud mask- smells minty and has a cooling factor on my face. Bottle says to leave it for 10 mins, which i did. It dried pretty quick and clean up was easy. My face actually feels really refreshed after. I like it so far. Have to use it a few more times.</li>
            <li> A good marketing strategy deserves a 5-star.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so refreshed after the first use!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this stuff is great!  It makes your skin moist for hours.  Great product and feels amazing on your skin.  It has a citrus smell that is really pleseant.</li>
            <li> I loved it!! It really does work! Honestly when I first bought it I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t work but right after the first use it was amazing !! Great product at a great prize!</li>
            <li> Horrible smell, nasty taste. Not sure if it&#x27;s helped my skin any, maybe drying.</li>
            <li> Got here fast, excited to use it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the container is quite big. It went on smoothly and was completely dry in 15 minutes. Clean up was a breeze (which is not always the case when it comes to washing dried mud off your face!). Skin was smooth and refreshed after.</li>
            <li> This mask is a must-have. I am so happy I tried it because it really works. My skin feels refreshed and smooth like I&#x27;ve just been to the spa. Best kept secret is this face mask.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Left my face feeling soft and it smells great.  I cannot wait until next week when I can use it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the mask for 3 weeks now and the texture of my skin has really improved. I had a few blemishes and acne scars and they have definitely faded since using it. I have also got a lot less breakouts and as the ingredients are all natural its very gentle on my skin. I have heard good things about dead sea treatments and this really has impressed me!</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product and I got it for cheap, so I figured why not! Only reason this isn&#x27;t 5 stars is because I&#x27;ve only used it once. Made with all natural ingredients &amp; left my skin feeling smooth and visably clearer. I would recommend only keeping it on for 7-10 minutes; the bottle says 15, but it did not take that long to dry.</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old.  I have oily yet sensitive skin.  In the last 2 years I have noticed considerable dullness of my skin, but so many products are too harsh for me.  After 2 treatments of Barefaced Mud Mask, my skin is noticeably brighter and fresher looking.  Once a week-for me-is all it takes.  I am certainly adding this to my beauty regime.  I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance to try a new product and the results have been wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judeth&lt;br /&gt;Flint Mi</li>
            <li> I loved it! My skin felt great after one use. Definetly recommend</li>
            <li> Great Product, arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 4 or 5 times, about a week apart and love it. I love that it&#x27;s a clay mask that you don&#x27;t have to mix together - not messy at all if you&#x27;re careful. I do feel the need to wash my face thoroughly after using it since my skin is very sensitive to any type of oil and there is an oily-ish residue left behind. But the results are impressive and very quick to show - clearer pores and less breakouts. I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Usually face masks make me break out from all the chemicals but not in this case! There are all natural ingredients and the smell is interesting and soothing at the same time. It&#x27;s fun to have a mud mask every once in a while.</li>
            <li> First of all, my product was shipped almost instantly! I had a face-full of Barefaced mud within days of placing my order, which only started things out on a good foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried it... wow! The smooth, creamy mask goes on smoothly and evenly, unlike a lot of other mud masks I&#x27;ve used. No strong odor either. After 15 minutes, I could feel the mask was tight and ready to wash off. After drying my face and heading to bed, I woke up with smooth, fresh, and glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to use it more to really see the lasting benefits. I highly suggest this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! When I first opened it, I was slightly distracted by the consistency. Which I am not going to detail how I would like to save those of you with weak stomachs. Once I got past that, wow! Super impressed. I&#x27;m one of those lucky people, blessed with both the driest, Sahara Desert dry, and Oily, like BP oil spill oily skin types. This stuff did wonders for me. My normal routine consists of alternating face wash and exfoliaters, followed by a mild moisturizer. Mild because I will start oozing oil out of my pores with too much lotion, but I can&#x27;t pass it up all the way because then I&#x27;ll get lovely dry skin flakes. Gross. I washed my face with a mild exfoliator, patted my skin dry, and went for this mud mask. The moment I finished the third layer (layering with this stuff is the way to go, you&#x27;ll see) I could already feel the magic happening. Let it set and then rinsed off to reveal the best state my skin has been in since before I had my son (4.5 years ago!) Buy it. Now.</li>
            <li> Great product! I used the mask last night as my face breaks out a lot and gets very dull and dry looking. My face felt a little tingly and red after the mask but I have very sensitive skin. The next morning is when I really saw the results...my skin feels and looks really good! It&#x27;s smoother and the scars from acne have already started to fade. Most masks leave you feeling like that for about 5 minutes and then it&#x27;s back to red, ugly scars. That&#x27;s is NOT the case with Barefaced Skincare. The NEXT DAY my skin still feels and looks good. I think I&#x27;ve finally found a good mask!</li>
            <li> I suffer from oily combination skin...and am still recovering from dry winter skin. After just 1 10-minute application of the Barefaced Mud Mask, my skin was very soft and my dry patches were almost non-existent. Very pleased! I have now purchased 2 jars for myself and was very happy with the speed in which they arrived!</li>
            <li> This feels really good on my face..it tingles and my skin is so soft after I use it. One thing, though...it smells pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this stuff. I only apply a thin layer each time and you can really feel it work. Smells strong and you can tell it&#x27;s earthy but I quite like it and the lavender scent works well. My face literally felt glowing for most of the day! Should last a while too as I&#x27;ve hardly made a dent in it yet. I would happily recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Barefaced Mud Mask I was able to try for nothing and it smells out of this world. Simple. Fresh, and Clean. It tights too! THUMBS UP for pore cleansing and overall cleansing benefits. Potent in smell but super natural.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to try something new (nothing has ever worked for my skin) and I am very happy to say this works!! The mask made my skin feel and look amazing after the first time! I never write these review things but this product deserves it. Best part is how reasonably priced the mask is! I LOVE it and would recommend the Barefaced mask to anyone with all types of skin, you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li> The wife got me to try this, because I &amp;#34;needed it&amp;#34;...anyway have tried it a few times now and it works for me. My favourite bit is the sand granules (think its sand anyway from the mud) that give you a face scrub when you wash it off. Makes my face feel good for the day and can see pores on nose have got smaller. Recommend.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is oily while at the same time dry. This mask, from all-natural ingredients, worked great with refreshing my skin without over-drying it. Great quality for the price! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have only used the mask twice, so I&#x27;m unsure if it prevents or treats breakouts and/or aging, but I can say that after I use it my skin is glowing and looks very healthy.  Another thing I can say with certainty is that I haven&#x27;t broken out at all since using the mask.  So far, I am a fan!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new product to replace an old favorite for rainy days—the Barefaced Dead Sea Mask fits the bill and more. Most masks leave my face feeling overly taught and dry, but Barefaced is different. There&#x27;s a light tingle while it&#x27;s working its magic (no harsh burn) and it comes off easily with water and a wash cloth. My skin was noticeably softer and I didn&#x27;t need to layer on an intense moisturizer afterward. I&#x27;ll be putting this into my weekly routine.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, feels great, smells great, love the design and didnt break out afterwards. great gift idea too. thanks barefaced skincare!!!</li>
            <li> This mask left my skin feeling soft and clean.  I loved the smell.  A hint of eucalyptus, but not overbearing and still had the earthy scent so you know it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using any type of &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; mask so I can not compare it to other brands. However, after using the Barefaced sea mud mask I am making it part of my skin regimen. I have been using it for a month now. I only use it once a week. The very 1st time I used it I only left in on for 10 minutes because I felt it had gotten very tight and I was afraid it was going to make my sensitive skin even drier. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference after the 1st application but considering I never used a mask before I figured I should use it a few times to see if it made a difference and I am so glad I did. The 2nd week and on I left it on for the full 15 minutes since everything was fine after the 1st use. After a months use I can see a difference in my skin. My pores appear much smaller. My skin is soft. I really didn&#x27;t have any issues with acne so I cant comment on the effectiveness of that. However, being in my mid 30&#x27;s I have developed some &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; wrinkles on my forehead and since using this product they seem &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; looking. I must say I am not a fan of the smell of the mask. Its not horrible by any means but I would prefer something nicer as I use this right before I go to bed and I smell a lingering effect as I try to go to sleep. My skin is a little red also when I wipe the mask off but that does not last long. Probably has to do more with me being &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;. All in all I am very happy with this product and will continue to use weekly!!</li>
            <li> I really never thought masks worked until I tried this one! I followed the simple directions on the jar and watched some TV then rinsed off my face and went to bed. I woke up with two of my preexisting blemishes dried out and a clearer, less blackhead filled nose.  Im going to try the suggested use of once a week and see if all of my black heads will disappear! Im also making my boyfriend try it too.  The smell is not strong at all but is very clean and fresh and the mud itself is very thick so you don&#x27;t need to use that much, I pretty much used what was left on the jar cover for my first application, not even really dipping into the jar itself! everyone should try this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. It is especially helpful during the summer because it removes excess oil and polishes my skin. I love this product and will reorder once I reach the bottom. Please note that this is mask was gentle enough to agree with my rosacea, so rosacea sufferers should definitely give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I have only used this mud mask twice and already my skin is softer and more radiant! People with rosacea or broken blood vessels should not scrub those areas due to the masks grainy texture but can smooth it on gently. I love the smell of this mud mask and the way it makes my skin look and feel! I will use it forever!!!</li>
            <li> Mud masks have never been part of my regular routine, but decided to try out this product. Been using it for a couple weeks and am pretty pleased. Skin feels smooth and nourished after using, and love how natural the product is. Only complaint is that I still have not seen any improvements to my minor acne, but perhaps it&#x27;s just too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> Thank you Barefaced for the excellent mud mask.  It helps me clean my pores out, it smells good, and my face feels great afterwards.  I use this mask 3-4 times per week.  A jar lasts a long time.  It is the same color and texture as real dead sea mud!!  Great customer service as well.</li>
            <li> I used this today for the first time, it smelled good, rinsed clean and my skin feels so soft! So far so good! I would recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> Great mud mask that smells nice and goes on very smoothly. It left my face refreshed and smooth. Would recommend to anyone, male or female.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based upon a friend&#x27;s recommendation and was blown away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve abandoned a few tubs like this before but I know this is one I&#x27;ll be using all of! The texture and delicate scent alone are so luxurious and for once I really felt like I was using the real deal. Probably because of the real dead sea mud and all the organic ingredients! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other masks that go on thin and feel like they barely harden, this is a nice thick muddy mix that can be applied as generously as you wish. A little more than I would usually spend, but I&#x27;m happy to have finally found a mask that I really enjoy using!</li>
            <li> Firstly there&#x27;s loads in this jar so I&#x27;ll definitely get my moneys worth out of this this stuff! Like the smell and all I can say is it makes my skin feel great all day! Feels soft, smooth and refreshed! I can see some already but highly recommend to any guys out there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years and use it once per week.  After I use it my face feels so smooth, moisturized, like I magically acquired better skin for the rest of the night.  And then the morning comes and it feels like it was all a dream.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic dead sea product, highly recommend to men or women! It makes my face feel really nice and no breakouts since using it! I would happily try again once it runs out, thanks!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Barefaced Mud Mask. The tub it comes in is great, using a bear for the logo since this is &amp;#34;Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask&amp;#34; is very cute, and helps to make this a perfect beauty gift for a friend. Using the mask, I didn&#x27;t have any skin irritation, and after washing it off (which is easy to do) my pores were significantly smaller, and my blackheads were gone.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me and I am very glad she did.  I have tried masks before which always seemed to leave my face completely dried out.  This is just lovely.  I hope to make it a part of my weekly routine.  My skin feels smooth &amp; supple.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.  It left my skin feeling soft and smooth,  not dry or tight like a lot of other masks tend to do.  I think that it&#x27;s because of the essential oils in it.  It has a cool,  slightly tingling feeling, but I liked it.  Smells fresh.</li>
            <li> The jar has many treatments in it as well, so once a week is realistic, and it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> I originally liked this product because of the bear as a joke, but decided to actually try it. Product has a very clean and earthy smell. I&#x27;m a mixture of dry skin with an oily/acne prone forehead and tend to be very sensitive to products, but did not find this irritating or pore clogging. I had a very light, clean, and refreshing feel to my face after use. Great for random weekend relaxing nights. I&#x27;d definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try a new skin care product!</li>
            <li> Best mask cream ever. Feels good when applied and leaves skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Cleared my psoriasis right up. And it sucks all impurities right out of my pores. It&#x27;s was the grossest. Yet coolest thing I&#x27;ve put on my face!! I will never be without this mask!!</li>
            <li> not helpful at all, smell so bed and very greasy after use it.</li>
            <li> This is probably my new favorite mask. I LOVE the intense minty feeling it has while its drying. I have acne prone/ oily skin and this really helps heal the spots and make my skin SO SOFT. Its not a greasy feeling when you take it off, its more like you just put on a thick moisturizer. I use this one the most out of my collection of face masks.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of face masks, mud masks and any other type of mask that I can sit back in the tub and let dry while I relax in my bubble bath or use a bath bomb. I was very happy to give this product a try because I am always looking for the masks that provide a fresh face with smooth skin and also works like cleaning pores and removing dirt/oil. I ordered the Barefaced Mud Mask from Amazon and it was here within 2 days so I was excited to give it a try. It&#x27;s a pretty large tub and even better is that a little bit goes a long way so I won&#x27;t go through this rather quickly. There scent isn&#x27;t too strong. It has a little bit of a lavender smell to it. It&#x27;s pretty thick so as I said, you don&#x27;t have to apply a lot. Rub it on and let it dry. It&#x27;ll tighten on your face and after about 15 minutes you&#x27;re free to wash it off. I have used it a couple of times now and am a fan for sure. Softer and clearer skin for the win!</li>
            <li> It got moldy in a month!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this mask. It left my skin hydrated and soft. I was a little nervous based on other reviews because I have sensitive skin, but while it did leave my skin red for a couple of minutes, it did not linger and my skin looked vibrant. It is great for an at home spa day or a little face pick me up. It only takes a little to cover the whole face and washes off with ease. While it has a slight mint scent, there is no weird minty tingle like with other masks. I really love this mask as a whole!</li>
            <li> They is one of the best face mask I have found! Highly recommend it. Face never felt better</li>
            <li> At the age of 44, I&#x27;ve come to realize I need to treat my skin better than I have until this point. I&#x27;ve started purchasing higher quality makeup products but also looking at various haircare and skincare products. I&#x27;ve discovered that I like lotions, creams and serums for daily use and enjoy masks for occasional \\&quot;repair\\&quot; work. Before starting this journey, I thought masks and peels were the same thing. They aren&#x27;t. For that matter, masks come in all kinds of varieties too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask for the purpose of sharing my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive Skin: I have sensitive skin and have to be careful with which products I use. This one didn&#x27;t cause me any issues or skin reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: As I said, I&#x27;ve tried several and this one has more of a goopy texture than many of the others. It is thick enough to not drip during application but it seemed like I wasn&#x27;t able to apply very much at a time. That isn&#x27;t a negative comment nor a positive - it&#x27;s simply stating that if you prefer a certain texture, keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: This is the first mask I have tried that said to gently massage the product into the skin. I actually really liked the feel of it and it certainly felt like it helped me apply it evenly and acknowledge the little crevices here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Process: It dries stiff but doesn&#x27;t feel like concrete. Timing is great as well, 15 minutes isn&#x27;t a huge time commitment. It wiped off extremely easily, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance: Many other reviewers said they could smell lavender. As someone who doesn&#x27;t like overly fragrant products, that was actually a good thing for me. During application, it had a slight fragrance but i don&#x27;t think it was the lavender coming through. I&#x27;m not sure what it was but I wasn&#x27;t particularly fond of it. HOWEVER, as soon as I got it wet 15 minutes later to rinse, I LOVED the scent it emitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End result: Holy cow did my skin feel soft. Not just soft... silky. I&#x27;m not kidding when I say that after using it on my face, I wanted to slather it on other parts of my body. Particularly, my arms and shoulders. The clean sensation was nice but the soft, silkiness was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really liked the product. It was easy to apply, quickly dried and the fragrance when rinsing was great. But I primarily liked it because of the end result: silky soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/25/2014 Edit: I&#x27;ve been notified by the company that they amended the fragrance after reading that it hadn&#x27;t gone over well. I love when a company takes feedback into consideration! That was really the only thing I didn&#x27;t really like about the product. As a result, I&#x27;ve amended my review from 4 stars to 5. Looking forward to trying it out with the new scent!using it on my face, I wanted to slather it on other parts of my body. Particularly, my arms and shoulders.

            <li> Love this face mask! Leaves skin smoother and not dry!</li>
            <li> I recently went to a well known spa and had a mud mask and I loved the results. I wanted something similar that I could do at home myself. I saw the barefaced Dead Sea mud mask so I decided to try it. I only like using face products last have the least amount of additives and this one was all natural and organic. I use the mask once a week and noticed after one use that my whiteheads were nearly gone. My pores were smaller and my skin wasn&#x27;t as oily. Needless to say after a month of using the mask my skin is soft, my pores are smaller and my skin is brighter. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Fells nice, smells good, face visibly clearer</li>
            <li> Im loving this product.  When I remove it, I can see the black heads come to the surface of my skin and my skin feels so fresh and clean.  The only small downside is the smell.  I am not a lover of the smell.  But all in all its a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I am a really big fan of this particular mud mask. The mask itself is very thick (think pudding), which makes it easy to cover your face. Plus, it is a deep, dark, greenish-brown color so you can see exactly where you placed it. As it dries you can feel it tighten on the skin, which I always associate with getting deep into those pores. I have pretty acne prone skin that I have been battling since I was a teenager. It has, in the very recent past, gotten very bad around my chin area. I love that this particular mask addresses those needs, however, I must speak to the way it made my skin look immediately renewed upon use! I think that this would work well for any skin type! Plus, with all natural and mostly organic ingredients, you really can&#x27;t go wrong. I will say that I must have put this on pretty thick, as it took a little effort to get off, but if you use a wash cloth, it is much easier. Again, I see this as a good thing, as it ensures that the effective ingredients are getting deep down where they need to be to do their thing. I highly recommend this mask to anyone who is looking for a weekly skin treatment that is simple and effective! I am thankful that I received a complimentary sample for review purposes.</li>
            <li> Helped my skin a lot!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a great product so far!  It was shipped pretty fast! I would recommend</li>
            <li> This is Luis A&#x27;s wife: Amazing mud mask, my skin feels great after using it. Would buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> The Barefaced Mud Mask comes in a 6 oz container and will last you quite some time since a little bit goes a long way. The recommended usage is once a week. If you are feeling a little more indulging you can use it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions say to massage onto your face and neck (I just did my face) avoiding the eye and lip areas.  Once applied, let sit for 15 minutes so it can dry and work it&#x27;s magic.  It goes on a slightly greenish color and smells quite nice with a minty fragrance and a slight tingle on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The mud mask dries to a more of a brown color. It really makes your face feel tight and firm!&lt;br /&gt;After you let the mask dry you just wash it off with warm water! Ta da!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your face will be smooth, firm and brighter!&lt;br /&gt; always love to find products that are 100% natural.  It&#x27;s nice to know exactly what you are applying to your skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and my skin was so amazingly soft to the touch after! I will definitely keep using weekly!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, which can get very oily in warmer weather. (Okay... I&#x27;m super sweaty.) My nose and farehead are my problem areas. I have tried numerous pore cleansing products, including nose strips but none of them have worked as well as this mask. My skin feels so much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*A great price for the huge jar you get.&lt;br /&gt;*Does a fantastic job of getting all the dirt out of your pores.&lt;br /&gt;*Dries super tight and you really feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;*Rinses very clean and leaves your skin feeling taut and clean.&lt;br /&gt;*Did a great job extracting many of the blackheads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*If you have very dry skin it might be too drying.&lt;br /&gt;*The smell wasn&#x27;t exactly the most appealing. It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but I found it odd. I&#x27;m also very picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am super happy with this. I feel like I will use it regularly. Totally worth investing in.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Got 2 and gave one as gift to my sister in law and she loves it too! Dries super fast and smells great too :) Use it about once a week and immediately improves my skin and feel so good afterwards. Would definitely recommend this product. Also I have really sensitive skin and had zero irritation from it!</li>
            <li> Barefaced dead sea mud mask .... CUTEST Container ever. Maybe because I like bears is why I wanted to try this so bad.&lt;br /&gt; This stuff ... gets good and bad marks from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First thing I notice on all things that I put on my face is SMELL ... this stuff does not smell great. It is like a mixture of crayons, glue and vapor rub. Pretty much smells like a kindergarten class room with a sick kid in it.&lt;br /&gt; That being said .... Once it is on your face for the first few moments, your nose adapts and it doesn&#x27;t bother you too much. (It&#x27;s not too terrible, just not pretty smelling like some of the other masks I have tried. (However, I have had skin reactions with those that smell good, and that could be the underlining factor. SO THIS IS A PLUS AND A CON.&lt;br /&gt; One. smells &amp;#34;Not so great.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; Two and this is a big one for me....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; TWO .... This is the first face mask that I have used where after I washed it off, my face was NOT red and irritated. It was my normal face color, no welts. HUGE for me. Since other masks I have tried, I always seem to have a reaction to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Three. Tightness, You know how when you wear face masks.. you can feel your face stiffen? Where when you smile, it feels like your face is flaking off? That didn&#x27;t happen the few times that I have used this stuff. Felt like a face. I honestly forgot I had it on, left it on for an hour and a half, instead of just the 15 minutes. So that is good ... because there is nothing worse than feeling like you have something stiffening your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Four. My face is as soft as a babies bottom. Feels fresh, and oddly MOISTERIZED. With others after washing it off, my face felt dry and I would end up putting on lotions etc. But Not with this. I washed it off and my face felt so good ... I just free balled it! Nothing, not even my vitamin c serum, I will put it on later, but for right now, this very moment, after having JUST washed it off my face. It feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Another thing I noticed, isn&#x27;t really something you should ... I am just clumsy in all that I do. While washing it off my face, I did accidently get some in my mouth. Definitely salty,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Another PLUS, when you order, they give you a 50 % code off your next purchase for just being loyal! I will be continuing the use of  this stuff. I really like it.Another thing I noticed, isn&#x27;t really something you should ... I am just clumsy in all that I do. While washing it off my face, I did accidently get some in my mouth.

            <li> this is a really nice mask with very nice ingredients but this might not be the right mask for super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received a product in exchange for an unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is my bread and butter! lol So I do a LOT to take care of it. I&#x27;ll try just about anything that will keep me blemish and wrinkle free.  Barefaced Mud Mask is all natural, organic, and paraben free Dead Sea mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their mud is harvested straight from the black mud of the Dead Sea. Then mixed with a few organic ingredients, the mud is ready to work magic for your skin. The mud itself is of perfect consistency. Its smooth and has a real natural scent. To apply, just add the mud to a freshly cleansed face and leave on for 15 minutes. I did notice a little bit of a burning sensation as I let the mud sit on my face but nothing more than what I normally feel with any other type of mask. After I rinsed the mask off, my face did have a few areas that were red for a little while. But my face did feel noticeably cleaner, smoother, and softer.  I do have somewhat sensitive skin so maybe the next time I use Bareface Mud Mask I will let is sit for a shorter amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;* I would recommend, if you have sensitive skin to test an area on your face first before leave it on for the full 15 minutes. *&lt;br /&gt;Barefaced claims to also help relieve skin conditions such as eczema so I plan on using it to help my daughters problem areas as well. Overall, its a fantastic product that leaves my skin feeling pure. The natural ingredients are a plus for me. I constantly hear about all the dangerous ingredients and chemicals that people put in the products. So to know that what I&#x27;m putting on my skin comes from the Earth leaves me with a great feeling.</li>
            <li> This mask is AWESOME! It feels so cool and refreshing on the skin and it never ever irritated my extremely sensitive skin on all the times that I used it. I am a face mask aficionado and I have tried mud masks that would feel good upon initial use and then start burning as it dries on your face. That has never happened on all the times that I used Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask. It washes off easy! It is worth every penny, as it works like a champ on my sensitive and problematic skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Barefaced was nice enough to send me their Dead Sea Mud Mask to test out for them and I have to say I really love this stuff!  I love that it is made with 100% Natural &amp; Organic ingredients and the value is unbeatable.  The mask smells nice and earthy and I really like they way it felt on my skin as it dried, like it was sucking all the bad stuff right out of my pores and my skin felt so soft and smooth afterwards.  This is great stuff and I would recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> This product is great !  Makes my skin soft, smooth, toned, and my face hasn&#x27;t been oily in mornings since I started using Barefaced Dead Sea mud mask.  *** UPDATE.  I bought this when it cost $16 something. Now they&#x27;re trying to charge $44.95 ??  No way.  Not worth that price and I would never pay that for this product !</li>
            <li> Smooth, and refreshingly tingly!  One friend said my skin looked like it had a &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34;  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it! Makes my skin very smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of product from Dead Sea. I have start from exfoliating my skin with Dead sea salt and washed out my face of it. My face is pretty clean and I am ready to apply layer of mad mask. This mask is AWESOME and has worked wonders for me! It feels so cool and refreshing on my face and it did not irritate my sensitive skin. Barefaced Dead Sea Mud mask has a gel-like consistency and very easy to apply, no runs, prefect coverage. I had kept on my face until complete dryness, about 25 min. I have to give advice to users of mask to choose dark color of wash cloth to wash out mask. I got a white and my wash cloth got mud color but nothing can ruin my mood after mud mask. Just PREFECT!  Can&#x27;t stop talking about how great my face felt after. I have lost ages just after first use, wrinkles visible got softer and pores almost disappear. I am just glowing!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask to anyone who wants to have fast result for almost no money.</li>
            <li> I was only able to try this product once since their instructions claim it should only be used once per week.  I&#x27;m currently staying at a friend&#x27;s place while I plan my big move back home.  My friend&#x27;s husband was away for a few days last week on a business trip, so one night we decided to try this mud mask out! I mean who wants to be seen all scary looking when not in front of your girlfriends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mud mask looks similar to...well...mud but I would say it&#x27;s more of a slate grey kind of color.  The consistency is also not as gross as real mud. (Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve never gone &amp;#34;mudding.&amp;#34;  I know it&#x27;s a thing but I&#x27;ve never done it.)  I applied the mud mask and it went on  pretty easily and didn&#x27;t have a horrible chemical smell.  Since all of the ingredients are natural the smell wasn&#x27;t bad.  After I put on the mask, I stepped out into the living room and my friend&#x27;s puppy started barking at me. I think I scared her with my demon-looking face.  I mean come on, no one looks normal when they have mud on their face.  It started to dry fairly quickly and turned kind of hard when done.  I couldn&#x27;t really smile because my face muscles were stiff due to the mud mask drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my friend Sarah and I kept the mask on for 15 minutes then rinsed it off in the sink with warm water.  This is not a peel off mask so you will have to wash it off thoroughly.  It came off pretty easy except on the sides of my face where I had to scrub a little harder.  My face felt refreshed after using the mask and my nose, which is constantly clogged with sebum, felt much smoother and clearer.  My friend Sarah felt the same way.  Two thumbs up from me and this awesome mask! I plan on using the mask once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mud mask is 99% natural with one ingredient that isn&#x27;t natural.  If you are into masks with mostly natural ingredients and would like to try playing with mud on your face, then give this a try!  You will have a lot of fun doing it.  Just try not to scare anyone!</li>
            <li> From the first time I used it my pores looked smaller and clearer. Overall a great product</li>
            <li> This is the first product like this I have used, but my face felt incredibly soft after using.  I didn&#x27;t mind the tingle it caused, and did not find it painful as other reviewers did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask twice weekly since I purchased it and I can say I&#x27;ve seen absolutely zero positive results. If anything, I say my skin appears to have been breaking out slightly more than normal (could be due to other factors though). I&#x27;m not impressed at all and do not plan to repurchase. In the past I&#x27;ve had much better success using a sulfur-based masks for acne-prevention.</li>
            <li> Well, I usually apply mud mask before my bath because you know, it&#x27;s messy when you wash off your face! It&#x27;s a 6 oz jar, a great size, probably will last for more than 6 months I guess! The mud actually feels like gooey and it doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh scent like the previous one I have tried which I mainly love about it. It&#x27;s easy to apply on your face.I waited for 15 minutes to completely let it dry and then straightly went to shower. You can either use a warm wet towel or washed without towel, it&#x27;s up to you. I simply massage my face slowly with a little bit water to loosen up the mask and then I can easily clean my face with towel.To be honest I didn&#x27;t see any difference after washing off the mask. It just didn&#x27;t do anything on my face. At least I was expecting an instant result but Sadly there was nothing I feel.And the next day, I got some rashes on my face (wow!on my cheek side, Holy cow!!) which I am so mad about it right now!! This mask didn&#x27;t suit on my skin rather gave me bloody rash!! [I do not have sensitive skin though!!]&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am not so impressed at all because this mask gave me rashes on my skin and there was no good effect about it. I do not recommend it if you have sensitive skin!! It&#x27;s works ok for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love Dead Sea Mud Masks! They are the best.&lt;br /&gt;The picture on the jar is so cute.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorites. It doesn&#x27;t have a wonderful scent, but what would you expect salty mud to smell like right? It&#x27;s not a disgusting scent though.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow,&lt;br /&gt;I mix it up a little with my finger and apply it thickly to my already cleansed and slightly damp face. I leave it on for the required amount of time, and yes I can really feel it working. I feel my skin tightening and a little bit of a tingle. I love the feeling. Then, I rinse off, with a damp cloth and my skin feels incredible. Extremely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Such a great mask! Looking forward to using this mask weekly. It&#x27;s like a spa day for me at home whenever I use it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free jar of Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask in exchange for an honest review. All opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
            <li> This is a little bit different than other mud masks. The texture is a mud/gel-like feel which is quite strange, but does a great job as a mask as you would expect. It has a strong medicinal scent and you can \\&quot;Feel\\&quot; it working on the skin. I love when you can feel that in a facial product. While the consistency is different to me it applies easily and smoothly. It dries quickly. The main difference is when you clean it off your face. It leaves a silky smooth feeling where you feel like a moisturizer is not really necessary.  I Imagine it is because of the multiple clarifying, moisturizing and oils in the ingredient list like  Dead Sea Mud, Organic Lavender Essential Oil, Organic Eucalyptus Essential Oil, Hickory Bark Extract, Non GMO Xanthan Gum, Organic Aloe Vera Juice, Water, Kaolin Clay, Organic Shea Butter, Organic Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Organic Calendula Oil  The one thing I would like to see different due to the texture is either a squeeze tube or a scoop since it is gel like and slippery. I also think being able to stir it is a plus to mix the mud. I used a Qtip to stir it around. I received the product for an unbiased and uncompensated review.</li>
            <li> The second I laid eyes on the Barefaced Mud Mask, I knew I had to have it. How cute is that packaging? And the play on words? Love it! Mud masks are excellent to incorporate in to your skincare routine because Dead Sea mud is full of nutrients, salt and natural minerals that are shown to have healing properties for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mud mask claims to tone and tighten the skin, exfoliate and unclog pores, draw out oils and dirt, and moisturize skin to stimulate collagen to fight wrinkles. This dark brown mask smells just like something out of Aveda. I absolutely love the earthy, herbal smell. The texture has a bit of grittiness to it and it dries rather fast, within 10 minutes. The packaging says to keep the mask on for 15 minutes and rinse dry with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask makes your skin feel really tight (and has a cooling effect) as it dries, and when you rinse it off the gritty texture softly exfoliates the skin. Afterwards, my skin felt super soft and really clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I wish I could use the product  everyday , its a wonderful mask, its gentle on my very sensitive skin , and it smells superb, very earthy, this product not only makes me happy, but my face as well. also, bears are cute.</li>
            <li> This product is great!! First of all, when I first opened the package I loved how it smells! I don&#x27;t know much about mud masks, but Great mud mask that smells nice and goes on very smoothly. My skin felt great afterwards. Works also if you have facial hair, so guys don&#x27;t miss out.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a couple of times since I just got it last week. So far so good. It smells good and comes off cleanly. My face feels smooth and clean right away. Will reserve the fifth star for at least a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> The product was satisfactory. It was easy to use and apply. Although I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the smell, it doesn&#x27;t take away from the use of the product. For full product reviews, please check out my blog: laceituplove.blotspot.com</li>
            <li> when I opened it. it smelled like nice spa smell. But when I actually put on my face, it smelled like dirt. But while I&#x27;m putting on my face, I can feel my skin is healing and tighten.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing mask! It helped clear up my skin and I love the clean smell! Will definitely order from them again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too impressed with this mask as everyone else seems to be. It seems to help with the redness of my face but it does nothing for my acne or dark spots. I kinda regret spending the money on it.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, so I was worried that this would upset my skin, but it worked wonders! I have a small acne breakout after the first use, but after that, it kept my skin really clear, and it looked like I was glowing! If I have a zit pop up at all, I just put a little on that one area, and it clears it right up! I use it on my face once to twice a week, and my skin has never been this clear!</li>
            <li> Refreshing and smooth.  Has a nice smell to it.  Just switched from GlamGlow to this, and I loved the feel of my skin afterward with Barefaced.  And the price is much better.  Especially for the size of it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell amazing, but it&#x27;s a mud mask so i think its okay! My face feels so smooth after, I love masks where you can see the mask drying too.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice mask and feels spa quality. Relaxing, and it made my face feel fresh and deep cleaned afterwards. I have to moisturize after using although this is pretty normal with face masks in my opinion. I didn&#x27;t break out afterward , which can sometimes happen. Happy all round and well worth a try, would recommend. Also a really reasonable price for the quality you get.</li>
            <li> Went to use it this morning only to find a big mold colony in it. GROSS!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by telling you that this Mud Mask is the real deal. I&#x27;ve used masks before and didn&#x27;t notice any results. With this Mask I can tell you it does its job. A mask helps pull out all the impurities in your skin and your pores, cleansing your pores in the process. If you have imperfections already it will aid in clearing out your clogged pores. Now I live in the desert where it is over 100 degrees this month. I sweat frequently as I move about outdoors. So my pores have been a little clogged. I used this and within days I had several imperfections rise to the skin and work their way to the surface. I had no idea my pores were clogged that bad. This mud is pretty amazing. I&#x27;m going to use this mask once a week from now on to make sure my skin is nice and clear. I usually never have a problem but i recently had a clogged pore that was pretty deep and if I had been using this mask I probably could have avoided that. I was given this product in exchange for an honest review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and feels so good when you are putting it on your face. I tend to massage it on with gentle circular motions and let it dry then rinse it off in the shower. My skin is still oily but glows after I take off the mask. Feels like there is a little residue afterwards but that may be because of the horrible moisturizer I was using. Have not tried it since switching moisturizer last week.</li>
            <li> I got this to try You all know I love a good facemask so when I got the chance to try this one out I was so excited.  This was a very thick mud mask but still went on like butter.  I did this mask with my mom and we both loved it.  As a matter of fact she loved it so much she stole it lol.  The mask will help tone and tighten skin.  It also helps exfoliate and get the impurities out.  I could tell after the first use that my skin was smoother and softer.  I loved how well this mask worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The mask took about 15 minutes to dry and was very easy to wash off.  I did not have to scrub like I do with some of them.  This Dead Sea mask is all natural and organic ingredients and Paraben free.  I loved this face mask very easy to use and left my skin glowing and softer after just one use.  The price is great and I would recommend this mask to everyone.</li>
            <li> This has a very earthy scent that lingers for some time. I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant, but some might. Doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your face, so the jar lasts quite a while. Just spread a little over your skin avoiding eye and mouth areas, let it firm up about 5-6 minutes, and rinse off. Great ingredients. This mask really tightens quickly. I like how it left my skin feeling afterwards. Not for sensitive skin as it is very stimulating.</li>
            <li> This is a good mud mask. I&#x27;d give it five stars if it didn&#x27;t have such a strong scent to it. However, it works really really well, and dries super fast. It&#x27;s a nice thick mask that clears out your skin and does an awesome job exfoliating your face since it has a grainy kind of texture. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this if you&#x27;re not sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> I had a really horrible experience with this stuff -- and I&#x27;m not sure whether it was just my skin doing a &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m terrified to ever use it again. I used it, following the instructions, and two days later woke up with 10 giant acne bumps on my face. It was the worst breakout I&#x27;ve had in my life. Scared to use it again, so it&#x27;s just sitting in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I have always liked anything with dead sea mud. I like this even more because of the chemicals, or lack thereof, in the ingredients list. I like natural products that do not cause irritation of flakiness. I would recommend that people try it.</li>
            <li> Works great! Skin feels nice after use. My only complaint is the smell. But overall it&#x27;s great stuff</li>
            <li> Great product, for the whole family.</li>
            <li> So very awesome!! The mud mask isn&#x27;t too overwhelming and the effect is equivalent to a spa facial. LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> I have tried this mud mask a few times now and really enjoy it. When I first apply it to my face it feels tingly and after washing off my skin is SO SOFT! The smell is earthy with a hint of lavender, my husband loves it! It has helped with my acne prone skin and I will continue to use it. Must try!</li>
            <li> My wife never tried a mud mask before. She read the reviews about how it worked for some people and not for others. She tried it while watching a show on the Filipino channel. She followed the directions. The mask was easy for her use and had a nice scent. After thirty minutes or so, she rinsed it off. She did this and her skin was much smoother after she used it. She will continue to use it because she likes the results. We don&#x27;t know a think about other mud masks, but this one did the trick for her skin.</li>
            <li> As a mom with a limited income, I rarely get the chance to pamper myself. A good facial is just about as close to a spa day as I can get. When I opened the jar I was surprised that this actually was mud. It did have a scent but I didn&#x27;t find it offensive at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nice and thick, not runny at all. After I put it on I could feel my skin tightening and tingling as the mud dried on my face. It washed off easily with a soft cloth and left me skin feeling smooth and refreshed. I tend to have oily skin which is especially noticeable at the end of a long day and this definitely seemed to help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be making this a part of my weekly beauty regiment</li>
            <li> The scent made me feel like I was having an aromatherapy facial.  It was deeply relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing off the mask and lightly patting it dry, I saw that my skin was instantly brighter and glowing.  My skin was soft to the touch.  I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at my skin.  The texture looking much better and it was much tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with this mask and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love mud masks! I am always trying to find a new mask to review. I have had great experiences with mud masks in the past, so I jumped at the opportunity to review this one. What immediately stood out to me about this mud mask was definitely the cute bear on the tub of it. This made me think of the wilderness, which intrigued me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason a bear is on the tub of this mud mask is because it is made with a unique combination of minerals and salts that are great for our skin!eally love the smell of the mudmask. Immediately when I received it, I opened it and smelled it. It has a refreshing minty smell, which I am assuming is a combination of the Lavender, Aloe Vera, and Eucalyptus. While it is on your face all you smell is that refreshing aroma! It is very relaxing! It leaves your face feeling SO soft and smooth!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You receive a HUGE tub of this mud mask! It will last you forever! I recommend this to anyone who is suffering from acne, aging, dark spots, oil skin, dry skin, or for anyone that just wants a pick me up on their skin! It will get rid of that dullness leaving your face looking bright and refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product complimentary to give my full and honest opinion, whether it be positive or negative!</li>
            <li> I received this mask for the purpose of review, but the opinions within are my own. I have been using this amazing mask for several weeks and it feels great on my skin. I love the way it dries and tightens and when I was it off, my skin appears fresh and new. My pores are smaller and my skin looks amazing. Though it does look like mud, it does not smell bad...but rather minty like...earthy. I like it. I love the ingredients,the scent and how it makes my skin look and feel, what more can you ask for from a mask??</li>
            <li> The product smells great and leaves your skin feeling refreshed. It definitely helped with my oily skin and clears up your pores. The shipping was also very fast and even arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> 3 stars only because my skin is not the right type for this mask. It&#x27;s a little astringent, which is great for teenage skin but I have dry patch &amp; really sensitive around my cheeks so it was a little too drying &amp; stingy for me. But it has a refreshing scent with a dark colored clay that was very smooth.</li>
            <li> When I first went to use this, I almost couldn&#x27;t. The smell of this stuff is pretty bad. It has a very VERY VERY earthy scent. Nothing pleasant, or anything you would want to put on your face. But I did... and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got past the scent and applied this on my face. A thin layer is all you need. The texture feels just like mud, thus it being a mud mask. Same color as mud as well. I left this mask on for 15 minutes, and once I rinsed my face I could see and feel a difference. My skin looked so healthy, hydrated, and incredibly clean. My skin was soft to the touch, and it almost had a tingly feeling to it. These results are worth dealing with the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this now about 2-3 times a week, and it just adds to my bath time. I can relax, apply this on, and just soak while my face is having a spa treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this, and I will warn about the smell, it isn&#x27;t pleasant. However if you can deal with the wonky smell for 15 minutes to achieve beautiful hydrated skin then it&#x27;s well worth it! This would get 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift. Its a good mask and works nicely. Smells fine too. Really earthy...like mud! Would happily purchase for myself.</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend. He really loves products that leave his face soft without making them oily. I highly recommend this product for men who like to take care of their skin in a manly way!</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE IT! My face is so smooth after just once!!!!</li>
            <li> It feels cooling on the skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! With all my heart!</li>
            <li> Love using this product!</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed a difference in the appearance of my pores after the first application. This product has a really nice smell as well!</li>
            <li> I love the results from the face mud.  It makes my face feel smooth and clean.  In addition, the price is reasonable.  I will definite order again.</li>
            <li> This mask made my skin feel soft and supple after using it. I was not really crazy about the smell but that wasn&#x27;t that big a deal when considering how my face looked and felt after use. Authentic Dead Sea mud will have a slight sulfur odor to it, which is how you know that it is real Dead Sea mud. This mask is the real deal... I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like the way product works. Hydrates and cleanses but may cause breakout first couple of uses, as any new product introduced to the skin could.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. It came quickly after ordering. The mask works great and a little goes a long way! I&#x27;ve used it multiple times and it looks like the jar is still full. Would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> I love this face mud.My face looks and feels refreshed and replendished</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but loved the tingle and my face was glowing afterward. Going to use again tonight and then regularly afterwards. Will post another review after a few more uses, but so far, I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product! Absolutely helped my skin look noticeably clearer within the first few days, and I can&#x27;t wait to see that long term results! I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need eucalyptus and mint on my sensitive skin. I had hoped for more Dead Sea content and less fillers that irritate my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far, but my face felt cool, clean, and refreshed. I like it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have received my product. I loved it, I have only used it once, and I can&lt;br /&gt; already tell a difference, I can not wait to get a few more uses out of it&lt;br /&gt; to see it&#x27;s full potential. I have a wedding in August of 2015 and want my&lt;br /&gt; face to be beautiful. This product is amazing and I look forward to&lt;br /&gt; purchasing more!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try mud masks before but just never have for one reason or another so when I got the chance to try out the Barefaced one I jumped on the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned my face real good before using the mud mask, applied, and left on around 10 minutes as per the instructions. It was a bit different than other type masks I have tried and I must admit I felt kinda funny smearing &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; on my face although it is a practice that has been used for ages! Once I got past that initial reaction the cream was cool to my face which felt lovely in this hot hot weather lately and although it did have a slight &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; aroma it was not overwhelming to me so that was a definite plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the product once so far so I can&#x27;t say I have noticed any drastic changes but upon rinsing it off my face did feel a bit smoother and soft. I will continue using it maybe once a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free</li>
            <li> The product is very good. After two times using, my skin feels soft and moristure.</li>
            <li> Relaxing scent and leaves my skin super soft. Follow instructions, I left it too long ( I was watching something) and my skin felt a little dry. Other than that, I loved it! I&#x27;m glad I ordered 2 to last me.</li>
            <li> Great product that left my skin feeling clean and clear! Use over an extended period resulted in cleaner, healthier looking skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice so far. I love how it makes my skin feel so smooth and clean. I really enjoy the smell, but if you are opposed to putting mud on your face then this is not a product for you. I am going to keep using it and see what results I get. I did notice when I woke up the blackheads on my nose were minimal.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
            <li> Ok. So I only buy things on Amazon if they have good reviews. I wanted a nice mask that I DIDNT have to mix. This not only is that it also smells amazing, really get the mint. I used it as well as my boyfriend who has terrible pores (took a before and after that I will attach) now it doesn&#x27;t look like much in the photos, but my god the stuff it sucked out of his pores. I&#x27;m sure with frequent use it will look amazing. It made my skin feel SOOOO smooth. My pores aren&#x27;t  too terrible thanks to my clarisonic but this mask totally sucked out the last bit of gunk out of them. All of that and my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry either, the glycerin helps big time. The website had mentioned wrinkle reduction. Now after a few years as a retail pharmacist and a constant  &amp;#34;you have got to be kidding me face&amp;#34; at 26 I have a few small wrinkles on my forehead. However I am realistic that it will take a few uses and nothing is a miracle worker, but I&#x27;m sure it will do some good in that aspect as well. All and all in pretty impressed and cannot wait to see the results on both of us with some consistent use. 👏👍</li>
            <li> The mask smells great (like you are at the spa). For me it is a little harsh and begins to burn after 5 minutes. I have fair, sensitive, acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve used it once a week for 4 weeks and it works ok to clear my pores a bit.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It doesn&#x27;t smell super great but it has no artificial fragrances so its completely &amp;#34;bare-ble&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  It makes your skin feel great and removes excess dirt and dead skin.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for organic, cruelty free products and Barefaced Facial Mud Mask was just that and more.  Unlike other mud masks that have irritated my skin during application, this one does not, and I love the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male, 25 year-old, full-time graduate student and I decided to take better care of my face. I have sensitive skin with acne that appears every now and then. It&#x27;s not terrible but not something I want to deal with anymore. I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and it seems to do a good job at keeping my skin clear along with a healthy diet and clean pillow cases regularly. It seems that they care about their customers and stand by their product since they&#x27;re willing to take feedback seriously. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It has been four weeks since I&#x27;ve been consistently using their product, and I can already see immediate results. I am very satisfied with my purchase. My skin is clearer, healthier, and just looks and feels so much better. In particular, my acne scars are even becoming less noticeable and I&#x27;ve mostly stopped breaking-out with regular use of this product! Hopefully--although I&#x27;m not sure if the product can do this--my acne scares can become completely effaced from my face and that the product continues to be just as effective.    For now, I honestly believe that in six months, as this product claims, my skin will be \\&quot;beautifully barefaced.\\&quot;    In lieu of all these benefits, I haven&#x27;t really experienced any negative effects. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest, but all mud masks--the good ones at least--are like that. In addition, it does tend to leave your skin dry so don&#x27;t leave it on too long!    Please continue to put out such a great quality product!</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth... havent been using long enough to see long term results, but hoping it is all it promises to be, especially with winter coming</li>
            <li> I finally made the time tonight to finally try this mud mask out.  I only have experience of how my skin feels the same day, but I will update my review if I have any significant reactions or problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the mud very creamy and it felt great going on my skin. The smell was actually mostly pleasant to me and I could feel a very mild calming tingling going on while it was drying. After about 6 to 7 minutes it was quite dry but I waited the full recommended 10 minutes. By this point my skin was feeling tight and the mask was quite dry, it felt as though it would be uncomfortable soon but fortunately it was time to remove it. The mud came off very easily with warm water and some gentle wiping of a wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after using the mask my skin felt clean and soft. It definitely felt a bit tighter. A short time later my skin still felt soft and a bit dryer so I followed up with my normal nightly moisturizer and it feels fantastic. Overall as long as I have no adverse reaction from here I will definitely be adding this to my weekly skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Very effective mask. I loved using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Smells good, feels terrific - it tingles, and after you rinse it off you feel like you&#x27;re wearing brand new skin.  I put a generous amount of moisturizer on afterwards and repeat about twice per week.  It&#x27;s just as good as other products at 3X the price!</li>
            <li> My face is so soft and clean!  Love this product and even my Husband tried it out as well!  Will definitely purchase again and again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super crazy about this product. It feels nice going on and I like the earthy smell but I haven&#x27;t achieved any positive long term changes. When you remove the mask, your face does feel soft but there are no positive or negative visual affects.</li>
            <li> It was ok, nothing spectacular.  I was actually expecting more of a glow from something so natural.  I will keep using it, but I seem to get better results from philosophy masks.  Not sure if I would purchase again.  Jury is still out.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for the first time and she was very impressed with the product. I would love to buy it again.</li>
            <li> It gave my skin very soft and deep moisturized feeling after only putting it for two days in a row.  It burns a little when you apply it but nothing unbearable, plus you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this mask. I have seen a big difference in the overall appearance of my skin. It really cleans my skin, it helped me a lot with my whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mud mask for HMU prep on a feature film and was incredibly happy with it! This mask smells amazing, cleans beautifully, feels great, and was an excellent purchase. All of my client&#x27;s skin looked incredibly radiant after using Bearfaced mud mask and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to treat their face well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product! I am a college freshman, and have been really stressed out lately and have been breaking out a lot. Other traditional methods like benzoyl peroxide just weren&#x27;t working, in fact, my skin seemed to be getting worse. In a last ditch effort to find a solution before having to break down and schedule a dermatologist appointment, I found this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I noticed after about 3 uses, or a week and a half, my skin was much more clear and less acne was actually starting to form. The smell is a little off-putting at first, but you learn tog et used to it. Other than that this is a great product and I recommend it to anyone who is struggling with acne.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask. For one it feels good when applied to my face, and neck area. Another thing about this mask is that it has all natural ingredients. There are no weird sounding ingredients in here, that any consumer should be worried about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily/combination skin, so when I put this mask on, I was surprised how soothing this mask was. It has lavender oil, and eucalyptus, which is probably why I love this mask so much!</li>
            <li> This is amazing! It helps clean your skin and feels great on it!. This something you have to have for a little pampering time! A+++</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far so I cannot comment on it&#x27;s usefulness. I can, however, say that it smells atrocious. Get ready to either hold your breath for 15 minutes or spend that time gagging.</li>
            <li> Good mask. Easy to apply and when I washed it off, my face felt so clean. My face was a little pink, but it didn&#x27;t last long. I would suggest a face cream after using this. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from years of acne and I struggle to maintain a half-decent complexion. My friend recommended a particular peel-off mask to me, but it was way too expensive. I tend to look for products at a great price, so I decided I would see what Amazon had to offer in terms of facial masks. This one seemed to stand out. Everywhere I looked, I saw outstanding reviews, and I saw claims that it helped with acne and facial imperfections. I decided I wanted to try it out, and I couldn&#x27;t be more grateful. I opened up the mud mask and was pleasantly surprised by the smell. It kind of reminded me of lemons. I applied the mask and it dried pretty quickly. I could feel a little bit of tingling, which reassured me that it was working its magic. The mask wasn&#x27;t too tight on my face, which made for a pretty comfortable experience. After 10 minutes, I washed it off with warm water and patted my face dry. The mud mask came off easily, and the result was great! My skin felt incredibly supple and soft, and the size of my pores has visibly been reduced. I&#x27;m excited to continue using this product, and I would recommend this to anyone thinking of buy a facial mask.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderfully refreshing and washes off easily. Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Works really well with my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask two times a week for about 3 weeks and I love it! The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all - it&#x27;s a natural mud smell and texture. I use it specifically for my oily t-zone and clogged pores around my nose and jaw line. I love how soft and clean my skin is after I remove the mask with a warm, wet wash cloth!!</li>
            <li> I have been buying from Amazon for years and this is the second review I have felt it necessary to write.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 57 and have okay skin. THIS STUFF ROCKS. I never believe the hype on beauty products but this product is different. i have only used it twice now but I will never be without it.  I used it while having a long soak in the bath and it stimulated blood flow to my skin without making it sensitive afterwards. I love how my skin looks and feels afterwards,</li>
            <li> Uhm...Peeee-Uuuuu.  This stuff stinks.  Really stinks.  I&#x27;m not sure of its effectiveness because I only use it very rarely...because it stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/6/2015 Update:  I had to toss this out without hardly any use.  It was at least 3 weeks since I last used it.  When I opened the jar this morning, the top layer was covered in fuzzy mold.  I will NOT be using this product again nor do I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mask. My face is clear and baby-smooth. Barefaced mud mask has become an essential part of my skin routine.</li>
            <li> Love this mud mask!  My pores size has reduced significantly and my skin is much clearer!  I have used all sorts of mud mask, but this by far the best!</li>
            <li> I initially wrote a review saying the smell was unpleasant. Barefaced was SO responsive that they actually sent me a new batch that has a slightly different smell! I am extremely impressed with the customer service. The new batch is still &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smelling, but does have a hint of mint scent that does improve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual mask, I&#x27;ve been using it twice a week for about three weeks now and I do see an improvement in my skin. It&#x27;s softer, clearer, and the coloring is somehow better. I took it over to my mom&#x27;s house yesterday and we both did the masks and thought they felt great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, compared to other mud masks, this one has a competitive price and is a great value.</li>
            <li> Great! I have combination skin and this works great. I had my husband try it and he loved it too. : )</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing it&#x27;s the real deal I just got it today and I have used it with my mother you can feel it working . I will be getting another one soon because my mother wants it . Thank you so much</li>
            <li> literally the best. My skin is clearer, face is less red, and just an overall healthy glow to my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but the results are immediately noticeable! The morning after using it, I woke up to some of the clearest skin I&#x27;ve seen in years. I would highly recommend this to anyone who isn&#x27;t responding well to the typical store-bought scrubs and washes. Amazing stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This may well be great for others but I could not get past the smell -- too honey sweet offish.  Apologies to Barefaced Skincare who seem genuinely interested in pleasing their customers....</li>
            <li> Great stuff. It leaves my face feeling really clean without making it feel dried out. I seem to notice some reduction in blackheads as well. I love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> I bought this product with excitement and apprehension. The apprehension came from the fact that when I was a teenager, I had terrible skin and would have to get glycolic peels which were incredibly painful and some products still irritate my skin. I also have eczema so that makes my skin even more sensitive. In total I had four people try this product - myself (female, aged 24), my brother (male aged 22), my boyfriend (male, aged 25) and my mother. Reviews are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: I initially washed my face with my regular face wash as directions state. I then generously applied the product. I personally really like the smell - it reminded me of lavender. I also liked the texture of this product - it was thick yet I was able to apply it easily and it didn&#x27;t become patchy like a lot of masks do so you have to use an obscene amount of product (which helps with overall cost). I felt a tingle, mainly around my mouth as that&#x27;s my &amp;#34;problem area&amp;#34; but it didn&#x27;t burn and I like that feel as it signifies to me that it is doing something. This feeling went away after approximately 30 seconds as the product dried. As expected with a mud mask, as it dried it hardened (fairly quickly in comparison to other mud masks I&#x27;ve used). This did make it hard to move your face and my dad had a laugh at me as I tried to eat a piece of bread. I washed off the product at the stated 15 mins - I liked the removal process. It didn&#x27;t seem to adhere to my skin as I&#x27;ve found with other products in the past and since it had dried, it felt like I was also exfoliating my face as well as lathering it. I dried my face with a towel and immediately felt a difference. I let my face completely dry and felt it with the back of my hand. It was SO soft! I honestly couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face the rest of the evening. I even didn&#x27;t wash my face when I went to bed three hours later to see how it would feel in the morning. I have an oily face and in the morning it still felt smooth, and not as oily as it usually would. I would 100% recommend this product to other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brother: Into personal hygeine and takes more time than the basics. Also liked the smell. He said there was no problem removing it and loved the feel after and thought his razor burn looked less irritated on his neck from shaving that morning. Also had glycolic peels and said he thought it helped the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boyfriend: Basic male hygeine routine. Wasn&#x27;t fond of the smell but didn&#x27;t hate it. This was his first mud mask and thought the tightening feel was awkward. Washed off easily and agreed that it made his face feel a lot softer and his facial hair feel incredibly soft. Had one bad pimple at the time which looked less red a few hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mother: Had the exact same response as I did. She couldn&#x27;t stop touching her face and saying exactly how great it felt and if she could take the tub with her (which I did not allow).</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice since I purchased it ( once a week as directed). It seems to act as an exfoliant and a mask on my skin. I followed the instructions, left it on for 15 minutes. You can feel your skin tightening. It has a nice aroma. I can smell the lavender oil. After the 15 minutes, I used warm water and a wash cloth to remove the mud. My skin was noticeably improved! There was a healthy glow and was very soft! The next morning the effects remained! So I would recommend this product and will continue to use it weekly.</li>
            <li> This mask is excellent for a deep-pore cleanse and really softens the skin. It goes on smooth and almost has a whipped texture to it. After 5 minutes it will begin to harden and you can feel a cooling affect. It&#x27;s easy to wash off and leaves the skin fresh, soft, and silky.</li>
            <li> This mask feels great on and washes away clean.  After using it, my skin feels so soft and refreshed.  Great product and great results.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product. You can simply feel your pores being naturally cleansed within seconds. The tingle is fantastic and your skin will truly recover overnight. I owe a lot to this product!</li>
            <li> This product is great! !! Coming from me that is alot to say since I never leave products feed back!!! Trust me you have to try this. From a mother of three boys on a budget and don&#x27;t have time for facials at salons this will fit your bill.</li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling clean with a noticeable difference after a week or so of using. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Felt great in my skin. Skin looked great afterwards. Will continue tonise!</li>
            <li> Great customer service. My favorite mud mask!!!!</li>
            <li> I kept this is a cool dry place, only used it twice, got it out to use a third time and it had mold all over the top. Had to throw it away. I did like it when I got to use it though.</li>
            <li> Of all the products of this type I have used, this is the best yet.  Balanced mix of ingredients.  Great texture and balance of oils.  Nice scent.  Most of all, it really does a great job on my skin.  Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Great consistency, very smooth and pleasant smelling compared to others I have tried in the past. Seems to keep my face clear using only once a week!</li>
            <li> This mask is ticking all the boxes for me! Smells great, good value, cleared up my skin and is very gentle so no nasty burning sensation like I get from other masks. Will definitely be making a second purchase, thank you Barefaced Skincare!</li>
            <li> Great experience, great product!</li>
            <li> Great easy to use product. Have previously used a dead sea mud mask and when I put it on, it actually felt like it was burning, so to not get the burning sensation was great. I enjoyed the smell of it, wasn&#x27;t overwhelming. The product came quickly after ordering and came packaged perfectly, which was a relief, I&#x27;ve had places that just threw products in a box and went for it. I have really enjoyed adding this to my weekly routine and recommend it to anyone who would like a great face mask.I did receive this product for free, but all thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail a couple of days ago and have only used it once since then, following the directions which recommend to use once a week, but from using it just one time I&#x27;ve noticed a small difference in my skin. Can&#x27;t wait to keep using!</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the Barefaced Mud Mask, I have tried another one similar to this one and loved it. I think the main issue I have with this product is the mud isn&#x27;t all that thick. To me the mud is kind of watery which isn&#x27;t how mud is suppose to be, when I apply a product to my face I would like it to stay put and not be all watery feeling. I did feel the affects of the oils and other ingredients used to help pull the impurities out and add moisture to your skin. It wasn&#x27;t a complete bust but I am not a big fan. I do want to add though if you are a type who can&#x27;t be around strong potent smells you might want to pass this one up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note just because an item isn&#x27;t a favorite of mine doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t a favorite to you.</li>
            <li> This was an amazing company to work with. The mask was awesome. It didn&#x27;t get too tight like some others I have used before. This had a nice clean feel to it and is a great way to treat yourself a couple of times a week. I enjoyed using the mask and will keep on using it to keep me in a good skin routine. The company takes reviews and critiques to heart and strives to make sure you&#x27;re 100% happy with their product. Give it a try and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Been looking for an all-natural mud mask that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like SO many others I have tried. I finally found it! I suffer from blackheads and have some dry areas. This works very well for both. Really cleansed my skin and left it so soft. And the eucalyptus and lavender make it smell great! LOVE that so many of the ingredients are organic, and that the mud is actually from the Dead Sea. Highly recommend this product for anyone looking to cleanse and/or nourish their skin. Great mask to use once or twice a week. Will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this mask to me so I decided to try it. I&#x27;m so glad I did! It&#x27;s hard to find all natural products that work this well! The mask left my skin feeling so clean and soft and it smells great! My skin even seemed brighter. It I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As a licensed aesthetician, I&#x27;m constantly looking for good skin products to try on myself before I recommend them to anyone else. When I was offered the opportunity to try this mask, I thought \\&quot;why not\\&quot;? I was amazed at how my skin felt after only one application. While applying the mask, I noticed how cooling it felt. After leaving it on for recommended amount of time, I was very pleased at how easy it was to remove even though it had harden upon drying (which is typical of masks). My skin felt soft, clean and looked fantastic. I will continue to use this product one to two times a week!!!! Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good mask.&lt;br /&gt;It left my skin feeling clean and so smooth! I would recommend this to anyone that wants beautiful skin with beautiful results!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for my girlfriend and she ended up convincing me to give it a go as well and we both really like it.  We were both having the typical daily issues that all 20-somethings have as far as oily skin and problem areas with blackheads and this seems to really help pull out all of the trapped dirt and oil.  We are both very happy with the product and plan on purchasing again when we runt out.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it twice before I gave a review to really see how my skin would react. I love it my acne is getting better every time and the surface of my skin just looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin and this product was exactly what I needed to bring back the dewiness and health to my face!</li>
            <li> I had never tried any kind of facial or mud mask before ordering this. I did a lot of research on lots of different products on amazon before finally deciding on this one. My husband and I tried it together and we both loved it! It gives your face a slight tingling sensation after a few minutes and you can feel it hardening on your face and tightening your skin. It was fairly easy to wash off and it even came out of our hair pretty easily too, which I was worried about when I accidentally got some in my hair at the top of my forehead. My skin felt really clean, fresh, and soft afterwards. I&#x27;m excited to  continue trying it once a week to see how my skin feels after multiple uses! So far so good! I was definitely a little nervous about using it since I had never used any kind of facial product before and I have pretty sensitive skin, but it felt great on my skin and I felt very comfortable using it. Also, the smell was very mild, which is nice since I try to avoid highly fragrant products on my sensitive skin. All in all it was a great choice!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve received the mud mask about a week and half ago and so far, I love it! At first, when I applied it to my face, I noticed a slight burning/tingling sensation on my lower chin/face area... but, this was probably due to me shaving earlier in the morning. With that in mind, I ended up using the mud mask on the days where I don&#x27;t shave in the morning and it has been wonderful! I actually used it when I noticed a formation of a pimple/zit on my face. Upon using the mud mask and waking up the next morning, I noticed a significant difference on the impact that it had on the acne. It had reduced the formation and eventually subsided the redness, which is awesome! I&#x27;m glad I made the decision to purchase this product as it has proved very beneficial. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> awesome face mask! Intense in a good way. Super cute package too….</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, but this mask was a nightmare for me. After leaving it on for around 8 minutes, a layer of skin on the bridge of my nose and chin peeled off. Unattractive scabs were not what I wanted from this product, and five days later they are still healing.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!Truly worked wonders!!!&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Tried this today and loved it. Smelled much better than previously used mud masks and my face felt clean and renewed after using. Product arrived fast and as described. Great experience with Barefaced Skincare!</li>
            <li> Love love love this mask! Even got a second one. My roommate loves it too. Goes on nice and thick, smells really good for a mud mask as well. It dries super fast on your face and skin feels amazing afterwards. Was really happy with it and definitely recommend it! Great gift idea too :)</li>
            <li> Skin felt smooth and clean afterwards! Don&#x27;t usually use mud masks but this one definitely surprised me and is now in mh skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this product once.  I liked it.  Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin but I&#x27;m hoping the more I use the product I will have an increase in results.  It didn&#x27;t make me breakout which is a big deal for me.  I have a hard time trying new product because my skin is very prone to breaking out.  As of now I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, came extremely fast and good quality. Will be ordering this again</li>
            <li> I like the mask but was surprised the second time I opened it has mold on the inside of the lid. Now I&#x27;m left wondering if I should use it. It says to store in a cold dry place, which I did. Also I wasn&#x27;t happy to see if I rated the product they would send me a free jar, that means you need to take all of these high reviews with a grain of salt since everyone is getting a free jar for reviewing...I wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> smells good, but does not feel as clean as the cleanser should be.</li>
            <li> Great quality product BUT NOT for my sensitive &amp; finicky skin, my skin is still bright red and I used it yesterday. I&#x27;m sure it works great for people who don&#x27;t have such sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After opening up the jar I noticed a strong scent- a very hard to explain scent- it is a bit of a strange smell &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell mixed with the fresh scent of eucalyptus but when I apply it on my face the scent is not that strong anymore. The consistency seems a bit slimy but it applies very easy on skin. t has this really dark mud color and after applying it I got right away this tingling sensation. Not in a unpleasant way- it felt very nice! I am not sure this will work on very sensitive skin but if you have normal to oily skin that does not get irritated quickly this will work awesome. I had it on for 15 minutes and it got really hard and I had quite a lot of work washing the mask of with water again. But the results were very nice. I tend to get some blackheads on my forehead and some blemishes on my chin and this mask did an fantastic job in helping healing some of those. I found my face felt very clean and tight (in a good way) afterwards. I recommend this!</li>
            <li> This mask has an amazing aroma. It just feels fresh and clean as soon as you open the jar. With this review I wish I had a way to have a scratch and sniff option! When I applied this product for the first time I found that the mask dried rapidly. It took only about five minutes till it was hard. It did not take much of the product to be able to cover my face entirely. This is a 6oz jar so it would last many uses with the proper application. Taking off the product was very simple as well, it came right off, with no fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I woke up the next day I could really notice a difference. I had a problem with another product I reviewed leaving me broken out. This Barefaced Mud Mask, dried out those problem spots over night. My face also felt so silky smooth. I feel that this product works perfectly. When using a dead sea mask on the face, the one contribution it has is eliminating toxins. This product worked perfectly in that area, by helping to eliminate any toxins made my face feel just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit scared to be honest because some mud masks are very harsh and not recommended for sensitive skin, like I have. I had no problem using this product. If you have sensitive skin, this might be one mask that would work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I would recommend this product to my readers. I found that it worked perfectly for my sensitive face. The next day I had felt that I had gone and spend hundreds of dollars for a facial. GREAT PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this product for review.</li>
            <li> Face feels fantastic, very cleansing, dries very nice. Rinses well. I really enjoy facial masks and my favorite are ones that contain Dead Sea mud, this one has it and its the first ingredient, all ingredients are amazing. There is no junk it useless fillers, everything is very beneficial to skin. Feels very refreshing. No irritation or burning. Face really looks beautiful after :) very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I received this mud mask free to try in return for an honest product review. I have been wanting to try a mud mask for quite some time. After just a couple of days I received the jar. It is a good size jar plastic jar. It will last me quite some time. The mask has a small lite pleasant scent. The mask is very thick as a mud mask should be. It went on evenly. In just a matter of a few minuted the mask started to dry and created a very tight feeling on the skin. You can feel it drawing out the impurities in your face. I left it on for about 10 minutes I made sure it was completely dry. I have to scrub a little with warm water to get my face clean. After all of the mask was rinsed off I noticed I no longer had oily spots in my t-zone. The biggest difference that I noticed was the copious amounts of blackheads on my nose were nearly all the way gone! I am pretty satisfied with this mask! Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Recently I got the opportunity to try this Barefaced Dead Sea Mud mask! I really enjoy using beauty products and trying new things so I was pretty excited about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First of all I love that it has Dead Sea Salt in it! I recently tried an exfoliator with salt from the dead sea and it has been wonderful for my skin. Having such good luck with that made me even more excited about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I have mentioned before the first thing I do when I get a new beauty product is open it and smell it. I&#x27;ll admit that it didn&#x27;t have much of a smell- but I have learned that this is good because it usually means it has all natural products with no perfumes in it! When I looked into the product a bit more I found that it has all organic ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my mud mask on Mondays! (I have deemed Monday to be Mud Mask Monday!) I simply wash my face and use my cleanser, then I apply this mud mask. The container says to apply with dry hands and to let the mud mask stay on your face for 10 minutes, then rinse with warm water and pat dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that my face feels much softer and has had less blemishes than it usually gets in the summer. I especially like how I pair it with other dead sea products such as the Adovia Exfoliating Salts that I have reviewed in the past!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never been healthier than it is right now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes with a mud mask I find it difficult to rinse off but I haven&#x27;t had that problem with this one! It rinses of when I want it to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin so I am always worried that skincare products are going to make me break out or develop dryness. My skin did not break out and it actually helped me with my dry areas!</li>
            <li> I received this product for free to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK so I literally just got this in the mail and decided to try it so I open it up and its this green goopy gelatinous substance and the fragrance I instantly place yummm! Eucalyptus and lavender!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least this will smell pleasant! OK this doesn&#x27;t feel half bad its kind of cold and tingly and messy and fun, the kids think I&#x27;m turning in to a monster, the husband says I&#x27;m applying war paint&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All done, yeah I like this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve tried a mask like back when I was a teen and it was funny and didn&#x27;t mean anything. Oh as its drying my face feels tighter and its still tingling but mostly in spots where I had blemishes, looking good so far.&lt;br /&gt;Well it&#x27;s been the required 15 minutes and its time for this to come off one more before shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow this stuff sucks, literally. I had a few pre zits before putting this on that came to a head and if you&#x27;ve had those where they hang around for a few days just being painful and leaving you helpless to remedy you know how great that is I&#x27;m noticing the pores on my nose and cheeks are smaller now too I&#x27;m guessing because the mask absorbed all that nastiness out of them as it dried and my skin feels nice and soft and clean!&lt;br /&gt;OK so its the next day and I flaked on the after pictures but its fine I&#x27;m going to use it a couple more times before I&#x27;m through anyway and as its actually midnight and therefore dark as heck I&#x27;m going to do another treatment tomorrow and show you the results. Now it says to use it once a week and I used it yesterday and again today cause well, I like it. It feels relaxing, I love the scent, I love how it makes my face feel tight as it dries and how I can feel it pulling out all the stuff that&#x27;s trapped in my skin. I asked someone from the company and they suggested maybe 2 times a week as it can dry out skin but I&#x27;m really having the opposite effect so far. I swear I&#x27;m going to break out more cause I keep touching my face though. Alright see y&#x27;all in well the pm most likely since its am now lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my face feels clean, my pores look smaller and every time I use the mask its like a little at home spa day. I really like it. They warned that it may be drying but I think the essential oils they use to scent it counteract that nicely so its not an issue and I just use it whenever I feel like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Taken from my blogger post which contains pictures -Reviewstuffzp touching my face though. Alright see y&#x27;all in well the pm most likely since its am now lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my face feels clean, my pores look smaller and every time I use the mask its like a little at home spa day. I really like it.

            <li> I really liked this mud mask, it really makes your face feel clean and refreshed. Also it leaves it silky feeling, after years of sun exposure its nice to have soft skin. It goes on smooth and rinses off clean.  I highly recommend this mud mask to my friends.  I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using tomoson.</li>
            <li> Ahh, Mud Masks...one of the greatest &amp;#34;pamper me&amp;#34; items ever, and I have to say, I have a new favorite. I was given the chance to review this awesome Dead Sea Mud Mask from Barefaced Skincare, and I LOVE it! It has an earthy scent, which I expect of a mud mask, because it lets me know that it is real. I have never been fond of the ones that have so many other ingredients in them, that they just smell like fragrance.&lt;br /&gt; I applied the mud to my face, massaged slightly, and left it to dry for roughly 15 minutes, before rinsing it with warm water, and patting my face dry. In this picture, the mud has been on for about 5 minutes, and was already feeling tight on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Right away, I liked that it was thick enough that it stayed where I put it, but not so thick that I had to apply pressure to spread it. It had a nice scent to it, very earthy with botanical undertones, which include sunflower, lavender, aloe, and eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing my face, I followed up with a Vitamin C serum, and a good moisturizer. My face felt so soft and smooth, and by the next morning, some of my blemishes were already gone. I do the mud mask about once a week, and my skin is always happy afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product free for review purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Loved this product loved the way it made my face feel and just felt really refreshed!! Love A++ in my book</li>
            <li> This works great. Makes my skin feel smooth!</li>
            <li> I purchased a jar right before my son was born, and it was left forgotten in a drawer in my bathroom.  Fast forward to today - baby is down for a nap and I&#x27;m looking to pamper myself.  Coming across the jar was a pleasant surprise, but not as much of a surprise of how wonderful my face felt after the treatment!  What have I been missing?  I won&#x27;t be misplacing my jar again...highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The mud mask caused acne and dried out my skin. I did not have acne before nor did I ever have an issue with my skin being too dry. While I imagine this product does work for others, I find it rather suspicious and a bit sneaky in terms of the note provided with the purchase. Basically, it requested that before posting a negative review to speak to them first... so hopefully there aren&#x27;t hundreds of repressed negative reviews...</li>
            <li> This mask will definitely be a staple in my skin care regimen.  After using once my skin felt and looked amazing!</li>
            <li> Loved this mask so much it made my face feel soft and detoxified. Can not wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> After trying several masks ranging in varying prices, I am seriously addicted to this mud mask.  The smell does not bother me one bit -- in fact, I think it is very clean and natural smelling.  I have sensitive fair (and combination!) skin, and this is a perfect way to get a deep clean and spa-at-home feel.  I am hooked!</li>
            <li> I applied it weekly 4 times already mad it definitely helps me with mild acne and blemishes. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Looking for ways to cure eczema on my face. My wife was also looking for ways to better control oil and break outs. So far it seems it has helped with controlling eczema and break outs. The product moisturizes the skin on a very deep level!</li>
            <li> Overall, I really enjoyed Barefaced Skincare&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask. It isn&#x27;t the most appealing LOOKING, but if you can get over the initial texture, you will be very pleased. I found that it does not have a strong scent, which I really prefer, if I am going to be leaving a mask on my face for fifteen minutes. It was initially easy to apply, but if you don&#x27;t apply it fast enough while massaging, it will start to crack, so work quickly and try not to go over areas you have already gotten. I have super sensitive skin and I did not notice any redness or tingling post-mask, nor did I feel any stinging in my eyes while I had it on (typically this happens to me with facial cleansers and skin peels), so that is a definite plus. It was easy to remove without leaving any mess. I found that the Barefaced Skincare Dead Sea Mud Mask made my skin feel instantly softer. I was glad, because at first I wondered if the thick texture might actually clog my pores and dry my skin out. That did not happen, so if you&#x27;re anything like me (with sensitive combination skin) you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time, as I used this product each week, I feel that I noticed a gradual increase in softness, and maybe even a more balanced skin tone with less redness, though it is hard to pinpoint since I use many facial products. I do feel like my acne has lessened overall, and that my skin feels more firm in the 24 hours post-mask. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but I always like to treat my face preventatively, as I produce low amounts of collagen for my age. I think this mask is a great investment for anyone with any skin type. It would make a wonderful gift, and also would be a lot of fun to do at a sleepover or after a girl&#x27;s night out.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product--love how it makes my skin soft and pores smaller! Don&#x27;t hesitate and just buy it!</li>
            <li> This product is very good for my skin. I have sensitive skin and it did not break my skin out. I have used it twice so far and have already seen a difference in the feel of my face. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love love love! Fantastic product, works wonders for my skin. I can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Love the fresh clean smell and it helped to clear some blemishes! Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Great value for the cost, very high quality, and positive customer care.</li>
            <li> Great product and cheaper than others on here.  I was very pleased and will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells great (almost like tequila???) applies evenly and is a great price! Can read and understand all of the ingredients on the label. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> The mud mask made my face tingle and so soft.  I will be using it 2x a week!!</li>
            <li> This is the fourth mud mask I&#x27;ve used, and I have to say, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s fantastic&amp;#34;! I&#x27;ve used it only once, but my face feels unbelievably clean, smooth and tingly. I honestly feel my pores are less noticeable. I definitely plan to try other Barefaced products!</li>
            <li> My product arrived on time and as expected! I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it definitely makes my skin feel fresh and smooth!</li>
            <li> What it is: Deep pore cleansing mask formulated with mineral rich dead sea mud&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who it&#x27;s for: Non inflamed, non sensitive skin types in need of pore purging and skin brightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key ingredients: Dead Sea mud&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use it: Cleanse skin, leaving it damp. Smooth a small amount of mud over entire face, avoiding eye area. Use of a small spatula is advised to avoid potential contamination of jar contents. Mud may be manipulated lightly over skin while formula is still creamy, to experience a gentle physical exfoliation. Allow mud to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional notes: This mask sets very tightly in a short period of time. 5-6 minutes is enough time to reap full benefit, 15 minutes is excessive. Formula is not suitable for very sensitive skin due to its stimulating nature but could be blended with a hyaluronic acid hydrating gel mask to split the difference between deep cleansing and a saturation of hydration. Formula is not moisturizing, an appropriate moisturizer should follow removal. Use a dark towel for removal to avoid staining light fabrics. Most efficient removal is in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formulas this stimulating tend to encourage pore purging - be prepared to experience occasional breakouts as skin purges, but look forward to experiencing far fewer breakouts when used as maintenance post adjustment period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love what&#x27;s in it as much as what isn&#x27;t - no parabens, alcohols, lanolin or artificial fragrance/color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always remember spf - it&#x27;s the #1 smart aging product on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a licensed Esthetician and industry educator with a decade of hands on experience, I come across a ton of product, most of which is hype and loaded with extraneous ingredients. Used 1-3x weekly, and paired with a smart home care regimen, this mask is a deep cleansing, pore refining, skin brightening genius. I would definitely use this mask in my treatment room and recommend this product to my clients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of dead sea products in the past and this is one of the better ones. It has got a good strong smell...the lavender oil seems to be the most obvious which I really like. Works as described and I noticed a slight improvement after my first try. Plenty in the jar too. Would recommend this product to others, thanks a million Barefaced!</li>
            <li> Once ordered, I received my Barefaced mud mask without delay. I felt a very tingly, warm sensation but not unbearable or unpleasant.  I left it on for about 7 minutes. After rinsing my skin felt smooth and soft and I noticed a reduction in the size of my pores.  I am looking forward to adding this weekly to my regular skin care regimen!  Your follow up regarding my feedback is appreciated.</li>
            <li> Thank you! I really like this mud mask. I&#x27;m a guy, and this is my first mask of any kind. But I definitely notice the effects. After I use it, my skin looks and feels better. (I&#x27;m still ugly, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to fix that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all - the seller actually called me after I received it to see if I had any questions. That&#x27;s so nice! I really appreciate the extra customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
            <li> This is the best mask ever! It has tiny particles that exfoliate as you apply the mask. You can feel it drying and your skin feels great! I left mine on longer than the stated 15 minutes, mine was on about 1/2 a hour. After I washed off the mask my skin was glowing and baby soft! I am a huge fan! Thank you for this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and makes my skin feel smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> This is a quick skin treatment that I look forward to using.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product. Love it.</li>
            <li> makes my face feel very fresh and clean. the mint feels like its waking up my skin.</li>
            <li> This mask is awesome! I have oily/acne prone skin and I noticed a noticeable difference in my skin after the first few uses.  Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> This product works so well and allows the pores to be cleaned and works well for me and my son!</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and feels great on the skin.  It&#x27;s refreshing and tingly.  It left my skin feeling very smooth and soft.  I was unsure because I tend to have oily somewhat acne prone skin but it made me skin look and feel balanced.  The customer service is also above and beyond--I was surprised that I received an additional email ensuring that I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My husband just bought this for my birthday, and I love it!! Leaves the skin feeling so smooth afterwards! I like the smell of it too, all the oils and extracts are so nice. My husband even did a mud mask with me:)</li>
            <li> Amazing! My oily skin doesn&#x27;t respond well to many masks and this made my pores so much cleaner. Will definitely be using this product regularly.</li>
            <li> used this product twice since purchase and am happy with results.  My complexion is brighter and tone is more even.  Love the smell of this all natural product!  I will expect more good results with continued usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for a couple of weeks - it&#x27;s just a so-so product, nothing outstanding. It has pretty much dried out my skin and I have to use twice as much moisturizer now. I wish I had read the 5 star reviews more closely and realized that they were not written by everyday Amazon shoppers who have purchased this mud mask. This product is being offered free in exchange positive reviews by hundreds of bloggers - be careful when you see so many positive reviews in such a short space of time! - another example of Amazon&#x27;s failing review system being gamed! Purchase at your own risk!</li>
            <li> Used this mud mask for the first time tonight and I love it, it leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshed! Another positive is the shipping was really fast it came before I expected it too.</li>
            <li> 💙💙💙💙 makes my face feel so fresh!</li>
            <li> best. mask. ever.&lt;br /&gt;seriously.</li>
            <li> It Rocks!! Better than borghese mud.I used a sea sponge to remove and think that did make a difference in results. I also let it dry all the way. It did not dry out my skin. It felt soft and supple.Also my 13 year old daughter used it and it helped with her acne.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!  leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li> I love how clean this makes my skin feel! Typically I&#x27;ll put it on just before I&#x27;m about to hop in the shower, so that by the time I am done washing my hair and body, I can rinse this off in there. My kids like using it, too--there&#x27;s no harsh garbage in it like some other face masks.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  My skin has never felt so soft and I&#x27;ve stopped breaking out!  I use twice a week.  The only reason I give it four stars is because it doesn&#x27;t smell awesome.  My roommate said that&#x27;s what a spa smells like, but having never been in a spa myself I wouldn&#x27;t know.  Its not the worst thing in the world, but it&#x27;s not the best either.  Also, definitely avoid putting it on your upper lip - my lip was a little too sensitive for it and the first time i used it I got some redness there.  Otherwise it&#x27;s awesome and it feels really good on my skin!  I love love love it.</li>
            <li> 1. Ultra fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;I got it within 48 hours my order despite the fact that my order was under Free Shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Package that shows detail to attention&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other delivered items, the packs were tightened by rubber bands so that it was protected not to be shaken over the delivery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Product quality&lt;br /&gt;Given the price, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect that much. It turned out that I was too skeptical, and I probably order another one within a few weeks. In my first try, my skin got irritated and became reddish all over. I thought it was a waste of my time. Then, mom said it is because the mud takes out the hidden sebum from skin, so I should try a couple more times. After days, now I can see that all the irritations are gone and feel that the skin is literally glorying.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It smells wonderful and I am already noticing a difference with my complexion! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> The mud was a little thinner than I expected and I ended up putting on two layers. Dried within 15 minutes and washed off easily. Left my face a little dry but did a great job cleaning up pores and left my face feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I was given this product in return for my honest review. With that said, let me begin by saying that I have never been a mud mask or face mask type of girl. I just like something quick &amp; clean. My facial routine includes makeup removers followed by various face washes, a moisturizer and that’s it. However, I’m willing to try anything that helps me get a deep pore cleaning and helps with my high shine face and acne prone skin, and this face mask does just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression when using this was, “WOW”- the scent is STRONG! I was not a fan of the scent at first but it kinda grew on me. It has an earthy, scent followed by lavender and hints of eucalyptus. It is mud after all so it will smell odd. I had my sister and my cousin test the mask out and tell me what they thought of it, and they could not get past the scent. – I advice that if you are scent sensitive, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is very slimy and thick looking. But it applies very nicely, not as thick as it looks. When I applied it the scent is still very strong to me, but it fades a bit as it dries. The mask itself dries very quickly and very hard. This stuff made my face feel immobile. I mean really difficult to make any facial features without cracking the mask. This could have possibly been my fault, maybe I added too thick of a layer of mud mask. Thinning out the mask could probably prevent this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came time to wash my face, I had trouble washing it completely off my face. It almost felt like I had stage makeup on. You know that greasy feeling you get when you try to wash it off but it only feels like you are just smearing it around your face? Kinda like that. After my face felt completely rid of the mud I patted my face dry. The results for me every time I use this have been the same. I get a super dry feeling, like I have completely stripped my face of any oil traces. But it is nothing a good non oily moisturizer can’t fix.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the mask about twice a week and I will admit that my face seems clearer. I have not had a bad break out or a bad zit in a month, which is very surprising for me. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the oil level of my skin has also settled. As for my gigantic pores, I have not seen much of a change there, although I noticed that other reviewers have claimed to see a nice change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice that if I don&#x27;t use the mask withing a week, my face gets oily again and I do start to break out. So I am a big of how much it has been doing for my skin and acne. It is incredible to think that after searching and buying expensive products for something that can help clear my skin, a once or twice a week regiment has helped me find the perfect skin balance that I have always wanted.</li>
            <li> Smooth, smells clean, made my skin soft and pores visibly cleaner/smaller.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing after using this product. Great buy!</li>
            <li> A very lovely mask! The texture is delightfully smooth and not gritty like others I&#x27;ve tried which we&#x27;re irritating. I use it both as a spot treatment for pimples that pop up or as a full restorative mask when I feel like my skin needs a reset. This mask has a very nice earthy aroma and feels cool on the face. Dries and then easily wipes off with a warm wash cloth. Would recommend to anyone looking for a mud mask treatment!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after I use it, and after only 3 uses, I can tell the pores around my nose are getting smaller, and I think the wrinkles on my forehead are a bit smoother.  I have combination skin, and have been trying to use the mask twice a week. I cant wait to see the results from using the mask a few more times.  Highly recommend this mask</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, so I was a little worried at first, but I just kept an eye on it, followed the directions, and it worked wonders! I didn&#x27;t have any adverse reactions, and it really helped clear out my skin and make it smoother! I had a minor acne breakout after the very first use, but after the very first use, it just kept my skin perfect! I keep it on for about 15 minutes, once to twice a week, and if I have a zit pop up, I just use a little dab of it on that area, and it clears it out immediately!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Absolutely in love with Baredfaced!!</li>
            <li> Great mask, smells like you&#x27;re in a spa!</li>
            <li> Really good mask! my face feels tingly with it on and it a good product!</li>
            <li> Stings your skin while on and during removal, but leaves your skill felling cool soft and refreshed. Barefaced clearly cares about their product and customers.</li>
            <li> Very nice texture. Dries easily. Smells like lemon cake batter to me. It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin. It contains organic herbal oils and still it does not make the skin oily. I like the fresh feeling of mint and eucalyptus, which stays after you rinse the mas off. After rinsing the mas my skin was glowing! Just after the first use! The natural ingredients are what attracted me to it. I find the selection perfect for a face mask! Will keep using it!</li>
            <li> Love this mask. I use it twice a week and I noticed my skin isn&#x27;t as oily. I usually apply a thick layer and let it sit while I do some chores. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. Leaves  my skin feeling  smooth  and  tight</li>
            <li> YES. I used a Zuma sugar face scrub, then used this while soaking in a bath of salts and essential oils. It was a marvelous day. Sometimes, you just need to pamper yourself ;) Btw, this stuff made my face feel like it was on fire towards the last 2 minutes, Im glad I set a timer! My face feels so amazingly smooth tonight, oooooh yeah! Fast shipping, works great so far.</li>
            <li> My face feels very refreshed after using this.  I love I could feel a tingle while using this.  My face felt smooth.  Not harsh nor did I break out.  For some reason I started to break out before using this product however this product help clear up my face and stop the break outs.  Will continue to use!!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after using - will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work for me. Burn my skin out. When I put it my skin, My skin feel painful.</li>
            <li> Honestly, Amazon, do you bother checking the reviews on here before they are posted? I was an honest customer and this product was like throwing money down the toilet. I have been using it for over a week and guess what, I have broken out in the upper lip area after many many years and I am far from being a teenager! Ridiculous. If anything, it made my skin dryer. Planted reviews- not fair!</li>
            <li> I have SUPER sensitive skin, so I was very tentative when I tried this. Thankfully, it did not burn like most other things I have tried on my face and was actually enjoyable to use. It smells nice and feels cool when applied.</li>
