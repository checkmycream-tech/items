            <li>It was sent to me quickly and arrived in excellent shape!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>, I love Oscar De la renta, so I thought it would make good Christmas presents.  </li>
            <li>Rosamor is a nice fragrance.....</li>
            <li>They were very cheap</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>oscar de la renta, one of the best scents to wear, even for daily use!</li>
            <li>Oscar, by Oscar, is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I received many compliments.</li>
            <li>Love this spray.  </li>
            <li>This perfume scent is very light and stays all day without a strong odor on me.</li>
            <li>and i feel so foolish.......for waiting so long for a wonderful experience.</li>
            <li>Mom loved it so much that I got one for her as a gift.</li>
            <li>Make sure to contact the seller before you make your purchase to inquire about where the product was &amp;#34;made&amp;#34; since all the ones I bought that are original are made in France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love roses and this parfum smells like a bunch of sweet roses. ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>I agree I don&#x27;t think this is the original</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, if you are not picky about this low cost perfum being original this one smells very similar and still very nice!</li>
            <li>There is definitely a distinct difference.  </li>
            <li>I have this eau de toilette and like it very much for daily use, so I bought it as a present, at U$ 22 , very good price, arrived in time.</li>
            <li>I am very selective when it comes to perfums, it must be original.</li>
            <li>To be worn by a classy lady and confident any gentleman will be titilated at that first kiss on the neck  when he sees you.</li>
            <li>for the world recommend this purchase, the perfume does not smell all that much, the scent disappears quickly and smells like perfume vanished&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;por</li>
            <li>It is worth the extra money to make sure you are getting the products made in France.  </li>
            <li>She asked me if it was the real deal, if it was fresh, etc.</li>
            <li>fast delivery!</li>
            <li>They have a &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; fragrance, not the smooth soft fragrance of the Oscar made in France.  </li>
            <li>Sorry, USA, not as good a product!</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest buying the Oscar fragrances that are made in France...not the ones made in New York, NY.  </li>
            <li>So De La Renta and Oscar were made in New York.  </li>
            <li>Smells good but fades away to metallic, fake smell; I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>So i am anxious to try more of Oscar De La Renta fragrances for quite a while.</li>
            <li>The product I received unfortunately was not original, it was very similar, and it still smelled very nice, however since I know how it really smells and how it looks like I was able to see that it was not the same.</li>
            <li>The large size was an extra plus for me.</li>
            <li>This scent is so suttle and soft.  </li>
            <li>This is a definite winner and will be really busy.</li>
            <li>Nice enough for casual wear.</li>
            <li>It is a very soft and feminine perfume which last for a series of long hours.</li>

            <li> I love this product.  This scent is so suttle and soft.  I just wish they sold it in stores like they used to.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Best memories by Oscar de La Renta.</li>
            <li> sort of a generic scent. Nice enough for casual wear.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, I love Oscar De la renta, so I thought it would make good Christmas presents.  You can not go wrong with oscar de la renta.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, great price!</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume to try it, I had heard of it and never smelled it before.  it is very subtle and a soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> for the world recommend this purchase, the perfume does not smell all that much, the scent disappears quickly and smells like perfume vanished&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;por nada del mundo recomiendo esta compra, el perfume no huele casi nada, el aroma desaparece rÃ¡pido y huele como a perfume desvanecido</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume because I wanted something to use during day hours. This perfume scent is very light and stays all day without a strong odor on me. Great perfume. Beautiful bottle and great price</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfum for a long time, it is very hard to find it.  I am very selective when it comes to perfums, it must be original. The product I received unfortunately was not original, it was very similar, and it still smelled very nice, however since I know how it really smells and how it looks like I was able to see that it was not the same.

            <li> My sister lives overseas. She absolutely loves this fragrance and was not able to buy until she paid for it out of her nose... I told her I&#x27;d search for it in the U.S. and found it on Amazon, once again, for about a third of the price she would have had to pay. She asked me if it was the real deal, if it was fresh, etc. Of course it was! It was sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. Would have cost $100 for two bottles in the mall. Saved a ton and the wife is happy!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! The large size was an extra plus for me. Only wish that I had bought another one!</li>
            <li> I agree I don&#x27;t think this is the original there hardly any smell at all.  Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I love roses and this parfum smells like a bunch of sweet roses. ðŸ˜€</li>

            <li> fast delivery! wonderful fresh floral scent, but not overpowering! packaged perfectly! ! oscar de la renta, one of the best scents to wear, even for daily use!</li>
            <li> Great price for a 3.3 oz. Bottle of perfume. Bought as a gift for mother and she loves the scent</li>
            <li> Rosamor is a nice fragrance.....just not one of my personal favorites.  Oscar, by Oscar, is still my favorite.  For the money Rosamor was a good purchase.  It is one that is made in France.  I would highly suggest buying the Oscar fragrances that are made in France...not the ones made in New York, NY.  There is definitely a distinct difference.  I purchased Rosamor, Volupte, So De La Renta and Oscar by Oscar.  So De La Renta and Oscar were made in New York.  They have a &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; fragrance, not the smooth soft fragrance of the Oscar made in France.  It is worth the extra money to make sure you are getting the products made in France.  Sorry, USA, not as good a product!</li>
            <li> Great price for an Oscar scent. Bought this for my daughter for her 19th birthday. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent and fantastic price!  It was sent to me quickly and arrived in excellent shape!</li>
            <li> Smells so good. I received many compliments. Mom loved it so much that I got one for her as a gift.</li>
            <li> Smells good but fades away to metallic, fake smell; I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the real thing. They were very cheap, I guess that should have been a clue.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations. It is a very soft and feminine perfume which last for a series of long hours. The price and size are perfect. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My second botle of a  De La Renta and i feel so foolish.......for waiting so long for a wonderful experience. To be worn by a classy lady and confident any gentleman will be titilated at that first kiss on the neck  when he sees you. So i am anxious to try more of Oscar De La Renta fragrances for quite a while. This is a definite winner and will be really busy.</li>
            <li> Love this spray.  Had it earlier and could no longer find in the local retail stores for purchase.  Very happy to have found abottle.</li>
            <li> Loving This Scent!!!!!</li>
