            <li>This has reduced the fine lines tremendously!!!</li>
            <li>I have used many Dr. Hauschka products over the years and like them all, but this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it feels around the eyes and it is very light</li>
            <li>this is so far the best to reduce fine</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this eye balm.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Hauschka Eye Balm has been my favorite undereye care for years now.</li>
            <li>I love this eye balm.  </li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive,dry skin it feels refreshing on the eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>This cream is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>and it worked like magic.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others, this is my &amp;#34;have to have&amp;#34; eye cream.</li>
            <li>BUT love love love as lip balm.</li>
            <li>I buying 2 more to stock</li>
            <li>Looking fw to trying more of their line.</li>
            <li>I love this eye balm.</li>
            <li>I have used it for 5yrs and recommended it to friends who also like it and have told me they see a difference in the moisture level and fine lines in the eye area.</li>
            <li>&amp; I truly see results with it (increased moisture, diminished fine lines</li>
            <li>I would take each ring finger one at a time, touch it to the balm to pick up some product, and then tap lightly into my undereye area.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best, most gentle yet moisturizing thing out there!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique.</li>
            <li>It is worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>It does have a bit of shine, but I take care of this in the morning by blotting my face with a clean terry cloth towel after applying my make-up.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what happened as far as that went, but it would have been nice to know when it was arriving.</li>
            <li>It has a great deal of moisture and all other eye cremes I have used go into the skin and disappear looking like you never used anything.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading all the positive reviews and was excited to try something higher-end than what&#x27;s normally available at your neighborhood pharmacy.</li>
            <li>I can then easily dab it onto the contour under my eye and gently rub it in.</li>
            <li>dry climate, good eye balm</li>
            <li>I love the way it glides on the eye area and how my cover up and foundation glide right over the top without leaving dry looking areas.  </li>
            <li>Plus it gave me a nice sheen similar to lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product might seems greasy /oily when you first apply but it will be absorbed quickly and would not impact you applying makeup.</li>
            <li>and it goes to work right away.</li>
            <li>and I left it on all day and my eyes look great for several days.</li>
            <li>but the skin will absorbs it very fast.  </li>
            <li>This day balm for the eye is exactly that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s consistency is similar to lip balm except that it soaks into the eye area instead of sitting on top.</li>
            <li>It feels oily when you first applies it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many eye products but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>At night time I use Dr. Hauschka Daily Hydrating Eye Cream and layer this on top.</li>
            <li>This balm mixed bee wax and carrot oil, and more.</li>
            <li>Love it, have been using it for 10 years, it&#x27;s the only eye balm that does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Hauschka eye contour is the only one that I have tried so far that succeeds for the whole day.</li>
            <li>I am 34 yr old female and LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I use my ring finger nail to scoop a little out, warm it in between my fingers and dab/lightly rub it in.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that really works for fine lines.  </li>
            <li>BUT nothing but the real one works like this.</li>
            <li>The powder also minimizes any shine which may remain depending on how much balm you used.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for it as eye cream</li>
            <li>It eliminates my crows feet and dryness and really keeps the eye area young and fresh and very moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I can control how much I use/need each day/night.</li>
            <li>Kind of heavy and leaves a Vaseline-like sheen and texture under the eye.</li>
            <li>I have used so many  different eye creams such as Estee Lauder, Lancome, Clinque, Clarins, Khiels and etc.</li>
            <li>I went back the next day to try it again just to make sure and tried it again</li>
            <li>Price is always too high for this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear lipstick as it&#x27;s too drying; thick consistency of this lip balm is so nourishing and made my lips super smooth.</li>
            <li>It is the consistency of a firm balm, so it is necessary to warm it up in order to apply it.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the skin of your eyes very soft and moistured.  </li>
            <li>I used so many different brands and more expensive products</li>
            <li>I have tried many other eye creams and keep going back to this one.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes; many eye creams I used in the past caused issues</li>
            <li>Very thick and sticky, takes a while to warm up and be pliable.</li>
            <li>and I am 51 years old.</li>
            <li>I apply it morning, noon and night to keep the under eye area soft and it helps prevent wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>and I notice even my young friends are getting lines under their eyes.  </li>
            <li>yes, it is pretty heavy and very emollient</li>
            <li>I have dry skin under my eyes, which has created fine lines, due to allergies.  </li>
            <li>Much prefer the other Hauschka revitalizing eye cream.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado and it is so dry out here.  </li>
            <li>I am 62 years old, have dry skin and a definite tendency to wrinkle under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>In a couple days my dry and red eyelids were completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>It helped to mix it with another product on the back of my hand before applying; I used Vita-K Solution Professional Dark Circles, which made a decent combo because the Vita-K would dry my skin out while the Dr H would leave it too shiny, but despite the mix, it was still on the shiny side.</li>

            <li> It is not heavily scented or full of the nasty chemicals in most mainstream products.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida and thought it might be heavy</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive skin around my eyes, and developed rosacea in the past few years.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out like some of the others</li>
            <li> I battled dry, peeling, crepey undereye skin.  </li>
            <li> Cured my dry skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> To be clear, this is an eye BALM, not a cream as others have said; it has the same thick consistency as a LIP BALM for example, thicker even.</li>
            <li> A couple of times I got a rash under my eyes from using the wrong products and this healed it right up.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin around my eye area, this is the only eye moisturizer that keeps the delicate skin around my eye feeling nourished and protected.</li>
            <li> less then the Hauschka site.</li>
            <li> , then dust just a little powder to set.</li>
            <li> I dip a pea size amount out of the container and rub it between my pointer fingers for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> These skin problems disappear within a few days.</li>
            <li> It is like a lip balm consistency, very thick and a little goes a long way (each jar usually lasts 6 months or so-I use it morning &amp; night after cleansing).</li>
            <li> However, no matter how little I use this is not a suitable day time eye cream for me, it&#x27;s too shiny/greasy looking.</li>
            <li> It is a balm, so you use very little.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive, but a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It was also greasy and hard to pat onto the eye area.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream keeps my delicate skin moisturized without keeping into my eyes.</li>
            <li> Too thick for an eye product.  </li>
            <li> This is a thick cream for eye contour</li>
            <li> Very thick, consistency comparable to Carmex lip balm.  </li>
            <li> If you are at all unhappy about how your eyes or eye area lookes....</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Absolutely love this eye balm.  I have dry skin under my eyes, which has created fine lines, due to allergies.  This has reduced the fine lines tremendously!!! I use at night and in the morning under my makeup.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This day balm for the eye is exactly that. It&#x27;s consistency is similar to lip balm except that it soaks into the eye area instead of sitting on top. I live in Florida and thought it might be heavy but you need just a touch of product for each eye and it goes to work right away. Thicker than I&#x27;m use to but very glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream ever. I have used so many  different eye creams such as Estee Lauder, Lancome, Clinque, Clarins, Khiels and etc. This is the only one that really works for fine lines.  It keeps the skin of your eyes very soft and moistured.  It feels oily when you first applies it but the skin will absorbs it very fast.  This is definitely a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> I love the way it glides on the eye area and how my cover up and foundation glide right over the top without leaving dry looking areas.  The texture of the skin around my eyes has greatly changed to the better.  I put this product on auto delivery so I never run out.</li>
            <li> Dr. Hauschka Eye Balm has been my favorite undereye care for years now. It&#x27;s unique.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin around my eye area, this is the only eye moisturizer that keeps the delicate skin around my eye feeling nourished and protected. I have been using this product for over a year now and I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else at this point.</li>
            <li> I love this eye balm.  It is not heavily scented or full of the nasty chemicals in most mainstream products.  I find that during the winter this is a must.  It is a bit expensive, but a small amount goes a long way.  It is worth it!</li>
            <li> After using Dr. Hauscka Eye Balm for years, I couldn&#x27;t find it locally. For 2 years I tried to find something...anything...that worked as well. Even the cream for $160. didn&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering from Amazon was $12. less then the Hauschka site. I am happy to say, this is still the best under eye cream(balm) for my baby blues. Love love love!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years and really love it! Will continue to use it--It is the best I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many eye products but always come back to this one. It doesn&#x27;t dry out like some of the others</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use my ring finger nail to scoop a little out, warm it in between my fingers and dab/lightly rub it in. However, no matter how little I use this is not a suitable day time eye cream for me, it&#x27;s too shiny/greasy looking. At night time I use Dr. Hauschka Daily Hydrating Eye Cream and layer this on top.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all the positive reviews and was excited to try something higher-end than what&#x27;s normally available at your neighborhood pharmacy. To be clear, this is an eye BALM, not a cream as others have said; it has the same thick consistency as a LIP BALM for example, thicker even. I would take each ring finger one at a time, touch it to the balm to pick up some product, and then tap lightly into my undereye area. That is ALL you should have to do for an undereye product, but this stuff would NOT absorb! Even after an hour, it was still incredibly shiny. I was left with half-moons of grease under my eyes. It helped to mix it with another product on the back of my hand before applying; I used Vita-K Solution Professional Dark Circles, which made a decent combo because the Vita-K would dry my skin out while the Dr H would leave it too shiny, but despite the mix, it was still on the shiny side. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Awesome eye cream/balm. It is like a lip balm consistency, very thick and a little goes a long way (each jar usually lasts 6 months or so-I use it morning &amp; night after cleansing). I have used it for 5yrs and recommended it to friends who also like it and have told me they see a difference in the moisture level and fine lines in the eye area. I have sensitive eyes; many eye creams I used in the past caused issues so I&#x27;m hooked on this because it doesn&#x27;t &amp; I truly see results with it (increased moisture, diminished fine lines &amp; I believe it&#x27;s prevented deeper lines from forming).</li>
            <li> I tried this product at Earth Fare and wasn&#x27;t expecting to see any result but to my surprise the wrinkles and bags under my eyes almost disappeared and I was amazed. I went back the next day to try it again just to make sure and tried it again and I left it on all day and my eyes look great for several days. I couldn&#x27;t believe it worked this good. nothing I&#x27;ve ever used has worked this well and I am 51 years old. its cheaper off Amazon 36.99 and its PRIME so no charge for shipping, in store 43.99 plus tax. Amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> Personally I did not like this product at all.  Too thick for an eye product.  It was also greasy and hard to pat onto the eye area.  Much prefer the other Hauschka revitalizing eye cream.</li>
            <li> I battled dry, peeling, crepey undereye skin.  Nothing helped until I found Dr. Hauschka Eye Balm.  Very thick, consistency comparable to Carmex lip balm.  I only use it at night and sometimes day time when my allergies are flaring up.</li>
            <li> I cannot function without this balm, especially this time of year. I apply it morning, noon and night to keep the under eye area soft and it helps prevent wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is good for me but I don&#x27;t know well because I received on yesterday. The color is yellow-orange and the texture is like Bees wax.  This balm mixed bee wax and carrot oil, and more.</li>
            <li> This is the only under eye product that keeps my skin continually moisturized.  It also has healing properties.  A couple of times I got a rash under my eyes from using the wrong products and this healed it right up.</li>
            <li> Price is always too high for this product.But if you have sensitive,dry skin it feels refreshing on the eyes.</li>
            <li> I recommend this eye balm. It&#x27;s soothes the skin.</li>
            <li> had an allergic reaction to the product. Wanted to return but the vendor did not authorize return.</li>
            <li> Love it, have been using it for 10 years, it&#x27;s the only eye balm that does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Kind of heavy and leaves a Vaseline-like sheen and texture under the eye. Goes on as Vaseline would, so not the easiest application. Does feel nice on.</li>
            <li> I have used many Dr. Hauschka products over the years and like them all, but this is the best by far.  I am 62 years old, have dry skin and a definite tendency to wrinkle under my eyes.  This product is wholesome and effective. It is the consistency of a firm balm, so it is necessary to warm it up in order to apply it.  I dip a pea size amount out of the container and rub it between my pointer fingers for a few seconds.  I can then easily dab it onto the contour under my eye and gently rub it in. It does have a bit of shine, but I take care of this in the morning by blotting my face with a clean terry cloth towel after applying my make-up.  Shine gone! I also use this balm to rub on burns and skin reactions I sometimes get in the spring and fall. These skin problems disappear within a few days. I highly recommend the product. When this product does not seem to be enough, I use the Hauschka cleansing cream and the moisterizing mask.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this forever! This is the best eye balm I have EVER used. The lines around my eyes have actually diminished. I also do not have any irritation from using this product. I finally found something that works for me!</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever worked on my eyes as well as this product. I&#x27;ve used it on and off for years. I sometimes buy the lip balm in the jar as it is a similar recipe BUT nothing but the real one works like this. If you are at all unhappy about how your eyes or eye area lookes....give this a try.</li>
            <li> This is a thick cream for eye contour but I love it. I have literally pain below my eyes if they are not properly hydrated and Hauschka eye contour is the only one that I have tried so far that succeeds for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!  This cream is outstanding.  Applied it twice a day and it worked like magic.  In a couple days my dry and red eyelids were completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> This is a balm, not eye cream, almost like Vaseline.</li>
            <li> This balm is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It leaves my skin so soft. I have the driest skin around my eyes and this is the only balm that lasts.</li>
            <li> Cured my dry skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This eye cream keeps my delicate skin moisturized without keeping into my eyes. It is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I used so many different brands and more expensive products this is so far the best to reduce fine line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product might seems greasy /oily when you first apply but it will be absorbed quickly and would not impact you applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels around the eyes and it is very light and I see a different around my eyes....I definitely buy it again!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products...yes, it is pretty heavy and very emollient but that is what I wanted.  It soaks in enough that concealer under my eyes stays put and mascara doesn&#x27;t run but still looks dewy on the skin.  I have tried many other eye creams and keep going back to this one.</li>
            <li> Product was great for wrinkles. I used it around my eyes and forehead. The reason for the three stars was because the skin around my eyes would be red and itchy. So I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> For fine lines under eyes, this is the best.  It is a balm, so you use very little. tap it on your ring finger and rub it to get it warm, then pat.  By the way, I always pat my face 100 times each day after moisturizing to build collagen.  I follow with concealer (sometimes I mix the balm with the concealer) continuing to pat, then dust just a little powder to set. The powder also minimizes any shine which may remain depending on how much balm you used.  I&#x27;m 62 and I notice even my young friends are getting lines under their eyes.  They ask me and I always recommend this balm. I&#x27;ve tried many others, this is my &amp;#34;have to have&amp;#34; eye cream.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for it as eye cream BUT love love love as lip balm. I don&#x27;t wear lipstick as it&#x27;s too drying; thick consistency of this lip balm is so nourishing and made my lips super smooth. Plus it gave me a nice sheen similar to lip gloss. I buying 2 more to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like it as eye cream, use on your lips, neck, or chest!</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my eye area except irritate it. Very thick and sticky, takes a while to warm up and be pliable.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this product and was running out, so as a part of her birthday present this was one of the items. The product wound up coming in time for her birthday, but there was no tracking on the package, even though a tracking number was provided. I don&#x27;t know what happened as far as that went, but it would have been nice to know when it was arriving.</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive skin around my eyes, and developed rosacea in the past few years. I have literally tried EVERYTHING for my eyes. This is hands down the best, most gentle yet moisturizing thing out there! Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> dry climate, good eye balm</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado and it is so dry out here.  I have been on a quest for YEARS to find a good eye cream.  I have tried low-end to high-end brands including some for $100+... and none have been good.  They either don&#x27;t moisturize enough, make my eyes puffy and itchy, or they burn.  This is the best stuff I have found and I plan on using this for a while.  It eliminates my crows feet and dryness and really keeps the eye area young and fresh and very moisturized.  A little goes a long way and I like that I can control how much I use/need each day/night. I am 34 yr old female and LOVE this stuff!  Looking fw to trying more of their line.</li>
            <li> I love this eye balm. It has a great deal of moisture and all other eye cremes I have used go into the skin and disappear looking like you never used anything. I feel that this makes the skin soooo moist and dewy. I love it! I have never found a eye creme I liked except this one.</li>
