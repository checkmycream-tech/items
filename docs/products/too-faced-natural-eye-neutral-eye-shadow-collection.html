            <li>Kind of disappointing.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Was Nice pack and with care.</li>

            <li>Really nice selection of colors all matching so well.</li>

            <li>Really great set of colors that go on well and blend super easy.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I also love the booklet with tips on how to use/combine the looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have known better.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>Oh and also it is in a tin this time and not a cardboard like box love</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging.</li>
            <li>So glad they changed their packaging from the cardboard to the tin and added a mirror.</li>
            <li>I love too faced palettes.</li>
            <li>I bought these eye shadows for my 19 year old daughter and she loved them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had cheap department store shadows that have more saturation than these do.</li>
            <li>This one is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>Here is the review from her: &amp;#34;The colors are nice, but have very light pigment, almost can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there, and have to apply more than normal.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it stays on for hours and looks consistently great!</li>
            <li>Perfect colors, great texture (velvety) &amp; long lasting!</li>
            <li>Definitely good for going to high school or college.</li>
            <li>The middle row is perfect for my fair skin and blue eyes.</li>
            <li>If you want more info, there is a full review on my blog, here: http://thebeautyofmidlife.com/2015/05/product-review-too-faced-natural-eyes-palette-original-not-matte/.</li>
            <li>This palette is fine for me and works well with my complexion.</li>
            <li>It is a nice neutral palette that is very versatile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for an everyday look because none of the colors are too out there.</li>
            <li>The gold color was way off as I already owned this and liked it so much that I bought this one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Awesome palette for everyday to smokey night out looks.</li>
            <li>The colors look good on many different skin types and eye colors.</li>
            <li>Faced eye shadows and even the very light colors look strong and saturated, this one not so much.</li>
            <li>I am an avid makeup wearer and an addict of Too Faced eyeshadow palettes for many reasons.</li>
            <li>I have had my too faced pallets for over a year now and they are still full.</li>
            <li>What makes this one so great is that there&#x27;s just the right range of light, mid-tone and dark colors, as well as mattes and shimmers.  </li>
            <li>There are several different price points of primers so try some out and see which works best for</li>
            <li>the shadows are super silky, and pigmented.</li>
            <li>I got this pallet as a Christmas present from my sister and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>There is a little instruction booklet that is fastened in front of the mirror that you can remove and get some assistance on deciding how you want to wear your eye makeup that day!&lt;br /&gt;The pigmentation of these shadows is great</li>
            <li>Fun names too.</li>
            <li>And the names of the eyeshadows are just so fun.</li>
            <li>I love that they come in this super cute little metal compact that is magnetic.</li>
            <li>By itself, it won&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours without creasing.</li>
            <li>Very pricey but well worth it</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Color is good but not long lasting and needs to be re-applied by evening.</li>
            <li>Nice shadows but not right for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>A few of my girl friends use this pallet also and they look amazing in it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The packaging is off compared to the real one I purchased from Too Faced.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Pretty package but quality definitely not worth the price and not any better than what you can get at any drug store.</li>
            <li>This is more versatile than even my Naked palettes from Urban Decay, and in pretty, feminine packaging.  </li>
            <li>The pigment and quality is really good, but compared to Urban Decay Pallets or MAC it is a slight step below those.</li>
            <li>However, in combination with the infallible Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion, it lasts for a full day.</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeshadow, hands down.  </li>
            <li>The colors remind me a lot of my Urban Decay Naked palette (which I also love), but this is a little cheaper and may be a better option for some people that can&#x27;t afford the Naked collection.</li>
            <li>you!&lt;br /&gt;I like to apply these with a double ended shadow brush so I can get it on point and then use the other side to blend it in to a more natural look.</li>
            <li>I have both, but reach for this one a little more often since they are similar</li>
            <li>The neutral colors go with nearly everything (clothing and other makeup) and the makeup guide they give you can be fun to use when you want to try something new, or you&#x27;re giving this as a gift to a younger girl who doesn&#x27;t know much about makeup.</li>
            <li>The Too-Faced Neutral Eye Shadow collection is very complimentary to those with green eyes.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this palette, the colors last a long time and there is little fallout when applying</li>
            <li>, I usually have to touch it up to get that same fresh look.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product. Colors are nice and neutral. I&#x27;m in late 20&#x27;s, light skin, green eyes and brown hair. This palette is fine for me and works well with my complexion. The palette includes a &amp;#34;day&amp;#34;, a &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;fashion&amp;#34; look (each line in the palette is a look) and they&#x27;re all great. I also love the booklet with tips on how to use/combine the looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 and not 5 stars it&#x27;s because of the staying power. By itself, it won&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours without creasing. However, in combination with the infallible Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion, it lasts for a full day.</li>
            <li> The middle row is perfect for my fair skin and blue eyes. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great makeup, gives you examples of how to apply. Nice shades provided</li>
            <li> Nice shadows but not right for my skin tone.  Gave them to my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Gift for my wife by her request. Here is the review from her: &amp;#34;The colors are nice, but have very light pigment, almost can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there, and have to apply more than normal. I have other Too Faced eye shadows and even the very light colors look strong and saturated, this one not so much. I&#x27;ve had cheap department store shadows that have more saturation than these do. Even the dark &#x27;sexpresso&#x27; color takes several attempts to get the right density, not at all like my previous shadows. Kind of disappointing.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The mirror lid feels little lose but at least no tablet felt off . Was Nice pack and with care. Thanks</li>
            <li> The pigment and quality is really good, but compared to Urban Decay Pallets or MAC it is a slight step below those. When I put it on in the morning and I plan on going out that evening, I usually have to touch it up to get that same fresh look. The colors look good on many different skin types and eye colors. A few of my girl friends use this pallet also and they look amazing in it. I have had my too faced pallets for over a year now and they are still full. Other than that, it stays on for hours and looks consistently great!</li>
            <li> The Too-Faced Neutral Eye Shadow collection is very complimentary to those with green eyes. The browns draw out the color. I don&#x27;t use all of the colors, but find the Day light beige great day or night for under the brows. I then use the the last four colors for contouring and shading. I do find the shading sometimes has to be reapplied as the staying power seems to vary depending on the color chosen.  You can also mix the various shades for a lighter or darker application.  It is a nice neutral palette that is very versatile.</li>
            <li> I got this pallet as a Christmas present from my sister and I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s perfect for an everyday look because none of the colors are too out there. Definitely good for going to high school or college.</li>
            <li> My grandaughter really loved them!!!</li>
            <li> I believe this is a fake.  The gold color was way off as I already owned this and liked it so much that I bought this one for my daughter.  The packaging is off compared to the real one I purchased from Too Faced.  I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I am an avid makeup wearer and an addict of Too Faced eyeshadow palettes for many reasons. I love that they come in this super cute little metal compact that is magnetic. There is a little instruction booklet that is fastened in front of the mirror that you can remove and get some assistance on deciding how you want to wear your eye makeup that day!&lt;br /&gt;The pigmentation of these shadows is great and they last all day for me (roughly 12 hours). I have been wearing makeup for.. quite awhile and would always suggest using an eyeshadow primer no matter what brand or quality of eyeshadow you&#x27;re using. There are several different price points of primers so try some out and see which works best for you!&lt;br /&gt;I like to apply these with a double ended shadow brush so I can get it on point and then use the other side to blend it in to a more natural look. The colors remind me a lot of my Urban Decay Naked palette (which I also love), but this is a little cheaper and may be a better option for some people that can&#x27;t afford the Naked collection. I have both, but reach for this one a little more often since they are similar and it&#x27;s cheaper (I want my Naked to last longer since it cost me more).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this palette is bomb, just like all other Too Faced palettes. The shadows all glide on super smooth like butter and look gorgeous all day!</li>
            <li> Awesome palette, the perfect combination for neutral colors with a little shimmer. Stays put all day and blends nicely</li>
            <li> the shadows are super silky, and pigmented. they are not powdery and they stay on for a long hours. i am happy that i ordered this product.üòç</li>
            <li> Pretty package but quality definitely not worth the price and not any better than what you can get at any drug store.</li>
            <li> Beautiful shadows! Great pigmentation. I just love it. Shipping was fast. Item just as described. Will buy again when i use it all</li>
            <li> Very pricey but well worth it right colors love that come with the mirror this time!!! Oh and also it is in a tin this time and not a cardboard like box love that as well!!</li>
            <li> Color is good but not long lasting and needs to be re-applied by evening.</li>
            <li> Really great set of colors that go on well and blend super easy. The neutral colors go with nearly everything (clothing and other makeup) and the makeup guide they give you can be fun to use when you want to try something new, or you&#x27;re giving this as a gift to a younger girl who doesn&#x27;t know much about makeup.</li>
            <li> Arrived in great condition, lovely palette</li>
            <li> I love it. The colors are great and there is a good mix of flats vs shimmers.</li>
            <li> Great palette!  This one is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  What makes this one so great is that there&#x27;s just the right range of light, mid-tone and dark colors, as well as mattes and shimmers.  This is more versatile than even my Naked palettes from Urban Decay, and in pretty, feminine packaging.

            <li> Nothing to hate. Absolutely amazing pigments and how can anyone ever be mad at too faced!!!???</li>
            <li> gift for my daughter she loved it</li>
            <li> I bought these eye shadows for my 19 year old daughter and she loved them! Really nice selection of colors all matching so well. Fun names too.</li>
            <li> What a great collection of eye shadows and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my purchase. The quality, convenient packaging and included instructions are an added plus. Excellent!</li>
            <li> My grand-daughter loves this make up.</li>
            <li> Great neutral colors.  Love the packaging.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite neutral palette, but it&#x27;s nice. There are four matte and five shimmer shades. I haven&#x27;t touched the two darker shades of the bottom three. The others, though, pair well for my very fair skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect colors, great texture (velvety) &amp; long lasting!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this palette, the colors last a long time and there is little fallout when applying, I like that they send you a &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; book . I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeshadow, hands down.  Goes on smoothly and looks great.  The shades are perfect and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It is great with the tutorial for apply the eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;it is good for beginner who learn make up.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. All have great pigmentation except Heaven. Did not swatch well at all.  So glad they changed their packaging from the cardboard to the tin and added a mirror. Instruction cards inside will help beginners and with only 9 colors the user will not be overwhelmed.  I love too faced palettes. Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Very nice eyeshadows!</li>
            <li> Love it! Even comes with a look book that details how you can use the shadows together! I use it with a primer and it stays all day. Can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Awesome palette for everyday to smokey night out looks. And the names of the eyeshadows are just so fun.</li>
