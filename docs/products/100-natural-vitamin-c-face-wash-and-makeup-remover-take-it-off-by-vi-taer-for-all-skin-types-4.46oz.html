            <li>I think the biggest surprise was that this is not a foaming face wash—for good reason.</li>
            <li>This cleanser has a great smell and a nice texture.</li>

            <li>, I really love this face wash/makeup remover!</li>
            <li>This is one AMAZING SKIN cleaner.</li>
            <li>Over the years, what I have found to as ABSOLUTELY the best treatment for my face, is ... (drum roll) washing it before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>This was sent to me for my honest opinion of the item.</li>
            <li>Nice smell&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>bubbles on nicely.</li>
            <li>Over that, you&#x27;ll be better off with an efficient and cheaper product The product claims to be good on all types of skins, but it is not for all types of age.</li>
            <li>It cleans beautifully and does the job perfectly in every way.&lt;br /&gt;You will love Vi-Tae&#x27;s Lavendar Facial Cleanser &amp; Makeup Remover.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I find it especially good for my highly sensitve skin</li>
            <li>It is a great way to baby your skin and to keep it in lovely, clean condition.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is like a creamy milk.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>honestly, your skin will love you for it.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but that is understandable because it is all natural...</li>
            <li>It leaves on the skin a bit of a shine, which is probably wonderful on young skins, because it gives an appearance of youth and health.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and hydrated...not to mention the beautiful yet light lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser has a great lavender scent that smells great.  </li>
            <li>I am in love..</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of this and also trying some more products from the seller...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>

            <li>I love everything lavendert</li>
            <li>I do love lavender, so I gave it a go.  </li>
            <li>This makeup remover does more than remove makeup.</li>
            <li>I put about 1/4 of a teaspoon of this on it and like magic</li>
            <li>He told me his hands felt way better than they do with his chemical cleaner.</li>
            <li>So many uses</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more like a cleansing milk, and it dissolves every bit of make-up and grime.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>what I really love is the calming, soothing lavender</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to remove as many chemicals from my daily life and this was a perfect choice.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Great, gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love love love it, took my makeup off without being abrasive.</li>
            <li>And I love the way my face feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>I recommend it, if you love lavender.</li>

            <li>Works a lot better than I thought it would</li>

            <li>Thanks to I Love to Review for the free trial!!</li>
            <li>In addition, i purchased two other items which is the best.  </li>
            <li>The plastic bottle is easy to hold and has a cap that pops up when you press the indentation – no need to unscrew it.</li>
            <li>A natural cleanser, that is gentle on the skin, that helps it rest while retaining moisture is the best thing you can do for yourself, and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It rinsed easily and didn&#x27;t leave any residue or leave my face feeling oily.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to remember to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong at all</li>
            <li>First of all it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>Take it Off is all natural and amazing!</li>
            <li>all the gum came out with a fine tooth comb.</li>
            <li>However, this one seems to work perfectly fine with my skin, didn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The lavender scent was both soothing and refreshing although the scent disappeared quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was super pumped!</li>
            <li>My granddaughter stayed with us and ended up with a huge wad of gum in her hair.</li>
            <li>This face cleanser is so light weight</li>
            <li>It was really light</li>
            <li>This makeup remover is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>, great cleanser, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>This is a creamy, light cleanser you just massage over face and neck and then rinse off.  </li>
            <li>This face wash leaves my face feeling smooth, moisturized, and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy which is often an issue for me.  </li>
            <li>great product actually has a one year</li>
            <li>This face wash also has a great lavender smell, and leaves me feeling like I’ve just left the spa.</li>
            <li>Off Facial Cleanser” is a great place to start.  </li>
            <li>mostly botanical formula has an intense scent of true lavender, which is my favorite scent.  </li>

            <li>so far it works great on my Very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always nervous trying out new products; however, I was sent this product free in return for a fair review.  </li>
            <li>pure all natural ingredients, that it really truly cleans really well, a nice light fragrance, and most importantly - being very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I recently have also bought there skinny bath salts and was IN LOVE with the smell!</li>
            <li>The label uses various fonts which is eye pleasing, adheres nicely to the bottle (no curled edges) and is artistic.  </li>
            <li>in my opinion, it is probably excellent if you are less than 50 years old.</li>
            <li>I love that its all natural.</li>
            <li>out a softer, more natural way of cleaning my face.  </li>

            <li>It is a really effective facial wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is truly a natural and effective facial cleaner with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, natural facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Instead my skin just felt soft,  light,  and clean.  </li>
            <li>Thats right</li>
            <li>Skin doesn&#x27;t really feel clean.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re all clean and ready to hit that pillow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and all my life I&#x27;ve been trying out different cleansers to find the perfect balance in a facial cleanser:</li>
            <li>When massaged into the skin and then rinsed with hot water, it removes makeup and grime and leaves the skin feeling fresh, moist, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The milk-colored fluid is very mild, soft, has no lather, and feels very comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and quite probably the first time I am smelling the real thing - the lavender totally elevated my mood and calmed me.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>This cleanser Is very gentle.</li>
            <li>this product contains just enough exfoliating material, very very light material, and the lavender is so soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Vi-Tae&#x27;s “Take It Off Lavender Facial Cleanser” because it really is very, very gentle - yet quite effective.</li>
            <li>This product’s list price was $41.50 which is pretty steep and not a price I’d be willing to pay but is currently on sale on Amazon for $25.50 which is more manageable.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>You get any and all makeup removed and you&#x27;re left with that lovely relaxing lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>I would like Vi-Tae to vary the color or look of the labels in some way so that it&#x27;s easier to grab the bottle I want more quickly, especially since I don&#x27;t have my glasses on when I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It’s a lavender scented facial cleaner good for all skin types and is gentle and all natural.  </li>
            <li>Reviewed by JoAnne&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for review&lt;br /&gt;Review originally posted at Romancing the Book&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>It Off&amp;#34;  Lavender Facial Cleanser and Makeup Remover does an amazing job cleansing my face and purifying my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it makes your face soft and clean.</li>
            <li>And this worked as good if not better than his smelly stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not as good a remover as my usual cleanser (witch hazel).</li>
            <li>I just recently converted to all-natural/organic products and I was very pleased to see that there were no synthetic or toxic additives, such as parabens, sodium lauryl sulfate, fragrances or dyes.</li>
            <li>To get super soft skin leave it on a couple minutes before washing it off.</li>
            <li>And the only thing better than that is to do it with a natural, organic product, free from synthetic fragrances, sulfates or parabens - generally all the stuff that distress your skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser leaves it soft and smooth without causing redness.</li>
            <li>I like a cleanser that foams and really feels like it is doing something</li>
            <li>and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>It retains moisture, while gently getting rid of the impurities that build up over the day - it allows you skin to breath at night and rest.</li>
            <li>face feels really refreshed after using this.  </li>
            <li>(I have oily skin), and 15 hrs later my face still feels smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li>Off  all week, and it has accomplished everything that I wanted -  </li>
            <li>so I used almost the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for something that is really gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>B00DT4757A Blackhead Remover, Pore Minimizer &amp; Unclogger, Gentle,</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser also felt silky smooth while I was washing my face</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a lavender scented face cleanser that will be gentle on your skin, this product should be something you try.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot about how the foaminess in soap is what causes dryness, and I really noticed the difference with this product.</li>
            <li>It can also be used with a washcloth in a steamy shower for gentle exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hopefully as more time goes by, it will help clear up my face from the occasional breakouts I get.</li>
            <li>This lavender facial cleanser  makes your face feel clean and very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other cream type cleansers before</li>
            <li>I tried so many foaming cleansers from drugstores, but they had a harsh smell or dried me out even more!  </li>
            <li>Low and behold, my friend was right!</li>
            <li>Sounds simple, but its true.</li>
            <li>This is a gem of a cleanser and is hands down better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>My very sensitive skin is prone to rosacea, but I find this cleanser very soothing.</li>
            <li>I have dermatitis and it really cleaned all the scales off my face and made my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad high in price</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>wife highly recommends this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face looks so refreshed and moist after using this, and it smells amazing unlike other facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>The lotion was not greasy, was easy to apply and rinse off, and softened my skin in addition to removing makeup, dirt and other impurities from my skin.</li>
            <li>But if this product is any indication that a little goes a long way I believe it would be a good value.  </li>
            <li>It does not linger on the skin to interfere with perfumes you might be wearing, it&#x27;s just enough to calm and uplift you while cleansing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the scent of fresh French lavender, and it is heavenly.</li>
            <li>i have a naturally fresh smelling face (not artificial scents that bother my skin) that has proven to take the extra oils and gunk from the day off my face, without taking extra oils and the hydration away.</li>
            <li>#34;foam up&amp;#34; like a normal cleanser</li>
            <li>I am in love with these products, I have acne, oily and dry skin in different areas of my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found my new friend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched long and hard for an effective makeup remover that gets the makeup off without irritation!</li>
            <li>but it is all natural and so much better on your skin then using harsh cleansers.</li>
            <li>I have super dry, VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Another bonus to this is that it is gentel and all natural!</li>
            <li>Only one dislike, it takes much more product to wash the face as other one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It Off\\&quot; is not a harsh product at all and while it is safe for daily use and clearly works as a gentle cleanser (removes makeup and sebum), it&#x27;s not going to remove years of build-up of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try Vi-Tae&#x27;s other products!</li>
            <li>and it leaves your sking looking, smelling and feeling so soft like baby skin.</li>
            <li>The fact that this is organic and natural is just a bonus.  </li>
            <li>B00DSW9D7S Jojoba Facial Scrub, Exfoliating &amp; Smoothing Serum, Gentle,</li>
            <li>All Natural - \\&quot;Get Refreshed\\&quot; -</li>
            <li>I really like this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Even without applying additional moisturizer after using the cleanser, the skin already feels soft and moist .</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>It works really good, but it&#x27;s just too expensive for the amount of liquid in it.</li>
            <li>All their labels look exactly the same, the only difference being the name of the cleanser on the label.  </li>
            <li>Based on other reviews, I had high hopes for this product and really tried to like it.  </li>
            <li>She has gotten off the pill and we are hoping that soon her skin and body will get back to normal.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no hint of harshness at all, and it cleans very thoroughly, leaving no oily residue, nor does it dry out the skin.</li>
            <li>The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free.</li>
            <li>face is usually really sensitive, had tried a lot different products, but seems to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>This made my facial skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>facial cleanser is all natural and leaves your skin feeling refreshed, and  thoroughly cleaned.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter because she has been dealing with acne rosacea, severe dry and sensitive skin for years.</li>
            <li>It works well on both oily and dry areas of the face and neck and doesn’t irritate sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> I think the biggest surprise was that this is not a foaming face wash—for good reason.</li>

            <li> , I really love this face wash/makeup remover!</li>
            <li> This is one AMAZING SKIN cleaner.</li>
            <li> Over the years, what I have found to as ABSOLUTELY the best treatment for my face, is ... (drum roll) washing it before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> This was sent to me for my honest opinion of the item.</li>
            <li> Nice smell&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> bubbles on nicely.</li>
            <li> Over that, you&#x27;ll be better off with an efficient and cheaper product The product claims to be good on all types of skins, but it is not for all types of age.</li>
            <li> It cleans beautifully and does the job perfectly in every way.&lt;br /&gt;You will love Vi-Tae&#x27;s Lavendar Facial Cleanser &amp; Makeup Remover.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I find it especially good for my highly sensitve skin</li>
            <li> It is a great way to baby your skin and to keep it in lovely, clean condition.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is like a creamy milk.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> honestly, your skin will love you for it.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but that is understandable because it is all natural...</li>
            <li> It leaves on the skin a bit of a shine, which is probably wonderful on young skins, because it gives an appearance of youth and health.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and hydrated...not to mention the beautiful yet light lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser has a great lavender scent that smells great.  </li>

            <li> I do love lavender, so I gave it a go.  </li>
            <li> This makeup remover does more than remove makeup.</li>
            <li> I put about 1/4 of a teaspoon of this on it and like magic</li>
            <li> He told me his hands felt way better than they do with his chemical cleaner.</li>
            <li> So many uses</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is more like a cleansing milk, and it dissolves every bit of make-up and grime.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> what I really love is the calming, soothing lavender</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to remove as many chemicals from my daily life and this was a perfect choice.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Great, gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love love love it, took my makeup off without being abrasive.</li>
            <li> And I love the way my face feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I recommend it, if you love lavender.</li>

            <li> Thanks to I Love to Review for the free trial!!</li>
            <li> In addition, i purchased two other items which is the best.  </li>
            <li> The plastic bottle is easy to hold and has a cap that pops up when you press the indentation – no need to unscrew it.</li>
            <li> A natural cleanser, that is gentle on the skin, that helps it rest while retaining moisture is the best thing you can do for yourself, and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It rinsed easily and didn&#x27;t leave any residue or leave my face feeling oily.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to remember to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong at all</li>
            <li> First of all it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> Take it Off is all natural and amazing!</li>
            <li> all the gum came out with a fine tooth comb.</li>
            <li> However, this one seems to work perfectly fine with my skin, didn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The lavender scent was both soothing and refreshing although the scent disappeared quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was super pumped!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter stayed with us and ended up with a huge wad of gum in her hair.</li>
            <li> This face cleanser is so light weight</li>
            <li> It was really light</li>
            <li> This makeup remover is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> , great cleanser, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a creamy, light cleanser you just massage over face and neck and then rinse off.  </li>
            <li> This face wash leaves my face feeling smooth, moisturized, and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy which is often an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> great product actually has a one year</li>
            <li> This face wash also has a great lavender smell, and leaves me feeling like I’ve just left the spa.</li>
            <li> Off Facial Cleanser” is a great place to start.  </li>
            <li> mostly botanical formula has an intense scent of true lavender, which is my favorite scent.  </li>

            <li> so far it works great on my Very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always nervous trying out new products; however, I was sent this product free in return for a fair review.  </li>
            <li> pure all natural ingredients, that it really truly cleans really well, a nice light fragrance, and most importantly - being very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I recently have also bought there skinny bath salts and was IN LOVE with the smell!</li>
            <li> The label uses various fonts which is eye pleasing, adheres nicely to the bottle (no curled edges) and is artistic.  </li>
            <li> in my opinion, it is probably excellent if you are less than 50 years old.</li>
            <li> I love that its all natural.</li>
            <li> out a softer, more natural way of cleaning my face.  </li>

            <li> It is a really effective facial wash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is truly a natural and effective facial cleaner with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, natural facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Instead my skin just felt soft,  light,  and clean.  </li>
            <li> Thats right</li>
            <li> Skin doesn&#x27;t really feel clean.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re all clean and ready to hit that pillow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and all my life I&#x27;ve been trying out different cleansers to find the perfect balance in a facial cleanser:</li>
            <li> When massaged into the skin and then rinsed with hot water, it removes makeup and grime and leaves the skin feeling fresh, moist, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The milk-colored fluid is very mild, soft, has no lather, and feels very comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and quite probably the first time I am smelling the real thing - the lavender totally elevated my mood and calmed me.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser Is very gentle.</li>
            <li> this product contains just enough exfoliating material, very very light material, and the lavender is so soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Vi-Tae&#x27;s “Take It Off Lavender Facial Cleanser” because it really is very, very gentle - yet quite effective.</li>
            <li> This product’s list price was $41.50 which is pretty steep and not a price I’d be willing to pay but is currently on sale on Amazon for $25.50 which is more manageable.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> You get any and all makeup removed and you&#x27;re left with that lovely relaxing lavender scent.  </li>
            <li> I would like Vi-Tae to vary the color or look of the labels in some way so that it&#x27;s easier to grab the bottle I want more quickly, especially since I don&#x27;t have my glasses on when I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> It’s a lavender scented facial cleaner good for all skin types and is gentle and all natural.  </li>
            <li> Reviewed by JoAnne&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for review&lt;br /&gt;Review originally posted at Romancing the Book&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> It Off&amp;#34;  Lavender Facial Cleanser and Makeup Remover does an amazing job cleansing my face and purifying my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it makes your face soft and clean.</li>
            <li> And this worked as good if not better than his smelly stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not as good a remover as my usual cleanser (witch hazel).</li>
            <li> I just recently converted to all-natural/organic products and I was very pleased to see that there were no synthetic or toxic additives, such as parabens, sodium lauryl sulfate, fragrances or dyes.</li>
            <li> To get super soft skin leave it on a couple minutes before washing it off.</li>
            <li> And the only thing better than that is to do it with a natural, organic product, free from synthetic fragrances, sulfates or parabens - generally all the stuff that distress your skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser leaves it soft and smooth without causing redness.</li>
            <li> I like a cleanser that foams and really feels like it is doing something</li>
            <li> and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> It retains moisture, while gently getting rid of the impurities that build up over the day - it allows you skin to breath at night and rest.</li>
            <li> face feels really refreshed after using this.  </li>
            <li> (I have oily skin), and 15 hrs later my face still feels smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li> Off  all week, and it has accomplished everything that I wanted -  </li>
            <li> so I used almost the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that is really gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> B00DT4757A Blackhead Remover, Pore Minimizer &amp; Unclogger, Gentle,</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser also felt silky smooth while I was washing my face</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a lavender scented face cleanser that will be gentle on your skin, this product should be something you try.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot about how the foaminess in soap is what causes dryness, and I really noticed the difference with this product.</li>
            <li> It can also be used with a washcloth in a steamy shower for gentle exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hopefully as more time goes by, it will help clear up my face from the occasional breakouts I get.</li>
            <li> This lavender facial cleanser  makes your face feel clean and very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other cream type cleansers before</li>
            <li> I tried so many foaming cleansers from drugstores, but they had a harsh smell or dried me out even more!  </li>
            <li> Low and behold, my friend was right!</li>
            <li> Sounds simple, but its true.</li>
            <li> This is a gem of a cleanser and is hands down better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> My very sensitive skin is prone to rosacea, but I find this cleanser very soothing.</li>
            <li> I have dermatitis and it really cleaned all the scales off my face and made my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad high in price</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> wife highly recommends this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face looks so refreshed and moist after using this, and it smells amazing unlike other facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> The lotion was not greasy, was easy to apply and rinse off, and softened my skin in addition to removing makeup, dirt and other impurities from my skin.</li>
            <li> But if this product is any indication that a little goes a long way I believe it would be a good value.  </li>
            <li> It does not linger on the skin to interfere with perfumes you might be wearing, it&#x27;s just enough to calm and uplift you while cleansing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the scent of fresh French lavender, and it is heavenly.</li>
            <li> i have a naturally fresh smelling face (not artificial scents that bother my skin) that has proven to take the extra oils and gunk from the day off my face, without taking extra oils and the hydration away.</li>
            <li> #34;foam up&amp;#34; like a normal cleanser</li>
            <li> I am in love with these products, I have acne, oily and dry skin in different areas of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found my new friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched long and hard for an effective makeup remover that gets the makeup off without irritation!</li>
            <li> but it is all natural and so much better on your skin then using harsh cleansers.</li>
            <li> I have super dry, VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Another bonus to this is that it is gentel and all natural!</li>
            <li> Only one dislike, it takes much more product to wash the face as other one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It Off\\&quot; is not a harsh product at all and while it is safe for daily use and clearly works as a gentle cleanser (removes makeup and sebum), it&#x27;s not going to remove years of build-up of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try Vi-Tae&#x27;s other products!</li>
            <li> and it leaves your sking looking, smelling and feeling so soft like baby skin.</li>
            <li> The fact that this is organic and natural is just a bonus.  </li>
            <li> B00DSW9D7S Jojoba Facial Scrub, Exfoliating &amp; Smoothing Serum, Gentle,</li>
            <li> All Natural - \\&quot;Get Refreshed\\&quot; -</li>
            <li> I really like this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Even without applying additional moisturizer after using the cleanser, the skin already feels soft and moist .</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> It works really good, but it&#x27;s just too expensive for the amount of liquid in it.</li>
            <li> All their labels look exactly the same, the only difference being the name of the cleanser on the label.  </li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I had high hopes for this product and really tried to like it.  </li>
            <li> She has gotten off the pill and we are hoping that soon her skin and body will get back to normal.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no hint of harshness at all, and it cleans very thoroughly, leaving no oily residue, nor does it dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free.</li>
            <li> face is usually really sensitive, had tried a lot different products, but seems to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This made my facial skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> facial cleanser is all natural and leaves your skin feeling refreshed, and  thoroughly cleaned.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she has been dealing with acne rosacea, severe dry and sensitive skin for years.</li>
            <li> It works well on both oily and dry areas of the face and neck and doesn’t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is moderately viscous and pure white in color and tingles very slightly when applied.  </li>
            <li> It was clean, no makeup left behind.</li>
            <li> but this just doesn&#x27;t feel good :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bogged down with a bunch of fillers that are just designed to foam.  </li>
            <li> When you are through using it to wash your face and neck, you simply rinse it off with water, and pat dry with a towel.</li>
            <li> We believe it totally messed up her Ph in her body which can cause all kinds of problems including dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This did not irritate my skin in any way (I also have sensitive skin due to some of the acne fighting products I used in my teens and early twenties), and I hesitate to try new face wash products because sometimes they make my skin worse.</li>
            <li> Unlike most companies out there, they understand that in order to get your face clean, you don&#x27;t have to strip have of it off with nasty stinging</li>
            <li> I would really describe this as a thick milk bath.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t lather up like other facial cleansers but you could still feel it working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have actually thrown away all of my other cleansers.</li>
            <li> I then rinsed it off and patted my face and neck dry.  </li>
            <li> I like this one because it&#x27;s a creamy milk (no foam) and doesn&#x27;t sting my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The problem is that her skin is still severely dry because of the birth control pill (specifically YAZ type pills).  </li>
            <li> It takes off everything I don’t want – dirt, makeup and excess oil without stripping my skin dry or causing any irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient is the culprit, but I was was surprised it burned.  </li>
            <li> It is not like a lot of the harsh, chemical-type stuff you get from the store, and does not dry out my face which tends to happen a lot in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Some of those other facial cleansers can leave your skin feeling dry and tight, or just oily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s self is a little thicker creamy white texture</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way and this bottle would easily last a month even with using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> As a 39 year old woman whose skin has become so much different than it was only a few years ago, it has been difficult to find a cleanser that both cleans deeply yet soothes dryer skin.</li>
            <li> I felt like I still had makeup left on my face, and when I dried my face, I did still have residue from my makeup there.  </li>
            <li> the scent is so calming as I expected.  </li>
            <li> my face ended up in stinging pain, and redder and blotchier AFTER I used a few regular store-bought cleansers, I knew I needed to</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful what I use.  </li>
            <li> because I&#x27;m not really into or like the lavender smell, I just hope that the company could create this cleanser in a smell other than the lavender.&lt;br /&gt;Still</li>
            <li> It removes makeup well or just use to clean your face from every day dirty and grime.  </li>
            <li> These pills caused her acne rosacea and her severe sensitive dry skin to become worse among other problems.  </li>
            <li> you will NOT be disappointed. :)</li>
            <li> I will be trying some of their other products.</li>
            <li> Love that isn&#x27;t no alcohol or artificial things in it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of lavender is extremely soothing and calming, as well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of lavender, but that&#x27;s minor.  </li>
            <li> Usually, after I dry my face, my skin feels dry and tight and I have to hurry to put moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> My daughter is also using Cure natural aqua gel exfoliant from Japan to help get ride of the dry dead skin on her face which is clogging her pores and making her acne worse.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned half my face with hazel and the other with this lavender product:</li>
            <li> have only one complaint about these skin cleansers</li>
            <li> Even though I was skeptical, she was very persistent about it</li>
            <li> Usually, I wash my face at least twice a day and have sebum buildup in my pores as well as considerably oily skin.</li>
            <li> I like my detergent to be washed off with water, but usually that leaves my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I started with the scrub then the cleanser and now the product for black heads and</li>
            <li> Being a self proclaimed skin care snob, I typically don&#x27;t put anything on my face if it doesn&#x27;t come from a Spa counter or a high-end store.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery with the lavender scent</li>
            <li> This cleansing lotion contains emulsified botanical oils and surfactants to gently cleanse and condition the skin, much as cold cream does, rather than stripping the skin like soaps or detergents can.  </li>
            <li> This product is the only exfoliant my daughter can use without irritating her skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Upon my research on why I should use all-natural, a truly organic face wash should never foam because that indicates that they contain harsh detergents.</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad acne, even into my mid-20s, but as soon as I realized I needed to wash the impurities from my skin, and let it breathe overnight</li>
            <li> lavender fragrance is very natural (unlike some artificial and pungent ones used in some products).</li>
            <li> squeezed a small amount in my palm, rubbed my hands together then spread it on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> However, it is disastrous on very old skins like mine: because then all the defects are showing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing negative occured, it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> it comes to lavender products, some have a slight artificial smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone can go wrong with using anything that has the relaxing scent of lavender..</li>
            <li> Not impressed :(&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Reviewed by JoAnne&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for review&lt;br /&gt;Review originally posted at Romancing the Book&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  It’s a lavender scented facial cleaner good for all skin types and is gentle and all natural.  It is good for dry/sensitive/rosacea skin and has a pleasant aroma.  The ingredients along with the directions on how to use the cleanser and the company website are all on the label.  The label uses various fonts which is eye pleasing, adheres nicely to the bottle (no curled edges) and is artistic.  The plastic bottle is easy to hold and has a cap that pops up when you press the indentation – no need to unscrew it. The product is meant to be used twice a day and I added it to my morning and nightly cleansing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  squeezed a small amount in my palm, rubbed my hands together then spread it on my face and neck.  I then rinsed it off and patted my face and neck dry.  The lotion was not greasy, was easy to apply and rinse off, and softened my skin in addition to removing makeup, dirt and other impurities from my skin. A small amount goes a long way and this bottle would easily last a month even with using it twice a day. I could feel the effects of the lotion several hours after using it.  The lavender scent was both soothing and refreshing although the scent disappeared quickly.  Lavender is often used for relaxing and massages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vi-Tae makes a variety of products some of which I would try although they do seem pricy.  But if this product is any indication that a little goes a long way I believe it would be a good value.  This product’s list price was $41.50 which is pretty steep and not a price I’d be willing to pay but is currently on sale on Amazon for $25.50 which is more manageable.  I would definitely recommend it to family and friends and can see myself incorporating it into my daily routine.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser has a great lavender scent that smells great.  However, I didn&#x27;t feel like it cleansed my face very good.  I felt like I still had makeup left on my face, and when I dried my face, I did still have residue from my makeup there.  I like a cleanser that foams and really feels like it is doing something, this one doesn&#x27;t foam.  Thanks to I Love to Review for the free trial!!</li>
            <li> This is one AMAZING SKIN cleaner. I think that the Lavender smell relaxes you while helping to cleanse your skin at the same time. I am a person who NEVER uses anything on my face but water and soap but with this Lavender Facial Cleanser &amp; Makeup Remover,... OH MY GOSH!!! I am in love.. I don&#x27;t think anyone can go wrong with using anything that has the relaxing scent of lavender.. This face cleanser is so light weight and it leaves your sking looking, smelling and feeling so soft like baby skin. I will be purchasing more of this and also trying some more products from the seller... you will NOT be disappointed. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product. It leaves my face refreshed, feeling and looking clean.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  It was really light and it works really well.  I was a little leery with the lavender scent but it was awesome.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering and doesn&#x27;t hang around.  The fact that this is organic and natural is just a bonus.  You don&#x27;t need alot of it either.  All in all this is a great product if you are looking for a really good and gentile cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this! I recently have also bought there skinny bath salts and was IN LOVE with the smell! I wanted more! When I found out about the face wash I was super pumped! The smell of this smells like a land of summer lavender! It&#x27;s not too strong at all is is actually quite relaxing while taking off your makeup before bed! Another bonus to this is that it is gentel and all natural! The cleanser it&#x27;s self is a little thicker creamy white texture and it comes is an amber color plastic bottle! Can&#x27;t wait to buy more! *i received this with a promotional discount*</li>
            <li> I love that its all natural. I have seen the acne on my face diminish. I am excited because nothing else have worked.</li>
            <li> Over the years, what I have found to as ABSOLUTELY the best treatment for my face, is ... (drum roll) washing it before I go to bed. Sounds simple, but its true. I had pretty bad acne, even into my mid-20s, but as soon as I realized I needed to wash the impurities from my skin, and let it breathe overnight, I was amazed. And the only thing better than that is to do it with a natural, organic product, free from synthetic fragrances, sulfates or parabens - generally all the stuff that distress your skin. The Vi-Tae Lavender facial cleanser does all this. It retains moisture, while gently getting rid of the impurities that build up over the day - it allows you skin to breath at night and rest. Thats right, your skin needs to rest too. Also, the smell is delightful. I know because my girlfriend told me so. ;) A natural cleanser, that is gentle on the skin, that helps it rest while retaining moisture is the best thing you can do for yourself, and honestly, your skin will love you for it. Trust me.</li>
            <li> I love everything lavendert so I was so excited to receive this. the scent is so calming as I expected.  so far it works great on my Very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always nervous trying out new products; however, I was sent this product free in return for a fair review.  I do love lavender, so I gave it a go.  I am pleased to report that my sensitive skin gets clean and fragrant without drying out:).</li>
            <li> I like my detergent to be washed off with water, but usually that leaves my skin dry. Not with this product. My very sensitive skin is prone to rosacea, but I find this cleanser very soothing. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This makeup remover does more than remove makeup. My granddaughter stayed with us and ended up with a huge wad of gum in her hair. I put about 1/4 of a teaspoon of this on it and like magic all the gum came out with a fine tooth comb. I also use a lot of eye liner and mascara and this melts it away and even my wash cloths come clean. The wash cloth thing is great! It has always been a problem for me. My husband was working on the car so i made him try this on his hands. (i hate the way hand cleaners smell) And this worked as good if not better than his smelly stuff. He told me his hands felt way better than they do with his chemical cleaner. This was sent to me for my honest opinion of the item. and this is an awesome product i will buy again. So many uses</li>
            <li> This makeup remover is fantastic.  First of all it smells amazing.  It works great too.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara is always a problem getting cleaned off and this just dissolves it off.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels really refreshed after using this.  I highly recommend.  Reviewed for&lt;br /&gt;amztrader.</li>
            <li> I like the cleanser, used it during the morning and night. It cleans my face very well, love it.&lt;br /&gt;My face is usually really sensitive, had tried a lot different products, but seems to irritate my skin. However, this one seems to work perfectly fine with my skin, didn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I only give it four stars is because I&#x27;m not really into or like the lavender smell, I just hope that the company could create this cleanser in a smell other than the lavender.&lt;br /&gt;Still, great cleanser, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product, and will be purchasing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most super gentle cleansers, this one does not leave your face with a &#x27;unwashed&#x27; greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;It is more like a cleansing milk, and it dissolves every bit of make-up and grime.&lt;br /&gt;But what I really love is the calming, soothing lavender scent.&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to lavender products, some have a slight artificial smell. Not so with this. It&#x27;s the scent of fresh French lavender, and it is heavenly. It does not linger on the skin to interfere with perfumes you might be wearing, it&#x27;s just enough to calm and uplift you while cleansing.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and makes my skin feel refreshed. I&#x27;m trying to remove as many chemicals from my daily life and this was a perfect choice. I will be trying some of their other products.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  It&#x27;s not bogged down with a bunch of fillers that are just designed to foam.  Great, gentle cleanser.  Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the product helpful  for my skin. Nothing negative occured, it just wasn&#x27;t for me. I won&#x27;t make a repurchase</li>
            <li> Smells like spa at your face! Good product. Only one dislike, it takes much more product to wash the face as other one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This made my facial skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Great product! It does not have any foaming agents, feels like a cross between creamy yogurt and moisturizer, but not oily at all. I would really describe this as a thick milk bath. I used about a quarter sized amount, spread it around my face and neck (I have oily skin), and 15 hrs later my face still feels smooth and not oily. Usually, I wash my face at least twice a day and have sebum buildup in my pores as well as considerably oily skin. This did not irritate my skin in any way (I also have sensitive skin due to some of the acne fighting products I used in my teens and early twenties), and I hesitate to try new face wash products because sometimes they make my skin worse. This is a fantastic product, I love it, and after using this I just totally fell in love with this company and the makers of this product. My only suggestion would be to use an exfoliator once or twice a week in conjunction with the face wash because \\&quot;Take It Off\\&quot; is not a harsh product at all and while it is safe for daily use and clearly works as a gentle cleanser (removes makeup and sebum), it&#x27;s not going to remove years of build-up of dead skin cells. I looked into Vi-Tae&#x27;s website, and found a valuable read on choosing an exfoliator: [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to meet the maker of this product, just to personally give him/her a big hug!  Unlike most companies out there, they understand that in order to get your face clean, you don&#x27;t have to strip have of it off with nasty stinging chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my face ended up in stinging pain, and redder and blotchier AFTER I used a few regular store-bought cleansers, I knew I needed to&lt;br /&gt;seek out a softer, more natural way of cleaning my face.  It wasn&#x27;t helping my face, it was ruining it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Take It Off  all week, and it has accomplished everything that I wanted -  i have a naturally fresh smelling face (not artificial scents that bother my skin) that has proven to take the extra oils and gunk from the day off my face, without taking extra oils and the hydration away.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I had high hopes for this product and really tried to like it.  I have super dry, VERY sensitive skin so I have to be careful what I use.  I wanted to give it a fair shot so I used almost the whole bottle.  Not impressed :(&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Nice smell&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Doesn&#x27;t remove eye make up!, Burns my skin. I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient is the culprit, but I was was surprised it burned.  Leaves a &amp;#34;reside&amp;#34; on your skin so you have to use toner.  Skin doesn&#x27;t really feel clean.  Feels like you are cleansing your face with lotion.  I&#x27;ve used many other cream type cleansers before so I know not to expect it to &amp;#34;foam up&amp;#34; like a normal cleanser but this just doesn&#x27;t feel good :(</li>
            <li> works great at removing the makeup. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love love love it, took my makeup off without being abrasive. And I love the way my face feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these products, I have acne, oily and dry skin in different areas of my face. I started with the scrub then the cleanser and now the product for black heads and all work beautifully, my skin loves them!!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that is really gentle on my skin. This winter has been a nightmare to my skin, and some products irritate it.  I tried so many foaming cleansers from drugstores, but they had a harsh smell or dried me out even more!  I like this one because it&#x27;s a creamy milk (no foam) and doesn&#x27;t sting my dry skin. The lavender smell is so calming before bed. I&#x27;ve searched long and hard for an effective makeup remover that gets the makeup off without irritation! My face looks so refreshed and moist after using this, and it smells amazing unlike other facial cleansers. Love that isn&#x27;t no alcohol or artificial things in it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful lavender fragrance. Nice lotion, facial cleanser. It made my skin feel very clean and dewy. I recommend it, if you love lavender. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is perfect for washing your face at night before bed.  You get any and all makeup removed and you&#x27;re left with that lovely relaxing lavender scent.  This is a creamy, light cleanser you just massage over face and neck and then rinse off.  That&#x27;s it.  You&#x27;re all clean and ready to hit that pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions say to use this twice daily.  I prefer to use it only at nighttime and in the daytime I will use either [[ASIN:B00DSW9D7S Jojoba Facial Scrub, Exfoliating &amp; Smoothing Serum, Gentle, All Natural - \\&quot;Get Refreshed\\&quot; - For all Skin Types.

I would like Vi-Tae to vary the color or look of the labels in some way so that it&#x27;s easier to grab the bottle I want more quickly, especially since I don&#x27;t have my glasses on when I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sample provided by Vi-Tae.)</li>
            <li> I really love this facial cleanser. The lavender smells so nice! This facial cleanser also felt silky smooth while I was washing my face and it did a wonderful job cleaning my skin. It didn&#x27;t lather up like other facial cleansers but you could still feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rinsed easily and didn&#x27;t leave any residue or leave my face feeling oily. Instead my skin just felt soft,  light,  and clean.  I really like this facial cleanser. It&#x27;s a tad high in price but it is all natural and so much better on your skin then using harsh cleansers. Some of those other facial cleansers can leave your skin feeling dry and tight, or just oily. This lavender facial cleanser  makes your face feel clean and very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample product was provided for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing! Very gentle on the skin. It did not remove makeup as much as I would have liked, but is otherwise a great gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, natural facial cleanser.  The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but that is understandable because it is all natural...I&#x27;m not a huge fan of lavender, but that&#x27;s minor.  This face wash leaves my face feeling smooth, moisturized, and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy which is often an issue for me.  It also takes off my makeup wonderfully so I give it two thumbs up!!  It is not like a lot of the harsh, chemical-type stuff you get from the store, and does not dry out my face which tends to happen a lot in the winter.  Hopefully as more time goes by, it will help clear up my face from the occasional breakouts I get.</li>
            <li> This cleanser Is very gentle. It smells great. It removes all your makeup including your eye makeup. I used some astringent afterwords to test to see if there was any residual left. It was clean, no makeup left behind.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and did it&#x27;s job. My skin feels refreshed after use. I received this free and all thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li> I tend to be a soap and water girl for removing make-up, but this product has changed my cleaning routine.  I have used this for three weeks and love it.  I have fair skin and don&#x27;t use a lot of makeup, but this cleanser makes my face feel so refreshed when I use it in the evening.  I love the lavender smell so it&#x27;s easy to remember to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for a free evaluation and I was lucky to receive it.</li>
            <li> Vi-Tae &amp;#34;Take It Off&amp;#34;  Lavender Facial Cleanser and Makeup Remover does an amazing job cleansing my face and purifying my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of lavender is extremely soothing and calming, as well.&lt;br /&gt;This facial cleanser is all natural and leaves your skin feeling refreshed, and  thoroughly cleaned. It is a really effective facial wash. I find it especially good for my highly sensitve skin type.&lt;br /&gt;It is recommended that you use it twice a day. It is a great way to baby your skin and to keep it in lovely, clean condition.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is like a creamy milk.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use too much.&lt;br /&gt;It bubbles on nicely. When you are through using it to wash your face and neck, you simply rinse it off with water, and pat dry with a towel. It leaves your skin feeling refreshed, clean, and terrific.&lt;br /&gt;This great product actually has a one year guarantee!&lt;br /&gt;It is truly a natural and effective facial cleaner with a lovely scent. It cleans beautifully and does the job perfectly in every way.&lt;br /&gt;You will love Vi-Tae&#x27;s Lavendar Facial Cleanser &amp; Makeup Remover.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, and see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;jean</li>
            <li> Works great, I really love this face wash/makeup remover! This cleanser is so gentle and feels great on your skin. It says for dry skin/rosacea skin, but I have oily skin and it still works great for me. It didn&#x27;t break me out. It didn&#x27;t burn my eyes at all, but neither did it remove all my eye makeup either (it was only mascara that I was wearing)...all in all I would recommend this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had to update and say I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now and it really is the best as far as removing makeup for sensitive skin. I love that this doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes whatsoever and it&#x27;s so gentle. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she has been dealing with acne rosacea, severe dry and sensitive skin for years. My daughter has been able to use this product without any issues.  The problem is that her skin is still severely dry because of the birth control pill (specifically YAZ type pills).  These pills caused her acne rosacea and her severe sensitive dry skin to become worse among other problems.  We believe it totally messed up her Ph in her body which can cause all kinds of problems including dry skin.  She has gotten off the pill and we are hoping that soon her skin and body will get back to normal.  My daughter is also using Cure natural aqua gel exfoliant from Japan to help get ride of the dry dead skin on her face which is clogging her pores and making her acne worse.  This product is the only exfoliant my daughter can use without irritating her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely give this product a try.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Vi-Tae&#x27;s “Take It Off Lavender Facial Cleanser” because it really is very, very gentle - yet quite effective. I just recently converted to all-natural/organic products and I was very pleased to see that there were no synthetic or toxic additives, such as parabens, sodium lauryl sulfate, fragrances or dyes. I think the biggest surprise was that this is not a foaming face wash—for good reason. Upon my research on why I should use all-natural, a truly organic face wash should never foam because that indicates that they contain harsh detergents. This face wash also has a great lavender smell, and leaves me feeling like I’ve just left the spa. For anyone starting or continuing their journey with all-natural/organic products, Vi-Tae&#x27;s &amp;#34;Take It Off Facial Cleanser” is a great place to start.  I am excited to try Vi-Tae&#x27;s other products!</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser has a wonderful lavender scent.  It removes makeup well or just use to clean your face from every day dirty and grime.  It is for all skin types and contains organic ingredients such as safflower seed oil and lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it, I thought it would foam up like soap.  It doesn’t.  It was like washing with a body lotion.  It is creamy smooth but does clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a lavender scented face cleanser that will be gentle on your skin, this product should be something you try.</li>
            <li> i wear no makeup, as i have internal and external scleroderma which is irritated by every makeup known to women, however i do wear moisturizer day and night..  this product contains just enough exfoliating material, very very light material, and the lavender is so soothing to the skin. i use it at night and in the morning followed by a touch of witch hazel (also for soothing my sclerodermic skin) i&#x27;ll be buying this one again!</li>
            <li> I bought another product (Pain Pain Go Away) from vi-tae several weeks ago and I was stunned at how well it worked. My current cleanser was about to run out so I bought ‘Take It Off’ to try it out. I have sensitive skin and all my life I&#x27;ve been trying out different cleansers to find the perfect balance in a facial cleanser: pure all natural ingredients, that it really truly cleans really well, a nice light fragrance, and most importantly - being very gentle on my skin. I must admit that I believe I&#x27;ve finally found the holy grail in facial cleansers. Take It Off is perfect! It takes off everything I don’t want – dirt, makeup and excess oil without stripping my skin dry or causing any irritation. Oh – and the fragrance is wonderful lavender. Smells amazing and quite probably the first time I am smelling the real thing - the lavender totally elevated my mood and calmed me. I&#x27;ve found my new friend. Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I do like this cleanser. My only issue is I wear water proof mascara and it doesn&#x27;t seem to remove it. To get super soft skin leave it on a couple minutes before washing it off. So, I like that it makes your face soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Works great I have dermatitis and it really cleaned all the scales off my face and made my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> As a 39 year old woman whose skin has become so much different than it was only a few years ago, it has been difficult to find a cleanser that both cleans deeply yet soothes dryer skin. Usually, after I dry my face, my skin feels dry and tight and I have to hurry to put moisturizer on. Not with this. My skin feels clean and hydrated...not to mention the beautiful yet light lavender fragrance. If you are looking for a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t strip your skin, this is it, especially if you suffer from occasional dermatitis/eczema issues like me.</li>
            <li> A friend mentioned she bought the most amazing &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; facial cleanser on Amazon.  Being a self proclaimed skin care snob, I typically don&#x27;t put anything on my face if it doesn&#x27;t come from a Spa counter or a high-end store. Even though I was skeptical, she was very persistent about it so I went on Amazon and bought the Take It Off facial cleanser. Low and behold, my friend was right! This is a gem of a cleanser and is hands down better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before. I really appreciate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up. I&#x27;ve read a lot about how the foaminess in soap is what causes dryness, and I really noticed the difference with this product. I have actually thrown away all of my other cleansers. Take it Off is all natural and amazing!</li>
            <li> This cleansing lotion contains emulsified botanical oils and surfactants to gently cleanse and condition the skin, much as cold cream does, rather than stripping the skin like soaps or detergents can.  When massaged into the skin and then rinsed with hot water, it removes makeup and grime and leaves the skin feeling fresh, moist, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mostly botanical formula has an intense scent of true lavender, which is my favorite scent.  It is moderately viscous and pure white in color and tingles very slightly when applied.  It works well on both oily and dry areas of the face and neck and doesn’t irritate sensitive skin. It can also be used with a washcloth in a steamy shower for gentle exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided by Vi-Tae for testing and evaluation.</li>
            <li> Great scent and it gets all the makeup off. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works a lot better than I thought it would</li>
            <li> Best stuff EVER!! My skin is the healthiest it has ever been. I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser leaves it soft and smooth without causing redness.</li>
            <li> (Disclaimer - My wife and I were invited by the seller to try and review their products. I only agree to these requests when it&#x27;s something we would actually use, and in this case, we picked some products to try and review. The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free. Also, for this type of invited review, I always begin with a disclaimer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife highly recommends this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender fragrance is very natural (unlike some artificial and pungent ones used in some products). The milk-colored fluid is very mild, soft, has no lather, and feels very comfortable on the skin. There&#x27;s no hint of harshness at all, and it cleans very thoroughly, leaving no oily residue, nor does it dry out the skin. Even without applying additional moisturizer after using the cleanser, the skin already feels soft and moist .</li>
            <li> This cleanser has a great smell and a nice texture. It leaves on the skin a bit of a shine, which is probably wonderful on young skins, because it gives an appearance of youth and health. However, it is disastrous on very old skins like mine: because then all the defects are showing.&lt;br /&gt;It is not as good a remover as my usual cleanser (witch hazel). I cleaned half my face with hazel and the other with this lavender product: the cotton I used with hazel had much more residue.&lt;br /&gt;So in my opinion, it is probably excellent if you are less than 50 years old. Over that, you&#x27;ll be better off with an efficient and cheaper product The product claims to be good on all types of skins, but it is not for all types of age.</li>
            <li> It works really good, but it&#x27;s just too expensive for the amount of liquid in it.</li>
            <li> Lavender cleanser is excellent.  I love the smell and it felt so wonderul.  Surprising.  I will be back.  In addition, i purchased two other items which is the best.  Wow.  Also, customer service is the best!  Excellent service!</li>
