            <li>Awesome stellar shine from day one through the day</li>
            <li>My nail polish now lasts more than a week without chipping!</li>
            <li>Shiny is also rather protective, too depending on what kind of occupation you have.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely</li>
            <li>I bought this after getting the best manicure in my life at a new salon.</li>
            <li>This is a product with a very strong odor though.  </li>
            <li>This top coat is AMAZING</li>
            <li>The Super Shiney Top Coat protects my polish from chipping, and adds a great (not blinding) layer of shine.</li>

            <li>I just LOVE using it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It turns out that it wasn&#x27;t the colored polish, but the glossy top coat that I had been using.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem a heckuva lot shinier than others, but then - how shiny can top coat get?</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use this in a room without people with sensitivity to smells.</li>
            <li>Love this topcoat.</li>
            <li>Have been using it on top of a nail strengthener for years .</li>

            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>its high gloss is great</li>
            <li>A must have for any lady or gent looking to have beautiful natural shiny nails.</li>
            <li>The top coat makes a GREAT difference that will make each application more memorable and glazing than the last!</li>
            <li>Love the super shine!</li>
            <li>Great alone for a clear manicure, too.</li>
            <li>it works as a top coat but doesn&#x27;t really protect any better than others.</li>
            <li>It dries quick enough for me &amp; it GLIDES on so beautifully &amp; evenly.</li>
            <li>Love it very fast shipping</li>
            <li>Love it, very shiny!  </li>
            <li>I always get compliments on my manicure, which looks professional thanks to this great polish.</li>
            <li>Nice clear clean look.</li>
            <li>and I could still see her bright red nails sparkling and glittering from quite a ways away!</li>
            <li>Very shiny top coat, as promised.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It IS super shiny.</li>
            <li>It got gummy quickly, as well.  </li>
            <li>so far, not super impressed and wouldn&#x27;t&#x27; pay that much again.</li>
            <li>There is a two-pack available even more reasonably priced, but this was my &amp;#34;test purchase&amp;#34;, so only got one as an &amp;#34;Add-On&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>(when I use sparkle/glitter, the super shine really makes it noticeable!).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Creative Nail Design also has other fine products that I use.</li>
            <li>It is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>It is a regular top coat.</li>
            <li>the smaller one is much more convenient  to lug to the nail salon.</li>
            <li>The only CND product I am still using is the &amp;#34;top coat&amp;#34;, that one works ok actually, but for Stickey and Shiney, save your money and look for something better.</li>
            <li>I actually need to buy more soon.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but with a few coats looked good</li>
            <li>I quickly abandoned by old rimmel too coat which sucked.</li>
            <li>Fast drying and leaves nails very shiney.</li>
            <li>I expected so much more from this product.  </li>
            <li>Included brush can grab too much of the polish.</li>
            <li>Finish is very glossy.</li>
            <li>Using the CND Super Shiney along with the CND Sticky Base Coat makes for the perfect pair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Nail time lasts about a little over a week most times.</li>
            <li>Its a great product easy to apply it&#x27;s a little bit expensive and is glossy  </li>
            <li>Looks like I put a new coat on every day.</li>
            <li>Way better than goopy thick seche vite, &amp; shinier.</li>
            <li>and I think it can help smooth out small mistakes in the coats below.</li>
            <li>It is offered in this smaller bottle as well as a huge round bottle, have both and</li>
            <li>and lately I&#x27;ve been considering switching because it&#x27;s been chipping very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I use mainly OPI polish and the combination of these three products makes for a long lasting manicure...</li>
            <li>The first time I put this one my self-manicure last three times as long and the shine does not wear down one bit.  </li>

            <li> If I wasn&#x27;t experimenting semi-professionally to compare different products for a future service and possible e-videos, I may not even be dealing with other coats!</li>
            <li> Have read a lot of reviews that say it takes forever to dry, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not fast dry.</li>
            <li> For some reason this topcoat hides any nail imperfections, such as white marks or small ridges...</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Going to try the Sticky Base Coat next time with this top coat.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s shinier than other, less expensive top coats.</li>
            <li> I would use Stickey as a base and Shiney as a top coat and my manicures lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Also, a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Extreme shine.</li>
            <li> Still not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am still searching for the top and base coat that would last for at least 5 days.</li>
            <li> I am convinced that they changes something on the formula, because it doesn&#x27;t work at all anymore, worst kind of money-wasting stuff now.</li>
            <li> usually around 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> However, you really need to get CND&#x27;s Sticky Base, too.</li>
            <li> So, if you are needing some serious shine, try this out for yourself and prepare to be impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical cuz I never heard of the brand</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to use with the Sticky Base Coat!</li>
            <li> use CND sticky base coat with it</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the CND sticky base coat.</li>

            <li> Awesome product, arrived very quickly and is one of the best nail products my wife buys. She goes through quite a bit of this stuff and always buys more.</li>
            <li> Lasting shine. I refuse to use anything else.</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting the best manicure in my life at a new salon. This stuff helps keep my manicure intact for a week. However, you really need to get CND&#x27;s Sticky Base, too.</li>
            <li> Fast drying and leaves nails very shiney. Creative Nail Design also has other fine products that I use. Their drying solution is good.</li>
            <li> its high gloss is great</li>
            <li> It is so pretty.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Very shiny top coat, as promised.</li>
            <li> Love the super shine! This is beautiful and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Its a great product easy to apply it&#x27;s a little bit expensive and is glossy  so I  like it .</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes my nail stand out. Looks like I put a new coat on every day. Works on any color.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical cuz I never heard of the brand but after I applied 2 coats of this, my manicures lasted until I wanted to take them off with no chipping and stayed oh so shiny! I seriously love this top coat. I quickly abandoned by old rimmel too coat which sucked.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this top coat. Have read a lot of reviews that say it takes forever to dry, but it doesn&#x27;t. It is a regular top coat. Not fast dry. But I don&#x27;t mind waiting. It dries quick enough for me &amp; it GLIDES on so beautifully &amp; evenly. I just LOVE using it. It IS super shiny. I will definitely buy again but probably in the bigger bottle. Way better than goopy thick seche vite, &amp; shinier. Great great product. Going to try the Sticky Base Coat next time with this top coat. A great buy!!!!</li>
            <li> Lasted 2-3 days, even polish on my toes chipped. I expected so much more from this product.  I am still searching for the top and base coat that would last for at least 5 days.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I swear by OPI nail polish and lately I&#x27;ve been considering switching because it&#x27;s been chipping very quickly.  It turns out that it wasn&#x27;t the colored polish, but the glossy top coat that I had been using.  It got gummy quickly, as well.  The first time I put this one my self-manicure last three times as long and the shine does not wear down one bit.  I like it a lot.  Also, a little bit goes a long way.  I dip the brush once for each hand.</li>
            <li> not as shiney as i was hopping for . but with a few coats looked good</li>
            <li> Included brush can grab too much of the polish. Otherwise, a long lasting product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem a heckuva lot shinier than others, but then - how shiny can top coat get? I like the CND line and am happy with this. There is a two-pack available even more reasonably priced, but this was my &amp;#34;test purchase&amp;#34;, so only got one as an &amp;#34;Add-On&amp;#34; item. Would I buy again? The jury&#x27;s still out... let&#x27;s see how it does to prevent chipping.</li>
            <li> It was okay. Still not worth the money.</li>
            <li> If I wasn&#x27;t experimenting semi-professionally to compare different products for a future service and possible e-videos, I may not even be dealing with other coats! This top coat is AMAZING and I get compliments all the time on how great my nail art looks! The shine has people asking if I had it done at a salon or if they are gel (when I use sparkle/glitter, the super shine really makes it noticeable!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Let me just say this: When doing nails for a friend at a local event, she got up and walked away and across the gym floor and I could still see her bright red nails sparkling and glittering from quite a ways away! The top coat makes a GREAT difference that will make each application more memorable and glazing than the last! So, if you are needing some serious shine, try this out for yourself and prepare to be impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Nail time lasts about a little over a week most times. Shiny is also rather protective, too depending on what kind of occupation you have.</li>
            <li> Love it, very shiny!  This is a product with a very strong odor though.  Make sure you use this in a room without people with sensitivity to smells.</li>
            <li> This top coat is the best I have bought! I does keep my nails shiny and it keeps them from chipping!</li>
            <li> Arrived leaky and too coagulated to use. Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is great!  The polish is so shiny and feels like they were done at the salon!</li>
            <li> Love it very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Using the CND Super Shiney along with the CND Sticky Base Coat makes for the perfect pair. I use mainly OPI polish and the combination of these three products makes for a long lasting manicure...usually around 2 weeks. The Super Shiney Top Coat protects my polish from chipping, and adds a great (not blinding) layer of shine. I always get compliments on my manicure, which looks professional thanks to this great polish. Would definitely recommend to use with the Sticky Base Coat!</li>
            <li> Love this topcoat. Have been using it on top of a nail strengthener for years . Nice clear clean look. Manicures last about one week if I am not doing a lot of house cleaning. It is offered in this smaller bottle as well as a huge round bottle, have both and the smaller one is much more convenient  to lug to the nail salon. For some reason this topcoat hides any nail imperfections, such as white marks or small ridges... A must have for any lady or gent looking to have beautiful natural shiny nails. Enjoy! ❤❤❤</li>
            <li> works as promised. this is only product I will ever use. love it &amp; recommend it. use CND sticky base coat with it</li>
            <li> CND used to have awesome Stickey and Shiney. I would use Stickey as a base and Shiney as a top coat and my manicures lasted a long time. Then they changed the product, it suddenly came in different bottles and I am convinced that they changes something on the formula, because it doesn&#x27;t work at all anymore, worst kind of money-wasting stuff now. The only CND product I am still using is the &amp;#34;top coat&amp;#34;, that one works ok actually, but for Stickey and Shiney, save your money and look for something better.</li>
            <li> gloss was shinning.  Polish stayed on longer than regular polishes</li>
            <li> Awesome stellar shine from day one through the day I take it off. I love ,love, love it! I definitely reordering.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever! I&#x27;ve used it for years. Great alone for a clear manicure, too. It goes on nicely and I think it can help smooth out small mistakes in the coats below.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes polish last forever.</li>
            <li> Extreme shine. I get lots of compliments! I actually need to buy more soon.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever had! It is soooo shiney!!! It makes acrylic nails look like gel nails with gel polish. Absolutely gorgeous!</li>
            <li> it works as a top coat but doesn&#x27;t really protect any better than others. it is shiny but i&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s shinier than other, less expensive top coats. so far, not super impressed and wouldn&#x27;t&#x27; pay that much again.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the CND sticky base coat. My nail polish now lasts more than a week without chipping! Finish is very glossy. Looks like a gel manicure! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The Best shine for your nails for the money.</li>
            <li> Amazing deals on great products. Thanks!</li>
            <li> this is an excellent high gloss top coat that really keeps your nails looking as if they had just been done !!!</li>
