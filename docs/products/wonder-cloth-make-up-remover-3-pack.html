            <li> I have a very old Wonder Cloth that was getting threadbare. Bought these to replace. These ones are not as soft and silky as my old one. They are kind of rough. They do a good job removing makeup, so I&#x27;ll keep them. But if you&#x27;re a user of the older Wonder Cloth, just be aware they&#x27;ve changed it and it&#x27;s not as silky as it used to be.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping however product does not work well. Would not re-order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years.  Cleans up all makeup and dirt without any chemicals or cleanser.  Truly a &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Wonder Cloths for at least 10 years and are great.  They get off your makeup and do exfoliate your skin.  The thing that is hard to get off is some mascaras (like waterproof! Rinse in water and the makeup comes out of cloth.  As long as they are around I will continue to use!  Love them!</li>
            <li> It cleans your face, but I don&#x27;t think it does better than any regular wash cloth. I didn&#x27;t notice any increase in softness or glow or anything, in fact I got a few more zits than normal so I went back to my regular wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I love these and have a couple I use every night.  I was pleased to find this deal on Amazon because it was like getting one free.  They launder beautifully and never get stinky like regular washcloths because they dry so quickly and rinse so thoroughly.  Advice: wash them before you use them for the first time to get the chemical smell from the packaging out...other than that, perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and I still have the first one I bought. If you wash them in hot water they will shrink and it does effect the texture of the cloth but they still work. Love them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m going to buy more and give them to my daughter and granddaughter for a little extra Christmas gift. ;)</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and love it !! Bought three and gave one to a friend. She loves it too. Great way to get rid of chemical makeup removers. Use just water or your best facial cleanser. Ponds cold cream if you really feel the need to use something or you apply heavy makeup. Hand wash to clean. Air dry.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, really works well as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love these, exfoilating and the makeup rinses right off...</li>
            <li> Love these cloths.  They remove make-up like a breeze and rinse out easily.</li>
            <li> They are great my whole family is using them  !!</li>
            <li> I use these and have for years.  More than ten!  I think they are gentler to my face than most washcloths.  Also, nothing gets out mascara stains and I don&#x27;t want them on my bathcloths.  So I use these and just don&#x27;t worry about the mascara darkening them.  They say they will remove makeukp without soap.  I would not try that.  I think that is why one woman commented negatively.  Bet she used them sans soap.  I am careful to rinse my cloth well and squeeze dry.  I have a short mini towwl rack on a couple of suction cups on my mirror that this fits on and dries overnight.  I use them for several days and then launder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much makeup and dirt this takes off.  No more expensive remover lotions for me, this wven takes off eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Great Face Cloth!  I have been using the Wonder Cloth for about 6 months now and I love it.  It cleans and exfoliates my skin, leaving it feeling wonderful.  I bought the 3 pack because it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Stucks and waste of money!</li>
            <li> This  product is worthless.  No better than a washcloth.  Tried by 3 females in the home and it only worked if you added soap.  Cheap imitation.</li>
            <li> This feels so soft on the face and cleans out the make up without using any more chemicals on face.  I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
