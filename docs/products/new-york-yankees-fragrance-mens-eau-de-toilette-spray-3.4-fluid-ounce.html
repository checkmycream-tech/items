            <li> I gave to my dad as a Christmas gift and he loves it.  He&#x27;s a big Yankees fan and was pleased with his gift.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Decent product light masculine fragrance with a touch of a flowery aroma. Great for Yankee fan that want a cool little keep sake after you are done smelling great! Would buy again</li>
