            <li>This is my GF&#x27;s favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Spells nice, but the scent lasts maybe 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>It has a class aromatic fragrance on its own.</li>
            <li>I am loving this perfume.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is a nice blend - top notes have a citrus scent and lower fruity tones.</li>
            <li>I wanted something flowery and this does smell really good although a bit too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>i know she is going to love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Thinking about buying some more</li>
            <li>I have never had so many compliments on a perfume.</li>
            <li>and I love to wear it even if I dont intend on leaving the house :)</li>
            <li>I wish I could smell the fragrance more; I apply more so it can be enjoyed through the day.</li>

            <li>Its a sweet and sexy smell that lasts all day!</li>
            <li>of my far most favorite perfumes ever!!</li>
            <li>, I was excited I love the smell of it, its very light &amp; sweet when I wear it all I can think of is a very light cotton candy scent.</li>
            <li>This is a special essence!  </li>
            <li>It is so refreshing and unique.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick despite the weather delay!</li>
            <li>the provider responsible good experience , impeccable product , I recommend it with my eyes closed , waiting for more credits to repurchase them</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m not to happy with this but.</li>
            <li>Good perfume, I love this scent does not last all day.</li>
            <li>perfunem original, lleno mis expectativas,</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much that I wanted to get another bottle right away.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet vanilla with flower tones.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a really bad scent.</li>
            <li>The seller was kind enough to send some samples and one of them was from Paris Hilton, which I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is the most beautiful, subtle sweet and fruity fragrance.</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, not too heavy or flowery, a nice light scent that does not give me a headache</li>
            <li>Was completely out of prior fragrance-This is my absolute favorite scent around!!!</li>
            <li>The seller was right on time and the product was well packaged.</li>
            <li>The deliver was right on time and the product was as specified in the web page.</li>
            <li>For only $2 more than what I had paid at a national drug store</li>
            <li>a light scent but not heavy</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch! ðŸ˜„</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have ordered it through Amazon and will do so again. :-)</li>
            <li>So glad to find it on Amazon at such a discounted price with no running around checking the stores.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the bonus lotion!</li>
            <li>It smelled very sweet but only lasted for a minute</li>
            <li>They responded promptly, but I still didn&#x27;t think that it was okay for me to have to wait so long and not hear anything from the company until I contacted them.</li>
            <li>I gave this to a friend of mine and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Very mellow floral scent.</li>
            <li>It was a gift and it was greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>thanks you</li>
            <li>but the few hours you you&#x27;ll feel fresh, and you will receive many compliments.</li>
            <li>The additional jasmine and heliotrope, combined with a very subtle musk create a warm, sweet, subtle, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>again only got a wif of sweet smell for a minute.</li>
            <li>regular body sprays smell better than this, last longer and are way cheaper.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you wear cotton candy perfume!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a new way for me to order cologne and purfume...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get all worn out and old.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but not good enough for me to order it again.</li>
            <li>en general todo perfecto</li>
            <li>It is very inviting and it plays well on the skin- not overpowering or sharp in any way.</li>
            <li>It reminds me just a little of the old Almay fragrance (which also was very sweet and subtle).</li>
            <li>This fragrance is subtle and sweet.</li>

            <li> This fragrance is subtle and sweet.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a 1.7oz bottle of the new Shakira</li>
            <li> I can still smell it after a long 16 hour day, the scent is the same at them end of the day as it was when I put it on in the morning.</li>
            <li> It took over 14 days for me to get my perfume, and in this day and age, that is waaaay too long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically buy \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; perfumes but this one is the exception.</li>
            <li> This has a slight candy smell to it</li>
            <li> I got it for less than I was paying for the 1oz.</li>
            <li> Not many perfumes</li>
            <li> Not sure if they change something in it or if this is just a replica</li>
            <li> Will never buy it again waste of money!</li>
            <li> Not a favorite</li>
            <li> of a late spring/summer fragrance or evening scent</li>
            <li> Not okay!!</li>
            <li> It actually smell like burned grass, really nasty.</li>
            <li> Una fragancia muy sutil y romantica de uso diario y casual ...</li>
            <li> but this one was really bad.</li>
            <li> I was embarrassed to give this to my sister because I knew she would be as disappointed as me.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago ever since I&#x27;ve been unable to find it!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe how terrible the smell was.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Good gift for friend!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, not too heavy or flowery, a nice light scent that does not give me a headache</li>
            <li> this item is great. just what i need for my christmas gift for my wifw. i know she is going to love this perfume. thank you amazon and perfumania!!!</li>
            <li> So my purchase came from perfumania, and it took FOREVER for me to get it! It took over 14 days for me to get my perfume, and in this day and age, that is waaaay too long. Not okay!! I didn&#x27;t even get an email from them saying there was an extended wait, or the tracking number, nothing! I had to contact them myself to find out what was going on! They responded promptly, but I still didn&#x27;t think that it was okay for me to have to wait so long and not hear anything from the company until I contacted them.</li>
            <li> I gave this to a friend of mine and she absolutely loves it. Thinking about buying some more</li>
            <li> This is the most beautiful, subtle sweet and fruity fragrance. If you like Britney Spears stuff or Shania, this is for you . It is sooo feminine you can&#x27;t stop smelling it!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is subtle and sweet. You can definitely pick out the cassis and berries with the vanilla. The additional jasmine and heliotrope, combined with a very subtle musk create a warm, sweet, subtle, pleasant fragrance. It is very inviting and it plays well on the skin- not overpowering or sharp in any way. It reminds me just a little of the old Almay fragrance (which also was very sweet and subtle). I don&#x27;t typically buy \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; perfumes but this one is the exception. Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Spells nice, but the scent lasts maybe 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast! Was completely out of prior fragrance-This is my absolute favorite scent around!!! Very mellow floral scent. You will NOT get a headache from this smell, it&#x27;s NOT overbearing!</li>
            <li> excellent perfume, very good quality. All in very good condition, so qualify with 5 stars. very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the perfume I bought by SHAKIRA!!!! Not many perfumes I like but this one is beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> If you like the Ed Hardy then you will LOVE this!!! Its a sweet and sexy smell that lasts all day! I have never had so many compliments on a perfume. This has a slight candy smell to it and I love to wear it even if I dont intend on leaving the house :)</li>
            <li> Fragrance is a nice blend - top notes have a citrus scent and lower fruity tones. I wish I could smell the fragrance more; I apply more so it can be enjoyed through the day.</li>
            <li> The seller was right on time and the product was well packaged. That being said, I got this perfume for my wife based upon the good reviews from others.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time any perfume goes well on my wife but this one was really bad. It actually smell like burned grass, really nasty. I can&#x27;t even describe how terrible the smell was. The seller was kind enough to send some samples and one of them was from Paris Hilton, which I strongly recommend. It has a class aromatic fragrance on its own. But this Shakira perfume, I will not recommend. They said that perfumes goes according to people chemistry of their skin, well this one didn&#x27;t react too well. But It may work on somebody&#x27;s else.</li>
            <li> I give this 4 stars. I wanted something flowery and this does smell really good although a bit too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling perfumes ever!. It was a gift and it was greatly appreciated. Way to go Shakira!</li>
            <li> I like this scent. It&#x27;s a sweet vanilla with flower tones. It&#x27;s very pleasant, but the scent fades quickly.</li>
            <li> This perfume is very pleasant, and having purchased it before, I knew what I was getting, and it was what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a 1.7oz bottle of the new Shakira and I liked it so much that I wanted to get another bottle right away.  On checking around on the internet, perfumeria had the most incredible price!  For only $2 more than what I had paid at a national drug store I got almost three times the amount of a scrumptious aroma.</li>
            <li> ME ENCANTO MIL GRACIAS EXECELENTISIMO</li>
            <li> I had this scent before (brought elsewhere though) and I loved it. When I used to wear it I could smell it all day. Not sure if they change something in it or if this is just a replica but overall I&#x27;m not to happy with this but.</li>
            <li> The deliver was right on time and the product was as specified in the web page. Excellent service and attention.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!! Feminine and floral, l</li>
            <li> the purchase and shipment were correct, I am very satisfied with the service. i am not complaints about it, thanks you</li>
            <li> Muy buen producto y llego en perfecto estado. Muchas gracias. Suerte y que sigan vendiendo mucho mas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saludos desde Venezuela</li>
            <li> Pleasant. I took a chance never smelling the fragrance prior to purchase.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my sister and I decided to try it before gift wrapping it. It smelled very sweet but only lasted for a minute then I sprayed it again a couple of hours later...again only got a wif of sweet smell for a minute. I was embarrassed to give this to my sister because I knew she would be as disappointed as me. Now it&#x27;s just sitting in my closest. I do not recommend it!! regular body sprays smell better than this, last longer and are way cheaper. Will never buy it again waste of money!</li>
            <li> excelente producto llego en el tiempo previsto</li>
            <li> Para los amantes de los toques suaves y primaverales, esta fragancia es la ideal para sentirte fresca y ligera. recomiendo a aquella mujer delicada y chic...</li>
            <li> perfunem original, lleno mis expectativas, personas puntuales en el envio, vino todo sellado, el perfectas condiciones. en general todo perfecto</li>
            <li> fragrance is floral and seductive&lt;br /&gt;not a light scent but not heavy either&lt;br /&gt;more of a late spring/summer fragrance or evening scent</li>

            <li> I am loving this perfume. I orderd it for my aunt and she loves it. I am planning on ordering some for myself.</li>
            <li> My favorite sent at a great price!  I got it for less than I was paying for the 1oz. size at a store. I ordered it because the two stores I was buying it in are no longer carrying it.  So glad to find it on Amazon at such a discounted price with no running around checking the stores.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume!!! It reminds me of a carnival with funnel cakes and cotton candy! This perfume is AMAZING!!! It lasts forever! I can still smell it after a long 16 hour day, the scent is the same at them end of the day as it was when I put it on in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t get all worn out and old. Shipping was quick despite the weather delay! The bottle is amazingly HUGE!!! Thank you so much for the bonus lotion! I will be back! SOON!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago ever since I&#x27;ve been unable to find it!! I was browsing Amazon and found it, I was excited I love the smell of it, its very light &amp; sweet when I wear it all I can think of is a very light cotton candy scent. I highly recommend it if you wear cotton candy perfume!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my far most favorite perfumes ever!!</li>
            <li> I love this one. I have been using it since its release.</li>
            <li> This is a special essence!  It is so refreshing and unique.  I love it!  I am going to get another one soon!</li>
            <li> Not a favorite but it&#x27;s not a really bad scent. It smells nice but not good enough for me to order it again.</li>
            <li> Good perfume, I love this scent does not last all day. but the few hours you you&#x27;ll feel fresh, and you will receive many compliments. Thank You</li>
            <li> This is a new way for me to order cologne and purfume... I liked this price and product was in excellent condition.</li>
