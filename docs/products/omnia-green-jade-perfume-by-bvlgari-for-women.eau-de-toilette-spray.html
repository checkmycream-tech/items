            <li>adore the original Omnia, but I don&#x27;t understand the place of this flanker in the Omnia line - it&#x27;s out of place.</li>
            <li>Friends of mine have even begun to wear this scent because the love it so much as well!</li>
            <li>Love the light and beautiful scent of Omnia Green Jade!</li>

            <li>This is the second occasion I buy this perfume, I feel very confident with their scent.</li>
            <li>I can live with re-applying. :)</li>
            <li>I wish I had not purchased 2 (due to the good price)</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Good enough as I expected :)</li>
            <li>Mysterious, very fragrant, and I will never use anything else !!  :)</li>
            <li>Omnia Green Jade Bulgari is one of my most favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>A real winner!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very refined and fresh, so you can use during day time as well.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Fell in love instantly!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>it was not expensive and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know how to rate since it was a gift that was requested- not a scent</li>
            <li>Wife says she really likes it.</li>
            <li>There are several on-line stores who offer it at a discount, but with Amazon we get no tax and free 2-day shipping through our Amazon Prime membership.</li>
            <li>Gentle aromas that dont slap people when passing by.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast</li>
            <li>I get a clean &amp; green top, and I clearly sense the pistachio and peony.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too heavy, it is a very fresh and clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I have bought my first one at a department store and can notice this one  was a bit more watery than usual and</li>
            <li>It is 100% the authentic Omnia Green Jade by Bulgari.</li>
            <li>I consider Omnia Green Jade my favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It smells clean, light, fresh, a little bit floral (LITTLE bit) and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new signature scent.</li>
            <li>when I used it the smell was less strong too.</li>
            <li>Enjoying it everyday!</li>
            <li>sillage is steady but discreet.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not active, but everybody will notice you are smelling great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I think it is old stock</li>
            <li>It serves either for everyday or special ocassions just as well.</li>
            <li>But for everyday use it might still be fine, just got to keep spraying regularly!</li>
            <li>I recently ran out and for the heck of it tried looking on Amazon to see if I could get it here, and was surprised to find it for $20.00 less than what I paid for my first bottle.  </li>

            <li> This is a clean,fresh fragrance and it stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Weak, fades fast, scent off.  </li>
            <li> Too bad Bulgari didn&#x27;t think enough of its customers who enjoy this frangrance to keep it in production.</li>
            <li> I do not believe it is the same green jade as in the department stores.</li>
            <li> I hate it &amp; to make it worse the company lists the perfume as hazardous, making it incapable of returning!</li>
            <li> Smells like it has been watered down.</li>
            <li> It is indeed watered down.</li>
            <li> I found it online for about half price and thought</li>
            <li> Has a slightly grassy, herbal smell.</li>
            <li> After it was used up we found that we paid LESS for it at Disney</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so sad that Bvlgari discontinued this particular one of Omnias...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s woody, green and floral, with slight musk and citrus in there somewhere as well.  </li>
            <li> Almost a hint of green tea.</li>
            <li> I used a heavy hand, and I thought it was stifling.</li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t spray this time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My object is to enter the room not storm troop it behind an overpowering, crowd leveling heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> scent not too sharp or unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The bottle wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the jasmine doesn&#x27;t sit well with me and this goes cloying, irritating even.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed to find that the company had discontinued it.</li>

            <li> I LOVE THIS PERFUME!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s so sad that Bvlgari discontinued this particular one of Omnias... I don&#x27;t like the rest.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a great gift.  The bottle is unique, and the fragrance is light and lovely.  I have purchased several bottles for gifts.  A real winner!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is a clean,fresh fragrance and it stays on for a long time. I just love it and hope they keep making it. It is great for the office and evening.</li>
            <li> I have worn this cologne for about 2 years and had bought it at a department store.  I found it online for about half price and thought wow. I do not believe it is the same green jade as in the department stores. Smells like it has been watered down. I will never order cologne online again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know how to rate since it was a gift that was requested- not a scent I personally like but she loves it. The packaging was as should be. The bottle wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> Shell loved it and it went back to Bulgaria with request for more which will soon be on it&#x27;s way.</li>
            <li> Tried this when I was at Epcot and so happy to have been able to get this a such a great price.</li>
            <li> I dont know when this was discontinued, but it did not smell like the description.  I think it is old stock or I just did not like the smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent ítem, thanks</li>
            <li> This is a lovely scent, my wife has ordered several bottles for her family and they all loved it&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a clean fresh scent well worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> Omnia Green Jade Bulgari is one of my most favorite fragrances. I was so disappointed to find that the company had discontinued it. I decided to go onto Amazon.com and see if anyone was still carrying it. I found it, and it is wonderful. It is 100% the authentic Omnia Green Jade by Bulgari. I will keep buying from this company until they have sold out. Too bad Bulgari didn&#x27;t think enough of its customers who enjoy this frangrance to keep it in production. However, great for me that I discovered a company that still carries it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new signature scent. I enjoy all of the Bvlgari scents but this one strikes the right chord. It&#x27;s a clean scent, not heavy on the florals, which suits me perfectly. Lots of compliments on this one.</li>
            <li> This is a light lovely fragrance for work or a night out.  I wear it often and get lots of complements on the scent.</li>
            <li> Wife says she really likes it. Has a slightly grassy, herbal smell. Almost a hint of green tea. While she likes it, she likes Amethyst better.</li>
            <li> This perfume is my mom&#x27;s favorite. I was looking for this perfume everywhere offline, and could not find it. Amazon has everything! :) My mom was very happy about it. It was a perfect gift for my mom&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li> I am always complimented on my fragrance when I wear this scent.  It&#x27;s woody, green and floral, with slight musk and citrus in there somewhere as well.  This fragrance lasts most of the day, by bedtime it&#x27;s mostly gone.  It&#x27;s an easy fragrance to wear all seasons.  It&#x27;s not overpowering, but definitely present.  This is one of my daily go-to fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is a nice light fragrance that maintains its scent throughout the day.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed many compliments followed by requests for name of scent.  I consider Omnia Green Jade my favorite fragrance.  My object is to enter the room not storm troop it behind an overpowering, crowd leveling heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> I will order this perfume again and again.  Its lasts all day and I always get compliments..my boyfriend cant keep his lips off me. :)</li>
            <li> My mom brought me a tiny one from her last trip to Europe, and I fell for it right away.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very refined and fresh, so you can use during day time as well.&lt;br /&gt;Its sillage is steady but discreet.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not active, but everybody will notice you are smelling great.&lt;br /&gt;A forever keeper.</li>
            <li> Love this! One of the things that make me happy!  I am enjoying it very much and going to keep using it!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and have gotten many compliments on the scent.  It isn&#x27;t too heavy, it is a very fresh and clean scent.  I will purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Totally excellent. This product is very good and incredibly beautifull. On time and with a perfect package. I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Weak, fades fast, scent off.  This doesn&#x27;t smell like my last purchase from a mall retailer.  I wish I had not purchased 2 (due to the good price) You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Incredible aroma. This is the second occasion I buy this perfume, I feel very confident with their scent. I like the price and I recommend it to anyone who likes good fragrances</li>
            <li> I sampled this at Macy&#x27;s when it was launched. I used a heavy hand, and I thought it was stifling. Duh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a couple years later, I dabbed rather than sprayed. I get a clean &amp; green top, and I clearly sense the pistachio and peony. Unfortunately the jasmine doesn&#x27;t sit well with me and this goes cloying, irritating even. At least I didn&#x27;t spray this time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore the original Omnia, but I don&#x27;t understand the place of this flanker in the Omnia line - it&#x27;s out of place. In fact, I think none of the flankers in the line are true to the original, although I also adore Omnia Crystalline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually love Alberto Morillas&#x27;s creations. This isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> I recently ran out and for the heck of it tried looking on Amazon to see if I could get it here, and was surprised to find it for $20.00 less than what I paid for my first bottle.  It&#x27;s actually $79 at Sephora.com so for this price ($40) it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s all-time favorite scent. We discovered it in the Italy exibit of EPCOT&#x27;s World Showcase from a spray sample. Fell in love instantly! (In fact, I have the men&#x27;s version!). After it was used up we found that we paid LESS for it at Disney then we could get it at local stores like Macy&#x27;s. There are several on-line stores who offer it at a discount, but with Amazon we get no tax and free 2-day shipping through our Amazon Prime membership. This has been our fourth refill.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a good buy!</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle design and pleasing smell. It serves either for everyday or special ocassions just as well. Gentle aromas that dont slap people when passing by.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality 100% authentic</li>
            <li> Good enough as I expected :)</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!!  I get compliments everytime I wear it.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this whenever I wear it.  It smells clean, light, fresh, a little bit floral (LITTLE bit) and simply beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly it doesn&#x27;t last through the day and Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry the perfume.  I can live with re-applying. :)</li>
            <li> Nice Cologne. the size and price is way better than getting it from a mall or somewhere else. scent not too sharp or unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> This scent, by far, has become one of my favorite scents! I absolutely love this scent! The smell is intoxicating and I always receive compliments when I am wearing this scent. Friends of mine have even begun to wear this scent because the love it so much as well!</li>
            <li> I hate it &amp; to make it worse the company lists the perfume as hazardous, making it incapable of returning! That&#x27;s Low</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite perfume.  Love all Bvlgari perfumes.  Mysterious, very fragrant, and I will never use anything else !!  :)</li>
            <li> The product is as expected&lt;br /&gt;This item is OK, I like it&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everybody&lt;br /&gt;This Item is good quality</li>
            <li> It is good Bvlgari fragrance.</li>
            <li> Lovely musky scent! I look all over the net for the best price when I run out of this perfume and buy it.</li>
            <li> My friend bought this and I loved the aroma so I ordered it here and I love this perfume it smells great. The delivery was fast so I liked that to I am happy I got it it was not expensive and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> It is indeed watered down. I have bought my first one at a department store and can notice this one  was a bit more watery than usual and when I used it the smell was less strong too. But for everyday use it might still be fine, just got to keep spraying regularly!</li>
            <li> Es un excelente producto, lo recomiendo mucho y es exactamente como lo descrito por el vendedor, tambien el empaque fue adecuado y llegó en buenas condiciones, sin daños ni problemas</li>
            <li> Always love the fresh clean scent of this perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for getting it to me so fast!  Enjoying it everyday!</li>
            <li> Love the light and beautiful scent of Omnia Green Jade! Very feminine and great for summer! Love the price as well. :)</li>
            <li> Smells nice but nothing special</li>
            <li> The bottle and box it came in were in great condition upon arrival. How I would expect it to appear from the store. I love the earthy, fresh smell of this perfume so much!</li>
