    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with it!</li>
            <li>I ordered this to cut my 2-year-old son&#x27;s hair and it has served its purpose perfectly.</li>
            <li>Perfect for kids</li>
            <li>Great find!</li>
            <li>For the price, it was a great value.</li>
            <li>Great cape for children.</li>
            <li>This is great.  </li>
            <li>The quality is good -</li>
            <li>This is a good buy for all DIY at home hair trimmers and for shampooing the children.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved it</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law owns a salon and really liked this cape.</li>
            <li>Item is great quality and the fun</li>
            <li>and they love it too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have this product...</li>
            <li>adorable cape perfect for little ones hair cuts.</li>
            <li>Returned easily though.</li>
            <li>Material is fairly cheap, but it&#x27;s held up for us.</li>
            <li>Cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this cape because I hoped it would keep the hair from itching my son&#x27;s neck and shoulders and, thus, prevent him from squirming all over the place during his haircut.  </li>
            <li>The velcro holds the cape shut just fine, the size is right for any age of child.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the material is so cheap that it ripped when I took it off him and shook it -- the FIRST time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Only if he would hold still more!</li>
            <li>now haircuts are fun again.  </li>
            <li>We like this cape,it is colorful and works well for keeping hair off the child.  </li>
            <li>My kids love it and it seems to be durable as far as I can tell</li>
            <li>Going to try to tape it together even though I have a feeling that the tape will itch my son&#x27;s neck, defeating the purpose of this cape in the first place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The velcro fastening system around the neck is perfect because obviously not all necks are the same size, and this allows a tight but not too-tight fit around any neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(Another, more minor con:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for occasional hair cuts, which is what I needed it for.</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried it would be thin &amp; not that great.  </li>
            <li>Clean-up after haircuts is much easier now too.</li>
            <li>This product was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Much easier than wrapping a towel around his neck and trying to get it to stay.</li>
            <li>The plastic is thicker than I was expecting for the price, and the fun pictures keep my 2 year olds busy while I am busy with their hair.</li>
            <li>We love this little haircut cape that I ordered for home haircuts for my son.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and design and no more complaints from hair clippings.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because I do the trimming in the house for my young son and daughter.  </li>
            <li>I might just buy an adult size and add velcro to make the neck smaller.</li>
            <li>A little hair still got around his neck, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much you can do about that.  </li>
            <li>Too bad, my kids would have loved the print.</li>

            <li> This works pretty well for cutting my 4.5 year old son&#x27;s hair.  </li>

            <li> I cut my sons hair at home &amp; he was fine up until a few months ago &amp; then started getting mad when the hair would get on him.  So I bought this &amp;  now haircuts are fun again.  He loves the &#x27;cape&#x27; and will actually sit still now when I give him a hair cut (he isn&#x27;t quite 3 yet).  The quality is good - I was a bit worried it would be thin &amp; not that great.  Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for occasional hair cuts, which is what I needed it for. Material is fairly cheap, but it&#x27;s held up for us.</li>
            <li> The cape is described as being made of nylon but it isn&#x27;t.  We specifically ordered this cape because we did not want vinyl or plastic since they don&#x27;t hold up well so we returned it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to cut my 2-year-old son&#x27;s hair and it has served its purpose perfectly. The velcro fastening system around the neck is perfect because obviously not all necks are the same size, and this allows a tight but not too-tight fit around any neck. For the price, it was a great value.</li>
            <li> Great cape for children. My sister-in-law owns a salon and really liked this cape. She found it to be just-right.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well for cutting my 4.5 year old son&#x27;s hair.  I wish the neck hole was in the middle, though.  It could use some length in the back.  He still gets hair on him.  I might just buy an adult size and add velcro to make the neck smaller.</li>
            <li> We love this little haircut cape that I ordered for home haircuts for my son.  He always hated the pieces of hair falling down on him, and haircuts used to be quite a chore.  The velcro holds the cape shut just fine, the size is right for any age of child.  Clean-up after haircuts is much easier now too.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this cape because I hoped it would keep the hair from itching my son&#x27;s neck and shoulders and, thus, prevent him from squirming all over the place during his haircut.  It *did* do that, so I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the material is so cheap that it ripped when I took it off him and shook it -- the FIRST time I used it.  There&#x27;s now a 3-inch rip along the white collar at the neck.  It&#x27;s technically  used now, so I don&#x27;t think I can return it.  Going to try to tape it together even though I have a feeling that the tape will itch my son&#x27;s neck, defeating the purpose of this cape in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Another, more minor con: The cape is on the short side, but I think that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s meant to be used during shampooing.  It&#x27;s referred to as a \\&quot;shampoo cape.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve never known a salon to change capes between shampooing and cutting, though, so I think this is a cop-out on the part of the manufacturer.)</li>
            <li> I trim my son&#x27;s hair.  I clip a towel around him but he is always complaining about the hair.  This is great.  Just like at the barber.  Only if he would hold still more!</li>
            <li> We like this cape,it is colorful and works well for keeping hair off the child.  Perfect for kids and they love it too.</li>
            <li> Flimsy -- torn as soon as I took it out of the package. Returned easily though. Too bad, my kids would have loved the print.</li>
            <li> Item is great quality and the fun Angry Bird like pattern managed to get my 3 year old to consider sitting to have his hair cut!</li>

            <li> My daughter loved it - she&#x27;s currently in Beauty School and is needing all the supplies required once she graduates.</li>
            <li> This product was better than I expected. The plastic is thicker than I was expecting for the price, and the fun pictures keep my 2 year olds busy while I am busy with their hair. Great find!</li>
            <li> My son was much happier while I was cutting his hair since he wasn&#x27;t getting all itchy.

            <li> Ripped as I got it out of the package! Cheap and flimsy. Save your $.</li>
