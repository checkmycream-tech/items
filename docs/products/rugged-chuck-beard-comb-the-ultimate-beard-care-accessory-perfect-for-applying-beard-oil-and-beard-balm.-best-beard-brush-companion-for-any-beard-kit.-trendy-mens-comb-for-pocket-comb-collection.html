            <li>Great beard comb, smooth and sturdy.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a great comb at a great price and real quality.this thing</li>
            <li>The laser-etched (assumed) logo is a nice touch as well.</li>
            <li>Combined with the aroma from a nice beard oil, the experience almost becomes spa-like.</li>
            <li>, I can report that the wood is developing a nice luster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d forgotten how nice it was until I went to my barber</li>
            <li>and I wonder if it&#x27;s as effective on the under layers of my beard with the way it combs.  </li>
            <li>Love it feels so good</li>
            <li>My beard thanks rugged chuck for this wonderful massage tool.</li>
            <li>Curve shape of comb fits nicely in hand.</li>
            <li>Nice size that fits in my hand and pocket.</li>
            <li>It feels and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I really liked this comb - but,  It broke after 4 days.</li>
            <li>I love love love it!</li>
            <li>helps me keep my beard looking good and clean</li>
            <li>This comb is exactly as advertised - a sturdy, quality wood comb that feels great on the skin and beard.</li>
            <li>If you have a larger shirt pocket or suitable compartment in your manbag or toiletry kit, then I suppose it would make for an excellent travel comb.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t snag or build up static.</li>
            <li>Nice comb, feels light weight and manly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always in the market for better beard combs and brushes.</li>
            <li>So when I saw The Rugged Chuck, I decided ok, I&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
            <li>I love this comb.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice finish to it that lets it go smoothly through my beard and hair.</li>
            <li>It could fit in your pocket if you want to take it with you, which is always nice.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the crappy plastic comb I had been using before.  </li>
            <li>eh, its okay.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the smell of the wood.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel more manly just by using it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>Looks great and very functional.</li>
            <li>Stylish and can&#x27;t wait to show it off..</li>
            <li>Love the comb.</li>
            <li>This is a substantial object that is perfectly functional and with care, should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>More of a comb to keep in a breast pocket or bag.</li>
            <li>This comb is not as long as this pic makes it look but still very good quality!</li>
            <li>It has a nice finish and its super sturdy.</li>
            <li>I am  still in the process of growing my beard out, but this comb works great so far.</li>
            <li>The size and shape makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a problem with the teeth or body of the comb snapping too easily</li>
            <li>That aside, it doesn&#x27;t scratch or pull like any plastic comb I&#x27;ve used, feels great on the hair, face, and scalp and does pretty much exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li>really diggn the embedded rugged chuck logo.. very pleased</li>
            <li>Very interesting comb, sturdy build with a pretty cool design.  </li>
            <li>this comb works keeps my beard looking smooth and managed just like I wanted</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have that cheap store bought plastic coating.</li>
            <li>I was picky with the combs that were available on Amazon, and decided on this one.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, smooth wood.</li>
            <li>Smooth through the beard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nicely made wood comb, but I really don&#x27;t think it should be called a beard comb.  </li>
            <li>I immediately noticed how well made the comb is, light</li>
            <li>It feels good in your hand, being pleasantly thick without feeling bulbous, and it feels great running it through your whiskers.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Certainly to be a unique conversation provoking comb.</li>
            <li>After opening I could tell right away that this was a finely made comb.</li>
            <li>And I feel cool using it.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality wooden comb.</li>
            <li>Other than those two, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>The wood is especially nice since new plastic combs will have sharp edges on the ends from the comb molds.</li>
            <li>Also I have posted a video with a quick review of it including my beard kit heres the link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;d4JNVM6UzYw</li>
            <li>; my wife actually borrowed it and now wants her own :)</li>
            <li>This comb is also excellent when used for light fluffing of the beard; enough to add some volume, but not so much fluff that you look like you are wearing</li>
            <li>Great quality, heavy duty comb.</li>
            <li>It is solid and I like the big top portion which gives me a good grip.  </li>
            <li>no cutting in to my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would love to see a smaller version available.</li>
            <li>a gift to my friend with short hair, she liked it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny; would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li>The Rugged Chuck folks got it right.</li>
            <li>Somehow this comb just feels right going through my beard.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box</li>
            <li>The comb arrived in excellent condition in the elegantly printed box: no major scratches, dings or otherwise broken</li>
            <li>Very well made, nice wooden comb.</li>
            <li>The comb is solid wood and very smooth.  </li>
            <li>The rugged chuck wooden comb is more than I expected, it is my first beard comb, the static free way</li>
            <li>My beard isn&#x27;t as full as I&#x27;d like yet, but I definitely see this becoming my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; comb once its much longer (although I&#x27;m still using it now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what my beard was looking for.</li>
            <li>The first weekend I used it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this comb for a week but love it.</li>
            <li>This combs has made my beard look straighter and overall better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably my fault for not looking better at the comb&#x27;s dimensions, but I only looked at the reviews and the &amp;#34;Beard Comb&amp;#34; title, and I made a mistake.</li>
            <li>Like any comb not made of a flexible plastic or metal, it probably shouldn&#x27;t go in a pants pocket as it will more than likely get damaged.</li>
            <li>This was a bit larger than I expected, but a great beard comb.</li>
            <li>mine broke pretty easily in my pocket and it did pull my beard hairs out when i brushed with it.</li>
            <li>Love this rugged chuck comb works nice and not to bad at all on my face way better than plastic</li>
            <li>First of all, this is a very well made item.  </li>
            <li>Just as described - made of real wood, solid and thick construction, perfect for men&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely a worthwhile purchase for any medium to long length beard/mustache wielders!</li>
            <li>so I say thank you to the makers of such a fine piece of man grooming technology.</li>
            <li>The comb is very high quality.</li>
            <li>The teeth have a large space which is good for those with a thick beard.  </li>
            <li>The teeth are too far apart IMHO and the comb does not perform nearly as well in my beard as my cheap plastic switchblade comb.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Lee Trevino, for the correction!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes for a very sturdy and rather ergonomic hand-feel.</li>
            <li>it seems to be made of a very dense wood.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this comb!</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and beefy comb</li>
            <li>I expected the box to be more sturdy, but box is a box</li>
            <li>I got this because my switchblade comb catches my beard hairs frequently, which hurts, but this strikes me more as a regular hair comb than a &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Many so-called &amp;#34;beard combs&amp;#34; are very fine toothed, which for a thick beard is not necessarily what you want.</li>
            <li>I have a thick beard and it combs thru so easily and doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs like a cheap plastic comb does.  </li>
            <li>No static or catching like the plastic ones.</li>
            <li>It is so much better in terms of construction and quality than the average plastic comb.</li>
            <li>The most manly spa possible without actual sawdust and pine</li>
            <li>I mainly use it on my beard to help soften it and distribute the beard oil I use, but sometimes I will run it through my hair.</li>
            <li>Super fragile.</li>
            <li>High Quality.</li>
            <li>high quality&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>After a while i got used to it, and it works just as well as the plastic combs, but way more comfortable, and way less harsh.</li>
            <li>However, I would think of this first and foremost as your morning home-base comb; the comb that is going to start your&amp;#34;good beard day&amp;#34; off right every morning, with little maintenance needed throughout the remainder of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get my hair tangled as much as your standard fine tooth black plastic comb.</li>
            <li>It came in a simple but elegant black box.</li>
            <li>To start it arrived a day early.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The relatively soft and semi-rounded tips of the teeth do indeed make this comb feel like a massage for the cheeks, neck and chin.</li>
            <li>It is seamless</li>
            <li>My wife gets really envious of my wooden comb.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>This comb flares a bit at the shaft, with a nice thick contour along the edge opposite the teeth.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no other way to say it.</li>
            <li>The teeth are spaced far enough apart so that it glides easily through my lengthy mane, yet they are not spaced too far apart, eliminating multiple successive passes that might otherwise be needed to tame a single area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend getting one of these for general use, even if you don&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
            <li>However if your rocking a full, thick beard</li>
            <li>Moreover, the fact that this comb is wood rather than plastic certainly helps to minimize static build-up and the associated stray hairs and crazy fliers, which can ultimately reduce the amount of beard balm necessary to control these strays.</li>

            <li> So when I saw The Rugged Chuck, I decided ok, I&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this comb.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice finish to it that lets it go smoothly through my beard and hair.</li>
            <li> It could fit in your pocket if you want to take it with you, which is always nice.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than the crappy plastic comb I had been using before.  </li>
            <li> eh, its okay.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the smell of the wood.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel more manly just by using it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> Looks great and very functional.</li>
            <li> Stylish and can&#x27;t wait to show it off..</li>
            <li> Love the comb.</li>
            <li> This is a substantial object that is perfectly functional and with care, should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> More of a comb to keep in a breast pocket or bag.</li>
            <li> This comb is not as long as this pic makes it look but still very good quality!</li>
            <li> It has a nice finish and its super sturdy.</li>
            <li> I am  still in the process of growing my beard out, but this comb works great so far.</li>
            <li> The size and shape makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a problem with the teeth or body of the comb snapping too easily</li>
            <li> That aside, it doesn&#x27;t scratch or pull like any plastic comb I&#x27;ve used, feels great on the hair, face, and scalp and does pretty much exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li> really diggn the embedded rugged chuck logo.. very pleased</li>
            <li> Very interesting comb, sturdy build with a pretty cool design.  </li>
            <li> this comb works keeps my beard looking smooth and managed just like I wanted</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have that cheap store bought plastic coating.</li>
            <li> I was picky with the combs that were available on Amazon, and decided on this one.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, smooth wood.</li>
            <li> Smooth through the beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nicely made wood comb, but I really don&#x27;t think it should be called a beard comb.  </li>
            <li> I immediately noticed how well made the comb is, light</li>
            <li> It feels good in your hand, being pleasantly thick without feeling bulbous, and it feels great running it through your whiskers.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Certainly to be a unique conversation provoking comb.</li>
            <li> After opening I could tell right away that this was a finely made comb.</li>
            <li> And I feel cool using it.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality wooden comb.</li>
            <li> Other than those two, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> The wood is especially nice since new plastic combs will have sharp edges on the ends from the comb molds.</li>
            <li> Also I have posted a video with a quick review of it including my beard kit heres the link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;d4JNVM6UzYw</li>
            <li> ; my wife actually borrowed it and now wants her own :)</li>
            <li> This comb is also excellent when used for light fluffing of the beard; enough to add some volume, but not so much fluff that you look like you are wearing</li>
            <li> Great quality, heavy duty comb.</li>
            <li> It is solid and I like the big top portion which gives me a good grip.  </li>
            <li> no cutting in to my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would love to see a smaller version available.</li>
            <li> a gift to my friend with short hair, she liked it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny; would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> The Rugged Chuck folks got it right.</li>
            <li> Somehow this comb just feels right going through my beard.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box</li>
            <li> The comb arrived in excellent condition in the elegantly printed box: no major scratches, dings or otherwise broken</li>
            <li> Very well made, nice wooden comb.</li>
            <li> The comb is solid wood and very smooth.  </li>
            <li> The rugged chuck wooden comb is more than I expected, it is my first beard comb, the static free way</li>
            <li> My beard isn&#x27;t as full as I&#x27;d like yet, but I definitely see this becoming my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; comb once its much longer (although I&#x27;m still using it now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what my beard was looking for.</li>
            <li> The first weekend I used it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this comb for a week but love it.</li>
            <li> This combs has made my beard look straighter and overall better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably my fault for not looking better at the comb&#x27;s dimensions, but I only looked at the reviews and the &amp;#34;Beard Comb&amp;#34; title, and I made a mistake.</li>
            <li> Like any comb not made of a flexible plastic or metal, it probably shouldn&#x27;t go in a pants pocket as it will more than likely get damaged.</li>
            <li> This was a bit larger than I expected, but a great beard comb.</li>
            <li> mine broke pretty easily in my pocket and it did pull my beard hairs out when i brushed with it.</li>
            <li> Love this rugged chuck comb works nice and not to bad at all on my face way better than plastic</li>
            <li> First of all, this is a very well made item.  </li>
            <li> Just as described - made of real wood, solid and thick construction, perfect for men&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely a worthwhile purchase for any medium to long length beard/mustache wielders!</li>
            <li> so I say thank you to the makers of such a fine piece of man grooming technology.</li>
            <li> The comb is very high quality.</li>
            <li> The teeth have a large space which is good for those with a thick beard.  </li>
            <li> The teeth are too far apart IMHO and the comb does not perform nearly as well in my beard as my cheap plastic switchblade comb.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Lee Trevino, for the correction!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes for a very sturdy and rather ergonomic hand-feel.</li>
            <li> it seems to be made of a very dense wood.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this comb!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and beefy comb</li>
            <li> I expected the box to be more sturdy, but box is a box</li>
            <li> I got this because my switchblade comb catches my beard hairs frequently, which hurts, but this strikes me more as a regular hair comb than a &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Many so-called &amp;#34;beard combs&amp;#34; are very fine toothed, which for a thick beard is not necessarily what you want.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and it combs thru so easily and doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs like a cheap plastic comb does.  </li>
            <li> No static or catching like the plastic ones.</li>
            <li> It is so much better in terms of construction and quality than the average plastic comb.</li>
            <li> The most manly spa possible without actual sawdust and pine</li>
            <li> I mainly use it on my beard to help soften it and distribute the beard oil I use, but sometimes I will run it through my hair.</li>
            <li> Super fragile.</li>
            <li> High Quality.</li>
            <li> high quality&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> After a while i got used to it, and it works just as well as the plastic combs, but way more comfortable, and way less harsh.</li>
            <li> However, I would think of this first and foremost as your morning home-base comb; the comb that is going to start your&amp;#34;good beard day&amp;#34; off right every morning, with little maintenance needed throughout the remainder of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get my hair tangled as much as your standard fine tooth black plastic comb.</li>
            <li> It came in a simple but elegant black box.</li>
            <li> To start it arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The relatively soft and semi-rounded tips of the teeth do indeed make this comb feel like a massage for the cheeks, neck and chin.</li>
            <li> It is seamless</li>
            <li> My wife gets really envious of my wooden comb.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> This comb flares a bit at the shaft, with a nice thick contour along the edge opposite the teeth.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no other way to say it.</li>
            <li> The teeth are spaced far enough apart so that it glides easily through my lengthy mane, yet they are not spaced too far apart, eliminating multiple successive passes that might otherwise be needed to tame a single area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend getting one of these for general use, even if you don&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
            <li> However if your rocking a full, thick beard</li>
            <li> Moreover, the fact that this comb is wood rather than plastic certainly helps to minimize static build-up and the associated stray hairs and crazy fliers, which can ultimately reduce the amount of beard balm necessary to control these strays.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not just a flat wooden comb.</li>
            <li> Slightly larger than expected.</li>
            <li> buy on a long time</li>
            <li> thick wood and very durable.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick and curly beard and this works right through it.  </li>
            <li> There are very few things I enjoy running across my face more than this bad boy!</li>
            <li> comb stays in the bathroom at home beside my other related beard accoutrements.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this as a pants-pocket comb because of its size and relative fragility vs. a plastic or other indestructible comb.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that due to the width and thickness of the teeth, it doesn&#x27;t do well with shorter hair so unless you&#x27;ve got a decent length mustache going on</li>
            <li> I like the look of this wooden comb over the plastic ones or the gimmicky &amp;#34;switchblade&amp;#34; types.</li>
            <li> Everything that&#x27;s expected from ,</li>
            <li> so it lacks the annoying inner ridge which most plastic combs have,</li>
            <li> Upgrading to 5 stars from 4 due to build quality and durability</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty useless there.</li>
            <li> At first it felt weird, because I&#x27;m used to plastic combs, and it didn&#x27;t feel like it was grabbing the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never actually enjoyed owning a comb, but there&#x27;s something about a wooden comb for your beard.</li>
            <li> My complaint would be it&#x27;s about twice as big as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> The only negatives were it was a little too thick</li>
            <li> and since there is no seam you&#x27;ll find yourself causing less damage and losing fewer hairs.</li>
            <li> It was in my jacket and snapped in half.  </li>
            <li> something to talk about I have dropped it several times on the hard floor and cement and no scratches or chips!</li>
            <li> and he wished it was just a little longer.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son he uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this comb after applying beard oil every morning for a few weeks already</li>
            <li> ** 05/13 - I&#x27;ve had this product for quite a few months</li>
            <li> No static when combing.</li>
            <li> No static or snagging (within reason)</li>
            <li> No static.</li>
            <li> Thus far I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this beard comb to anyone with a serious beard.</li>
            <li> , tough comb teeth</li>
            <li> your beard comes in thin, sparse or patchy, then I&#x27;d like to suggest the Merkur 34C HD safety razor.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re in the market for a wood beard comb, you cannot go wrong for the price and quality with Rugged Chuck.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with this comb.</li>
            <li> compared this comb to my switchblade comb after applying beard oil this morning and sadly this one just didn&#x27;t do the trick.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this bad boy</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice item, good quality product, just as described</li>
            <li> Bought for my son he uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> Great beard comb. Doesn&#x27;t snag or build up static. The size and shape makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love love love it! Is what some hipster would say. But it&#x27;s a great comb at a great price and real quality.this thing helps me keep my beard looking good and clean</li>
            <li> 5 stars. To start it arrived a day early. It came in a simple but elegant black box. After opening I could tell right away that this was a finely made comb. It has a nice finish and its super sturdy. Great for the manliest of beards or for your grandma&#x27;s mustache. Would definitely buy this as a gift for anyone.</li>
            <li> The rugged chuck wooden comb is more than I expected, it is my first beard comb, the static free way this comb works keeps my beard looking smooth and managed just like I wanted so I say thank you to the makers of such a fine piece of man grooming technology.</li>
            <li> Nice comb, feels light weight and manly. Doesn&#x27;t have that cheap store bought plastic coating. Look forward to years of use.</li>
            <li> Very good quality comb, slides through your beard don&#x27;t pull hairs out like plastic combs.&lt;br /&gt;the quality it something to talk about I have dropped it several times on the hard floor and cement and no scratches or chips!</li>
            <li> Best beard comb I have ever bought, it did not disappoint and I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the combs for my beard!  No static or catching like the plastic ones.</li>
            <li> The only comb I need for my beard! A+++</li>
            <li> (But Grizzly Adams did have a beard! Thanks, Lee Trevino, for the correction!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not just a flat wooden comb. No, sir! This comb flares a bit at the shaft, with a nice thick contour along the edge opposite the teeth. This makes for a very sturdy and rather ergonomic hand-feel. The laser-etched (assumed) logo is a nice touch as well. The comb arrived in excellent condition in the elegantly printed box: no major scratches, dings or otherwise broken teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In its application as a beard-grooming tool, this comb performs admirably. The teeth are spaced far enough apart so that it glides easily through my lengthy mane, yet they are not spaced too far apart, eliminating multiple successive passes that might otherwise be needed to tame a single area. Moreover, the fact that this comb is wood rather than plastic certainly helps to minimize static build-up and the associated stray hairs and crazy fliers, which can ultimately reduce the amount of beard balm necessary to control these strays. This comb is also excellent when used for light fluffing of the beard; enough to add some volume, but not so much fluff that you look like you are wearing an Elizabethan collar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The relatively soft and semi-rounded tips of the teeth do indeed make this comb feel like a massage for the cheeks, neck and chin. Combined with the aroma from a nice beard oil, the experience almost becomes spa-like. The most manly spa possible without actual sawdust and pine needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb stays in the bathroom at home beside my other related beard accoutrements. I would not recommend this as a pants-pocket comb because of its size and relative fragility vs. a plastic or other indestructible comb. If you have a larger shirt pocket or suitable compartment in your manbag or toiletry kit, then I suppose it would make for an excellent travel comb. However, I would think of this first and foremost as your morning home-base comb; the comb that is going to start your&amp;#34;good beard day&amp;#34; off right every morning, with little maintenance needed throughout the remainder of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this comb after applying beard oil every morning for a few weeks already, I can report that the wood is developing a nice luster. I can only imagine what months or even years of use will produce in terms of oil absorption and aging. Who knows, maybe this comb will become a family heirloom!</li>
            <li> This comb is exactly as advertised - a sturdy, quality wood comb that feels great on the skin and beard. My beard isn&#x27;t as full as I&#x27;d like yet, but I definitely see this becoming my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; comb once its much longer (although I&#x27;m still using it now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market for a wood beard comb, you cannot go wrong for the price and quality with Rugged Chuck.</li>
            <li> **Update** 05/13 - I&#x27;ve had this product for quite a few months and it&#x27;s still in perfect condition. No visible wear and no snagging still. I&#x27;d forgotten how nice it was until I went to my barber and he used a regular plastic comb and it snagged on EVERYTHING. Definitely a worthwhile purchase for any medium to long length beard/mustache wielders! Upgrading to 5 stars from 4 due to build quality and durability**  Very interesting comb, sturdy build with a pretty cool design.  I don&#x27;t see a problem with the teeth or body of the comb snapping too easily it seems to be made of a very dense wood. It does a very good job on thick/long hair. My only complaint is that due to the width and thickness of the teeth, it doesn&#x27;t do well with shorter hair so unless you&#x27;ve got a decent length mustache going on, it&#x27;s pretty useless there. That and I wonder if it&#x27;s as effective on the under layers of my beard with the way it combs.  That aside, it doesn&#x27;t scratch or pull like any plastic comb I&#x27;ve used, feels great on the hair, face, and scalp and does pretty much exactly what it advertises. I&#x27;d definitely recommend getting one of these for general use, even if you don&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in the market for better beard combs and brushes. So when I saw The Rugged Chuck, I decided ok, I&#x27;ll give it a try. Thus far I have not been disappointed. The Rugged Chuck beard comb just feels good. There&#x27;s no other way to say it. It feels good in your hand, being pleasantly thick without feeling bulbous, and it feels great running it through your whiskers. It is seamless so it lacks the annoying inner ridge which most plastic combs have, and since there is no seam you&#x27;ll find yourself causing less damage and losing fewer hairs. Many so-called &amp;#34;beard combs&amp;#34; are very fine toothed, which for a thick beard is not necessarily what you want. This one is not, and it moves through coarse beard hair with ease getting the tangles, but not breaking or pulling the hair. The Rugged Chuck folks got it right. I might have found the last beard comb I&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li> I love this comb. I bought an extra one and gave to my Dad on Fathers Day. He loves it as well. He had never heard of such comb. And now he has to get oil to use for the wood to absorb into it.</li>
            <li> This comb is not as long as this pic makes it look but still very good quality!</li>
            <li> I have been using this comb for a short time now.  I like the feel of it in my hand.  It is solid and I like the big top portion which gives me a good grip.  The teeth have a large space which is good for those with a thick beard.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend carrying it in your back pocket as it might break, but I use it at the house so this is not an issue for me.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it feels so good no cutting in to my face</li>
            <li> Awesome brush. I don&#x27;t get my hair tangled as much as your standard fine tooth black plastic comb. The wood is especially nice since new plastic combs will have sharp edges on the ends from the comb molds. Solid comb, would buy again but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate on buying this comb ......buy it you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> Exactly what my beard was looking for. My beard thanks rugged chuck for this wonderful massage tool.</li>
            <li> Great Handle and smooth brush</li>
            <li> At first it felt weird, because I&#x27;m used to plastic combs, and it didn&#x27;t feel like it was grabbing the hair. After a while i got used to it, and it works just as well as the plastic combs, but way more comfortable, and way less harsh. And I feel cool using it. My wife gets really envious of my wooden comb.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality wooden comb. It is solid and doesn&#x27;t bend. It also has a nice finish to it that lets it go smoothly through my beard and hair. It could fit in your pocket if you want to take it with you, which is always nice. I like the look of this wooden comb over the plastic ones or the gimmicky &amp;#34;switchblade&amp;#34; types. I was picky with the combs that were available on Amazon, and decided on this one. I am thoroughly happy with my decision.</li>
            <li> Great comb! Sturdy, smooth wood. No static when combing. Curve shape of comb fits nicely in hand. Definitely satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would love to see a smaller version available.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this bad boy</li>
            <li> I am  still in the process of growing my beard out, but this comb works great so far. No tugging or pulling it&#x27;s just nice.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this comb.</li>
            <li> Who knew a comb could be so manly?  I have a very thick and curly beard and this works right through it.  Beard maintenance is no joke and neither is this comb.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this to see what the fuss was all about. The first weekend I used it I thought I just had a couple &amp;#34;good beard&amp;#34; days. However it seems to be a constant thing. Every morning I get up, rub in some Grave Before Shave Bay Rum oil and pull the comb through. It&#x27;s now my morning ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your beard comes in thin, sparse or patchy, then I&#x27;d like to suggest the Merkur 34C HD safety razor. It&#x27;s a great buy for the quality... Lol. However if your rocking a full, thick beard then you need this comb to keep it under control!

            <li> I was a bit sceptikal of all the glowing reviews but I just received my comb 3 days ago and I love it.  Somehow this comb just feels right going through my beard.  It&#x27;s much better than the crappy plastic comb I had been using before.  It feels great on your face and leaves your beard looking good.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> High Quality. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully for my beard! I&#x27;ve never actually enjoyed owning a comb, but there&#x27;s something about a wooden comb for your beard. No static or snagging (within reason); my wife actually borrowed it and now wants her own :)</li>
            <li> Very well made, nice wooden comb. Slightly larger than expected.</li>
            <li> eh, its okay. mine broke pretty easily in my pocket and it did pull my beard hairs out when i brushed with it.</li>
            <li> Every day is a good beard day with this comb. Helps me become the majestic man I was born to be.</li>
            <li> Great comb! No hair pulling or name calling here. Plus they find a homeless kitten to hug on your behalf.</li>
            <li> Everything that&#x27;s expected from , high quality&lt;br /&gt;Best buy on a long time</li>
            <li> Quality made product.</li>
            <li> The comb is very high quality. Right out of the box I enjoyed the smell of the wood. After about a week of use I can say that I will never go back to my plastic comb again.</li>
            <li> There are very few things I enjoy running across my face more than this bad boy!</li>
            <li> The comb looks good, and is well made.  It was a gift for my bearded husband, and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this comb!  I have a thick beard and it combs thru so easily and doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs like a cheap plastic comb does.  I highly recommend this comb!</li>
            <li> First of all, this is a very well made item.  I like that it&#x27;s made of wood, and it&#x27;s durable enough to travel etc.  That&#x27;s why I bought it.  My complaint would be it&#x27;s about twice as big as I was expecting.  I thought beard and mustache combs were smaller than hair combs.  Not this one, it might be bigger.  It&#x27;s probably great for guys who enter beard competitions, but it doesn&#x27;t work well for shorter beards.</li>
            <li> Love this beard comb, works great for spreading beard oil. Makes me feel more manly just by using it.</li>
            <li> Husband loves the comb. The only negatives were it was a little too thick and he wished it was just a little longer. Other than those two, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and beefy comb, tough comb teeth it can work equally well for your head hair also. Rugged Chuck seems like an up and coming company so keep up with some of their products in the future, I know I&#x27;am. Also I have posted a video with a quick review of it including my beard kit heres the link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;d4JNVM6UzYw</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this comb for a week but love it. I was using a plastic comb before and didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference going to a comb made of wood, but it does! This combs has made my beard look straighter and overall better. Pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> Good, quality, product. Smooth through the beard. No static. Nice size that fits in my hand and pocket. Feels solid.</li>
            <li> Its a beard comb. It comb&#x27;s beards. I&#x27;m actually using it as I type.</li>
            <li> My Rugged Chuck is awesome. Best beard comb I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Just as described - made of real wood, solid and thick construction, perfect for men&#x27;s hair. I expected the box to be more sturdy, but box is a box and it&#x27;s the comb itself that counts. Love the engraving of Rugged Chuck!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my special Manfriend and he loves it!!! He couldn&#x27;t wait to tell his buddies how greAt my gift was! He uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best combs I&#x27;ve ever owned. It feels and smells nice. It works great for mustaches and beards</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nicely made wood comb, but I really don&#x27;t think it should be called a beard comb.  The teeth are too far apart IMHO and the comb does not perform nearly as well in my beard as my cheap plastic switchblade comb.  I got this because my switchblade comb catches my beard hairs frequently, which hurts, but this strikes me more as a regular hair comb than a &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared this comb to my switchblade comb after applying beard oil this morning and sadly this one just didn&#x27;t do the trick.  It&#x27;s probably my fault for not looking better at the comb&#x27;s dimensions, but I only looked at the reviews and the &amp;#34;Beard Comb&amp;#34; title, and I made a mistake. I hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great quality comb. Something that will last forever.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Does not pull hair.</li>
            <li> a gift to my friend with short hair, she liked it.</li>
            <li> Great quality, heavy duty comb.</li>
            <li> Very nice comb. Build is solid. Love the craftsmanship. I look forward to showing it off. Certainly to be a unique conversation provoking comb.</li>

            <li> Best comb for beards I have found</li>
            <li> Love this rugged chuck comb works nice and not to bad at all on my face way better than plastic</li>
            <li> Bought for boyfriends birthday and he loves it! His beard is thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li> This comb rocks! I mainly use it on my beard to help soften it and distribute the beard oil I use, but sometimes I will run it through my hair. It is so much better in terms of construction and quality than the average plastic comb. Worth every penny; would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great beard comb, smooth and sturdy. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Damn awesome comb!! Love it!! Stylish and can&#x27;t wait to show it off.. really diggn the embedded rugged chuck logo.. very pleased</li>
            <li> Damn good comb, my beard loves it. doesn&#x27;t snag or pull hairs, fits great in my hand. thick wood and very durable.</li>
            <li> This is the nicest wooden comb I have ever seen/used.  The comb is solid wood and very smooth.  I am sure that it will be perfect for winter use.</li>
            <li> Very good comb. The tooth width is perfect. Very excellent!</li>
            <li> The description says it all...&#x27;Rugged Chuck&#x27;....just a big durable comb!</li>
            <li> Good comb, does what it says.</li>
            <li> Love the comb. Best thing I have purchased</li>
            <li> I really liked this comb - but,  It broke after 4 days. It was in my jacket and snapped in half.  Super fragile.</li>
            <li> This was a bit larger than I expected, but a great beard comb.</li>
            <li> Beautifully crafted product. Excellent value. This is a substantial object that is perfectly functional and with care, should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Great comb I use it on my beard multiple times throughout the day. I would recommend this beard comb to anyone with a serious beard.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and seems to glide thru my beard!</li>
            <li> Works great, absolutely love it. &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed how well made the comb is, light but it feels sturdy. Like any comb not made of a flexible plastic or metal, it probably shouldn&#x27;t go in a pants pocket as it will more than likely get damaged. More of a comb to keep in a breast pocket or bag. I have only had it for about a week, so I don&#x27;t know yet how it will hold up to the beard oils or regular use. So I will update this review as needed. Happy with the beard tamer.</li>
