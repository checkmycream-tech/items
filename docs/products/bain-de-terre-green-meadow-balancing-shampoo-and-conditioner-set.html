            <li>Great products, fast shipping and great products.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair very clean and smells amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this more than once already.</li>
            <li>Well, much to my surprise, this product is not as great as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love yhis shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>This seems a lot more watery than what I was getting from my hair dresser.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have used these products for years and love them.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Needs to be packaged more securely.</li>
            <li>Light scent is refreshing and not over powering.</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves your hair soft and healthy</li>
            <li>downside is when it arrived, the wrapping was filled with the liquid.</li>
            <li>It is okay and very gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, especially for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>Very upset-only one of mine came with a pump top.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean and fresh w/o a lot of perfumey scent.</li>
            <li>Conditioner is super watery and came in with a cracked pump.</li>
            <li>Both shampoo and conditioner smell really fresh.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that my hair improved for a hot second but remained dry to the end of the bottles and many times my hair would tangle after conditioning for 5+ minutes every time I washed it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The photo posted was deceiving though because I did not receive the pump bottles and the bottles size was not as described, it was smaller; so I am 100% satisfied with the shampoo and conditioner because I have been using it for years and will not replace it, but the seller must not provide photos and descriptions that do not match what they send.</li>
            <li>I chose this Bain de Terre because it was \\&quot;balancing\\&quot; and had many scientific terms when explaining how the product has such a positive effect on the hair.</li>
            <li>It literally feels like water in the palm of my hand and most of it is a victim to gravity before it can even reach my head!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>The shampoo cleans really well without drying.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The conditioner feels very runny; not thick and creamy.</li>
            <li>I ordered this particular shampoo set because it is pictured with the pump.</li>
            <li>I knew this is what cause my breakouts because it started right when I bought this combo, and I took it out of my routine and started once again and had the same issue.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>The biggest reason I do not like this however is that it made me completely break out, all over my forehead and my back.</li>
            <li>I was SO excited to get this product in, since I had previously tried the color preserving Bain de Terre (yellow bottles) from a friend and it seemed to help the few times I used it.</li>

            <li> Others said its watery, the shampoo was a little bit watery but shook it around for awhile now its the right texture the conditioner is still a bit watery but for a 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; lady with hair width past the middle of my back all I need is 2 squirts of shampoo &amp; 3 squirts of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> My hair is so long and SO dry.</li>
            <li> The conditioner moisturizes my colored hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Got tired of trying to get it local</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it is not too harsh.</li>
            <li> It slips straight out of my hand, and falls as waste to the bottom of my shower! :(</li>
            <li> This works well on my medium thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t as thick as the Green Tea from Bain de Terre I purchased in the salon and the very thin conditioner is also missing that signature iridescent sheen from the aragon oil.</li>
            <li> My biggest issue is the texture of the conditioner -- SO THIN.</li>
            <li> I have had a difficult time finding this item until I ordered them on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed and decided to switch to ISO Color Preserve.</li>

Well, the help was also short-lived with the balancing series. I can honestly say that my hair improved for a hot second but remained dry to the end of the bottles and many times my hair would tangle after conditioning for 5+ minutes every time I washed it. Extremely disappointed and decided to switch to ISO Color Preserve.</li>
            <li> Used years ago.  Current salon does notcarry it.  Was happy to find it&lt;br /&gt;Clean shiny hair.  Good fragrance.  Does not leave hair oily.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Leaves your hair very clean and smells amazing</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t as thick as the Green Tea from Bain de Terre I purchased in the salon and the very thin conditioner is also missing that signature iridescent sheen from the aragon oil. I don&#x27;t know what to think...</li>
            <li> My stylist had me start using these products a while back so when I ran out I ordered them on line. It&#x27;s a good product, especially for color treated hair. I would recomment it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this particular shampoo set because it is pictured with the pump. The shampoo I received did not have the pump.</li>
            <li> like the product, been using it for years.Got tired of trying to get it local and they were always out.</li>
            <li> I love yhis shampoo and conditioner. It works great for my oily/dry combo hair. I use it every day. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. I use it everyday and it is not too harsh. My two sons use it also and it smells good!&lt;br /&gt;Your hair keeps the smell of the shampoo for awhile.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and price was great. Leaves hair clean and fresh w/o a lot of perfumey scent.</li>
            <li> This seems a lot more watery than what I was getting from my hair dresser.  It is okay and very gentle.</li>
            <li> I do not like this shampoo and conditioner. The conditioner feels very runny; not thick and creamy. The biggest reason I do not like this however is that it made me completely break out, all over my forehead and my back. I knew this is what cause my breakouts because it started right when I bought this combo, and I took it out of my routine and started once again and had the same issue. Hopefully no one else experiences that!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner. I have had a difficult time finding this item until I ordered them on amazon.  Keep up the good work</li>
            <li> Very upset-only one of mine came with a pump top. Where it states both do!!!</li>
