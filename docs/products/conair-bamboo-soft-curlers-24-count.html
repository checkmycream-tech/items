            <li>I am really impressed with theses rollers.  </li>
            <li>Everyone at work thought I&#x27;d cut my hair and said that it was gorgeous!  </li>
            <li>By twisting the hair before wrapping you can get a really beautiful spiral curl.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>My curls are tigh in the morning, but by the time I get to work, they look great, somewhat 1940&#x27;s Hollywood Style.</li>
            <li>These work great to create long-lasting waves.  </li>
            <li>they were great</li>
            <li>Not as great as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>My hair was adorable!!</li>
            <li>AND I LOOK FABULOUS!!!</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>The most magnificent curls, one girl could ask for.</li>
            <li>Then i went to bed and slept great, work up to gorgeous curls all over my head.  </li>
            <li>These are one of my favorite spontaneous purchases to date!!</li>
            <li>These are so easy to use, and my curls come out perfectly every time.</li>
            <li>good thing about them is the bendable wires that are embedded in the foam, and that the fabric has texture so your hair doesn&#x27;t slip</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying for months to find a good way to roll my pin-straight hair ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for two months now, and although the curls are just as good, the rollers are taking a beating.</li>
            <li>Great product, looking forward to more experimenting.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>but now that I have, I just love them!</li>
            <li>the curls were just so unnatural and amusing  </li>
            <li>They are a modern version of rag curlers and work great!  </li>
            <li>Now that I have, if used correctly, as I&#x27;ll explain below, I can honestly say these are amazing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can still use the curlers, but they&#x27;re not made as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Nice option for folks with my type of hair.</li>
            <li>I love them, they are a great purchase, eco friendly, easy and comfortable to sleep in, easy to have in, and they work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I use Rusk Wired as a styling product after I shower, so that plus the curlers keep my hair soft and perfect even during rainy days in Seattle.    </li>
            <li>They are so soft and great!  </li>
            <li>These soft curlers are wonderful!</li>
            <li>Soft bendy and wonderful to sleep in,</li>
            <li>Make sure to wrap your hair nicely because your results depend on it.</li>
            <li>Now the top part of my hair looks nice and curly like the rest.  </li>
            <li>You can sleep very comfortably with these curlers.</li>
            <li>With just a bit of product, they curl very nicely (although I do look a bit Shirley Templish when I first take them out).  </li>
            <li>And they lasted the rest of the day looking totally fabulous!  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried many ways to curl my hair with it  </li>
            <li>This gave me the perfect waves that last all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using these, but I might end up buying more durable rollers when these need replacing.</li>
            <li>I just make sure her hair is damp and start rolling in sections.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Perfect curly hair without any pain or extra</li>
            <li>If you use many you&#x27;ll get a lot of curl.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with how my hair turned out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten more skilled at rolling up the hair and securing it.</li>
            <li>I use more curlers to create a more even cushion on my head</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure to sleep on my biggest, fluffiest pillow to help.in&#x27;t</li>

            <li>The more you use, the curlier your hair will be.</li>
            <li>LOVE THESE CURLERS.</li>
            <li>why, but i am glad i bought some when i did.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for having great hair without all the damage or time normally associated with great hair:)</li>
            <li>highly recommend these for having great hair without all the damage or time normally associated with great hair:)se</li>
            <li>they also create beautiful natural looking curls and waves.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use just 1 box of 12 rollers just fine.</li>
            <li>is that I was able to sleep on them fine with no poking or digging into my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my thing) is that I was able to sleep on them fine with no poking or digging into my scalp.  </li>
            <li>HONEY, WAS I RIGHT!!  </li>
            <li>Putting them in is easy-</li>
            <li>The Bamboo Curlers are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy as that.</li>
            <li>They are easy to work with</li>
            <li>The curlers were easy to manage, and with the curl cream, the ends were easy to roll onto the bamboo fabric.  </li>
            <li>Fairly easy to sleep on</li>
            <li>Blame the thickness and length, but I could have easily used two packs.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>To be fair, I should have ordered 2 packs, used a night-time cap to help hold everything in place and it would have been wise to put some mousse or product in my wet hair so that the curl would hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bottom line, these curlers are SUPER EASY TO USE, they&#x27;re a GREAT PRICE, they leave your hair SUPER CUTE AND BOUNCY, and they&#x27;re SOFT (which makes it a bit more tolerable to sleep with them).  </li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t damage your hair or require any hair product; that said, if you want to use hair product, that is fine.  </li>
            <li>I assumed the drying alone would create a curl that was fine.</li>
            <li>hair comes out super curly or wavy depending on how many bamboo curlers I use.</li>
            <li>The curls are super cute...</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and these gave me nice soft curls and volume.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for something to give me curls that is comfortable and does not use heat or product.</li>
            <li>I had great curly hair the next morning.</li>
            <li>i get fantastic curls.</li>
            <li>USE THESE ON DAMP HAIR, COMFORTABLE TO SLEEP IN.  </li>
            <li>The package says to use a setting cream/lotion; however I used a cheap spray-on conditioner, for a lighter look and feel.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait until they&#x27;re available to purchase again.</li>
            <li>My daughter said that they are comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li>But you can feel them and put them back on..other than that, great curlers.  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re also so comfortable.      </li>
            <li>Sleeping in them was quite comfortable and none fell out in the night.  </li>
            <li>Use a light mousse before rolling it up to keep the curl longer.</li>
            <li>Use a light mousse before rolling it up to keep the curl longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them to accentuate my already curly hair, and I find they work best with some mousse in first, then wait til the hair is nearly dry, them twist them in.</li>
            <li>The best part is it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like hot rollers and blow dryers.</li>
            <li>and the next morning I had amazing curly hair!</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time getting ready in the morning, I sleep in these puppies and they are the most comfortable curlers I&#x27;ve EVER found.  </li>
            <li>The quality could be a bit better, but overall gives a nice curl with comfort and ease.</li>
            <li>It all depends on how many you use as to how much curl you will get.</li>
            <li>i unraveled them pretty easily</li>
            <li>but I end up with really tight curls that kind of look like a 1940&#x27;s style hairdo (which my husband liked, but I didn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li>These are great soft curlers, easy to use, and I can actually sleep in them.  </li>
            <li>No hard plastic things digging into your head, its fantastic!  </li>
            <li>If you are careful about how you roll them (cork screw, and make sure to include the very ends), I&#x27;m sure you will love them, too.</li>
            <li>you can sleep in this, and less heat damage &#x3D; more healthy hair!</li>
            <li>They are SUPER quick&amp;easy to use and very comfortable to sleep in (even my 3 year old niece thinks so).  </li>
            <li>A great way to get the curls to set... is to go out and buy one of those hair-towels that are small and light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to sleep with them and it gives my hair the much needed break from hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>and the curls really held!!</li>
            <li>I love Conairs Bamboo Soft Curlers.  </li>
            <li>i even had some nice curl / body the second day after using these.</li>
            <li>for $12, definitely worth trying out.</li>
            <li>Results were curly and fun.  </li>
            <li>I love the natural aspect of bamboo eco-friendly curlers</li>
            <li>It takes longer than using an iron but definitely worth it because your not damaging your hair.</li>
            <li>and I love that they are made with natural products.</li>
            <li>I love the soft, tossled look of the \\&quot;moviestar curl\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy to curly hair which can be a pain because it is often more wavy underneath than on top and the top tends to get sort of frizzy and straggly looking while the bottom turns into ringlets.  </li>
            <li>i LOVE these soft curlers.</li>
            <li>I tried these curlers and it took me a couple of times to get it right</li>
            <li>They are soft and comfortable, especially compared to rags, and they keep your hair healthy since you&#x27;re not applying any heat!</li>
            <li>I rolled my almost dry hair, putting a curl cream (Avon) on the ends, slept on them comfortably overnight, and got up the next morning with the most beautiful blonde curly afro you&#x27;ve ever seen!  </li>
            <li>The easy way around that is to start wrapping a few inches up from the end of the hair length, then wrap the end around the part of the hair already wound up, then, catching the ends under the rest of the hair to hold in place, continue to roll up toward the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these curlers because I detest hot roller sets and am not crazy about standing in front of a mirror curling my hair for 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>They are easy to roll and soft to lay on.</li>
            <li>Do the same with these, take your time, and curl all in the same general direction, don&#x27;t worry about doing it perfectly though.  </li>
            <li>then some, super for me because my hair is totally flat and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl from a curling iron for more than a few hours, even if I had the good fortune of having hours in the morning to do my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are a great curlers if your hair is not too long, short to medium length, or if you just want to put some curl on your ends if your hair is longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After several uses, I have discovered that the wire inside the covering (which is nothing more than a pipe cleaner with some sponge over it) pokes through the covering.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used them was the day I received them.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments at work the next day....</li>
            <li>Before these, I had never used anything but hot rollers or curling irons.  </li>
            <li>Really pretty results.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have recommended it to several people</li>
            <li>These soft curlers were comfortable during sleep.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li>wear these curlers to sleep and they create pretty curls.  </li>
            <li>To prevent them from falling out, be sure to wrap the two ends of the curler in the SAME direction, both inwards or outwards.  </li>
            <li>To prevent them from falling out, be sure to wrap the two ends of the curler in the SAME direction, both inwards or outwards.  </li>
            <li>and these didn&#x27;t even on the first day,</li>
            <li>If it ends up being too many for you, you can always return them or keep them as a replacement for your others when they finally break.</li>
            <li>first setback</li>
            <li>I put three rollers on top of my head, one at each side and one at the top/ back.  </li>
            <li>good tip is to let your hair air-dry a bit before rolling it up or even take a blowdryer to it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>A good tip is to let your hair air-dry a bit before rolling it up or even take a blowdryer to it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use very many, it&#x27;ll curl well with just a few.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;ve given this product 4 starts instead of 5 is because the very first time I used them the inner wire poked out of one of the curlers and a few wires have begun poking out ever since so these aren&#x27;t the best quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used pretty much everything to style my hair over the years.</li>
            <li>Some things work well for me (hot rollers, straightening iron) and some things don&#x27;t (those rubbery hot stick things, classic foam rollers).</li>
            <li>but there is still a slight halo of stray hairs that want to do their own thing.</li>
            <li>They produced nice tight curls (my hair is shoulder length, medium weight, wavy).  </li>
            <li>One package is definitely enough if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>The wire does tend to poke out the end at times, but I just gently push it back in and it seems to be fine.  </li>
            <li>I only left them in for about 2-3 hours since I was impatient and the curls came out wonderful and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>When you remove them, do so gently and slip them out of the curl rather than pull, that will maintain the curl.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these, as they don&#x27;t damage your hair, either!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the curls to hold but much to my surprise</li>
            <li>I have long,fine,delicate hair and the Avon ones got very tangled in my hair and made the curls much to frizzy.</li>
            <li>That whole \\&quot;twist-and-tie\\&quot; thing?</li>
            <li>Either in a ponytail or half-up so that it won&#x27;t matter so much if the curls look erratic or uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i highly recommend these rollers, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>I would definitely test them out before you use them for an important event, because you can end up looking like Diana Ross.</li>
            <li>I have very long, very straight hair, and these give me a nice bouncy curl that lasts, when left in all night.</li>
            <li>My hair takes a curl very well so my main problem was too much curl.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy, but these curlers made it extremely frizzy and crispy for days.</li>
            <li>use only a few and you&#x27;ll get nice soft waves, They are easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can definitely see me using these as my hair gets longer and on special occasions.</li>
            <li>anyway, I tried these rollers by putting the top half of my hair in them.  </li>
            <li>One package could be enough for most heads, but two works well for me (with a couple left over).</li>
            <li>One big plus (and it is big because as I said, sleeping in most curlers ain&#x27;t my thing)</li>
            <li>Her curls are very pretty after taking them out the next morning.   </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The curls are more s-shaped, similar to the type of curls you get when you curl your hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>They create nice soft curls, but the ends can be too curly (fuzzy looking) if wrapped very tightly.  </li>
            <li>I bought two packages, since my hair is very thick, and that turned out to be a good thing.</li>
            <li>I slept in them, with a small/buttoned head-towel on, and they were soft and comfy; your hair will be all ready to go in the morning.</li>
            <li>as an fyi, i have 4b natural hair that i blow-dry/ + flat-iron straight from time to time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these curlers for many months now and waited to post a review until I had used them a few times.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these on a whim just to try something new with my hair.</li>
            <li>If you want a new look, try them...</li>
            <li>I had to deep condition my hair to get back the smooth texture.</li>
            <li>I might consider purchasing more but in the future I will have a friend help me put them in carefully, maybe pin some in place and wrap them all in something to keep them from coming out in my sleep.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, well made and there are enough of them to curl long hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like a huge mess of waves and curls like it normally does.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to sleep in and the curls last a really long time.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and straight (bra length and straight as a board - think Marcia Brady)).  </li>
            <li>my hair doesn&#x27;t curl very well normally, but when i sleep wiht these overnight on 2nd day hair</li>
            <li>Yes, down here in the South, we STILL love big hair, so I ordered these soft curlers to sleep in, thinking I would get the curls I wanted--AND</li>
            <li>These curlers are very easy to use (and I&#x27;m not good at fixing hair)</li>
            <li>and they are so soft they won&#x27;t bother you to sleep on.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve been playing with using 2-3 rollers on each section and not going too far up on the crown, for a looser look.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my 10 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>The curls stay the whole day without the use of any products such as hair spray.</li>
            <li>I had already tried the Avon Soft Curlers and did not like them at all.</li>
            <li>They are basically a soft material with a wire (like pipe cleaner) inside them that you roll your hair onto .</li>
            <li>This foam insert is much much much much longer and bigger!  </li>
            <li>To give my hair a much needed break from the heat of styling tools I bought a 12pack of these things because others claimed you could sleep in them and remove them the following morning to have</li>
            <li>All wrapped in soft bamboo fabric.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how well these things work.</li>
            <li>The hair wrapped up around the curlers first is covered by more wet hair wrapped around it so it won&#x27;t always dry completely if the hair is soaking wet to begin with.</li>
            <li>The hair wrapped up around the curlers first is covered by more wet hair wrapped around it so it won&#x27;t always dry completely if the hair is soaking wet to begin with.</li>
            <li>When I took the curlers out, my hair sprung back into the exact same position it was in when the curlers were in.</li>
            <li>just make sure your ends are slick (either with water or fully brushed out)</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments and the waves last for at least a day.  </li>
            <li>hair is a loud, natural red.</li>
            <li>You curl it carefully to all come out a certain way.  </li>
            <li>I will also allow time in the morning to use an iron for touch-ups if needed, placement of hairspray and just styling in general.</li>
            <li>I have straight shoulder length hair and am clumsy with hot rollers and curling irons.  </li>
            <li>I started playing with doing the whole head on barely wet hair.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft enough to sleep in, they don&#x27;t leave dents in my curls, and they don&#x27;t damage my chemically-relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>I waited until my hair was barely damp and put the curlers in.</li>
            <li>mousse.&lt;br /&gt;i retried the above without the product and it still came out within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;i have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>You can poke the wire back in and sew up the hole, so they aren&#x27;t ruined completely, but of course you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about doing that when you buy a product.</li>
            <li>things are basically the soft, foam cylindrical rollers you remember from the 90&#x27;s (usually light pink or green) with a heavy-duty garbage tie through the middle.</li>
            <li>; this only happened to me once, and it was when I literally wrapped up my soaking wet hair and went straight to bed.  </li>
            <li>There are some other reviews from girls with straight hair that had similar results.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty thin straight hair</li>

            <li> Everyone at work thought I&#x27;d cut my hair and said that it was gorgeous!  </li>

            <li> Beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> My curls are tigh in the morning, but by the time I get to work, they look great, somewhat 1940&#x27;s Hollywood Style.</li>
            <li> These work great to create long-lasting waves.  </li>
            <li> they were great</li>
            <li> Not as great as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> My hair was adorable!!</li>
            <li> AND I LOOK FABULOUS!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> The most magnificent curls, one girl could ask for.</li>
            <li> Then i went to bed and slept great, work up to gorgeous curls all over my head.  </li>
            <li> These are one of my favorite spontaneous purchases to date!!</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use, and my curls come out perfectly every time.</li>
            <li> good thing about them is the bendable wires that are embedded in the foam, and that the fabric has texture so your hair doesn&#x27;t slip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying for months to find a good way to roll my pin-straight hair ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for two months now, and although the curls are just as good, the rollers are taking a beating.</li>
            <li> Great product, looking forward to more experimenting.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> but now that I have, I just love them!</li>
            <li> the curls were just so unnatural and amusing  </li>
            <li> They are a modern version of rag curlers and work great!  </li>
            <li> Now that I have, if used correctly, as I&#x27;ll explain below, I can honestly say these are amazing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can still use the curlers, but they&#x27;re not made as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Nice option for folks with my type of hair.</li>
            <li> I love them, they are a great purchase, eco friendly, easy and comfortable to sleep in, easy to have in, and they work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> I use Rusk Wired as a styling product after I shower, so that plus the curlers keep my hair soft and perfect even during rainy days in Seattle.    </li>
            <li> They are so soft and great!  </li>
            <li> These soft curlers are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Soft bendy and wonderful to sleep in,</li>
            <li> Make sure to wrap your hair nicely because your results depend on it.</li>
            <li> Now the top part of my hair looks nice and curly like the rest.  </li>
            <li> You can sleep very comfortably with these curlers.</li>
            <li> With just a bit of product, they curl very nicely (although I do look a bit Shirley Templish when I first take them out).  </li>
            <li> And they lasted the rest of the day looking totally fabulous!  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried many ways to curl my hair with it  </li>
            <li> This gave me the perfect waves that last all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using these, but I might end up buying more durable rollers when these need replacing.</li>
            <li> I just make sure her hair is damp and start rolling in sections.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> Perfect curly hair without any pain or extra</li>
            <li> If you use many you&#x27;ll get a lot of curl.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with how my hair turned out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten more skilled at rolling up the hair and securing it.</li>
            <li> I use more curlers to create a more even cushion on my head</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure to sleep on my biggest, fluffiest pillow to help.in&#x27;t</li>

            <li> The more you use, the curlier your hair will be.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE CURLERS.</li>
            <li> why, but i am glad i bought some when i did.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for having great hair without all the damage or time normally associated with great hair:)</li>
            <li> highly recommend these for having great hair without all the damage or time normally associated with great hair:)se</li>
            <li> they also create beautiful natural looking curls and waves.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use just 1 box of 12 rollers just fine.</li>
            <li> is that I was able to sleep on them fine with no poking or digging into my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my thing) is that I was able to sleep on them fine with no poking or digging into my scalp.  </li>
            <li> HONEY, WAS I RIGHT!!  </li>
            <li> Putting them in is easy-</li>
            <li> The Bamboo Curlers are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy as that.</li>
            <li> They are easy to work with</li>
            <li> The curlers were easy to manage, and with the curl cream, the ends were easy to roll onto the bamboo fabric.  </li>
            <li> Fairly easy to sleep on</li>
            <li> Blame the thickness and length, but I could have easily used two packs.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> To be fair, I should have ordered 2 packs, used a night-time cap to help hold everything in place and it would have been wise to put some mousse or product in my wet hair so that the curl would hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bottom line, these curlers are SUPER EASY TO USE, they&#x27;re a GREAT PRICE, they leave your hair SUPER CUTE AND BOUNCY, and they&#x27;re SOFT (which makes it a bit more tolerable to sleep with them).  </li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t damage your hair or require any hair product; that said, if you want to use hair product, that is fine.  </li>
            <li> I assumed the drying alone would create a curl that was fine.</li>
            <li> hair comes out super curly or wavy depending on how many bamboo curlers I use.</li>
            <li> The curls are super cute...</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and these gave me nice soft curls and volume.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to give me curls that is comfortable and does not use heat or product.</li>
            <li> I had great curly hair the next morning.</li>
            <li> i get fantastic curls.</li>
            <li> USE THESE ON DAMP HAIR, COMFORTABLE TO SLEEP IN.  </li>
            <li> The package says to use a setting cream/lotion; however I used a cheap spray-on conditioner, for a lighter look and feel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait until they&#x27;re available to purchase again.</li>
            <li> My daughter said that they are comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> But you can feel them and put them back on..other than that, great curlers.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re also so comfortable.      </li>
            <li> Sleeping in them was quite comfortable and none fell out in the night.  </li>
            <li> Use a light mousse before rolling it up to keep the curl longer.</li>
            <li> Use a light mousse before rolling it up to keep the curl longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them to accentuate my already curly hair, and I find they work best with some mousse in first, then wait til the hair is nearly dry, them twist them in.</li>
            <li> The best part is it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like hot rollers and blow dryers.</li>
            <li> and the next morning I had amazing curly hair!</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time getting ready in the morning, I sleep in these puppies and they are the most comfortable curlers I&#x27;ve EVER found.  </li>
            <li> The quality could be a bit better, but overall gives a nice curl with comfort and ease.</li>
            <li> It all depends on how many you use as to how much curl you will get.</li>
            <li> i unraveled them pretty easily</li>
            <li> but I end up with really tight curls that kind of look like a 1940&#x27;s style hairdo (which my husband liked, but I didn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> These are great soft curlers, easy to use, and I can actually sleep in them.  </li>
            <li> No hard plastic things digging into your head, its fantastic!  </li>
            <li> If you are careful about how you roll them (cork screw, and make sure to include the very ends), I&#x27;m sure you will love them, too.</li>
            <li> you can sleep in this, and less heat damage &#x3D; more healthy hair!</li>
            <li> They are SUPER quick&amp;easy to use and very comfortable to sleep in (even my 3 year old niece thinks so).  </li>
            <li> A great way to get the curls to set... is to go out and buy one of those hair-towels that are small and light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to sleep with them and it gives my hair the much needed break from hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> and the curls really held!!</li>
            <li> I love Conairs Bamboo Soft Curlers.  </li>
            <li> i even had some nice curl / body the second day after using these.</li>
            <li> for $12, definitely worth trying out.</li>
            <li> Results were curly and fun.  </li>
            <li> I love the natural aspect of bamboo eco-friendly curlers</li>
            <li> It takes longer than using an iron but definitely worth it because your not damaging your hair.</li>
            <li> and I love that they are made with natural products.</li>
            <li> I love the soft, tossled look of the \\&quot;moviestar curl\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy to curly hair which can be a pain because it is often more wavy underneath than on top and the top tends to get sort of frizzy and straggly looking while the bottom turns into ringlets.  </li>
            <li> i LOVE these soft curlers.</li>
            <li> I tried these curlers and it took me a couple of times to get it right</li>
            <li> They are soft and comfortable, especially compared to rags, and they keep your hair healthy since you&#x27;re not applying any heat!</li>
            <li> I rolled my almost dry hair, putting a curl cream (Avon) on the ends, slept on them comfortably overnight, and got up the next morning with the most beautiful blonde curly afro you&#x27;ve ever seen!  </li>
            <li> The easy way around that is to start wrapping a few inches up from the end of the hair length, then wrap the end around the part of the hair already wound up, then, catching the ends under the rest of the hair to hold in place, continue to roll up toward the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these curlers because I detest hot roller sets and am not crazy about standing in front of a mirror curling my hair for 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> They are easy to roll and soft to lay on.</li>
            <li> Do the same with these, take your time, and curl all in the same general direction, don&#x27;t worry about doing it perfectly though.  </li>
            <li> then some, super for me because my hair is totally flat and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl from a curling iron for more than a few hours, even if I had the good fortune of having hours in the morning to do my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are a great curlers if your hair is not too long, short to medium length, or if you just want to put some curl on your ends if your hair is longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After several uses, I have discovered that the wire inside the covering (which is nothing more than a pipe cleaner with some sponge over it) pokes through the covering.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used them was the day I received them.</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments at work the next day....</li>
            <li> Before these, I had never used anything but hot rollers or curling irons.  </li>
            <li> Really pretty results.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have recommended it to several people</li>
            <li> These soft curlers were comfortable during sleep.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li> wear these curlers to sleep and they create pretty curls.  </li>
            <li> To prevent them from falling out, be sure to wrap the two ends of the curler in the SAME direction, both inwards or outwards.  </li>
            <li> To prevent them from falling out, be sure to wrap the two ends of the curler in the SAME direction, both inwards or outwards.  </li>
            <li> and these didn&#x27;t even on the first day,</li>
            <li> If it ends up being too many for you, you can always return them or keep them as a replacement for your others when they finally break.</li>
            <li> first setback</li>
            <li> I put three rollers on top of my head, one at each side and one at the top/ back.  </li>
            <li> good tip is to let your hair air-dry a bit before rolling it up or even take a blowdryer to it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> A good tip is to let your hair air-dry a bit before rolling it up or even take a blowdryer to it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use very many, it&#x27;ll curl well with just a few.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;ve given this product 4 starts instead of 5 is because the very first time I used them the inner wire poked out of one of the curlers and a few wires have begun poking out ever since so these aren&#x27;t the best quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pretty much everything to style my hair over the years.</li>
            <li> Some things work well for me (hot rollers, straightening iron) and some things don&#x27;t (those rubbery hot stick things, classic foam rollers).</li>
            <li> but there is still a slight halo of stray hairs that want to do their own thing.</li>
            <li> They produced nice tight curls (my hair is shoulder length, medium weight, wavy).  </li>
            <li> One package is definitely enough if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> The wire does tend to poke out the end at times, but I just gently push it back in and it seems to be fine.  </li>
            <li> I only left them in for about 2-3 hours since I was impatient and the curls came out wonderful and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> When you remove them, do so gently and slip them out of the curl rather than pull, that will maintain the curl.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these, as they don&#x27;t damage your hair, either!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the curls to hold but much to my surprise</li>
            <li> I have long,fine,delicate hair and the Avon ones got very tangled in my hair and made the curls much to frizzy.</li>
            <li> That whole \\&quot;twist-and-tie\\&quot; thing?</li>
            <li> Either in a ponytail or half-up so that it won&#x27;t matter so much if the curls look erratic or uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i highly recommend these rollers, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I would definitely test them out before you use them for an important event, because you can end up looking like Diana Ross.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very straight hair, and these give me a nice bouncy curl that lasts, when left in all night.</li>
            <li> My hair takes a curl very well so my main problem was too much curl.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy, but these curlers made it extremely frizzy and crispy for days.</li>
            <li> use only a few and you&#x27;ll get nice soft waves, They are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see me using these as my hair gets longer and on special occasions.</li>
            <li> anyway, I tried these rollers by putting the top half of my hair in them.  </li>
            <li> One package could be enough for most heads, but two works well for me (with a couple left over).</li>
            <li> One big plus (and it is big because as I said, sleeping in most curlers ain&#x27;t my thing)</li>
            <li> Her curls are very pretty after taking them out the next morning.   </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The curls are more s-shaped, similar to the type of curls you get when you curl your hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> They create nice soft curls, but the ends can be too curly (fuzzy looking) if wrapped very tightly.  </li>
            <li> I bought two packages, since my hair is very thick, and that turned out to be a good thing.</li>
            <li> I slept in them, with a small/buttoned head-towel on, and they were soft and comfy; your hair will be all ready to go in the morning.</li>
            <li> as an fyi, i have 4b natural hair that i blow-dry/ + flat-iron straight from time to time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these curlers for many months now and waited to post a review until I had used them a few times.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these on a whim just to try something new with my hair.</li>
            <li> If you want a new look, try them...</li>
            <li> I had to deep condition my hair to get back the smooth texture.</li>
            <li> I might consider purchasing more but in the future I will have a friend help me put them in carefully, maybe pin some in place and wrap them all in something to keep them from coming out in my sleep.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use, well made and there are enough of them to curl long hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like a huge mess of waves and curls like it normally does.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable to sleep in and the curls last a really long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and straight (bra length and straight as a board - think Marcia Brady)).  </li>
            <li> my hair doesn&#x27;t curl very well normally, but when i sleep wiht these overnight on 2nd day hair</li>
            <li> Yes, down here in the South, we STILL love big hair, so I ordered these soft curlers to sleep in, thinking I would get the curls I wanted--AND</li>
            <li> These curlers are very easy to use (and I&#x27;m not good at fixing hair)</li>
            <li> and they are so soft they won&#x27;t bother you to sleep on.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve been playing with using 2-3 rollers on each section and not going too far up on the crown, for a looser look.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my 10 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> The curls stay the whole day without the use of any products such as hair spray.</li>
            <li> I had already tried the Avon Soft Curlers and did not like them at all.</li>
            <li> They are basically a soft material with a wire (like pipe cleaner) inside them that you roll your hair onto .</li>
            <li> This foam insert is much much much much longer and bigger!  </li>
            <li> To give my hair a much needed break from the heat of styling tools I bought a 12pack of these things because others claimed you could sleep in them and remove them the following morning to have</li>
            <li> All wrapped in soft bamboo fabric.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how well these things work.</li>
            <li> The hair wrapped up around the curlers first is covered by more wet hair wrapped around it so it won&#x27;t always dry completely if the hair is soaking wet to begin with.</li>
            <li> The hair wrapped up around the curlers first is covered by more wet hair wrapped around it so it won&#x27;t always dry completely if the hair is soaking wet to begin with.</li>
            <li> When I took the curlers out, my hair sprung back into the exact same position it was in when the curlers were in.</li>
            <li> just make sure your ends are slick (either with water or fully brushed out)</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments and the waves last for at least a day.  </li>
            <li> hair is a loud, natural red.</li>
            <li> You curl it carefully to all come out a certain way.  </li>
            <li> I will also allow time in the morning to use an iron for touch-ups if needed, placement of hairspray and just styling in general.</li>
            <li> I have straight shoulder length hair and am clumsy with hot rollers and curling irons.  </li>
            <li> I started playing with doing the whole head on barely wet hair.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft enough to sleep in, they don&#x27;t leave dents in my curls, and they don&#x27;t damage my chemically-relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I waited until my hair was barely damp and put the curlers in.</li>
            <li> mousse.&lt;br /&gt;i retried the above without the product and it still came out within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;i have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> You can poke the wire back in and sew up the hole, so they aren&#x27;t ruined completely, but of course you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about doing that when you buy a product.</li>
            <li> things are basically the soft, foam cylindrical rollers you remember from the 90&#x27;s (usually light pink or green) with a heavy-duty garbage tie through the middle.</li>
            <li> ; this only happened to me once, and it was when I literally wrapped up my soaking wet hair and went straight to bed.  </li>
            <li> There are some other reviews from girls with straight hair that had similar results.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thin straight hair</li>
            <li> You can get tight corkscrew curls if you wind small portions of hair tightly around the curler OR looser curls if you wind wider bands of hair in a looser fashion (e.g. start twisting the hair from one end of the curler and continue to wist it until you reach the other end, using up the whole curler instead of just winding the hair around the same section of the curler - this will also let your hair dry better, see #4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have had a different brand of these curlers that did not last long.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick, coarse, wavy and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I bought two packages, but it really depends on how tight or loose you want your curls to be.</li>
            <li> it looks like i might be out of luck once these get worn down from frequent</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy, but only slightly, which may have helped to keep the curls in so long.</li>
            <li> I do it again with dry hair if I want a second day with the waves.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use any products or heat at all, a big yay for me since I have thin hair that gets completely weighed down with the slightest product (though I do sometimes spray in some sheer blonde hairspray, which is very light)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why did it take them so long to come up with these rollers?  </li>
            <li> I bought two pack for my fairly long hair but found I could almost get by with one pack.</li>
            <li> and I have long hair (bra length)</li>
            <li> I separated them and stretched them out.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair, and i washed my hair towel dried it until it was damp and brushed out sections and used only about 10 and slept with them in the next morning</li>
            <li> but like I said, it was just a minor thing.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is too long.</li>
            <li> I think next I will try using larger chunks of hair and not rolling them so tight.</li>
            <li> I just wake up with wet, flat, hair.</li>
            <li> I set my hair dry.</li>
            <li> When your hair is dry undo the ends of the roller and unroll your hair.</li>
            <li> Not as frizzy as when I just let it air dry</li>
            <li> for a softer/looser curl, put them in dry hair.</li>
            <li> loose, effortless</li>
            <li> I have very long (just above the waist) slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> What I ended up doing was place the curler about 1/3 of the way down the hair and start by wrapping the hair around the curler so that the ends are on the outside, then roll the curler towards the head to finish off.</li>
            <li> The rest of my hair i left down.  </li>
            <li> for the other negative comments, while a stray curler does occasionally fall out at night or one of them gets half unraveled, it&#x27;s completely unnoticeable once mixed in with the rest of the curls.  </li>
            <li> As for the other negative comments, while a stray curler does occasionally fall out at night or one of them gets half unraveled, it&#x27;s completely unnoticeable once mixed in with the rest of the curls.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer commented that her wet hair didn&#x27;t dry by morning</li>
            <li> I bought two packages because one package wasn&#x27;t enough depending on how tight or loose you want the curls.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little above my bra strap and wanted to add curls and volumn that lasts.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall is that with a lot of use, the wires try to poke through the ends of the fabic (because the little caps come off the ends of the wires on the inside).</li>
            <li> I like how they are compact flexible and firm at the same time.</li>
            <li> Be careful when bending the curler though because the end might break off and you cant fix it because its covered.</li>
            <li> In the morning, some of the curls were a bit damp, but they dried by the time I left the house AND maintained their curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I showered, sectioned my wet hair and rolled it up.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not putting stuff in my hair to make it stay, or maybe I&#x27;m doing it with my hair too wet, but I can&#x27;t get these things to curl my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> I also found that if I let my hair air dry a little before using the curlers I end up with dry hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> initially the curls are very tight and bouncy, but you can brush them out or let them fall during the day.  </li>
            <li> all you have to do is wet your hair just a little bit, towel dry, then put in the curlers if you want a tighter, 1940s-style curl.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews posted and thought that I&#x27;d give these rollers a shot.</li>
            <li> I WASH MY HAIR ABOUT EVERY OTHER DAY - SOMETIMES 3.  </li>
            <li> They have lasted longer than any other brand.</li>
            <li> A little gel or mousse before rolling and spraying with some hairspray after the hair is dry helps keep the curl longer.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s thin as mentioned above so this might be different for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The foamy insert is about twice the size of other ones that I&#x27;ve seen and when put in the hair they hold very well without being uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I twisted them pretty tightly</li>
            <li> The package instructions recommend only \\&quot;finger combing\\&quot; and I do agree with that, at least for my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually let my hair dry a little before using these so that it&#x27;s still wet but not dripping.  </li>
            <li> You sort of push up the ends and that will help the tip of your curl stay down.</li>
            <li> However, because these rollers use wires, the wires will wear down after time.</li>
            <li> The foam inserts are flattened, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to make my curls any less voluminous.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less damaging product.  </li>
            <li> , I have long, thick, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I was pretty doubtful if these curlers would actually work</li>
            <li> There are also little plastic covers that prevent the wires from poking through the fabric, but they all fall off and the wires will start to poke through.</li>
            <li> This causes the fabric to unravel a little.    </li>
            <li> if I&#x27;m in Florida during the summer, the humidity makes my hair look like Little Orphan Annie.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put on a de-frizzing serum before curling my hair or you could even use a little hairspray even though the curls hold throughout the day without it.</li>
            <li> For me, my hair was damp, air dried.</li>
            <li> If your hair takes a curl easily, a few hours might do it.  </li>
            <li> But - after a few uses, the wires started coming out of the ends of some of them.</li>
            <li> Instead, I awoke to limp, erratic curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hated the avon pillow curlers due to the small, cheap foam insert.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair extending to just below my shoulder blades, but it is fairly thin.</li>
            <li> They looked a bit small</li>
            <li> i use them when i want a break from my usual flat-ironed look.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thick and at the moment is about 3-4 inches past my shoulder.</li>

            <li> I got these last week and tried them out over the weekend.  I have pretty thin straight hair that&#x27;s a little above my bra strap and wanted to add curls and volumn that lasts.  Usually when I use a hot curling iron, my curls start to deflate in a matter of hours.  I used the Bamboo Soft curlers while my hair was semi wet.  I only left them in for about 2-3 hours since I was impatient and the curls came out wonderful and bouncy.  And they lasted the rest of the day looking totally fabulous!  I&#x27;m going to give them another whirl this week and going to leave them in overnight.  I highly recommend these.  I ended up only using 11 of the 12 in my hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried many ways to curl my hair with it  neither of them worked    the curls were just so unnatural and amusing  i think, still, getting a curling iron is the only solution    i bet you would rather get heat damage than walking down the street with weird curls on your head..</li>
            <li> I have very long (just above the waist) slightly wavy hair. I have been looking for something to give me curls that is comfortable and does not use heat or product. I tried these curlers and it took me a couple of times to get it right but now that I have, I just love them! My hair takes a curl very well so my main problem was too much curl. What I ended up doing was place the curler about 1/3 of the way down the hair and start by wrapping the hair around the curler so that the ends are on the outside, then roll the curler towards the head to finish off. I also used fewer curlers so the amount of hair on each one was thicker. This gave me the perfect waves that last all day. I do it again with dry hair if I want a second day with the waves. I also found that if I let my hair air dry a little before using the curlers I end up with dry hair in the morning. The package instructions recommend only \\&quot;finger combing\\&quot; and I do agree with that, at least for my hair.</li>
            <li> These are a great curlers if your hair is not too long, short to medium length, or if you just want to put some curl on your ends if your hair is longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about them is the bendable wires that are embedded in the foam, and that the fabric has texture so your hair doesn&#x27;t slip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them to accentuate my already curly hair, and I find they work best with some mousse in first, then wait til the hair is nearly dry, them twist them in. You sort of push up the ends and that will help the tip of your curl stay down. Let them stay on awhile then apply a bit of hair spray. When you remove them, do so gently and slip them out of the curl rather than pull, that will maintain the curl.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews posted and thought that I&#x27;d give these rollers a shot. I am very happy with them. They are easy to roll and soft to lay on. I bought two packages, but it really depends on how tight or loose you want your curls to be. One package could be enough for most heads, but two works well for me (with a couple left over).</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter and she loves the results.  They are comfortable to sleep in and the curls last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I love Conairs Bamboo Soft Curlers.  Since I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time getting ready in the morning, I sleep in these puppies and they are the most comfortable curlers I&#x27;ve EVER found.  They are the easiest to use, too!  They are a modern version of rag curlers and work great!  I highly recommend these, as they don&#x27;t damage your hair, either!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying for months to find a good way to roll my pin-straight hair ... and I finally found the solution in these rollers. These are so easy to use, and my curls come out perfectly every time. It only takes about 20 minutes to put my hair up, and I&#x27;ve gotten used to sleeping in these in a matter of days. They are soft and comfortable, especially compared to rags, and they keep your hair healthy since you&#x27;re not applying any heat! I use Rusk Wired as a styling product after I shower, so that plus the curlers keep my hair soft and perfect even during rainy days in Seattle.    Edit: I&#x27;ve been using these for two months now, and although the curls are just as good, the rollers are taking a beating. The foam inserts are flattened, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to make my curls any less voluminous. However, because these rollers use wires, the wires will wear down after time. There are also little plastic covers that prevent the wires from poking through the fabric, but they all fall off and the wires will start to poke through. This causes the fabric to unravel a little.    I&#x27;ll keep using these, but I might end up buying more durable rollers when these need replacing.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter to prevent heat damage to her hair and so I wouldn&#x27;t risk burning her with a regular curling iron.  Putting them in is easy- I just make sure her hair is damp and start rolling in sections. A little gel or mousse before rolling and spraying with some hairspray after the hair is dry helps keep the curl longer.  I bought two packages because one package wasn&#x27;t enough depending on how tight or loose you want the curls.  After several uses, I have discovered that the wire inside the covering (which is nothing more than a pipe cleaner with some sponge over it) pokes through the covering.  Not a big deal, but I can see that over time this might cause the covering to fall apart.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I purchased these but returned them before I used them.  They looked a bit small so I decided to go with the flexi rods instead.</li>
            <li> I ordered these on a whim just to try something new with my hair. The first time I used them was the day I received them. I haphazardly placed them in my hair about an hour after I got out of the shower that night. I didn&#x27;t put any product in my hair or separate it into sections. In fact, I was sitting in front of the tv, not even in front of a mirror. I didn&#x27;t expect the curls to hold but much to my surprise I had great curly hair the next morning. I twisted them pretty tightly so I had wringlet-type curls rather than waves. My hair was adorable!! I got so many compliments at work the next day....and the curls really held!! I did not wash my hair that night, and the spiral-curls were still there the second day.   I have long hair extending to just below my shoulder blades, but it is fairly thin. I was able to use just 1 box of 12 rollers just fine. My hair is naturally wavy, but only slightly, which may have helped to keep the curls in so long. There are some other reviews from girls with straight hair that had similar results.  Bottom line, these curlers are SUPER EASY TO USE, they&#x27;re a GREAT PRICE, they leave your hair SUPER CUTE AND BOUNCY, and they&#x27;re SOFT (which makes it a bit more tolerable to sleep with them).  I highly recommend. These are one of my favorite spontaneous purchases to date!!</li>
            <li> my hair doesn&#x27;t curl very well normally, but when i sleep wiht these overnight on 2nd day hair i get fantastic curls. don&#x27;t use very many, it&#x27;ll curl well with just a few. initially the curls are very tight and bouncy, but you can brush them out or let them fall during the day.  i even had some nice curl / body the second day after using these. and they are so soft they won&#x27;t bother you to sleep on. for $12, definitely worth trying out.</li>
            <li> USE THESE ON DAMP HAIR, COMFORTABLE TO SLEEP IN.  LEAVE IN OVERNIGHT AND MY CURLS LAST UNTIL NEXT WASH - I WASH MY HAIR ABOUT EVERY OTHER DAY - SOMETIMES 3.  GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love these. A 12 pack was the exact amount I needed for long-layered hair (about 2\\&quot; inches past shoulders). I slept in them, with a small/buttoned head-towel on, and they were soft and comfy; your hair will be all ready to go in the morning. These are wonderful. The package says to use a setting cream/lotion; however I used a cheap spray-on conditioner, for a lighter look and feel. Your hair will be curly with a bounce. For me, my hair was damp, air dried. Not soaked. I sprayed in the conditioner, and then set my hair. A great way to get the curls to set... is to go out and buy one of those hair-towels that are small and light. The most magnificent curls, one girl could ask for.</li>
            <li> These are great soft curlers, easy to use, and I can actually sleep in them.  I like the fact that they are made from bamboo (a renewable resource). They create nice soft curls, but the ends can be too curly (fuzzy looking) if wrapped very tightly.  The easy way around that is to start wrapping a few inches up from the end of the hair length, then wrap the end around the part of the hair already wound up, then, catching the ends under the rest of the hair to hold in place, continue to roll up toward the scalp.  I have very long, very straight hair, and these give me a nice bouncy curl that lasts, when left in all night. If your hair takes a curl easily, a few hours might do it.  I do tie a bandanna around the curlers to keep them from coming out during the night (I move around a lot in my sleep) and that works well.  I bought two packages, since my hair is very thick, and that turned out to be a good thing.</li>
            <li> Why did it take them so long to come up with these rollers?  I&#x27;m able to sleep with them and it gives my hair the much needed break from hot rollers.  Be patient, it does take some practice.</li>
            <li> Before these, I had never used anything but hot rollers or curling irons.  I was looking for a less damaging product.  My hair is long and straight (bra length and straight as a board - think Marcia Brady)).  I ordered 2 sets because of the length of my hair.  I started playing with doing the whole head on barely wet hair.  Results were curly and fun.  I prefered a looser look however.  Now I&#x27;ve been playing with using 2-3 rollers on each section and not going too far up on the crown, for a looser look.  Really pretty results.  Great product, looking forward to more experimenting.</li>
            <li> I like that you can sleep in this, and less heat damage &#x3D; more healthy hair!</li>
            <li> They are so soft and great!  No hard plastic things digging into your head, its fantastic!  they also create beautiful natural looking curls and waves.  I love them, they are a great purchase, eco friendly, easy and comfortable to sleep in, easy to have in, and they work wonderfully.  ^^</li>
            <li> These soft curlers are wonderful! They&#x27;re soft enough to sleep in, they don&#x27;t leave dents in my curls, and they don&#x27;t damage my chemically-relaxed hair. I can&#x27;t wait until they&#x27;re available to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 10 yr old daughter. They are easy to use, well made and there are enough of them to curl long hair. My daughter said that they are comfortable to sleep in. Her curls are very pretty after taking them out the next morning.   We have had a different brand of these curlers that did not last long. These are made of durable and eco freindly material.</li>
            <li> I wish I could post a photograph of how my hair turns out. You can see for photographs on my Website: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair comes out super curly or wavy depending on how many bamboo curlers I use. I love this product and have recommended it to several people already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I do is wash my hair at night, set it with these curlers, wake up in the morning, take the curlers out, WAALAA! Perfect curly hair without any pain or extra time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only bought 1 package of curlers and I have a LOT of hair.</li>
            <li> Soft bendy and wonderful to sleep in, and then I wake up with bouncy curls that last. I love the natural aspect of bamboo eco-friendly curlers</li>
            <li> I have used these several times on both my niece and I.  With just a bit of product, they curl very nicely (although I do look a bit Shirley Templish when I first take them out).  By twisting the hair before wrapping you can get a really beautiful spiral curl.  They are SUPER quick&amp;easy to use and very comfortable to sleep in (even my 3 year old niece thinks so).  The wire does tend to poke out the end at times, but I just gently push it back in and it seems to be fine.  The quality could be a bit better, but overall gives a nice curl with comfort and ease.</li>
            <li> The Bamboo Curlers are easy to use. I like how they are compact flexible and firm at the same time. I order 2 sets for my shoulder length thick hair. I am african american with a perm.</li>
            <li> I was pretty doubtful if these curlers would actually work but i put them on overnight and the next morning I had amazing curly hair! It takes longer than using an iron but definitely worth it because your not damaging your hair. Comfortable to sleep in. Be careful when bending the curler though because the end might break off and you cant fix it because its covered. But it only happened to one of the curlers out of the total twelve and is still usable. One package is definitely enough if you have fine hair. Make sure to wrap your hair nicely because your results depend on it. The curls stay the whole day without the use of any products such as hair spray.</li>
            <li> I had already tried the Avon Soft Curlers and did not like them at all. I have long,fine,delicate hair and the Avon ones got very tangled in my hair and made the curls much to frizzy. The Conair Bamboo Cloth Curlers are just wonderful! You can sleep very comfortably with these curlers. My curls are tigh in the morning, but by the time I get to work, they look great, somewhat 1940&#x27;s Hollywood Style. No need for any setting gels either. I set my hair dry. I am very pleased with this product.If you want a new look, try them...I doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought these curlers to curl my daughter&#x27;s hair and I got to say, they are the best curlers of this type I&#x27;ve ever seen. The foamy insert is about twice the size of other ones that I&#x27;ve seen and when put in the hair they hold very well without being uncomfortable. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> These are the best , they do not get tangeled in your hair and you can sleep with them on without getting a headache. They have lasted longer than any other brand. They are basically a soft material with a wire (like pipe cleaner) inside them that you roll your hair onto . It all depends on how many you use as to how much curl you will get. If you use many you&#x27;ll get a lot of curl. use only a few and you&#x27;ll get nice soft waves, They are easy to use. Just roll your hair up unto them as you would a roller then twist the end together. When your hair is dry undo the ends of the roller and unroll your hair. Easy as that. Beautiful curls. NO heat needed..</li>
            <li> These soft curlers were comfortable during sleep.  They produced nice tight curls (my hair is shoulder length, medium weight, wavy).  They are easy to work with and I love that they are made with natural products. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I had recently gotten a perm for my shoulder length hair and it was not as curly as I&#x27;d hoped it would be. Yes, down here in the South, we STILL love big hair, so I ordered these soft curlers to sleep in, thinking I would get the curls I wanted--AND HONEY, WAS I RIGHT!!  I rolled my almost dry hair, putting a curl cream (Avon) on the ends, slept on them comfortably overnight, and got up the next morning with the most beautiful blonde curly afro you&#x27;ve ever seen!  Everyone at work thought I&#x27;d cut my hair and said that it was gorgeous!  The curlers were easy to manage, and with the curl cream, the ends were easy to roll onto the bamboo fabric.  Just roll the hair to the scalp and bend the ends over into knots--they held all night.  I knew that I had a lot of hair, so I ordered two sets and used all of them.  After two days, my curls did not fall out--in fact they had to be washed out!  The only downfall is that with a lot of use, the wires try to poke through the ends of the fabic (because the little caps come off the ends of the wires on the inside). But you can feel them and put them back on..other than that, great curlers.  AND I LOOK FABULOUS!!! Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li> I have straight shoulder length hair and am clumsy with hot rollers and curling irons.  These work great to create long-lasting waves.  I set my hair the night before using the big gray strips with about 1.5 width of hair.  I have gotten so many compliments and the waves last for at least a day.  The best part is it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like hot rollers and blow dryers.</li>
            <li> Does not catch in the hair when you unroll them even pulling them out. Very nice. Fairly easy to sleep on too or just mist the hair and use and in a short time unroll and \\&quot;curls\\&quot;. I bought two pack for my fairly long hair but found I could almost get by with one pack.</li>
            <li> I tried these curlers and the Avon pillow curlers.  I hated the avon pillow curlers due to the small, cheap foam insert.  This foam insert is much much much much longer and bigger!  It also doesn&#x27;t &#x27;deflate&#x27; like the avon curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear these curlers to sleep and they create pretty curls.  The curls are more s-shaped, similar to the type of curls you get when you curl your hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> these were the best curlers I ever bough they lasted to but when I went to reorder them they did not have any they quit selling them bad mistake they were great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these curlers for many months now and waited to post a review until I had used them a few times.  Now that I have, if used correctly, as I&#x27;ll explain below, I can honestly say these are amazing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  They give you curls that actually last all day and then some, super for me because my hair is totally flat and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl from a curling iron for more than a few hours, even if I had the good fortune of having hours in the morning to do my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  You don&#x27;t need to use any products or heat at all, a big yay for me since I have thin hair that gets completely weighed down with the slightest product (though I do sometimes spray in some sheer blonde hairspray, which is very light)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  You can get tight corkscrew curls if you wind small portions of hair tightly around the curler OR looser curls if you wind wider bands of hair in a looser fashion (e.g. start twisting the hair from one end of the curler and continue to wist it until you reach the other end, using up the whole curler instead of just winding the hair around the same section of the curler - this will also let your hair dry better, see #4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Another reviewer commented that her wet hair didn&#x27;t dry by morning; this only happened to me once, and it was when I literally wrapped up my soaking wet hair and went straight to bed.  In the morning, some of the curls were a bit damp, but they dried by the time I left the house AND maintained their curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  If you have thick hair, you may want to get two packs.  I actually bought two packs and never use the second and I have long hair (bra length) but it&#x27;s thin as mentioned above so this might be different for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  When you use a curling iron, you don&#x27;t willy nilly curl in every which direction!  You curl it carefully to all come out a certain way.  Do the same with these, take your time, and curl all in the same general direction, don&#x27;t worry about doing it perfectly though.  I don&#x27;t even use a mirror when I do it now because I&#x27;m so used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the other negative comments, while a stray curler does occasionally fall out at night or one of them gets half unraveled, it&#x27;s completely unnoticeable once mixed in with the rest of the curls.  To prevent them from falling out, be sure to wrap the two ends of the curler in the SAME direction, both inwards or outwards.  I&#x27;m amazed that these actually do stay in even with my tossing and turning at night and they&#x27;re also so comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these for having great hair without all the damage or time normally associated with great hair:)se I&#x27;m so used to it.

            <li> I am African-American and I have relaxed hair. I used these curlers as per the instructions. The results were horrible!! My hair is healthy, but these curlers made it extremely frizzy and crispy for days. I had to deep condition my hair to get back the smooth texture. Do not use, if your hair is relaxed!!!</li>
            <li> These work wonderfully to curl your hair. I have very fine hair, and these gave me nice soft curls and volume.  But - after a few uses, the wires started coming out of the ends of some of them. I can still use the curlers, but they&#x27;re not made as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick, coarse, wavy and frizzy. It&#x27;s currently about shoulder length. Let me put it this way...if I&#x27;m in Florida during the summer, the humidity makes my hair look like Little Orphan Annie. The issue I was trying to address was the frizziness. I waited until my hair was barely damp and put the curlers in. The thought was that if the waves dried with curlers in, they might not frizz as much. When I took the curlers out, my hair sprung back into the exact same position it was in when the curlers were in. I separated them and stretched them out. The curls are super cute...but they are still frizzy. Not as frizzy as when I just let it air dry but there is still a slight halo of stray hairs that want to do their own thing. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with how my hair turned out. It doesn&#x27;t look like a huge mess of waves and curls like it normally does. I can definitely see me using these as my hair gets longer and on special occasions. Nice option for folks with my type of hair.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair, and i washed my hair towel dried it until it was damp and brushed out sections and used only about 10 and slept with them in the next morning i unraveled them pretty easily but the curls didn&#x27;t stay and i used curls holding spray and mousse.&lt;br /&gt;i retried the above without the product and it still came out within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;i have naturally wavy hair but i wanted curls.&lt;br /&gt;im disappointed i wasted money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with these since I bought them. I&#x27;ve been using smaller sections of hair but I end up with really tight curls that kind of look like a 1940&#x27;s style hairdo (which my husband liked, but I didn&#x27;t). I think next I will try using larger chunks of hair and not rolling them so tight. These curlers are very easy to use (and I&#x27;m not good at fixing hair) and they don&#x27;t damage your hair or require any hair product; that said, if you want to use hair product, that is fine.  Sometimes I put on a de-frizzing serum before curling my hair or you could even use a little hairspray even though the curls hold throughout the day without it. I usually let my hair dry a little before using these so that it&#x27;s still wet but not dripping.  Sleeping in them was quite comfortable and none fell out in the night.  The only reason I&#x27;ve given this product 4 starts instead of 5 is because the very first time I used them the inner wire poked out of one of the curlers and a few wires have begun poking out ever since so these aren&#x27;t the best quality.  You can poke the wire back in and sew up the hole, so they aren&#x27;t ruined completely, but of course you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about doing that when you buy a product. I expect a product to hold up for a while when I buy it and these didn&#x27;t even on the first day, but like I said, it was just a minor thing. I have thick hair so I had to buy two boxes of these.  If it ends up being too many for you, you can always return them or keep them as a replacement for your others when they finally break.</li>
            <li> I purchased these curlers because I detest hot roller sets and am not crazy about standing in front of a mirror curling my hair for 40 minutes. My hair is naturally thick and at the moment is about 3-4 inches past my shoulder. I love the soft, tossled look of the \\&quot;moviestar curl\\&quot;. To give my hair a much needed break from the heat of styling tools I bought a 12pack of these things because others claimed you could sleep in them and remove them the following morning to have loose, effortless curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first setback: 12 curlers is not nearly enough for my hair. Blame the thickness and length, but I could have easily used two packs.&lt;br /&gt;My second setback: That whole \\&quot;twist-and-tie\\&quot; thing? Not as great as I thought it would be. 2 or 3 curlers fell out of my hair while I was asleep.&lt;br /&gt;My third setback: I showered, sectioned my wet hair and rolled it up. I assumed the drying alone would create a curl that was fine. Instead, I awoke to limp, erratic curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a loud, natural red. So after removing all of the curlers from my hair my boyfriend told me I looked like an Irish Setter Hound. He was being playful, but there is no way I would have worn my hair out of the house as-is. To be fair, I should have ordered 2 packs, used a night-time cap to help hold everything in place and it would have been wise to put some mousse or product in my wet hair so that the curl would hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are basically the soft, foam cylindrical rollers you remember from the 90&#x27;s (usually light pink or green) with a heavy-duty garbage tie through the middle. All wrapped in soft bamboo fabric. I might consider purchasing more but in the future I will have a friend help me put them in carefully, maybe pin some in place and wrap them all in something to keep them from coming out in my sleep. I will also allow time in the morning to use an iron for touch-ups if needed, placement of hairspray and just styling in general. One big plus (and it is big because as I said, sleeping in most curlers ain&#x27;t my thing) is that I was able to sleep on them fine with no poking or digging into my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have 36 curlers total, which is enough to wrap up all of my hair. I&#x27;ve gotten more skilled at rolling up the hair and securing it. Basically, I use these curlers when I know I&#x27;ll need some zing to my &#x27;do the following morning, but I still give myself time to do some extra styling as I know I&#x27;ll need it. And I always plan to put my hair &#x27;up&#x27; after unrolling it. Either in a ponytail or half-up so that it won&#x27;t matter so much if the curls look erratic or uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good tip is to let your hair air-dry a bit before rolling it up or even take a blowdryer to it for a few minutes. The hair wrapped up around the curlers first is covered by more wet hair wrapped around it so it won&#x27;t always dry completely if the hair is soaking wet to begin with. Use a light mousse before rolling it up to keep the curl longer. And while these things aren&#x27;t the worst to sleep in you&#x27;ll still feel them. I use more curlers to create a more even cushion on my head and I&#x27;m sure to sleep on my biggest, fluffiest pillow to help.in&#x27;t my thing) is that I was able to sleep on them fine with no poking or digging into my scalp.  *UPDATE*  I now have 36 curlers total, which is enough to wrap up all of my hair.

            <li> I am really impressed with theses rollers.  I have thick wavy to curly hair which can be a pain because it is often more wavy underneath than on top and the top tends to get sort of frizzy and straggly looking while the bottom turns into ringlets.  anyway, I tried these rollers by putting the top half of my hair in them.  I put three rollers on top of my head, one at each side and one at the top/ back.  The rest of my hair i left down.  Then i went to bed and slept great, work up to gorgeous curls all over my head.  Now the top part of my hair looks nice and curly like the rest.  i highly recommend these rollers, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pretty much everything to style my hair over the years. Some things work well for me (hot rollers, straightening iron) and some things don&#x27;t (those rubbery hot stick things, classic foam rollers). I was really surprised at how well these things work. If you are careful about how you roll them (cork screw, and make sure to include the very ends), I&#x27;m sure you will love them, too. I bought 2 sets just in case, but have only used 1. The more you use, the curlier your hair will be. I would definitely test them out before you use them for an important event, because you can end up looking like Diana Ross. It totally depends on how you use them. Those who got bad results, probably didn&#x27;t use them correctly *for their hair*. FWIW, I have long, thick, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE CURLERS. THEY MAKE SLEEPING A DREAM  AND THEY PRODUCE CURLS THAT LAST FOR DAYS!!</li>
            <li> i LOVE these soft curlers. i use them when i want a break from my usual flat-ironed look. all you have to do is wet your hair just a little bit, towel dry, then put in the curlers if you want a tighter, 1940s-style curl. for a softer/looser curl, put them in dry hair. just make sure your ends are slick (either with water or fully brushed out) so they won&#x27;t be frizzy when you take them out of the curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that said, i was super-depressed when i saw these had been discontinued. i have no idea why, but i am glad i bought some when i did. it looks like i might be out of luck once these get worn down from frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just as an fyi, i have 4b natural hair that i blow-dry/ + flat-iron straight from time to time.</li>
            <li> But I cannot get these things to work.  Maybe my hair is too long. Maybe I&#x27;m not putting stuff in my hair to make it stay, or maybe I&#x27;m doing it with my hair too wet, but I can&#x27;t get these things to curl my hair at all.  I just wake up with wet, flat, hair.</li>
