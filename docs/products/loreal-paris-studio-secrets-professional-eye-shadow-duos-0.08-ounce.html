            <li>Perfect for me, the over forty type.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great all over lid color for any look.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s trendy and looked great on me!</li>
            <li>Also, the shadow applicator is not so great.  </li>
            <li>Nice Matte eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>Seems good like it</li>
            <li>is good for that</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it here!</li>
            <li>I wear L&#x27;Oreal W3 foundation and this is a nice compliment, that just evens out the lid colors.</li>
            <li>nice color</li>
            <li>Nice price..</li>
            <li>I love the colors as they are natural looking and are perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Great buy and it ships fast.</li>
            <li>Coverage ok.  </li>
            <li>I have some eye lid sag and needed something to give my eyes a bit more definition.</li>
            <li>makes my eyes look lovely and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of loreal products and love them they don&#x27;t melt run or smear</li>
            <li>You can probably get a better eyeshadow for a couple more dollars imo</li>
            <li>SO, use another applicator and enjoy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it, and am satisified with the price I paid.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Two pretty neutral colors with matte finish and good staying power.</li>
            <li>Amazon makes it easy for me to order it online</li>
            <li>Crumbled easy after a couple falls</li>
            <li>Fast ship:) Recommend!</li>
            <li>This does not go on smoothly and I can&#x27;t even tell I have it on.  </li>
            <li>goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>for eyes, this is really a nice natural look.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and feels very light on my eyes.</li>
            <li>Love L&#x27;Oreal cosmetics, didn&#x27;t really like this particular shade/color...</li>
            <li>and it comes right to my door in a couple of days,</li>
            <li>These neutral colors are just right.</li>
            <li>This one is just right.</li>
            <li>The lighter shade barely shows up and is chalky and the darker one is just okay.</li>
            <li>I am older now, and I prefer a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>i mostly use the white one.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mix and when my local store stopped carrying it</li>
            <li>This works well enough, but I gave it four out of five stars because the pigment isn&#x27;t top quality.  </li>
            <li>its pretty much see-through, so</li>
            <li>The eye shadow you see on the pic is exact one you ll receive, same colors, the quality is just fine</li>
            <li>But I will certainly find a way to pair it with another shade.</li>
            <li>It is fine pigment (swipes on the same color as what you see in the compact) for drugstore brands (which it is!)</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like it so much.</li>
            <li>But these very neutral tones do.  </li>
            <li>The teeny, tiny applicator is a real pain even with small hands though the quality of the eyeshadow is great.</li>
            <li>I finally found the right neutral colors without any shimmer or glitter look.</li>
            <li>A very natural look.</li>
            <li>I am fifty two and need matte cosmetics and eye shadows that are not too dark or too light.</li>
            <li>This package came 6 days early</li>
            <li>but I like the natural look</li>
            <li>I purchased this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Secrets Professional Eyeshadow duo because I was looking for something that looks mostly natural.  </li>
            <li>I like the bare look and the lighter color</li>
            <li>Nice neutral color to cover dark, tired eyelids.</li>

            <li> Yes, like a lot of people, I used to wear green, blue and other colors of eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow was everything I expected!</li>
            <li> The colors were a little lighter than I expected</li>
            <li> Unless you have dark skin, it is invisible to see.</li>
            <li> I wanted some understated color that blends in well that will also cover small capillaries, etc.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s not good.</li>

            <li> Great buy and it ships fast.</li>
            <li> This is a hard product for me to find in the stores.  I love the colors as they are natural looking and are perfect for me.  Amazon makes it easy for me to order it online and it comes right to my door in a couple of days,</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it so much. The brush is too short and the white was too white. Coverage ok.  I got it because the price was just pennys</li>
            <li> I finally found the right neutral colors without any shimmer or glitter look. It looks natural and feels very light on my eyes. A very natural look.</li>
            <li> This package came 6 days early and I was very impressed with the product, it&#x27;s a great all over lid color for any look. And the price simply can&#x27;t be beat</li>
            <li> Yes, like a lot of people, I used to wear green, blue and other colors of eye shadow. That was then, this is now. I am older now, and I prefer a more natural look.  I have some eye lid sag and needed something to give my eyes a bit more definition. These neutral colors are just right. I use the lighter shade for a highlighter under my brow and also on my lids, close to my lashes. The darker shade goes in the crease of my eyes and over a bit of the eye lid that sags. The darker shade recesses the sagging lid and the lighter shade on either side of that area makes my eyes look lovely and refreshed. There is no sparkle in this &amp;#34;sand dune duo&amp;#34;, just a very subtle matte finish.  The lighter shade can also be used under your eyes to mask redness, and the darker shade, elsewhere on your face for contouring, under cheekbones for example. for eyes, this is really a nice natural look.</li>
            <li> I am fifty two and need matte cosmetics and eye shadows that are not too dark or too light. This one is just right.</li>
            <li> Love L&#x27;Oreal cosmetics, didn&#x27;t really like this particular shade/color... But I will certainly find a way to pair it with another shade.</li>
            <li> this is the base that i use on my eyes every day.&lt;br /&gt;been using it for years and wont change because it is velvety smooth.&lt;br /&gt;the beige color also doubles as an &amp;#34;eraser&amp;#34; if you make an eyeshadow booboo</li>
            <li> The eye shadow you see on the pic is exact one you ll receive, same colors, the quality is just fine i mostly use the white one.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Arrived in tact and as expected.  Difficult to find matte finish shadows.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me, the over forty type.  Sparkles just don&#x27;t work anymore.  But these very neutral tones do.  I wear L&#x27;Oreal W3 foundation and this is a nice compliment, that just evens out the lid colors.</li>
            <li> Seems good like it I use a lot of loreal products and love them they don&#x27;t melt run or smear</li>
            <li> Not a fan..  This does not go on smoothly and I can&#x27;t even tell I have it on.  Bad choice for me.</li>
            <li> The colors were a little lighter than I expected but I like the natural look so it made up for the lighter color. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly. nice color</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow was everything I expected! But what I didn&#x27;t expect was I ordered one evening and it literally arrived 2days later so I totally recommend!</li>
            <li> The lighter shade barely shows up and is chalky and the darker one is just okay. You can probably get a better eyeshadow for a couple more dollars imo</li>
            <li> My only complaint,it was classified with the creme shadow, but otherwisw it&#x27;s trendy and looked great on me!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mix and when my local store stopped carrying it I was glad to find it here!</li>
            <li> Crumbled easy after a couple falls</li>
            <li> Nice Matte eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> The teeny, tiny applicator is a real pain even with small hands though the quality of the eyeshadow is great. Two pretty neutral colors with matte finish and good staying power. SO, use another applicator and enjoy!</li>
            <li> this virually has NO color to it whatsoever!!  Unless you have dark skin, it is invisible to see. Would not recommend to anyone. Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Secrets Professional Eyeshadow duo because I was looking for something that looks mostly natural.  Not only do I have pale/fair skin, its pretty much see-through, so I wanted some understated color that blends in well that will also cover small capillaries, etc. in my eyelids.  This works well enough, but I gave it four out of five stars because the pigment isn&#x27;t top quality.  It is fine pigment (swipes on the same color as what you see in the compact) for drugstore brands (which it is!) but I am used to high-pigment shadows such as Urban Decay, Too Faced, etc.  Also, the shadow applicator is not so great.  That said, it is on-par with drugstore pigments and applicators, and I expected the product to work as it did.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it, and am satisified with the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Nice price..color okay. Fast ship:) Recommend!</li>
            <li> the color is bad - it doesn&#x27;t brighten. it&#x27;s chalky.  it&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy it again.  I like the bare look and the lighter color is good for that but the darker color does nothing for me.  I would probably use a powdered foundation for my eye makeup with the lighter color as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> Nice neutral color to cover dark, tired eyelids.</li>
    </ol>
