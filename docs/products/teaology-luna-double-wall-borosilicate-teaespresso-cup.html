            <li>Got this for my roommate, she loved it!</li>
            <li>They are great to drink tea in.</li>
            <li>Great for taste testing though...</li>
            <li>I find that it is great for me as I place it on my desk when I am studying along with my 28oz tea pot.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>I made some Cuban coffee and they look great</li>
            <li>Great buy.  </li>
            <li>For that purpose, these provide great insulation and great aesthetics.</li>
            <li>It looks very nice</li>
            <li>Given this knowledge I still find these glasses to be beautiful and a good addition for a tea set.</li>
            <li>Awesome love it</li>
            <li>if you take good care of them, they are very nice to use.  </li>
            <li>They look stronger and of good quality.</li>
            <li>The good:</li>
            <li>They look as good as they do in their picture.</li>
            <li>This company has been good to me.</li>
            <li>perfect fit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this would be great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still very cute</li>
            <li>The cups are very cute.</li>
            <li>But they are so cute!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Love them and no hands getting burned either!</li>
            <li>But both were in their own box wrapped in bubble wrap.  </li>
            <li>Keeps the tea warm for a while.</li>
            <li>To be perfenctly honest, these favor form over function, but so what?</li>
            <li>Very good value and very durable.  </li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>Tasting cups...small but elegant vessels for drinking tea.</li>
            <li>I took a picture with an egg in one to provide better perspective.  </li>
            <li>They look like adorable candle holders</li>
            <li>Neat double wall glass cup that gets a lot of impressed inquiries!  </li>
            <li>These Tea/Espresso Cups are cute.</li>
            <li>I bought three and will probably get more at some point.</li>
            <li>If you are buying these because of how cute they look when you are drinking tea or coffee</li>
            <li>-you will be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>These cups are really cute</li>
            <li>It would not make sense to serve more tea, coffee, or</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cute, I still love it.</li>
            <li>and I thought these would be perfect for him when he brews Chinese tea leaves.</li>
            <li>These cups are adorable.</li>
            <li>i could not be more pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>i wish i bought the set because i am so satisfied with this teaology glass.</li>
            <li>but that is more my fault then a fault with the product.</li>
            <li>Great little cups that feel well made and look good!</li>
            <li>adorable, beautiful, but tiny.</li>
            <li>They really are beautiful and worth the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift and loved it so much that I had to order another one for myself.</li>
            <li>If you truly enjoy tea (not just a tea bag in a cup but loose quality tea ), this is perfect.</li>
            <li>They are absolutely beautiful and work wonderfully, although they are somewhat difficult to keep clean and require you to shine them before use.</li>
            <li>These are beautiful simple cups.</li>
            <li>but once you get used to it its fine.</li>
            <li>This little cup is perfect for one shot of espresso.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty they should be a must have for everyone!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a huge mug this is not for you</li>
            <li>I really love the Teaology Luna Double Wall Borosilicate tea/Espresso Cup, the shipping was fast and the service was great.</li>
            <li>Makes drinking my tea a special occasion everytime.</li>
            <li>but once I poured some tea into it for her, she changed her mind and told me to pour more tea, describing it as \\&quot;Really neat and pretty\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>However, the double wall also does a really good job of insulating the outer wall of the cup when it&#x27;s full of scalding liquid, so you can pick up your cup without burning your fingers.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great design.</li>
            <li>Had a shipping issue but Vandue was quick to respond to emails.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was surprisingly free and very fast, and each cup was overly-wrapped with paper and surrounded by Styrofoam in a sturdy box via USPS.  </li>
            <li>Super small so ideal for expresso, for tea it is not so convenient.  </li>
            <li>Great little tea cups.</li>
            <li>I have fun time having tea in this cup.</li>
            <li>But they are still worth the money.</li>
            <li>Light weight, elegant, and simple.</li>
            <li>I can keep the lid on my pot and keep my tea warm longer while only drinking what I want at the moment.</li>
            <li>Double walled so that your fingertips won&#x27;t be too hot but keep the beverage warm.  </li>
            <li>Love them to put Asian, Indian, or Latin dish dipping sauces and guests think they are really cool.  </li>
            <li>Great for small amounts of tea.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not noticeable that these are double walled until you pour something into and you discover how very pretty and elegant they are.</li>
            <li>It is different from those in that it is much shorter and wider, which is actually kind of cool, but there&#x27;s also much more distance between the inner and outer glass walls, so that should probably keep the espresso hotter longer.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Rather than having a huge cup, you keep the teapot nearby and pour cups frequently.</li>
            <li>Such a cute design.</li>
            <li>This a very tiny cute tea cup.</li>
            <li>hot saki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for to add to my tea set.</li>
            <li>so you can enjoy the tea and the flavor it offers.</li>
            <li>Too small but real cute.</li>
            <li>And because it is open up top, it cools off faster than your teapot, so you can keep drinking hot tea (drink this, fill it again, and repeat).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used borosilicate lab ware before and had higher hopes for toughness from these guys, BUT,</li>
            <li>so I suppose its great for Espresso but its really a double walled, wide shot glass!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then I expected wouldn&#x27;t recommend for drinking more than about a shot glass worth</li>
            <li>This is the second Borosilicate item I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;m becoming a fan of the material for tea.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice little</li>
            <li>I was considering because I really like how the double-walled glass looks.</li>
            <li>I really like the looks and feel of this cup.</li>
            <li>They arrived much soon than promised date.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and literally will give you 1 big swallow of tea if filled to the brim.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot</li>
            <li>the delivery of this product came so fast</li>
            <li>this double walled glass is cool to the touch even with the boiling hot espresso inside.</li>
            <li>These came twice bigger (two sips versus one sip) than mine, but right form; and my friends actually like this size better.</li>
            <li>The glasses are a good size and do not get hot to burn your fingers with tea, but are very light and do no feel sturdy or heavy at all, almost have the feeling of being so delicate you could crush them in</li>
            <li>This is an adorable little double walled tea cup which will get a lot of oohs and awww.  </li>
            <li>It is cool looking and all but its a lot smaller</li>
            <li>so I can drink and taste tea, without having to wait for the teapot to cool off or put the tea in a bigger cup (which cools off faster than the teapot).</li>
            <li>The only downside is that this can make your cup deceptively cool while the tea inside is still very hot, causing you to potentially burn your tongue a bit.</li>
            <li>It is tiny, but the double walls insulate your hands from heat while letting you see the lovely crema on your shot.</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased these teacups over others</li>
            <li>These are super tiny!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrives carefully packaged (and if you ship things or store fragile things, you can save and reuse the packaging material), however, it does not have any packaging of its own.</li>
            <li>The hold there temperature very well, hot or cold and are attractive as well.</li>
            <li>Double wall allows even the hottest tea or espresso double shot to stay hot, but be comfortable to the touch - and their shape feels &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; in the hand.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them if you have a candle under a glass tea pot.</li>
            <li>I just want to start off saying, I love this little tea cup.</li>
            <li>(you will be curious at how light they are when you pick one up).  </li>
            <li>Too thick on the lips, if I served coffee to a guest on this, I am pretty sure they would question me in their head</li>
            <li>Think of a fragile Christmas ornament and you&#x27;ve pretty much got the thickness of these cups.</li>
            <li>I am ordering a few more &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>That way you are always pouring hot tea and sipping them in the smaller but way cooler looking tea cups.</li>
            <li>We both love them, but will be using them for expresso instead since they are so small.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of the double wall design, it doesn&#x27;t get hot, so you can pick it up and drink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, but it&#x27;s too light, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to break it.</li>
            <li>I would not wasted the money again.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy how small these are - drinking tea in small cups magnifies the experience and these will make magic to any tea-drinking situation.</li>
            <li>but since she&#x27;s a tea fanatic I&#x27;m hoping she&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li>are glass, but feel light like plastic rather then heavy like crystal.</li>
            <li>Slightly odd shaped for sipping bit quickly adjust to the shape.</li>
            <li>These teacups are traditionally sized and therefore, most would consider them to be too small.</li>
            <li>They will be fantastic little espresso cups though!  </li>
            <li>this is big enough for a double shot yet short enough to slide right in and right out without having to tilt the cup.</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tiny, which is what I was looking for, and since it is double walled, the outside doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>I dont know if I will be able to use them for their intended purpose due to their small size.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re small enough to fit in your palm, and if you have big hands you could probably wrap your fingers over them.</li>
            <li>Traditionally, it is a social activity to sit together and drink tea.</li>
            <li>The only thing it like other posters have noted the lip is large</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall:  Great buy for the price but you will be disappointed if you want a &amp;#34;tea cup&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>By definition how much it holds is in the title CUP tea cup, this thing doesn&#x27;t hold 2oz much less a cup.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to have closer to an average sized cup but these hold about as much as 1-2 big sips of liquid.</li>
            <li>These look a little strange at first, my sister called them a \\&quot;candle holder\\&quot;</li>

            <li> If you are looking for a huge mug this is not for you</li>
            <li> I really love the Teaology Luna Double Wall Borosilicate tea/Espresso Cup, the shipping was fast and the service was great.</li>
            <li> Makes drinking my tea a special occasion everytime.</li>
            <li> but once I poured some tea into it for her, she changed her mind and told me to pour more tea, describing it as \\&quot;Really neat and pretty\\&quot;.  </li>

            <li> Such a cute design.</li>
            <li> This a very tiny cute tea cup.</li>
            <li> hot saki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for to add to my tea set.</li>
            <li> so you can enjoy the tea and the flavor it offers.</li>
            <li> Too small but real cute.</li>

            <li> so I suppose its great for Espresso but its really a double walled, wide shot glass!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I expected wouldn&#x27;t recommend for drinking more than about a shot glass worth</li>
            <li> This is the second Borosilicate item I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;m becoming a fan of the material for tea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice little</li>
            <li> I was considering because I really like how the double-walled glass looks.</li>
            <li> I really like the looks and feel of this cup.</li>
            <li> They arrived much soon than promised date.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and literally will give you 1 big swallow of tea if filled to the brim.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> the delivery of this product came so fast</li>
            <li> this double walled glass is cool to the touch even with the boiling hot espresso inside.</li>
            <li> These came twice bigger (two sips versus one sip) than mine, but right form; and my friends actually like this size better.</li>
            <li> The glasses are a good size and do not get hot to burn your fingers with tea, but are very light and do no feel sturdy or heavy at all, almost have the feeling of being so delicate you could crush them in</li>
            <li> This is an adorable little double walled tea cup which will get a lot of oohs and awww.  </li>
            <li> It is cool looking and all but its a lot smaller</li>
            <li> so I can drink and taste tea, without having to wait for the teapot to cool off or put the tea in a bigger cup (which cools off faster than the teapot).</li>
            <li> The only downside is that this can make your cup deceptively cool while the tea inside is still very hot, causing you to potentially burn your tongue a bit.</li>
            <li> It is tiny, but the double walls insulate your hands from heat while letting you see the lovely crema on your shot.</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased these teacups over others</li>
            <li> These are super tiny!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrives carefully packaged (and if you ship things or store fragile things, you can save and reuse the packaging material), however, it does not have any packaging of its own.</li>
            <li> The hold there temperature very well, hot or cold and are attractive as well.</li>
            <li> Double wall allows even the hottest tea or espresso double shot to stay hot, but be comfortable to the touch - and their shape feels &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; in the hand.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them if you have a candle under a glass tea pot.</li>
            <li> I just want to start off saying, I love this little tea cup.</li>
            <li> (you will be curious at how light they are when you pick one up).  </li>
            <li> Too thick on the lips, if I served coffee to a guest on this, I am pretty sure they would question me in their head</li>
            <li> Think of a fragile Christmas ornament and you&#x27;ve pretty much got the thickness of these cups.</li>
            <li> I am ordering a few more &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> That way you are always pouring hot tea and sipping them in the smaller but way cooler looking tea cups.</li>
            <li> We both love them, but will be using them for expresso instead since they are so small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the double wall design, it doesn&#x27;t get hot, so you can pick it up and drink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, but it&#x27;s too light, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to break it.</li>
            <li> I would not wasted the money again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how small these are - drinking tea in small cups magnifies the experience and these will make magic to any tea-drinking situation.</li>
            <li> but since she&#x27;s a tea fanatic I&#x27;m hoping she&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> are glass, but feel light like plastic rather then heavy like crystal.</li>
            <li> Slightly odd shaped for sipping bit quickly adjust to the shape.</li>
            <li> These teacups are traditionally sized and therefore, most would consider them to be too small.</li>
            <li> They will be fantastic little espresso cups though!  </li>
            <li> this is big enough for a double shot yet short enough to slide right in and right out without having to tilt the cup.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tiny, which is what I was looking for, and since it is double walled, the outside doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> I dont know if I will be able to use them for their intended purpose due to their small size.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small enough to fit in your palm, and if you have big hands you could probably wrap your fingers over them.</li>
            <li> Traditionally, it is a social activity to sit together and drink tea.</li>
            <li> The only thing it like other posters have noted the lip is large</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall:  Great buy for the price but you will be disappointed if you want a &amp;#34;tea cup&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> By definition how much it holds is in the title CUP tea cup, this thing doesn&#x27;t hold 2oz much less a cup.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to have closer to an average sized cup but these hold about as much as 1-2 big sips of liquid.</li>
            <li> These look a little strange at first, my sister called them a \\&quot;candle holder\\&quot;</li>
            <li> These are small for espresso or small tea cups, but very cool.</li>
            <li> Seemed a little thin at first but has held up and insulates from hot espresso shots well.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I am careful with it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem as fragile as looks</li>
            <li> I would compare the size to those you would find at a Chinese restaurant, a Japanese tea set, or a little girls tea.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you are doing this while relaxing or reading or working on the computer and such, this is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I accidentally bumped it at very low speeds against other things on the kitchen counter).</li>
            <li> it was only 3.95 but not worth it.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought it would be, but that is my fault.</li>
            <li> In the picture you think it&#x27;ll be roughly....</li>
            <li> These are not big enough and are very small.  </li>
            <li> I ordered only one since I was afraid it could be too small for espresso, but it is exactly the same volume as the Bodum and Ozeri double-walled espresso glasses.</li>
            <li> The amount of tea that goes into each cup is a small amount, and I only drink out of these when I have made a kettle to refill.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small and really fragile</li>
            <li> Should have listened to other reviews!</li>
            <li> The only thing is that is very small</li>
            <li> I was looking for stronger replacement for broken cup for Chinese stile tea drinking, bought in China.</li>
            <li> Obviously, they are delicate, but I haven&#x27;t broken mine yet</li>
            <li> Yes these are quite small.  </li>
            <li> They came via USPS in a small box,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it at least a few feet</li>
            <li> That said, the shape of the curve makes it slightly difficult to drink from properly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> i was using a small beaker but that would burn my fingers when i removed the cup.</li>
            <li> I was reading some tea books showing tasters and their setup with small sampling cups, so it gave me an idea, a small cup</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cup is really small, holds 80 ml which is about 2.7 oz.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried brewing tea in this cup because it&#x27;s just too small for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels very fragile, I&#x27;m afraid to drink out of it.</li>
            <li> I mean if you are serving tea to a baby</li>
            <li> These cups are very small and are not made of all glass</li>
            <li> These are very very very small.</li>
            <li> Very small</li>
            <li> that is, they are very small.</li>
            <li> They are a neat design concept, much less expensive than what you can fin din Target, etc, BUT they do not look as swanky/high end in person as they do on-line.  </li>
            <li> They are delicate and thin.  </li>
            <li> Very delicate.  </li>
            <li> when guests come it feels like you are rationing their portion and have to continue to poor at every sip.  </li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t broken on me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken mine yet, but I also haven&#x27;t dropped them or banged them around.</li>
            <li> This is a slower method of drinking tea, so if you are in a hurry, you may find it frustrating.</li>
            <li> Difficult to drink from...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy sturdy -</li>
            <li> I hate when someone put&#x27;s tea CUP, when it&#x27;s NOT.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an adorable little double walled tea cup which will get a lot of oohs and awww.  But it hold about one drop of tea and when guests come it feels like you are rationing their portion and have to continue to poor at every sip.  I would not wasted the money again.</li>
            <li> adorable, beautiful, but tiny. very tiny.</li>
            <li> Got this for my roommate, she loved it! Such a cute design.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Love them.  Makes drinking my tea a special occasion everytime. Recommended as a must have with glass tea pot for Blooming teas</li>
            <li> Tasting cups...small but elegant vessels for drinking tea.</li>
            <li> This a very tiny cute tea cup. I have fun time having tea in this cup. If you are looking for a huge mug this is not for you but if you want something fancy it might work well as did for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and loved it so much that I had to order another one for myself. Great price!</li>
            <li> I was looking for stronger replacement for broken cup for Chinese stile tea drinking, bought in China. These came twice bigger (two sips versus one sip) than mine, but right form; and my friends actually like this size better. They look stronger and of good quality.</li>
            <li> This little cup is perfect for one shot of espresso. It is tiny, but the double walls insulate your hands from heat while letting you see the lovely crema on your shot. Obviously, they are delicate, but I haven&#x27;t broken mine yet and I&#x27;ve been using them regularly for a couple of months now.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought it would be, but that is my fault. Arrived well wrapped in a box with padding. Works well to insulate my espresso shots.</li>
            <li> Slightly odd shaped for sipping bit quickly adjust to the shape. Very good value and very durable.  End of the day...recommended.  These are small for espresso or small tea cups, but very cool.</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased these teacups over others I was considering because I really like how the double-walled glass looks. However, the double wall also does a really good job of insulating the outer wall of the cup when it&#x27;s full of scalding liquid, so you can pick up your cup without burning your fingers. The only downside is that this can make your cup deceptively cool while the tea inside is still very hot, causing you to potentially burn your tongue a bit. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great design.</li>
            <li> Yes these are quite small.  I took a picture with an egg in one to provide better perspective.  They will be fantastic little espresso cups though!  Double walled so that your fingertips won&#x27;t be too hot but keep the beverage warm.  Had a shipping issue but Vandue was quick to respond to emails.  They came via USPS in a small box, figured there was just one per box as they&#x27;d be quite fragile I imagined.  But both were in their own box wrapped in bubble wrap.  Neither broke.</li>
            <li> These teacups are traditionally sized and therefore, most would consider them to be too small. They are absolutely beautiful and work wonderfully, although they are somewhat difficult to keep clean and require you to shine them before use.</li>
            <li> I really like the looks and feel of this cup. It&#x27;s crazy sturdy - I&#x27;ve dropped it at least a few feet and it hasn&#x27;t broken on me. That said, the shape of the curve makes it slightly difficult to drink from properly. I bought something very similar to replace it, but I still use this one on occasion.</li>
            <li> tiny. dainty. will probably never use this for tea.</li>
            <li> I would like to say that these glasses are cute, but somewhat uncomfortable to use to drink from it. They look like adorable candle holders and I think that&#x27;s how the seller should try to advertise them. Too thick on the lips, if I served coffee to a guest on this, I am pretty sure they would question me in their head why was I serving them coffee on a candle holder</li>
            <li> It is cool looking and all but its a lot smaller then I expected wouldn&#x27;t recommend for drinking more than about a shot glass worth</li>
            <li> These cups are very small and are not made of all glass (you will be curious at how light they are when you pick one up).  Shipping was surprisingly free and very fast, and each cup was overly-wrapped with paper and surrounded by Styrofoam in a sturdy box via USPS.  These look a little strange at first, my sister called them a \\&quot;candle holder\\&quot; but once I poured some tea into it for her, she changed her mind and told me to pour more tea, describing it as \\&quot;Really neat and pretty\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s not noticeable that these are double walled until you pour something into and you discover how very pretty and elegant they are. I really enjoy how small these are - drinking tea in small cups magnifies the experience and these will make magic to any tea-drinking situation.</li>
            <li> Double wall allows even the hottest tea or espresso double shot to stay hot, but be comfortable to the touch - and their shape feels &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; in the hand.  They arrived much soon than promised date.</li>
            <li> The good: Neat double wall glass cup that gets a lot of impressed inquiries!  Multi use: espresso cup, I use mine to place dipping sauces, etc.  Very inexpensive!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considerations: THIS IS NOT A TEACUP!  These are super tiny!  and literally will give you 1 big swallow of tea if filled to the brim. Unless you have a tea house where you do samples, do not get these for tea.  They are delicate and thin.  I haven&#x27;t broken mine yet, but I also haven&#x27;t dropped them or banged them around. Love them to put Asian, Indian, or Latin dish dipping sauces and guests think they are really cool.  You could use them for a shot glass as well or serving hot saki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  Great buy for the price but you will be disappointed if you want a &amp;#34;tea cup&amp;#34;.  These are not big enough and are very small.  They are a neat design concept, much less expensive than what you can fin din Target, etc, BUT they do not look as swanky/high end in person as they do on-line.  But they are still worth the money.</li>
            <li> They are great to drink tea in. Though they do feel extremely thin and light.</li>
            <li> I plan to use this as an espresso shot glass for my Nespresso. It came well packaged and arrived with another cup without damage. It arrived a day earlier than the earliest estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would recommend is that they put in a packing slip with the order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, but it&#x27;s too light, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to break it. It&#x27;s tiny, which is what I was looking for, and since it is double walled, the outside doesn&#x27;t get hot. Keeps the tea warm for a while. I like this cup, I just wish it was a bit heavier.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of 2 for my gal pal for Christmas. I haven&#x27;t given them to her yet, but since she&#x27;s a tea fanatic I&#x27;m hoping she&#x27;ll love them. They are as some of these reviews say--thin. One drop or bounce and these are bound to break. Think of a fragile Christmas ornament and you&#x27;ve pretty much got the thickness of these cups. They&#x27;re small enough to fit in your palm, and if you have big hands you could probably wrap your fingers over them. Given this knowledge I still find these glasses to be beautiful and a good addition for a tea set. They really are beautiful and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Super small so ideal for expresso, for tea it is not so convenient.  But they are so cute!</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot I really love the Teaology Luna Double Wall Borosilicate tea/Espresso Cup, the shipping was fast and the service was great. The only thing is that is very small</li>
            <li> Holds the same amount as a shot glass. They look as good as they do in their picture. I would highly recommend them if you have a candle under a glass tea pot. That way you are always pouring hot tea and sipping them in the smaller but way cooler looking tea cups. They are also perfect espresso cups.</li>
            <li> Great little cups that feel well made and look good! They are perfect replacements for my espresso maker shot glasses!</li>
            <li> These Tea/Espresso Cups are cute. I bought three and will probably get more at some point. To be perfenctly honest, these favor form over function, but so what? Isnt that why we all have iPhones?  The amount of tea that goes into each cup is a small amount, and I only drink out of these when I have made a kettle to refill.&lt;br /&gt;They are glass, but feel light like plastic rather then heavy like crystal. If you are buying these because of how cute they look when you are drinking tea or coffee-you will be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I had expected. I mean if you are serving tea to a baby I&#x27;m sure this would be great. Great for taste testing though... Nice little teaser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very durable. Dropped it on the floor and just bounced back.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for to add to my tea set.</li>
            <li> I ordered only one since I was afraid it could be too small for espresso, but it is exactly the same volume as the Bodum and Ozeri double-walled espresso glasses. It is different from those in that it is much shorter and wider, which is actually kind of cool, but there&#x27;s also much more distance between the inner and outer glass walls, so that should probably keep the espresso hotter longer.</li>
            <li> Awesome love it Very good service!THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Small and really fragile</li>
            <li> Beautiful perfect just the style and amount of serving I was looking for. They are very pretty they should be a must have for everyone!</li>
            <li> Seemed a little thin at first but has held up and insulates from hot espresso shots well.</li>
            <li> I just want to start off saying, I love this little tea cup. It looks very nice and I like the suspended look of the tea when its in the cup. I find that it is great for me as I place it on my desk when I am studying along with my 28oz tea pot. I would compare the size to those you would find at a Chinese restaurant, a Japanese tea set, or a little girls tea. If you truly enjoy tea (not just a tea bag in a cup but loose quality tea ), this is perfect. It&#x27;s small so you can enjoy the tea and the flavor it offers.</li>
            <li> These are very very very small. Gave as a gift and they thought that they were candle holders. Neat idea but need to be bigger.</li>
            <li> These cups are really cute but they are so much smaller than I antisipated. I was hoping to have closer to an average sized cup but these hold about as much as 1-2 big sips of liquid. I dont know if I will be able to use them for their intended purpose due to their small size.  It would not make sense to serve more tea, coffee, or what have you after each sip. Too small but real cute.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expect but it&#x27;s cute, I still love it. Feels very fragile, I&#x27;m afraid to drink out of it.</li>
            <li> In the picture you think it&#x27;ll be roughly.... Bigger!  I got it and I think my jaw hit the floor!  Since its double walled you get about 2 swallows from the cup so I suppose its great for Espresso but its really a double walled, wide shot glass!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still very cute and I found a use for it!</li>
            <li> Should have listened to other reviews! Very small but I will use it for tea lights!</li>
            <li> I hate when someone put&#x27;s tea CUP, when it&#x27;s NOT. By definition how much it holds is in the title CUP tea cup, this thing doesn&#x27;t hold 2oz much less a cup. It sits in my bathroom with a candle in it...it was only 3.95 but not worth it. I feel they shouldn&#x27;t use the picture they do because it&#x27;s misleading. I would not be back, this is to misleading and I just can&#x27;t trust someone who knows this is smaller then an espresso &amp;#34; cup&amp;#34; anyway. Just misleading.</li>
            <li> Light weight, elegant, and simple. I use mine for tea and liquor. I only hand wash these, so I can&#x27;t speak on the topic of dishwasher survival.</li>
            <li> Difficult to drink from...</li>
            <li> My husband loves tea and I thought these would be perfect for him when he brews Chinese tea leaves. We both love them, but will be using them for expresso instead since they are so small. Two sips of tea and it&#x27;s finished.</li>
            <li> Works well with a pot that holds about 10-16 oz of tea the reason being I can keep the lid on my pot and keep my tea warm longer while only drinking what I want at the moment. The only thing it like other posters have noted the lip is large but once you get used to it its fine. I am ordering a few more &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I use this to drink my night time tea. I bought the tea pot off this website also!</li>
            <li> These cups are adorable. I just received the  today. This company has been good to me. They&#x27;re great. Super fast delivery. The cups are very cute. I made some Cuban coffee and they look great</li>
            <li> I used these cups for a tea party with my granddaughters. They are small but the tea looked like it was peacefully floating in mid air. I love them!</li>
            <li> Great buy.  exactly what I expected.  Great for small amounts of tea.</li>
            <li> perfect fit. i have a DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Machine and there is a very low distance between the portafilter and the drip tray. this is big enough for a double shot yet short enough to slide right in and right out without having to tilt the cup. i was using a small beaker but that would burn my fingers when i removed the cup. this double walled glass is cool to the touch even with the boiling hot espresso inside. it is one solid piece of glass so you don&#x27;t have to worry about condensation inside the double walled glass unlike the Bodum Pavina glasses. the delivery of this product came so fast i did not know what it was when i got the package. it came in a day or two from the day i ordered it. i could not be more pleased with this product. the only critique i have is it comes in a set of 4 for $12 bucks and i ordered 1 for $4. i wish i bought the set because i am so satisfied with this teaology glass. but that is more my fault then a fault with the product.</li>
            <li> I was reading some tea books showing tasters and their setup with small sampling cups, so it gave me an idea, a small cup so I can drink and taste tea, without having to wait for the teapot to cool off or put the tea in a bigger cup (which cools off faster than the teapot). This is a slower method of drinking tea, so if you are in a hurry, you may find it frustrating. On the other hand, if you are doing this while relaxing or reading or working on the computer and such, this is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cup is really small, holds 80 ml which is about 2.7 oz. That&#x27;s about 1/3rd of a standard cup (8 oz). I always brew the tea elsewhere. I haven&#x27;t tried brewing tea in this cup because it&#x27;s just too small for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the double wall design, it doesn&#x27;t get hot, so you can pick it up and drink. And because it is open up top, it cools off faster than your teapot, so you can keep drinking hot tea (drink this, fill it again, and repeat). Depending on how well your teapot retains heat, you don&#x27;t have to drink room temperature tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it multiple times daily for about a month now, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues. I am careful with it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem as fragile as looks (I accidentally bumped it at very low speeds against other things on the kitchen counter). This is the second Borosilicate item I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;m becoming a fan of the material for tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrives carefully packaged (and if you ship things or store fragile things, you can save and reuse the packaging material), however, it does not have any packaging of its own. So if you are planning to give this as a gift, you may want to send it to yourself and prepare it for the gift set.</li>
            <li> Very delicate.  I&#x27;ve used borosilicate lab ware before and had higher hopes for toughness from these guys, BUT, if you take good care of them, they are very nice to use.  The hold there temperature very well, hot or cold and are attractive as well.</li>
            <li> These are &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; tea cups - that is, they are very small. Drinking tea is not the same as drinking coffee. Rather than having a huge cup, you keep the teapot nearby and pour cups frequently. Traditionally, it is a social activity to sit together and drink tea. For that purpose, these provide great insulation and great aesthetics.</li>
            <li> Among the best tea cups I have ever used.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful simple cups. Love them and no hands getting burned either!</li>
            <li> Great little tea cups. I use them every day.</li>
            <li> The glasses are a good size and do not get hot to burn your fingers with tea, but are very light and do no feel sturdy or heavy at all, almost have the feeling of being so delicate you could crush them in</li>
