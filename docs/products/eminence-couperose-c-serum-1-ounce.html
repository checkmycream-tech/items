            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>Skin looks great for the first time in years!</li>
            <li>This is hands-down the most effective treatment for my rosacea that I&#x27;ve found to date.  </li>
            <li>Wow this is the best C serum I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>Have beeing using it for many years.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks, my rosacea-skin looks and feels way better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this as my morning moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love this serum...feels wonderful on and my essential oils absorb better with this serum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I also am sure to drink a TON of water as well.</li>
            <li>This is a serum I love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that my skin didn&#x27;t get so damaged when I had acne.</li>
            <li>I have used many skin care serums and moisturizers during the year.</li>
            <li>The Eminence line is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I had bought this product from my dermatologist&#x27;s office and paid more for it.  </li>
            <li>maybe i need to use it more often</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if people realize that patting product on gets a more even distribution than smearing it all over??</li>
            <li>Many thanks to the person who took the time to figure out this very nice product.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin as well as all skin types.</li>
            <li>but I feel that my skin is looking so much better and starting to glow beautifully.</li>
            <li>BTW: The other Eminence products are excellent also.</li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea and Eminence Couperose-C Serum works as well, or better, than the prescription medicine I had.</li>
            <li>so I feel very comfortable applying it on my face and having it absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>This serum has made a huge difference in my complexion.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>Then I use some coconut oil after during the winter and it keeps my skin looking fresh &amp; moist!</li>
            <li>but I am old as dirt and have amazing skin</li>
            <li>The tiniest drop covers my entire face and a bottle lasts me a good 3-4 months.  </li>
            <li>This Couperosa-c serum feels better on my skin than the Acai Booster because it really absorbs unlike the Acai Booster.</li>
            <li>I have a mild form of rosacea.</li>
            <li>Every ingredient is natural and I am familiar with most of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>my sweet red rose whip moisturizer and BAM in the am</li>
            <li>The other products I&#x27;ve tried have also been great such as the sweet red rose cleanser, rosewhip moisturizer and the calming arnica masque are all fantastic!</li>
            <li>My face skin is even and calm now.</li>
            <li>This is great product I have used this for a few years.</li>
            <li>After 7-10 days of using this amazing product I started to see a big difference in my skin apperance.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really worth it.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin look brighter and fresh.</li>
            <li>Powerful serum giving proven results.</li>
            <li>Just not the right product for me.</li>
            <li>I have used this serum for years and it is hands down the best facial serum.</li>
            <li>It was OK, has natural ingredients, but I do not see much value in it.</li>
            <li>Have not had luck with many products, but this one definitely minimizes the veins.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USING THIS MOSTLY ON MY NECK AND UPPER CHEST AREA WHERE DAMAGE WAS FROM SUN BATHING AND TANNING BEDS</li>
            <li>It makes the skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>If my problems continue to diminsh at this rate I can only say this was more than I hoped for.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it contains only natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>However, I am really surprised that once put together, they are working nicely to shrink and fade away my red veins.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super sensitive skin and there was no reaction.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works wonders.  </li>
            <li>Now I use it on my whole face and it is working wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a very silky serum and smells of peppermint,</li>
            <li>This is my absolutely nuber 1 product from Eninence.</li>
            <li>This oil/serum is very moisturising and healing.</li>
            <li>Really makes me skin glow</li>
            <li>It seems to make my face really brighten up.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really afford to keep buying it</li>
            <li>I had so much acne and scars and slowing</li>
            <li>Initially tried the eight greens serum, but it is almost too rich for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>In fact, most people have no idea I am over 60, but think, due to my complexion that I am in my 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I chose this particular Eminence serum product for my type of skin concern.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using it my face has benefitted highly from the serum.</li>
            <li>Not a complaint, just a forewarning</li>
            <li>I like this one more than the Acai Booster Firm skin serum by Eminence</li>
            <li>Using it has decreased greatly my need for traditional moisturizers.</li>
            <li>and my skin was freaking out (breaking out, flaking off, super dry, with cystic acne coming in).  </li>
            <li>However, I have very sensitive skin and this product seemed to agitate it.&lt;br /&gt;No issues with the seller.</li>
            <li>There are other facial serums on the market that work much better.</li>
            <li>I love knowing I am using a product that is completely natural, very little needs to be applied,and it works</li>
            <li>It has natural ingredients and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I would order it again, because I have the idea that this is the only product that can help my skin feeling more or less</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth and also helps with any little outbreaks that pop up.</li>
            <li>None of the prescription creams the dermatologist prescribed worked anywhere near as well as this serum.</li>
            <li>after 4 days in the morning and night of use i would say its at least 50% better , its not noticable to anyone else anymore</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t notice that it is helping my facial redness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product because it contains natural</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 38 and oily/combination hyper SENSITIVE skin)</li>
            <li>i have mild redness on my face and this product seems to have calmed it down.</li>
            <li>This serum made a huge difference overnight and just a few days it is almost totally cleared</li>
            <li>The next morning, that side of my face was almost completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li>so nobody is surprised if they experience the same.</li>
            <li>I recently developed rosacea and would get red itchy bumps on my face.</li>
            <li>I started to get broken red blood vessels on my face for some reason i googled and saw this, i am so glad i bought it...</li>
            <li>It helps calm my rosacea and redness and makes my skin feel less dry.  </li>
            <li>It helps with my sensitive, dry, rocacea prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin almost to a point in the winter</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff really works wonders.  I have rosacea, and until now have found that of all the dozens of treatments I&#x27;ve tried, only periodic courses of minocycline (antibiotic) have helped.  Recently I had my worst rosacea flare-up yet, and my wife suggested trying this product.  She ordered it for me and applied it to half of my face.  The next morning, that side of my face was almost completely cleared up.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  Now I use it on my whole face and it is working wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything else -- organic or not, natural or synthetic.  You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.  This is hands-down the most effective treatment for my rosacea that I&#x27;ve found to date.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that it does sting ever-so-slightly on application when your rosacea is particularly bad, but that is fairly mild and subsides within minutes.  And it&#x27;s really worth it.  Not a complaint, just a forewarning so nobody is surprised if they experience the same.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I don&#x27;t have any skin conditions, so maybe that&#x27;s why this product didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I liked the fact that it contains only natural ingredients.  Its a very silky serum and smells of peppermint, but I just couldn&#x27;t see that it was doing anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with rosacea 13 years ago.  Although my symptoms are mild to moderate, this formula has made no difference with regards to redness or broken veins.  I am quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my absolutely nuber 1 product from Eninence. Makes my skin look brighter and fresh. Have beeing using it for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I recently developed rosacea and would get red itchy bumps on my face. None of the prescription creams the dermatologist prescribed worked anywhere near as well as this serum. I keep getting told I have great skin again now that I&#x27;ve found this serum. The other products I&#x27;ve tried have also been great such as the sweet red rose cleanser, rosewhip moisturizer and the calming arnica masque are all fantastic!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, my rosacea-skin looks and feels way better. I have less redness, bumps and flushing after eating certain food is also less. I would order it again, because I have the idea that this is the only product that can help my skin feeling more or less normal.&lt;br /&gt;No reduction in skin flakes though.. If someone knows a solution for those, please let me know!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve ordered this product at least 3 times now. it&#x27;s great, organic vitamin c...my skin is so happy and loves it.</li>
            <li> One quarter of the price I paid at the spa.  This serum has made a huge difference in my complexion.  One ounce lasted me 11 months.  BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I have used this now for over 7 months and have not seen a reduction of forehead lines.  Yet, I have not seen an increase.  So I rate as a three.  As I have not come across anything else to switch to I shall continue with the product.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER not use this</li>
            <li> Small red veins on your face are not attractive.  Have not had luck with many products, but this one definitely minimizes the veins.  I have only used it about 6 nights, but already attention is not drawn to the sides of my nose and the redness in the middle of my chin is fading.  Every ingredient is natural and I am familiar with most of the ingredients.  However, I am really surprised that once put together, they are working nicely to shrink and fade away my red veins.  Many thanks to the person who took the time to figure out this very nice product.</li>
            <li> I use this as an anti-aging and acne redness reducer.  It works great. It does not clog pores and it firms up your skin.</li>
            <li> Almost done with the bottle and seeing no improvement for broken capillaries.  I chose this product because it claimed to help remedy this facial embarrassment.  Also, not as moisturizing as I thought.  There are other facial serums on the market that work much better.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have had rosacea for the years, and this is the&lt;br /&gt;only product that has actually improved it. I order from this company&lt;br /&gt;because they are always prompt on sending the product.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS MOSTLY ON MY NECK AND UPPER CHEST AREA WHERE DAMAGE WAS FROM SUN BATHING AND TANNING BEDS AND IT SEEMS TO BE SLOWLY LESSENING THE PERMANANT REDDENING AND DAMAGE.</li>
            <li> Great product - it helped me to resolve my rosacea problems. My face skin is even and calm now. I combine it with Eminence moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I started to get broken red blood vessels on my face for some reason i googled and saw this, i am so glad i bought it...after 4 days in the morning and night of use i would say its at least 50% better , its not noticable to anyone else anymore but myself..I am so happy thank you!!!</li>
            <li> This serum feels wonderful on the skin.  It helps calm my rosacea and redness and makes my skin feel less dry.  I use it twice a day beneath my moisturizer.  The best part of all is that it is organic so I feel very comfortable applying it on my face and having it absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Using it has decreased greatly my need for traditional moisturizers. My skin feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This oil/serum is very moisturising and healing. If you are looking to avoid wrinkles, or want to reduce the ones you already have, you should give it a try!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my rosacea. It definetely makes my cheeks look less dry. I have a mild form of rosacea. I expected the serum to reduce redness. It actually does but just a bit. I like the sensations though. It smells nice. I use only a drop for the red spots. I am pretty satisfied. I did not expect a miracle. Was delivered earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I started using Eminence products about 10 months ago. Initially tried the eight greens serum, but it is almost too rich for my combination skin. Researched the Couperose serum and decided to give it a try. After 2 months, I like the way my skin feels. Late in the day, my oily areas are still controlled, and my dry areas aren&#x27;t dry. Even in the harsh winter weather. A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin as well as all skin types. Powerful serum giving proven results. Skin looks great for the first time in years!</li>
            <li> This serum makes me a fan of Eminence products. It helps with my sensitive, dry, rocacea prone skin. This serum calms my skin and minimizes the look of broken capillaries on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea and Eminence Couperose-C Serum works as well, or better, than the prescription medicine I had. I use it once, in the morning, under my make-up. I&#x27;d highly recommend it. BTW: The other Eminence products are excellent also.</li>
            <li> This is great product I have used this for a few years. It makes the skin feel smooth and soft. One bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Love this as my morning moisturizer.  The tiniest drop covers my entire face and a bottle lasts me a good 3-4 months.  Really an excellent product and worth a try if you&#x27;re on the fence about spending the money.</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; I think it helps with my skin regimen.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant getting this because it&#x27;s so difficult to try to find the right Eminence serum. I love this serum...feels wonderful on and my essential oils absorb better with this serum. I like this one more than the Acai Booster Firm skin serum by Eminence but maybe  because my skin does not need the firm skin serum since I&#x27;m not at this stage of aging yet. I bought the Acai Booster serum because of the anti aging and not for the firmer skin benefits. This Couperosa-c serum feels better on my skin than the Acai Booster because it really absorbs unlike the Acai Booster.</li>
            <li> I chose this particular Eminence serum product for my type of skin concern. It&#x27;s okay. Makes my skin soft but I really don&#x27;t notice that it is helping my facial redness.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Eminence Products. However, I have very sensitive skin and this product seemed to agitate it.&lt;br /&gt;No issues with the seller. Just not the right product for me.</li>
            <li> !I am an esthetician and I have oily and acne prone skin and in the summer months I use different moisturizers. In the summer I tend to go lighter and use water based moisturizers.  Eminence is great for my skin type and the best part is that their products are derived from fruits and vegetable.  I was introduced to Eminence while a student at Miller Motte Esthetic school located in Cary, NC and have been hooked ever since.&lt;br /&gt;www.frommetouessentials.com</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I get rosacea in&lt;br /&gt;the wintertime with the dry heat in the house.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this and have found a significant&lt;br /&gt;improvement.  I only use it on my cheeks.  I love&lt;br /&gt;this product because it contains natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I try to avoid pharmaceutical drugs whenever possible.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for years and it is hands down the best facial serum. You can not go wrong with any Eminence product.</li>
            <li> My redness has gotten better since trying this product!</li>
            <li> Wow this is the best C serum I&#x27;ve ever found. Really makes me skin glow</li>
            <li> I use this after i get out of the shower &amp; it just keeps my face moist. Then I use some coconut oil after during the winter and it keeps my skin looking fresh &amp; moist! I have very dry and sensitive skin almost to a point in the winter my face looks like it has wind burn and this stuff helps coupled with using a humidifier all night. I do use this stuff during the day sometimes too if my face looks a little dry and then i follow that with a greasy weleda skin food moisturizer and it seems to lock in the moisture of this serum. I do use this in the summertime as well. It seems to make my face really brighten up. I also am sure to drink a TON of water as well. GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I temporarily relocated to the Northeast from So Cal and my skin was freaking out (breaking out, flaking off, super dry, with cystic acne coming in).  This serum made a huge difference overnight and just a few days it is almost totally cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super sensitive skin and there was no reaction.  Very very very pleased!</li>
            <li> Product came on time in 4 days. I am 28 year old male and in past year developed some red spots on my nose and around my eyes. Also I noticed some capillars which started spreading around my nose and face. After 7-10 days of using this amazing product I started to see a big difference in my skin apperance. If my problems continue to diminsh at this rate I can only say this was more than I hoped for. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Finished the bottle, see no change in the broken capillaries . I used it as a moisturiser at night half way through, when I realized that it does not work. It was OK, has natural ingredients, but I do not see much value in it.</li>
            <li> a little weird in the application but smells and looks like fruit juice and skin loves it!</li>
            <li> Perfect product! Tried to use some thing else but worse</li>
            <li> My husband loves to use this product for his Rosacea.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the Derma Roller and my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> use this along with cleanser and moisturizer from this line. do your research as there are many types to choose from!</li>
            <li> Recommend this for anyone who suffers from Rosacea.  Use it with all of the chamomile products from Eminence~ cleanser, moisturizer, serum and masque. Even though they say there is no &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; for rosacea, this comes close.</li>
            <li> This is a serum I love. It helps improve texture and lightens my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve found that my purchase came in a disappointing condition - no seal; no box.&lt;br /&gt;I doubt its authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews of some Eminence products and found that I&#x27;m not the only one who receive suspected products.&lt;br /&gt;What we can do is to find a trustworthy seller.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps.</li>
            <li> Awesome serum.  I can&#x27;t really afford to keep buying it but someday in the future I will treat myself to it.  It helps balance out the skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love knowing I am using a product that is completely natural, very little needs to be applied,and it works</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday! It&#x27;s the best ever. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and also helps with any little outbreaks that pop up.</li>
            <li> I am using this serum along with four other serums. And I can&#x27;t say which ones are working or if it&#x27;s the combination of all serums but I feel that my skin is looking so much better and starting to glow beautifully. I had so much acne and scars and slowing they are fading and my skin is smoothing out. I&#x27;m so glad that my skin didn&#x27;t get so damaged when I had acne. I plan to keep using eminence products because they are organic, chemical-free, gmo-free, and they just smell awesome! I Love Eminence!!!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat organic. I have read that one of the signs of aging comes from all the chemicals we put on our face. Ever read the ingredients in your beauty products? Vitamin c helps correct the damage. I use this product once a day. I just turned 46 today. I don&#x27;t look a day over39.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use &amp; recommend the Eminence products.  I know I am just words on a web page but I am old as dirt and have amazing skin, I think these products are part of the reason why (genetics too, of course)</li>
            <li> Works well for dryness or Rosacea!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I ever want to go without Eminince Courperose-c serum. Since I have been using it my face has benefitted highly from the serum. In fact, most people have no idea I am over 60, but think, due to my complexion that I am in my 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> this keeps the skin supple and great for anti aging</li>
            <li> I have used many skin care serums and moisturizers during the year. The Eminence line is my favorite. It has natural ingredients and makes my skin very soft. I get compliments on my skin and people think I look younger than my 40s. The serum is not miracle against lines but I believe it softens them. I will be staying with the Eminence skin care products.</li>
            <li> I had bought this product from my dermatologist&#x27;s office and paid more for it.  It helps with roseacea, and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> i have mild redness on my face and this product seems to have calmed it down. maybe i need to use it more often (only use it at night). like any topical product, it takes time to notice results, so i guess only time will tell. it does feel good knowing that what i&#x27;m putting on my face is all organic...</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT! I use it at night with my sweet red rose whip moisturizer and BAM in the am I have beautifully toned, moisturized skin.  The age spots are kept at bay (I&#x27;m 38 and oily/combination hyper SENSITIVE skin) and I love this stuff.  It only takes a DROP on a wet hand, mix with other wet hand and PAT all over face and neck.  I wonder if people realize that patting product on gets a more even distribution than smearing it all over?? Pat people. PAT. PAT. PAT.  You will know what I mean after a month (it takes 28 days about, for your skin to turn over so be patient!!)</li>
