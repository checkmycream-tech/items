            <li> Great product with prompt delivery!</li>
            <li> so good! very protection and so shine.</li>
            <li> Great product for smoothing out your hair&#x27;s cuticle. Works on over worked youth hair &amp; gray hair. It makes it feel like it did when you were 10 years old.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. It is hard to find locally, so I tried several other products, but nothing is the same. I have hair that goes to my shoulder blades and I can just blow dry it with a round brush and this and it is nice and full, soft and shiny. It is not heavy or sticky, yet definitely helps style it.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  It makes my hair so silky!</li>
            <li> Makes my dry, brittle, over-processed hair look and feel much healthier. Smells nice too. Wish I could find them at regular stores.</li>
            <li> It only takes a tiny amount to put life back into dry, lifeless hair.  I find it does exactly what the directions say.  I am a woman with very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Not good for me.  Had to give it away.</li>
            <li> Great to keep curls soft</li>
            <li> my favorite hair style product - smooths strands &amp; ads shine &amp; without weighing hair down.  I always get compliments on my hair when I use it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - it does not make your hair feel STIFF.  It does give the hair body - like the way ti makes the hair feel.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this helps it to dry faster and I live in Florida so it helps with the humidity making my hair frizzy</li>
            <li> I bought this in the salon I go to for twice the price.  This product cuts the time it takes to blow dry your hair in half.  It also works as a great styling product.  You don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s in your hair since it is not sticky, waxy, etc.  I was happy to get it though Prime on Amazon for much cheaper and not have to go out to get it. My hairstylist uses this product on everyone&#x27;s hair she blow dries since it protects, dries faster, makes styling easier, and leaves your hair shiny and light as air.</li>
            <li> I have never tried this line of matrix, but it did not cut down the blow drying time. It actually took longer then normal. I only put a pearl size in my hand.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product and of course it is a GREAT product. Loved that when I received it there was also some cool tester perfumes &amp; a tester packet of linen wipes in the packaging. I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
