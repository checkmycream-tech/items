    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is the best!</li>
            <li>For me, Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Moisturizing Night Creme the best creme ever.</li>
            <li>excellent.</li>
            <li>Wonderful stuff and affordable.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>It feels so good and smells good too!</li>
            <li>It even has a very light wonderful smell that reminds me somehow of my childhood.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried soo many creams, and Burt&#x27;s Bees cremes (both day and night) are the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>This product feels so good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this night creme!</li>
            <li>nice product</li>
            <li>Best of all - the ingredients are natural and good for you and your skin.</li>
            <li>Very nice clean smell</li>
            <li>Have used it and love it.  </li>
            <li>My skin always looks better after using it overnight</li>
            <li>I think this creme smells much better and does a better job for my purpose.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>Strong smell for a face product.  </li>
            <li>I am fair complexioned and my skin, as I grow older, has a tendency toward dryness.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely loved it and will be ordering more in the future. :)</li>
            <li>The cream IS \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; as someone here pointed out, almost as if you put Vaseline on, but it&#x27;s a NIGHT cream, so I put it on after an evening shower and it gets absorbed within 1-2 hours, leaving my skin very soft and feeling great in the morning.</li>
            <li>This night cream fits the bill, but its bizarre texture takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>and it is rich and feels luxurious.</li>
            <li>The quality control is sometimes off (maybe 1 out of 10 isn&#x27;t &#x27;mixed&#x27; well--with granules in it and not as much &#x27;creme&#x27; and causes problems--but for the most part, the product is good, and I  am grateful for any moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes swell shut.)</li>
            <li>If you have a fair and dry skin, this product is for you.</li>
            <li>Likely because it is thickened with kaolin, which is a kind of clay, the cream has a consistency somewhere between Crisco and mud.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>It has a fine texture, is soft, and melts into your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have allergy-sensitive eyes and can&#x27;t use most commercial eye cremes or moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure with no chemicals.</li>
            <li>Very concentrated</li>
            <li>Instead of a light, herbal fragrance, this cream has a heavy, synthetic rose scent reminiscent of my grandmother&#x27;s old-school beauty products.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Whole Foods</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all the standard brands, but none have been as beneficial as this particular creme - even those in the Burt&#x27;s Bees line and many whose cost is double and even triple.  </li>
            <li>but when I wake up my face is as soft as a baby&#x27;s bum!</li>
            <li>The fragrance, too, is not what one would expect from a natural product.</li>
            <li>Not sure what the snafu was originally.</li>
            <li>In winter my face gets really dry and this is the only cream that really works for me.  </li>
            <li>Like it but heavy and greasy so it does not take much!</li>
            <li>It is fabulous - nothing negative about it!  </li>
            <li>Before I tried this particular forumla, I had a medicine chest full of useless face cremes that I used on my arms &amp; legs after a workout.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can not use this product as it burns my eyes even though I do not get the cream close to my eyes.  Strong smell for a face product.  Put it in the trash:D(</li>
            <li> I told my wife I am writing a review for her Burt&#x27;s Bees  item.What do you think? Burt&#x27;s Bees is the best! There you  go who can argue with that?</li>
            <li> Like it but heavy and greasy so it does not take much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried soo many creams, and Burt&#x27;s Bees cremes (both day and night) are the best I&#x27;ve found. My oil glands were dried out by the drug Accutane, and until I began using Burt&#x27;s Bees I had crazy dry skin, to the point where in became red and swollen. This product took care of it.</li>
            <li> If you want a totally hydrating creme, Burt&#x27;s bees is the only one to use. I am fair complexioned and my skin, as I grow older, has a tendency toward dryness.  I&#x27;ve used all the standard brands, but none have been as beneficial as this particular creme - even those in the Burt&#x27;s Bees line and many whose cost is double and even triple.  I use it as a day and night creme and my skin glows after I apply it.  It has a fine texture, is soft, and melts into your skin.  Before I tried this particular forumla, I had a medicine chest full of useless face cremes that I used on my arms &amp; legs after a workout.  For me, Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Moisturizing Night Creme the best creme ever.</li>
            <li> as expected. nice product</li>
            <li> excellent. Very concentrated</li>
            <li> Your skin just smiles when you put this on your face. It feels so good and smells good too! All natural no chemicals or nasty ingredients. Burt&#x27;s Bees has done it again!</li>
            <li> Have used it and love it.  I recommend it.  All worked out finally with the shipping. Not sure what the snafu was originally.</li>
            <li> As a Retin-A user, I require a heavy night cream with real staying power; otherwise, I wake up with a face that&#x27;s a flaky mess. This night cream fits the bill, but its bizarre texture takes some getting used to. Likely because it is thickened with kaolin, which is a kind of clay, the cream has a consistency somewhere between Crisco and mud. The fragrance, too, is not what one would expect from a natural product. Instead of a light, herbal fragrance, this cream has a heavy, synthetic rose scent reminiscent of my grandmother&#x27;s old-school beauty products. In spite of these things, however, the cream makes it all the way through the night, and I wake up with skin as moisturized as it was when I went to bed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream esxclusively for years.  It is fabulous - nothing negative about it!  The cream is not greasy feeling - just right.  My skin always looks better after using it overnight AND it lasts forever since you don&#x27;t need to use alot.  Best of all - the ingredients are natural and good for you and your skin. It even has a very light wonderful smell that reminds me somehow of my childhood.  Clare</li>

            <li> Absolutely loved it and will be ordering more in the future. :)</li>
            <li> I love this night creme! I have previously tried Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Night Creme which was too watery and thin for my dry skin. I think this creme smells much better and does a better job for my purpose. I am in my mid-twenties have very dry patches on my cheeks &amp; chin and I like to keep the area around my eyes ultra hydrated. A little goes a long way and makes your skin very soft. I bought this at Whole Foods but it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon so I&#x27;ll order it from here next time. On nights that I use [[ASIN:B004JVOTBM Aztec Secret - Indian Healing Clay, 1 lb clay]] and apply this creme after, I feel like I have just gotten a professional facial!</li>
            <li> This product feels so good on my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I love it. It&#x27;s pure with no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  Some I like.  Some I don&#x27;t.  This is one I would not buy again.  It is really, really thick and leaves a greasy sheen on your face.  The name \\&quot;Beeswax\\&quot; should have given me a clue.  I prefer a thinner face cream.</li>
            <li> In winter my face gets really dry and this is the only cream that really works for me.  It feels a bit greasy when I put it on but when I wake up my face is as soft as a baby&#x27;s bum! LOL</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  Very nice clean smell and it is rich and feels luxurious.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff and affordable. Hard to find in stores that sell Burt&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> The cream IS \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; as someone here pointed out, almost as if you put Vaseline on, but it&#x27;s a NIGHT cream, so I put it on after an evening shower and it gets absorbed within 1-2 hours, leaving my skin very soft and feeling great in the morning. Would definitely buy again as soon as I run out. If you have a fair and dry skin, this product is for you.</li>
