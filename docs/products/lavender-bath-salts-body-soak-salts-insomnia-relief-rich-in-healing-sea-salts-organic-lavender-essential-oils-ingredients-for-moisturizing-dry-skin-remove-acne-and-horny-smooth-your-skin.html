            <li> I bought to enjoy after a long days hard work .</li>

            <li> Great product. Smells great. Left my skin very soft!</li>
            <li> Loooooovvve the smell of this bath salt. It&#x27;s a great relaxation when I put this in the bathtub.  Smell stays there for a long time. Salt dissolves pretty quick.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing!!Shipping was fast and I received it pretty quick.I could literally smell the scent of Lavender through the box it was shipped in and it smelled great!I am a Lavender fiend because of the benefits it provides me and when I seen this during a promotional offer I had to buy it!I love taking baths and I do not get to take those very often they are more like a 10-15minute shower now that I have a toddler.So I do not get the luxury of soaking for over an hour or so in the tub and relax anymore.I was very excited to try this out and was able to when my daughter went to bed.The directions calls for 1/2 a cup of bath salts per bath and sadly you only get 2 baths with this jar.But I really enjoyed my bath this lavender bath salts were amazing.I felt so relaxed and any aches or pains were washed away.It was a real treat to soak in this bath salt mix.I just love the way the smells were released while the bath salts dissolved.Great way to unwind after a long day or just pamper yourself.This bath salts from ZenBath comes in a 16oz jar and contains only 100% sea salt, vitamin e oil, &amp; Lavender essential oils.No other additives or anything else added to it.It is also made in USA.I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t have time to bathe (kids&#x3D;no time) but I did make time to try this out and it was amazing. I never really like the smell of lavender but this was not bad at it. Definitely made me relax.</li>
            <li> These bath salts are amazing, and smells great!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like a bath after a long day and these bath salts make it glorious!  If you like lavender you will love these.  The scent is instantly relaxing!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, exactly as described. Recommended!</li>
            <li> These bath salts smell wonderful and make the bath like a spa.  This is a much deserved luxury.  Don&#x27;t want to be without.</li>
            <li> Oh - this smells great!  Leaves me so soft!</li>
            <li> This is a very refreshing bath salt. I usually take a warm bath when im feeling sore from working out and it has made it better. Would recommend to anyone who likes to have a refreshing bath</li>
            <li> While the product itself is nice - the amount you recieve for the price is a bit astronomical. There is only enough for approximately two baths. There are similar, cheaper products available.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Love it!</li>
            <li> This is such a Great value! Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells divine! Nice sized jar of salts!  Has made bath time even more relaxing!</li>
            <li> These are excellent bath salts. They are great to relax in. I&#x27;ve even used them on a sprained ankle once - poured some in a big pan of hot water and dipped my feet in.&lt;br /&gt;They also smell great!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to complain here, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I loved this product, after a long stressful day I put some in a bath and just got to relax. It is quite a large jar too so I have plenty left for several more baths. It dissolved quickly and left my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is such an awesome product. My wife loves it, its very relaxing and it looks and smells great. We really enjoy taking a bath with these salts and they are very refreshing. Great quality product and great presentation!</li>

            <li> These smell so good and make my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> Just used this today.  I was having a terrible day and so I took a bath. I was soothed and comforted by the light scent of lavender and my whole body was soft when I emerged feeling relaxed and calm from the tub.  I don&#x27;t soak in the tub often for lack of time. But I am so glad I had this around today. I feel so much better.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> These smell so good and I put them in my bath and it smelled awesome! I love these bath salts! I would recommend these to others for sure!</li>
            <li> Great on my skin and the smell reminds me of the spa.</li>
            <li> Very soothing. This is great after a long day.</li>
            <li> I use this product at least 3 times a week.  The lavender really sets into easing the mind and brings you to such a peaceful place.  My skin feels so soft and smooth afterward.  Definitely a product to help you reach your maximum zen!!</li>
            <li> As a mother of 3 little kids, this lavender bath salts make my bath time so relaxing, it&#x27;s always been a perfect thing to do to end a busy day.</li>
            <li> I am beyond impressed with this product!  I love the smell and it makes for an awesome spa time.  The packaging is easy to open and the crystal are simple to use.  I love how the aroma awakens me.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first. Lavender is not my favorite scent. Instantly, before I opened the package I could smell it. It has a wonderful relaxing scent. Not too overwhelming either.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful in the bath, and was great to soak my feet in as well.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Bought another one for a friend and she LOVES it! This is a great gift idea. Still using my container. :)&lt;br /&gt;I love this Bath salt by ZenBath. It is very effective. I started going to the gym after a very long break and as expected had very sore muscles. A nice soak in these bath salts helped me relieve tension and muscle discomfort. I agree with other reviewers, the quantity is quite generous and as claimed, a little goes a long way with this nourishing skin care formula. I also like the container it comes in, so easy to store. I use Epsom salts regularly but this bath salt is definitely more than that. Definitely buying more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> Smells great! I love it!!! The jar came in a box without any cushion. I was scared it was broken but it&#x27;s fine. I am excited to bathe with it!!!! :-)</li>
            <li> They smell great and obsorbed easily in the water making a refreshing and relaxing bath. Very soothing smell</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; lavender fragrance and my bath feels so luxurious.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product with lavender scent that last. These are great for those nights you just need to relax. ( for me almost every night) A little goes a long way so you don&#x27;t need to use much. Love them and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> So relaxing and lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was offered this at a low cost for my biggest review. The smell was absolutely amazing. I used about half for my bath and added some regular Epson salt. My skin felt great afterwards. It&#x27;s perfect for your bath before bed. The lavender is very relaxing.</li>
