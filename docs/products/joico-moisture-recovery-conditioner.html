            <li> Been using it for 20 years!  Need I say more.  I&#x27;m white with thick coarse curly long hair.</li>
            <li> Very thick and makes my hair so soft! Great deep conditioning</li>
            <li> salon products at discount price.  I have dry sometimes frizzy hair and this conditioner is the best.</li>
            <li> Pump broke after a few pumps of use.</li>
            <li> The product itself works great but they sent a pump that doesn&#x27;t go with the conditioner. The last time that happened I didn&#x27;t get one at all. The pump needs to go with the conditioner. Someone please try it before you pack it. I&#x27;d give it 3 stars but I like the conditioner, so the reason for the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a pricey conditioner, yet I&#x27;ve bought four bottles of it. I love how this conditioner leaves my hair. It remains moisturized days after I condition it, and it has a lovely sheen. I think I&#x27;ll keep using this one for a while. Also, the price is much cheaper on Amazon, which is surprising since Amazon usually charges quite a bit more than the stores. I have type 4 natural hair.</li>
            <li> A great product for a great price! It conditions without being heavy/sticky in my fine, silver, waist length hair, and has a pretty/light fragrance. I always have a bottle in my closet and one in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have to say, im always skeptical when ordering from a seller through amazing because I hadnt always had the best outcome but not this time. Im a hair stylist and was looking for a great deep conditioner and this product is amazing! I tried this product on a few different hair types and it didnt fail me, I love it :)!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my bleached hair and really helps get out tangles.  I use it with a shower brush and my hair has never been better.</li>
            <li> Everything was great except I had ordered 2 bottles of conditioner and the company shipped a bottle of shampoo and conditioner. Not a big issue as I use the shampoo when I need it.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter uses this conditioner exclusively and loves how it make her hair feel.</li>
            <li> Always my go too for dry damaged hair. Smells amazing too.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the stuff. Whatever it is/does.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and have trouble finding it locally. Fast delivery and good price. Will order from this seller again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have had problems with my coarse, dry, wild hair for years. Then I found Wen (Chaz Dean) and Joico and I finally have tamed the Beast! Getcha some, you can Thank me later.</li>
            <li> I have very dry coarse hair, but this conditioner has made it feel much softer than anything Ive ever used. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Actually found it At Tj Max for cheaper than amazon so bought it there. I have course wavy, frizzy hair and it really helps me tame it! You could also leave a tad in as a leave-in-conditioner</li>
