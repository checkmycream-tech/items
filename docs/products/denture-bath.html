            <li>I ordered the Denture Bath and it is well-made, sturdy, and most of all, opaque!</li>
            <li>THEY FIT GREAT IN THE CASE</li>
            <li>This provides a great place to clean my mouth guard.</li>
            <li>I feel very fortunate</li>
            <li>Buy 6 at a time to make shipping cost worthwhile.</li>
            <li>so was an okay deal.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This product was the right size as well as a good buy.</li>
            <li>After contacting the company, they were super nice and understanding.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t so sure about the plastic crease hinge, but it seems to be holding up fine.</li>
            <li>good large size, able to fit my husbands dentures in.</li>
            <li>More importantly, the lid does not seal to the body.</li>
            <li>The container is sturdy and the insert makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Pull out basket removes for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li>And, it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>We both acknowledged the return shipping costs were more than the items were worth.  </li>
            <li>Verify the color before ordering (if it&#x27;s important to you)</li>
            <li>Point #2:  Colonial Medical is very nice to work with.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to clean an invisalign retainer.  </li>
            <li>Will be returning them for a full refund.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt that the color is very pretty either.</li>
            <li>It is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned and I especially like the removable basket that makes it easy to preclean dentures prior to inserting the into the main tub.</li>
            <li>Colors are bright, you won&#x27;t loose these.</li>
            <li>It was worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>This product is absolute junk!</li>
            <li>First off, I thought I was getting 4 denture baths as there was 4 of them in the picture.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as stated on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>but it was too large.</li>
            <li>very plesed with item</li>
            <li>Even if the thin plastic that serves as the hinge breaks, the lid will still stay on, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast, free shipping, and great price.</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>Others have been undersized; these are amply sized, clip closed securely and do the job well.</li>
            <li>The hinges on others I&#x27;ve had over the years tended to break during normal use.  </li>
            <li>The plastic is much sturdier than most, and not the brittle type of plastic usually used in these products.  </li>
            <li>Take up less room than many similar products.</li>
            <li>This container makes spillage a lot less likely, and looks much better too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I purchased several because the price is so reasonable</li>
            <li>My husband had been using a regular clear plastic box for his dentures.</li>

            <li> One negative, It is very tight for my detures.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.  The container is sturdy and the insert makes it easy to use.  I purchased several because the price is so reasonable and I keep one in the bathroom and in the bedroom.  I also like the multiple colors.</li>
            <li> Product does the job.  Colors are bright, you won&#x27;t loose these. Take up less room than many similar products. Pull out basket removes for easy cleaning.  Hinges usually last a bit over a year.  Buy 6 at a time to make shipping cost worthwhile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plastic, yes, but not cheaply made.  The hinges on others I&#x27;ve had over the years tended to break during normal use.  Not this one.  S&amp;H might seem a little expensive when you order just one, but I got around that by ordering 3 instead of one &#x27;cause S&amp;H remained about the same.  Given the quality, I probably won&#x27;t have to buy another during my lifetime.</li>
            <li> very plesed with item</li>
            <li> I ordered 6 on advice of prior reviewer. It is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned and I especially like the removable basket that makes it easy to preclean dentures prior to inserting the into the main tub. One negative, It is very tight for my detures. If it were about 1/8\\&quot; wider and deeper I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> returned item it leaks</li>
            <li> This item is convenient for my retainer.  It serves as a great container for cleaning and storage, serving two purposes in one.  I also like the lift out drain cup for rinsing.  This product is inexpensive and the design function was well thought out.</li>
            <li> I got three of them to ease the shipping cost.... so was an okay deal.  This closes nicely and is a good item.</li>
            <li> My husband had been using a regular clear plastic box for his dentures. He left it on the side of the bathroom sink at night. It was not a pleasant sight during my nightly trips there. I ordered the Denture Bath and it is well-made, sturdy, and most of all, opaque! He likes it. It has a little pull-out basket-type insert for placing dentures in before lowering them into the water with the cleansing tablet. And, it allows a user to remove the dentures without getting the hands wet. Very nice. Inexpensive. And, looks good on the bathroom sink!</li>
            <li> Cup is sturdy, attractive color.  Looks like it will last a long time.  It was worth the cost.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> This product is absolute junk! First off, I thought I was getting 4 denture baths as there was 4 of them in the picture. More importantly, the lid does not seal to the body. If you take off a shelf while there is water in it, you are guaranteed to spill some somewhere.  Terrible product!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered two Denture Baths with the purple picture, purposely skipping the other colors. I wanted purple.  When the \\&quot;baths\\&quot; arrived, I received a forrest green one and a brick red one.  After contacting the company, they were super nice and understanding.  Colonial Medical acknowledged the posting on Amazon was confusing.  We both acknowledged the return shipping costs were more than the items were worth.  They agreed to send purple replacements at no cost and allowed me to donate the green and red \\&quot;baths\\&quot; to a senior home.  I&#x27;m a winner.  The senior home is a winner.  And, I believe, Colonial Medical is a winner.  Point #1:  Verify the color before ordering (if it&#x27;s important to you) Point #2:  Colonial Medical is very nice to work with.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to clean an invisalign retainer.  The plastic is much sturdier than most, and not the brittle type of plastic usually used in these products.  And, it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad. He used to keep his dentures in a coffee cup - which was always sitting in a precarious location, waiting to be knocked over. This container makes spillage a lot less likely, and looks much better too.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t so sure about the plastic crease hinge, but it seems to be holding up fine. Even if the thin plastic that serves as the hinge breaks, the lid will still stay on, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast, free shipping, and great price.</li>
            <li> This provides a great place to clean my mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding this product locally -- area pharmacies sold a denture bath but it was too large. This product was the right size as well as a good buy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful size and color. I love it</li>
            <li> Hard to say you &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; a denture bath. It does its job -- just wish I could have chosen the color</li>
            <li> Well made and works as  intended.</li>
            <li> good large size, able to fit my husbands dentures in.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GREAT FOR MY DENTURE WHEN I TAKE THEM OUT THEY FIT GREAT IN THE CASE SO I DID NOT LOOK FOR ANYMORE</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as stated on Amazon.com. It has been in use for about two months with no sign of wear. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these denture baths and I am very disappointed with the product. The lids on both of them would not close properly and kept popping up. Will be returning them for a full refund.</li>
            <li> There is no weakness in the bending. Very durable. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that the color is very pretty either. Great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It is now Aug.13th 2014. I bought only the one and I am still using it. The lid still closes tightly and it is still in one piece. I feel very fortunate I found this.</li>
            <li> Roomier than I expected. The basket lets me keep away from the foaming cleaner and works well to rinse the 2 pieces at once. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied this order</li>
            <li> I use these for soaking my Night Guard. Others have been undersized; these are amply sized, clip closed securely and do the job well.</li>
            <li> THESE WERE A GOOD BUY FOR THE MONEY .NICELY MADE  AND SERVED THE PURPOSE</li>
            <li> Very good quality. Should last a while.</li>
            <li> Holds water, and everything.</li>
    </ol>
