            <li>I ended up giving that bottle to a good friend who wanted to try something and he also liked it.  </li>
            <li>it smells really good and has a nice feel.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use very many moisturizers, as I break out very easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;accelerator\\&quot; lotion is amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing as well.</li>
            <li>We all know you can&#x27;t use oils in tanning beds, so this product is not an oil but rather a very liquidly lotion for spritzing purposes which is awesome!</li>
            <li>Not overly fragrant like some but a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Going to salon and seeing how much they charge per bottle this is the best way to go...</li>
            <li>Had a nice coconut smell and didn&#x27;t burn or tingle.</li>
            <li>I have been going for about 3 weeks already and have a nice tan</li>
            <li>smells good, easy to apply, gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and burn easily.</li>
            <li>Love this product and was thrilled to find it on Amazon,</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Its a good size for the price and the spray bottle works well and is very economical.</li>
            <li>Both of which are smells that I like, but it&#x27;s extremely potent and the odor is still strong HOURS after a good scrubbing in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product!</li>
            <li>Originally I was excited to get this reading all the reviews and the fact that the price was great.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in love with this tanning lotion since I started tanning years ago.</li>
            <li>and I love the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li>I love the scent too</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I recieved a bottle with a flip top dispenser of lotion.</li>
            <li>I was able to oder it here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It all arrived safe &amp; sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I love this product and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>Love Love Love it.</li>
            <li>Glad Amezon carries it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my ghost white skin to get some color!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite accelerator.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>This goes on fast, and smells great.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>favorite tanning spray ever.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, light oil that moistens your skin without feeling slimy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>Most local stores no longer carry many sun products that do not contain a sunscreen, so buying this on-line is the best way to go.</li>
            <li>found this product at a  tanning shop for much more.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tanning bed body spray.</li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>so I have pretty fair skin.</li>
            <li>a great product for .a great price, love the fact its not a fake bronzer, but an actual tanning excellerator</li>
            <li>Heck of a lot better than paying full price at the tanning salon!</li>
            <li>We like the lotion better than the spray, but they both work just fine</li>
            <li>Good price, fast delivery,</li>
            <li>What a nice golden tan it gave my husband and I.</li>
            <li>The other one is perfect and is what I wan&#x27;t, no problem.</li>
            <li>Other then that it is awesome.</li>
            <li>not bad at all!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and has a pleasing smell.</li>
            <li>The results are just okay, nothing special.</li>
            <li>The best accelerator hands down.</li>
            <li>Who knows, it may work fine.</li>
            <li>Who knows, it may work fine.</li>
            <li>The tanning lotion has an obvious bubblegum smell, but the tan I get with it is great.</li>
            <li>this could be a cheap tanning lotion when I&#x27;m jsut trying to maintain my tan. . .</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller about these issues, primary that I was upset that I paid for an item that I can&#x27;t even use (not that I would want to now..)</li>
            <li>theyre just putting it in cheap bottles for some reason .</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and works fast to give you the color you desire.</li>
            <li>Always a great product for starting out in a tanning bed, will not burn you&#x27;re skin and starts you a gradual tan</li>
            <li>Use as moisturizer for days in advance, sun with SPF 4 Australian Gold lotion and result in a great tan.</li>
            <li>And for someone who has Irish skin it is great in preventing a burn.</li>
            <li>Not for amateurs or people with light skin.</li>
            <li>you people really know how to get the job done!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; as some of the others, but it works super fine.  </li>
            <li>I end up taking the whole top off and pouring it in my hand to rub it on.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bit of an oily residue after you wipe it off, but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells like an orange dreamsicle and it&#x27;s pretty strong-</li>
            <li>At the end of my bottle now and love it just as much as I did when I first tried it!  </li>
            <li>I had to keep squirting more and more out constantly.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with my tan this last summer.</li>
            <li>tan looks very healthy and moisturized, prior to using this I just used spf4 tanning lotion</li>
            <li>The smell is super tropical and I find the accelerator worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I am a real person!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I like Australian Gold&#x27;s tanning lotion, it smells great and keeps my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>and I love how it enhances my natural color</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>If you have fair skin be careful because you will burn faster as it is an accelerator.</li>
            <li>It smells great but not as much tingle as the other one.</li>
            <li>It does have a orange cream-cicle smell, but that wears off pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>Tan seems to fade pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and did exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I bought this due to the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>faster!!)and I can always count on amazon to send the right products and fasssst too.</li>
            <li>But instead of making it right with me they offered for me to pay again for the right thing.  </li>
            <li>To soon to tell as of right now.  </li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for many years and use no other brand.  </li>
            <li>I am pale skinned and it takes me a while to tan, but Australian Gold does a great job of getting me there!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a very, very, long-time shopper of items on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a very, very, long-time shopper of items on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>very nice not to be pale!</li>
            <li>The product I received is clearly a counterfeit; But it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I also have burned with several others that cost a lot more.</li>
            <li>, I mix it with a standard unscented body lotion and it comes out okay.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and noticed a difference after first use.</li>
            <li>great price big fan and will purchase this lotion again as long as they do not raise the price....</li>
            <li>I had my first case of hives.</li>
            <li>exactly as described-  </li>
            <li>This accelerator worked the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than buying it at a salon!</li>
            <li>I like the actual sprays that come in sunscreen cans a lot more than this style.</li>
            <li>the picture shows a spray version of the product, which was exactly what i was looking for..</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>A GREAT product at a price far LESS than some of the lotions on the market.  </li>
            <li>Easy application, no foul smell, helps me to slowly get a nice even tan when I sit in the sun.  </li>
            <li>It is just the right amount of sensation, like a very brisk after-shave.  </li>
            <li>Good to get the base to get out to the pool.&lt;br /&gt;Price was great and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>This product will give your skin a nice dark luster, but it goes on very greasy</li>
            <li>I certainly intend to stick with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>the only excuse I can come up with is they got a knock off or maybe they have really fair skin and put way too much on....</li>
            <li>I always think highly of a business that knows how to handle a problem and it counts just as much as how they do business when things go exactly as they are supposed to.</li>
            <li>I will update if needed in the future regarding quality, but at the moment this is exactly what I was looking for, &amp; the price is right!</li>
            <li>Not broken and in the package, just gone.</li>
            <li>I have olive toned skin and really like this as it doesn&#x27;t have any added bronzers that can turn my skin orange.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for very tingly ones or some fragrances.</li>
            <li>The product itself has worked very well for me</li>
            <li>I recieved a bottle with a wide flip top dispenser of lotion.</li>
            <li>so i think the product is real</li>
            <li>AGA works very well for the price.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the salons</li>
            <li>Is much cheaper than buying the products at the salon.</li>
            <li>I recieved a bottle with a wide flip top dispenser of lotion.</li>
            <li>for me makes a real difference because lotion just makes my skin greasy and never seem to absorbe it</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>but hubby wasnt as fast rubbing in</li>
            <li>Wouldnt turn me away, highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>if you want a fast tan use this accelerator and you will see it.</li>
            <li>but you really dont need to.</li>
            <li>The orange smell fades within about 5 minutes; I really think that the smell of sunscreen lasts longer than that</li>
            <li>Can be used for indoor or outdoor tanning though you have to remember this is all about getting a tan fast, so there are no sunscreens in it.</li>
            <li>This can be used indoors AND outdoors as mentioned on the back of the product which is exactly what I got it for: indoor use but needed a quick application.</li>
            <li>So this product is definitely out of its league and worth the try!</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers said, it smells a lot like a Dreamsicle, though I would consider it more a combination of Dreamsicles and candy corn.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few of the accelerators and so far this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Usually all Australian gold is a great product.</li>
            <li>You can put a big blob in your hands, and when you wipe it on your body, you get maybe 6-10 inches and your hands are suddenly dry (kind of like Eucerine if you&#x27;ve ever used that).  </li>
            <li>After having sampled several different types over the years (usually in sample packs), I think this one is by far the best bargain and works every bit as well as $30-40 bottles.</li>
            <li>It actually works and smells ten times better than this junk.</li>
            <li>AS THE ITALIANS, AND SIMILAR PEOPLE ARE LUCKIER BORN WITH MORE SUN PROTECTION, I AM SCANDINAVIAN MALE, AND WE CAN BURN EASIER,</li>
            <li>Secondly, it did nothing for my skin, other than cause it to turn bright red and hot during and after tanning (NOT A SUNBURN)</li>
            <li>Only downside which isnt really one is that if you dont rub in right away it spots on your skin.  </li>
            <li>but once again the shipping was too high.</li>
            <li>Use all the time, recommend highly.</li>
            <li>But it did smell good and my skin was less dry after.</li>
            <li>Okay so this stuff smells horrible, however, most of the regular tanners shower after tanning anyways , , , this product gives you an amazing tan!</li>
            <li>Definitely makes a difference and worth the $$.</li>
            <li>Im not sure but just make sure you read reviews on the seller before you purchase from them and dont apply too much.m them and dont apply too much.</li>
            <li>It really helps your skin not dry out as much.</li>
            <li>it is far more natural than other products on the market.</li>
            <li>IF THEY USE THE RIGHT LOTION, RED HEADS INCLUDED, THIS PRODUCT IS NUMBER ONE, IN MY BOOK, WOW!</li>
            <li>and then would continue to be itchy and irritated after showering and putting new lotion</li>
            <li>Australian Gold products are very well made and here on Amazon they are very well priced.</li>
            <li>They told me I ordered the lotion which it is very clear by the picture and the fact that it says Accelerator &amp;#34;Spray&amp;#34; that the lotion is not what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Smells like most other Australian Gold products.</li>
            <li>anyway I loved the tanning lotion,it tans you in half the time so less time in sun.</li>
            <li>In the tanning parlor when the product was new I had no problem but with it a yr old and being out in the sun</li>
            <li>This product didnt tingle in any way at all nor did it make me red and its not supposed to, it doesnt include any tingling or hot action agents in it.</li>
            <li>I had trouble finding locally but Amazon makes keeping it on hand easy!</li>
            <li>The tanning salon charges double for what I paid for this product on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;It certainly accelerates a tan; however, the scent is obnoxious.  </li>
            <li>:) the only reason it did not get  all five stars is it took a little longer then it said to get to me.</li>
            <li>but it makes my skin feel really soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t burn with this lotion, which tends to happen easily on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my whole body except when applying to the above areas</li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace the old tingle I had called wild.</li>
            <li>Honestly i am not quite sure how ur supposed to undress and lotion up in 3 minutes before the bed turns</li>
            <li>Never again will I pay big bucks for high priced tanning accelerators!</li>
            <li>No added dyes, giving you a natural tan that doesn&#x27;t leave streaks .</li>
            <li>but i have deffinatly used the real australian gold before and the lotion its self seems the exact same</li>
            <li>but I am not sure is it genuine</li>
            <li>Rather Inexpensive which surprises me, as I have spent $$ on others far more expensive and less effective.</li>
            <li>Not only is it MUCH cheaper then alternatives but this one actually works.</li>
            <li>GIRLS ACTUALLY TURNED HEADS, AND HERE&#x27;S MY TRICK TO GET MY BACK REAL TAN IN THE TANNING BEDS, SQUIRT THE LOTION INTO THE TANNING BED, AND SMEAR AROUND, THEN WHEN YOU GET IN, WIGGLE AROUND TO APPLY TO YOUR BACK,</li>
            <li>I think I gave them enough money for them to have fixed it for me.  </li>
            <li>A days ago I bought 2 Australian Gold Accelerator and when I receive them one was completely broke.</li>
            <li>so if you are not careful  you will burn.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not goopy, it&#x27;s more of a thin texture</li>
            <li>I notified them immediately and was contacted the next business day and had a brand new bottle 48 hours later via UPS with no questions asked.</li>
            <li>I got dark very fast, I was really really white to begin with!</li>
            <li>Tingles a little at first but no worries.</li>
            <li>I spray the accelerator on top and rub in, I dont use much just barely enough to put a thin layer on, I dont have trouble rubbing it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale with red hair and freckles, so I don&#x27;t want or need anything that&#x27;s for a deep tan.  </li>
            <li>I was highly disappointed, as I was looking for a quick and easy application.</li>

            <li> I love the fact that I found a spritzer tanning lotion!!</li>

            <li> Very nice scent</li>
            <li> and I love the fact it has accelerator as well as sunscreen, works perfectly!  </li>

            <li> It smells good for the summer and beach</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells good even for guys without being obnoxious to others or yourself.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy, absorbs like a really good lotion.  </li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> the lotion itself is good</li>
            <li> Creamy, smells great, nice bronze tint.  </li>
            <li> Its ok...smell is good too.</li>
            <li> Im fairly tan already and never burn because Im from the island of Guam</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Has a good smell to it as well, I have used a couple I wouldnt put on again to save my life.</li>
            <li> Great smell and works nice for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> works great - love the product</li>
            <li> Feels great, smells even better and it seems to do what it says.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving that bottle to a good friend who wanted to try something and he also liked it.  </li>
            <li> it smells really good and has a nice feel.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use very many moisturizers, as I break out very easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;accelerator\\&quot; lotion is amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing as well.</li>
            <li> We all know you can&#x27;t use oils in tanning beds, so this product is not an oil but rather a very liquidly lotion for spritzing purposes which is awesome!</li>
            <li> Not overly fragrant like some but a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Going to salon and seeing how much they charge per bottle this is the best way to go...</li>
            <li> Had a nice coconut smell and didn&#x27;t burn or tingle.</li>
            <li> I have been going for about 3 weeks already and have a nice tan</li>
            <li> smells good, easy to apply, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and burn easily.</li>
            <li> Love this product and was thrilled to find it on Amazon,</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Its a good size for the price and the spray bottle works well and is very economical.</li>
            <li> Both of which are smells that I like, but it&#x27;s extremely potent and the odor is still strong HOURS after a good scrubbing in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> Originally I was excited to get this reading all the reviews and the fact that the price was great.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in love with this tanning lotion since I started tanning years ago.</li>
            <li> and I love the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> I love the scent too</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I recieved a bottle with a flip top dispenser of lotion.</li>
            <li> I was able to oder it here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It all arrived safe &amp; sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I love this product and I love the results.  </li>
            <li> Love Love Love it.</li>
            <li> Glad Amezon carries it.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my ghost white skin to get some color!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite accelerator.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> This goes on fast, and smells great.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> favorite tanning spray ever.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice, light oil that moistens your skin without feeling slimy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> Most local stores no longer carry many sun products that do not contain a sunscreen, so buying this on-line is the best way to go.</li>
            <li> found this product at a  tanning shop for much more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning bed body spray.</li>
            <li> Love It.</li>
            <li> so I have pretty fair skin.</li>
            <li> a great product for .a great price, love the fact its not a fake bronzer, but an actual tanning excellerator</li>
            <li> Heck of a lot better than paying full price at the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> We like the lotion better than the spray, but they both work just fine</li>
            <li> Good price, fast delivery,</li>
            <li> What a nice golden tan it gave my husband and I.</li>
            <li> The other one is perfect and is what I wan&#x27;t, no problem.</li>
            <li> Other then that it is awesome.</li>
            <li> not bad at all!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and has a pleasing smell.</li>
            <li> The results are just okay, nothing special.</li>
            <li> The best accelerator hands down.</li>
            <li> Who knows, it may work fine.</li>
            <li> Who knows, it may work fine.</li>
            <li> The tanning lotion has an obvious bubblegum smell, but the tan I get with it is great.</li>
            <li> this could be a cheap tanning lotion when I&#x27;m jsut trying to maintain my tan. . .</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller about these issues, primary that I was upset that I paid for an item that I can&#x27;t even use (not that I would want to now..)</li>
            <li> theyre just putting it in cheap bottles for some reason .</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and works fast to give you the color you desire.</li>
            <li> Always a great product for starting out in a tanning bed, will not burn you&#x27;re skin and starts you a gradual tan</li>
            <li> Use as moisturizer for days in advance, sun with SPF 4 Australian Gold lotion and result in a great tan.</li>
            <li> And for someone who has Irish skin it is great in preventing a burn.</li>
            <li> Not for amateurs or people with light skin.</li>
            <li> you people really know how to get the job done!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; as some of the others, but it works super fine.  </li>
            <li> I end up taking the whole top off and pouring it in my hand to rub it on.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bit of an oily residue after you wipe it off, but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells like an orange dreamsicle and it&#x27;s pretty strong-</li>
            <li> At the end of my bottle now and love it just as much as I did when I first tried it!  </li>
            <li> I had to keep squirting more and more out constantly.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with my tan this last summer.</li>
            <li> tan looks very healthy and moisturized, prior to using this I just used spf4 tanning lotion</li>
            <li> The smell is super tropical and I find the accelerator worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I am a real person!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I like Australian Gold&#x27;s tanning lotion, it smells great and keeps my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> and I love how it enhances my natural color</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> If you have fair skin be careful because you will burn faster as it is an accelerator.</li>
            <li> It smells great but not as much tingle as the other one.</li>
            <li> It does have a orange cream-cicle smell, but that wears off pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> Tan seems to fade pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and did exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> faster!!)and I can always count on amazon to send the right products and fasssst too.</li>
            <li> But instead of making it right with me they offered for me to pay again for the right thing.  </li>
            <li> To soon to tell as of right now.  </li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for many years and use no other brand.  </li>
            <li> I am pale skinned and it takes me a while to tan, but Australian Gold does a great job of getting me there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a very, very, long-time shopper of items on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a very, very, long-time shopper of items on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> very nice not to be pale!</li>
            <li> The product I received is clearly a counterfeit; But it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I also have burned with several others that cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> , I mix it with a standard unscented body lotion and it comes out okay.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and noticed a difference after first use.</li>
            <li> great price big fan and will purchase this lotion again as long as they do not raise the price....</li>
            <li> I had my first case of hives.</li>
            <li> exactly as described-  </li>
            <li> This accelerator worked the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than buying it at a salon!</li>
            <li> I like the actual sprays that come in sunscreen cans a lot more than this style.</li>
            <li> the picture shows a spray version of the product, which was exactly what i was looking for..</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> A GREAT product at a price far LESS than some of the lotions on the market.  </li>
            <li> Easy application, no foul smell, helps me to slowly get a nice even tan when I sit in the sun.  </li>
            <li> It is just the right amount of sensation, like a very brisk after-shave.  </li>
            <li> Good to get the base to get out to the pool.&lt;br /&gt;Price was great and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li> This product will give your skin a nice dark luster, but it goes on very greasy</li>
            <li> I certainly intend to stick with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> the only excuse I can come up with is they got a knock off or maybe they have really fair skin and put way too much on....</li>
            <li> I always think highly of a business that knows how to handle a problem and it counts just as much as how they do business when things go exactly as they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> I will update if needed in the future regarding quality, but at the moment this is exactly what I was looking for, &amp; the price is right!</li>
            <li> Not broken and in the package, just gone.</li>
            <li> I have olive toned skin and really like this as it doesn&#x27;t have any added bronzers that can turn my skin orange.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for very tingly ones or some fragrances.</li>
            <li> The product itself has worked very well for me</li>
            <li> I recieved a bottle with a wide flip top dispenser of lotion.</li>
            <li> so i think the product is real</li>
            <li> AGA works very well for the price.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the salons</li>
            <li> Is much cheaper than buying the products at the salon.</li>
            <li> I recieved a bottle with a wide flip top dispenser of lotion.</li>
            <li> for me makes a real difference because lotion just makes my skin greasy and never seem to absorbe it</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> but hubby wasnt as fast rubbing in</li>
            <li> Wouldnt turn me away, highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> if you want a fast tan use this accelerator and you will see it.</li>
            <li> but you really dont need to.</li>
            <li> The orange smell fades within about 5 minutes; I really think that the smell of sunscreen lasts longer than that</li>
            <li> Can be used for indoor or outdoor tanning though you have to remember this is all about getting a tan fast, so there are no sunscreens in it.</li>
            <li> This can be used indoors AND outdoors as mentioned on the back of the product which is exactly what I got it for: indoor use but needed a quick application.</li>
            <li> So this product is definitely out of its league and worth the try!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers said, it smells a lot like a Dreamsicle, though I would consider it more a combination of Dreamsicles and candy corn.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few of the accelerators and so far this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> Usually all Australian gold is a great product.</li>
            <li> You can put a big blob in your hands, and when you wipe it on your body, you get maybe 6-10 inches and your hands are suddenly dry (kind of like Eucerine if you&#x27;ve ever used that).  </li>
            <li> After having sampled several different types over the years (usually in sample packs), I think this one is by far the best bargain and works every bit as well as $30-40 bottles.</li>
            <li> It actually works and smells ten times better than this junk.</li>
            <li> AS THE ITALIANS, AND SIMILAR PEOPLE ARE LUCKIER BORN WITH MORE SUN PROTECTION, I AM SCANDINAVIAN MALE, AND WE CAN BURN EASIER,</li>
            <li> Secondly, it did nothing for my skin, other than cause it to turn bright red and hot during and after tanning (NOT A SUNBURN)</li>
            <li> Only downside which isnt really one is that if you dont rub in right away it spots on your skin.  </li>
            <li> but once again the shipping was too high.</li>
            <li> Use all the time, recommend highly.</li>
            <li> But it did smell good and my skin was less dry after.</li>
            <li> Okay so this stuff smells horrible, however, most of the regular tanners shower after tanning anyways , , , this product gives you an amazing tan!</li>
            <li> Definitely makes a difference and worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Im not sure but just make sure you read reviews on the seller before you purchase from them and dont apply too much.m them and dont apply too much.</li>
            <li> It really helps your skin not dry out as much.</li>
            <li> it is far more natural than other products on the market.</li>
            <li> IF THEY USE THE RIGHT LOTION, RED HEADS INCLUDED, THIS PRODUCT IS NUMBER ONE, IN MY BOOK, WOW!</li>
            <li> and then would continue to be itchy and irritated after showering and putting new lotion</li>
            <li> Australian Gold products are very well made and here on Amazon they are very well priced.</li>
            <li> They told me I ordered the lotion which it is very clear by the picture and the fact that it says Accelerator &amp;#34;Spray&amp;#34; that the lotion is not what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Smells like most other Australian Gold products.</li>
            <li> anyway I loved the tanning lotion,it tans you in half the time so less time in sun.</li>
            <li> In the tanning parlor when the product was new I had no problem but with it a yr old and being out in the sun</li>
            <li> This product didnt tingle in any way at all nor did it make me red and its not supposed to, it doesnt include any tingling or hot action agents in it.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding locally but Amazon makes keeping it on hand easy!</li>
            <li> The tanning salon charges double for what I paid for this product on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;It certainly accelerates a tan; however, the scent is obnoxious.  </li>
            <li> :) the only reason it did not get  all five stars is it took a little longer then it said to get to me.</li>
            <li> but it makes my skin feel really soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t burn with this lotion, which tends to happen easily on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my whole body except when applying to the above areas</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace the old tingle I had called wild.</li>
            <li> Honestly i am not quite sure how ur supposed to undress and lotion up in 3 minutes before the bed turns</li>
            <li> Never again will I pay big bucks for high priced tanning accelerators!</li>
            <li> No added dyes, giving you a natural tan that doesn&#x27;t leave streaks .</li>
            <li> but i have deffinatly used the real australian gold before and the lotion its self seems the exact same</li>
            <li> but I am not sure is it genuine</li>
            <li> Rather Inexpensive which surprises me, as I have spent $$ on others far more expensive and less effective.</li>
            <li> Not only is it MUCH cheaper then alternatives but this one actually works.</li>
            <li> GIRLS ACTUALLY TURNED HEADS, AND HERE&#x27;S MY TRICK TO GET MY BACK REAL TAN IN THE TANNING BEDS, SQUIRT THE LOTION INTO THE TANNING BED, AND SMEAR AROUND, THEN WHEN YOU GET IN, WIGGLE AROUND TO APPLY TO YOUR BACK,</li>
            <li> I think I gave them enough money for them to have fixed it for me.  </li>
            <li> A days ago I bought 2 Australian Gold Accelerator and when I receive them one was completely broke.</li>
            <li> so if you are not careful  you will burn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not goopy, it&#x27;s more of a thin texture</li>
            <li> I notified them immediately and was contacted the next business day and had a brand new bottle 48 hours later via UPS with no questions asked.</li>
            <li> I got dark very fast, I was really really white to begin with!</li>
            <li> Tingles a little at first but no worries.</li>
            <li> I spray the accelerator on top and rub in, I dont use much just barely enough to put a thin layer on, I dont have trouble rubbing it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale with red hair and freckles, so I don&#x27;t want or need anything that&#x27;s for a deep tan.  </li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed, as I was looking for a quick and easy application.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a thick lotion is just a little too much for tanning in a bed &amp; an oil is just a bit much for outdoor tanning, IMO.</li>
            <li> If I plan on being outside a long time I will use a sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not going to last very long...</li>
            <li> too be a little to gimmicky and not exactly for an adult consumer and cost waaayyy too much.  </li>
            <li> Truth is it took a long time to see any results.</li>
            <li> I spent at least 2 x this price in the Dominican when I first tried it.</li>
            <li> If you already have a good base tan, it&#x27;s perrfect for laying by the pool.  </li>
            <li> This is what I was hoping for, as the other reviews had said the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;The dark tanning lotion sells for $20 at my local salon, so</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL, WHEN JUDGING A TANNING LOTION, A PERSON&#x27;S ETHNICITY, CAN MEAN EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> But honestly, I was disappointed from the moment I received this in the mail.</li>
            <li> Anything that says black or deep tan with a multipler number frightens me.  </li>
            <li> that, ontop of the fact it came a mess, is why im giving it only 3 stars .</li>
            <li> This time I purchased it for just tossing on my arms and legs when I am outside to get a little tan going.  </li>
            <li> when you open the bottle the liquid is a little orangish beige but you cant see that color when you rub it in; it doesnt even show on your hands.</li>
            <li> Be careful when buying from them.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> but you have to be really careful</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan as often as a lot of other tanning bed users and don&#x27;t like to spend an arm and a leg on lotions.</li>
            <li> also find a lot of the other lotions</li>
            <li> My lotion came busted open with lotion everywere in plastic wrap,also, like others have mentioned, don&#x27;t expect the product in the picture, its a completely different bottle (maybe its a fake australian gold . .</li>
            <li> I receive my orders faster than any other sites(way</li>
            <li> But.. I&#x27;ve achieved the same results with other products in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am moving on to other products..</li>
            <li> But the other one like I said it was broke.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not like the other one.</li>
            <li> As a test I sprayed one arm and not the other before tanning.  </li>
            <li> i know it is partially my fault for not reading the description correctly, where it says \\&quot;lotion\\&quot;, but they still can&#x27;t show a picture of the spray one when offering lotion!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I got 15-20% darker and I was only in the tanning bed for 14 minutes and thats with a thin layer of spf4 and thin layer of accelerator</li>
            <li> It has been hard for me to find locally.  </li>
            <li> while it was wrapped in several layers of bubble wrap and placed in a plastic envelope, it was everywhere by the time I received it- a total sloppy mess inside the envelope.</li>
            <li> I received the dark tanning lotion, not spray.  </li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that a spray would be a faster way to apply the lotion before tanning and try and cut down on that time.</li>
            <li> When using small amounts, I did not experience the \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; sort of feeling some other users have or with other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 4 times and the bottle is close to half gone.  </li>
            <li> I recommend buying the 13oz bottle of Millennium Tanning Black Storm</li>
            <li> but if they did people would tan less</li>
            <li> The spray is too strong/concentrated, not like a mist, so it&#x27;s basically just a messier, less even way of getting it from the bottle to your skin for you to just rub it in anyway.</li>
            <li> I spend half the time getting my tan</li>
            <li> or you will look like and feel like a slimy mess.</li>
            <li> it takes a little longer to spread on body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days now and have noticed a visible difference as opposed to some other products that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Product safety seal was missing.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t unpleasent and I don&#x27;t mind sitting in it for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> so its not necessary to go crazy when you use this thing, a little can go a long way.</li>
            <li> so I usually buy online.</li>
            <li> somebody mentioned its a fake australian gold . .</li>
            <li> Not sure about using it with the sun.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if I wanted the spray or lotion.</li>
            <li> I usually burn and peel</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles, and when I opened my package I discovered that one of the bottles had broken and leaked all over the box and the tanning goggles and other bottle of lotion that I also ordered.</li>
            <li> I was using this as my first lotion for my base tan.</li>
            <li> spray....definitely comes out chunky and hard to use at some angles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dislike it, I&#x27;m just not thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> Another complaint I have is that the lotion itself is orange..</li>
            <li> but I havent been out in the sun lately</li>
            <li> /&gt;People complained that theirs turned parts of their body orangish</li>
            <li> The only downside is putting it on if its cold.</li>
            <li> I have a tanning membership at Darque Tan, but refuse to spend $50 on a lotion that definitely is not as good as this one.</li>
            <li> seriously!</li>
            <li> the consistency of the lotion is weird.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find sometimes because they are moving to sprays, etc.</li>
            <li> It also gives your skin a five-minute &#x60;rush&#x27; of tingly that is just shy of being uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Please correct me if I&#x27;m doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> (it was about $5 at walmart) and now I use a very thin layer of the spf4 then</li>
            <li> use sunblock and don&#x27;t expose yourself for too long because you can get a terrible sunburn.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I hate giving bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> not IN IT! :(</li>
            <li> Horrible gadgets.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A GREAT product at a price far LESS than some of the lotions on the market.  It works, too !!</li>
            <li> Product safety seal was missing. Not broken and in the package, just gone. Would you buy one off the hel that was already open and rub it on your skin? Nope me either. I was not given the choice here.</li>
            <li> Love this product and was thrilled to find it on Amazon,</li>
            <li> Love it.  The smell is super tropical and I find the accelerator worth every penny.  Rather Inexpensive which surprises me, as I have spent $$ on others far more expensive and less effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in love with this tanning lotion since I started tanning years ago. I have tried others but always come back to it. I have olive toned skin and really like this as it doesn&#x27;t have any added bronzers that can turn my skin orange. It smells great too and I love the spray nozzle. It makes application easier to me. It&#x27;s not goopy, it&#x27;s more of a thin texture but it makes my skin feel really soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan as often as a lot of other tanning bed users and don&#x27;t like to spend an arm and a leg on lotions. I don&#x27;t care for very tingly ones or some fragrances. This stuff smells like an orange dreamsicle and it&#x27;s pretty strong- if you don&#x27;t like that scent, this one definitely isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t burn with this lotion, which tends to happen easily on my sensitive skin. When using small amounts, I did not experience the \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; sort of feeling some other users have or with other lotions I&#x27;ve used. Any lotion will cause that if you put on a lot. I just prefer to do my tanning at the end of the day so I can shower shortly afterwards too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find a lot of the other lotions too be a little to gimmicky and not exactly for an adult consumer and cost waaayyy too much.  After having sampled several different types over the years (usually in sample packs), I think this one is by far the best bargain and works every bit as well as $30-40 bottles. I also have burned with several others that cost a lot more. I certainly intend to stick with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also as a side note, the seller for this, ShopWars was very good to me when I received a damaged bottle. I&#x27;m guessing it was beat up at the post office and while it was wrapped in several layers of bubble wrap and placed in a plastic envelope, it was everywhere by the time I received it- a total sloppy mess inside the envelope. I notified them immediately and was contacted the next business day and had a brand new bottle 48 hours later via UPS with no questions asked. I always think highly of a business that knows how to handle a problem and it counts just as much as how they do business when things go exactly as they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> The tanning salon charges double for what I paid for this product on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;It certainly accelerates a tan; however, the scent is obnoxious.  Smells like cooked peaches.</li>
            <li> works great - love the product</li>
            <li> The tanning lotion has an obvious bubblegum smell, but the tan I get with it is great. I am pale skinned and it takes me a while to tan, but Australian Gold does a great job of getting me there!</li>
            <li> My lotion came busted open with lotion everywere in plastic wrap,also, like others have mentioned, don&#x27;t expect the product in the picture, its a completely different bottle (maybe its a fake australian gold . . i dont know because I have never used the real australian gold pruduct before). It smells good for the summer and beach and I am gona use it for outdor tanning so I hope that gona help me tan but we&#x27;ll see.... Good price, fast delivery, but I am not sure is it genuine product(the bottle I recived looks different than product in the picture and  in offical site of australian gold), that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it only 3 stars .</li>
            <li> I have a tanning membership at Darque Tan, but refuse to spend $50 on a lotion that definitely is not as good as this one. Been using it for about 3 years now indoor and outdoor. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This product works well - I have used it for each of my tanning sessions and have been happy with the results.  It does have a orange cream-cicle smell, but that wears off pretty quickly.  The product itself has worked very well for me and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> you people really know how to get the job done!!! I receive my orders faster than any other sites(way faster!!)and I can always count on amazon to send the right products and fasssst too.NO I dont work for them I am a real person!! anyway I loved the tanning lotion,it tans you in half the time so less time in sun.I love the scent too so does everyone else.but then it IS australian gold.&lt;br /&gt;thank you,&lt;br /&gt;alicia sanders</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I found a spritzer tanning lotion!! This can be used indoors AND outdoors as mentioned on the back of the product which is exactly what I got it for: indoor use but needed a quick application. We all know you can&#x27;t use oils in tanning beds, so this product is not an oil but rather a very liquidly lotion for spritzing purposes which is awesome! Sometimes a thick lotion is just a little too much for tanning in a bed &amp; an oil is just a bit much for outdoor tanning, IMO. So this product is definitely out of its league and worth the try! I will update if needed in the future regarding quality, but at the moment this is exactly what I was looking for, &amp; the price is right!</li>
            <li> This product is great except for around the elbows, knees and ankles - turns an orange/dirt color.  I applied it to my whole body except when applying to the above areas, I mix it with a standard unscented body lotion and it comes out okay.</li>
            <li> The product I received is clearly a counterfeit; But it works just fine. I&#x27;m giving +5 stars for working, and -3 stars for being a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> Okay so this stuff smells horrible, however, most of the regular tanners shower after tanning anyways , , , this product gives you an amazing tan! seriously! I tan all the time I tried this thinking this could be a cheap tanning lotion when I&#x27;m jsut trying to maintain my tan. . . But it actually boosted my color a LOT!</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the good reviews.  I don&#x27;t dislike it, I&#x27;m just not thrilled with it.  It&#x27;s *ok*.  Like other reviewers said, it smells a lot like a Dreamsicle, though I would consider it more a combination of Dreamsicles and candy corn.  Both of which are smells that I like, but it&#x27;s extremely potent and the odor is still strong HOURS after a good scrubbing in the shower.  Tan-wise, it definitely does work.  Probably about 10-20% darker than without.  But.. I&#x27;ve achieved the same results with other products in the past.  Another complaint I have is that the lotion itself is orange.. not only did it stain my hands a deep orange color, it&#x27;s probably going to stain clothes too.  You definitely don&#x27;t want to wear white if you have this on.  It&#x27;s also not going to last very long... the consistency of the lotion is weird.  You can put a big blob in your hands, and when you wipe it on your body, you get maybe 6-10 inches and your hands are suddenly dry (kind of like Eucerine if you&#x27;ve ever used that).  I had to keep squirting more and more out constantly.  I&#x27;ve used it 4 times and the bottle is close to half gone.  It just doesn&#x27;t spread around well.  There&#x27;s a bit of an oily residue after you wipe it off, but it&#x27;s not bad.  I&#x27;m going to stick with the Hawaiian Tropic T2 Max stuff that I get at Walgreens for about the same price... works just as well without all of the issues I have with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone said it tingles... it doesn&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s not supposed to.  I didn&#x27;t get even the slightest bit of tingle anything.</li>
            <li> Originally I was excited to get this reading all the reviews and the fact that the price was great. But honestly, I was disappointed from the moment I received this in the mail. I ordered two bottles, and when I opened my package I discovered that one of the bottles had broken and leaked all over the box and the tanning goggles and other bottle of lotion that I also ordered. Secondly, it did nothing for my skin, other than cause it to turn bright red and hot during and after tanning (NOT A SUNBURN) and then would continue to be itchy and irritated after showering and putting new lotion on.&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted the seller about these issues, primary that I was upset that I paid for an item that I can&#x27;t even use (not that I would want to now..) but they said there was nothing they could do.&lt;br /&gt;Garbage. I recommend buying the 13oz bottle of Millennium Tanning Black Storm 60X for 15 bucks. It actually works and smells ten times better than this junk.</li>
            <li> Went to Florida for 2 weeks and it looks like We went to Aruba for 2 weeks. What a nice golden tan it gave my husband and I.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but this it not a spray bottle as pictured in the listing. I was highly disappointed, as I was looking for a quick and easy application.</li>
            <li> I like the product but because it is a spray instead of a squirt bottle it takes a little longer to spread on body.  It was great for the price.</li>
            <li> Who knows, it may work fine. But I have a problem with not getting what I intend to get. The picture of the product is a pump spray bottle. I recieved a bottle with a wide flip top dispenser of lotion. Not what I wanted. But I&#x27;m not going to go through the hassle of return. I&#x27;ve been a very, very, long-time shopper of items on Amazon. I&#x27;ve seen reviews of products where customers complain about not receiving what they ordered. Unfortunately, it finally happened to me.</li>
            <li> The best accelerator hands down. Has the scent of dreamsicles. Its a shame they don&#x27;t carry this in the salons anymore but if they did people would tan less, it&#x27;s that good. I like that I can spray my back instead of trying to use one of those longhandled sponge things. Horrible gadgets. Gets all the spots!</li>
            <li> The picture of the product is a pump spray bottle. I recieved a bottle with a flip top dispenser of lotion. Not what I wanted...very dispointed.</li>
            <li> The product picture on the Amazon page is NOT what I received.  I received the dark tanning lotion, not spray.  This is what I was hoping for, as the other reviews had said the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;The dark tanning lotion sells for $20 at my local salon, so it&#x27;s a no brainer to buy it from here for under $9.  Smells great and isn&#x27;t girly at all.  Guys can use this stuff without worrying they&#x27;re going to smell like a chick.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for many years and use no other brand.  It is difficult to find sometimes because they are moving to sprays, etc. which aren&#x27;t allowed in all tanning salons so I usually buy online. I&#x27;ve used this in the sun and in a tanning bed.  It will not stain if you don&#x27;t rub it in perfectly especially between fingers, toes or leave blotches.  This price is very good, it lasts and smells like a beach smell. Love it!</li>
            <li> I tried this product on the advice of a friend..Truth is it took a long time to see any results. I am moving on to other products..</li>
            <li> my lotion came busted open with lotion everywhere . thankfully, they put it in plastic wrap so it didnt get everywhere . but it is everywhere inside of that bag and all over the bottle . . not IN IT! :( also, like others have mentioned dont expect the product in the picture. its a completely different bottle. same product though . somebody mentioned its a fake australian gold . . i dont know about all that . maybe the packaging is but i have deffinatly used the real australian gold before and the lotion its self seems the exact same so i think the product is real theyre just putting it in cheap bottles for some reason . that, ontop of the fact it came a mess, is why im giving it only 3 stars .</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL, WHEN JUDGING A TANNING LOTION, A PERSON&#x27;S ETHNICITY, CAN MEAN EVERYTHING! AS THE ITALIANS, AND SIMILAR PEOPLE ARE LUCKIER BORN WITH MORE SUN PROTECTION, I AM SCANDINAVIAN MALE, AND WE CAN BURN EASIER, SOME OF US SAY WE CANNOT TAN AT ALL, BUT I KNOW ANYONE CAN TAN IF THEY USE THE RIGHT LOTION, RED HEADS INCLUDED, THIS PRODUCT IS NUMBER ONE, IN MY BOOK, WOW! TALK ABOUT A SAVAGE TAN! I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE II, AND NEITHER COULD MY FRIENDS, MY BLONDE HAIR AND BLUE EYES STOOD OUT LIKE ALL THAT! GIRLS ACTUALLY TURNED HEADS, AND HERE&#x27;S MY TRICK TO GET MY BACK REAL TAN IN THE TANNING BEDS, SQUIRT THE LOTION INTO THE TANNING BED, AND SMEAR AROUND, THEN WHEN YOU GET IN, WIGGLE AROUND TO APPLY TO YOUR BACK, WERE YOU CAN NEVER GET WHEN ALONE, I USE ABOUT 14 BOTTLES IN A ONE MONTH VISIT TO THE TANNING SALON, THAT&#x27;S ABOUT ONE EVERY TWO DAYS, AND REMEMBER TO USE THE JOHN ABATE 1.OZ FACIAL SPRAY FOR FACE &amp; HANDS, AND YOU&#x27;LL BE A TAN GODDESS, IN THIRTY DAY&#x27;S \\&quot;OH YEAH THIS IS THE SAUCE\\&quot;  AAA+++ HAPPY TANNING...HAROLD,</li>
            <li> I have always used Australian Gold Accelerator.  It has been hard for me to find locally.  I was able to oder it here at Amazon.  No problems.  It all arrived safe &amp; sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> I love this product and I love the results.  I am Irish and German but this product helps me tan.  Love Love Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Glad Amezon carries it. Looked fo it it in stores but they didn&#x27;t carry it. This is my second bottle orderd.</li>
            <li> It works but not as well as the one I used to buy from them. They stopped making the one.</li>
            <li> AGA works very well for the price. It&#x27;s not as \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; as some of the others, but it works super fine.  The fragrance could be somewhat lighter, for those situations where you tan in a booth/bed, and then are going somewhere without taking a shower, etc.  But all in all, its very good.</li>
            <li> Feels great, smells even better and it seems to do what it says. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days now and have noticed a visible difference as opposed to some other products that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I ordered this two times and both times got the lotion instead of the spray.  They told me I ordered the lotion which it is very clear by the picture and the fact that it says Accelerator &amp;#34;Spray&amp;#34; that the lotion is not what I ordered.  But instead of making it right with me they offered for me to pay again for the right thing.  I think I gave them enough money for them to have fixed it for me.  But that was never offered.  Be careful when buying from them.  What you see is not what you get from them.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and noticed a difference after first use. Smell is orange cream i think? not bad at all! Would definitely buy again for the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes a difference and worth the $$.</li>
            <li> A days ago I bought 2 Australian Gold Accelerator and when I receive them one was completely broke. The other one is perfect and is what I wan&#x27;t, no problem. But the other one like I said it was broke.</li>
            <li> Usually all Australian gold is a great product. I ordered this to replace the old tingle I had called wild. I couldn&#x27;t find that lotion so I ordered this one. The lotion says it tingles but it&#x27;s not like the other one. I used it for 2 weeks now and I do not see a difference in my skin. It smells great but not as much tingle as the other one.</li>
            <li> I was using this as my first lotion for my base tan. I went 2x in a level 1 bed and it was so great. Not overly fragrant like some but a nice smell. I got dark very fast, I was really really white to begin with! If you don&#x27;t like the tingle or bronzer lotions this is a great one. It&#x27;s inexpensive but works.&lt;br /&gt;It blends in well and is not greasy. No orange color or streaking either.</li>
            <li> Going to salon and seeing how much they charge per bottle this is the best way to go...great price big fan and will purchase this lotion again as long as they do not raise the price....big yes to recommend if you use tanning beds</li>
            <li> Love this. I use it in the tanning booth. It smells amazing and works fast to give you the color you desire. Will def buy again💛💛💛</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this item.  I have used this before as a tanning bed product to help start up that tan.  I ended up giving that bottle to a good friend who wanted to try something and he also liked it.  This time I purchased it for just tossing on my arms and legs when I am outside to get a little tan going.  If I plan on being outside a long time I will use a sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good even for guys without being obnoxious to others or yourself.  Not greasy, absorbs like a really good lotion.  Australian Gold products are very well made and here on Amazon they are very well priced.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;accelerator\\&quot; lotion is amazing stuff.  I can&#x27;t use very many moisturizers, as I break out very easily.  For some reason, this product is not greasy and immediately soaks into your skin.  It also gives your skin a five-minute &#x60;rush&#x27; of tingly that is just shy of being uncomfortable.  It is just the right amount of sensation, like a very brisk after-shave.  It does keep your tan longer as it prevents your skin from flaking.  Best to use it before going in the sun.  However, it is NOT a sunscreen, nor does it color your skin.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Mine came as a spray but I wish it didn&#x27;t. The spray is too strong/concentrated, not like a mist, so it&#x27;s basically just a messier, less even way of getting it from the bottle to your skin for you to just rub it in anyway. Tried it one one arm and one leg for two sessions, didn&#x27;t notice any difference in color. But it did smell good and my skin was less dry after.</li>
            <li> Great product for me.  Cannot be found on store shelves at all.  Easy application, no foul smell, helps me to slowly get a nice even tan when I sit in the sun.  No a phony look at all and keeps my skin silky and I do not peel or burn even though this does not contain SPF.  Thank you for allowing me to order this product.  I give it a 5 star rating.  it is far more natural than other products on the market.</li>
            <li> Smells great , not greasy and dosent iritate my skin.  To soon to tell as of right now.  I will come back and let you know.  Heck of a lot better than paying full price at the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> We like the lotion better than the spray, but they both work just fine</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the salons</li>
            <li> it smells really good and has a nice feel. not oily at all. I bought this thinking that a spray would be a faster way to apply the lotion before tanning and try and cut down on that time. Honestly i am not quite sure how ur supposed to undress and lotion up in 3 minutes before the bed turns on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways the lotion itself is good but it doesnt spray evenly. you have to spray alot and then rub it in. its almost like double time to put it on. I end up taking the whole top off and pouring it in my hand to rub it on.</li>
            <li> I broke out in hives in all the areas that I used this on after previouly not having that reaction. In the tanning parlor when the product was new I had no problem but with it a yr old and being out in the sun I had my first case of hives.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Use it outside. Not greasy at all. I spent at least 2 x this price in the Dominican when I first tried it. I find it works best to spray in the hand and wipe on. Tingles a little at first but no worries. Like it!</li>
            <li> exactly as described-  Great price</li>
            <li> a great product for .a great price, love the fact its not a fake bronzer, but an actual tanning excellerator</li>
            <li> Perfect for my ghost white skin to get some color! I used it in the sun by the pool.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion! Gives you great color and smells wonderful! Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale with red hair and freckles, so I don&#x27;t want or need anything that&#x27;s for a deep tan.  Anything that says black or deep tan with a multipler number frightens me.  The smell isn&#x27;t unpleasent and I don&#x27;t mind sitting in it for a few hours.  I&#x27;ve bought this before and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite accelerator. It does not have a sting to it. Great smell and works nice for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and blue eyes so I have pretty fair skin. This accelerator worked the first time I used it. Had a nice coconut smell and didn&#x27;t burn or tingle. Its a good size for the price and the spray bottle works well and is very economical.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I don&#x27;t like the heaviness of lotions.  This goes on fast, and smells great.  I get the moisture I need and it does accelerate the tanning process.  Love it!</li>
            <li> i like this product but like they say it has no sunscreen so if you are not careful  you will burn. but once again the shipping was too high.</li>
            <li> Great for indoor and outdoor tanning!  So much cheaper than buying it at a salon!</li>
            <li> Works okay. Is much cheaper than buying the products at the salon. Smells like most other Australian Gold products. The results are just okay, nothing special. Tan seems to fade pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Seems bunk.  As a test I sprayed one arm and not the other before tanning.  Absolutely no difference.  Sorry, I hate giving bad reviews.  Please correct me if I&#x27;m doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Creamy, smells great, nice bronze tint.  I would recommend this lotion for indoor tanning beds. Not sure about using it with the sun.</li>
            <li> I like Australian Gold&#x27;s tanning lotion, it smells great and keeps my skin soft.  Use all the time, recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Who knows, it may work fine. But I have a problem with not getting what I intend to get. The picture of the product is a pump spray bottle. I recieved a bottle with a wide flip top dispenser of lotion. Not what I wanted. But I&#x27;m not going to go through the hassle of return. I&#x27;ve been a very, very, long-time shopper of items on Amazon. I&#x27;ve seen reviews of products where customers complain about not receiving what they ordered.  Unfortunately, it finally happened to me.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if I wanted the spray or lotion. Wanted to know if this would help with tanning.</li>
            <li> This is my second year using this and I love it!!  I spend half the time getting my tan and I love how it enhances my natural color</li>
            <li> I like this spray, but I would tell anyone who was using it that it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; spray....definitely comes out chunky and hard to use at some angles. I like the actual sprays that come in sunscreen cans a lot more than this style. Especially if going to tanning salon!</li>
            <li> the picture shows a spray version of the product, which was exactly what i was looking for..however, they sent me a lotion version!.. i know it is partially my fault for not reading the description correctly, where it says \\&quot;lotion\\&quot;, but they still can&#x27;t show a picture of the spray one when offering lotion! for me makes a real difference because lotion just makes my skin greasy and never seem to absorbe it..pay attention to that!</li>
            <li> works very well. Came to my house on date told</li>
            <li> At the end of my bottle now and love it just as much as I did when I first tried it!  Very nice scent and I love the fact it has accelerator as well as sunscreen, works perfectly!  My husband even noticed my tan developing faster and switched!  Only downside which isnt really one is that if you dont rub in right away it spots on your skin.  I have no issue but hubby wasnt as fast rubbing in and you could tell.  Wouldnt turn me away, highly recommend!  I must add I also used this indoor tanning and worked wonderfully!  Never again will I pay big bucks for high priced tanning accelerators!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and did exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Very pleased with my tan this last summer. Used to use Panama Jack&#x27;s, but they don&#x27;t make the accelerator as before. Gave this a try and am happy that I did. Thanks</li>
            <li> Helped speed my tan along before my trip to sunny Florida.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Worth the price. Heck in you indoor tanning...</li>
            <li> Its ok...smell is good too. Only used it once tho.</li>
            <li> if you want a fast tan use this accelerator and you will see it.</li>
            <li> Im fairly tan already and never burn because Im from the island of Guam but I havent been out in the sun lately so I decided to start indoor tanning which I have never done before. I have been going for about 3 weeks already and have a nice tan but when I use this product I get even darker without having to increase my time in the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tan looks very healthy and moisturized, prior to using this I just used spf4 tanning lotion (it was about $5 at walmart) and now I use a very thin layer of the spf4 then I spray the accelerator on top and rub in, I dont use much just barely enough to put a thin layer on, I dont have trouble rubbing it in I guess it might be bc of the spf4, when you open the bottle the liquid is a little orangish beige but you cant see that color when you rub it in; it doesnt even show on your hands. This product didnt tingle in any way at all nor did it make me red and its not supposed to, it doesnt include any tingling or hot action agents in it. It does smell like a orange popsicle like everyone says but I dont find it overwelming I guess it can be though if you use alot but you really dont need to. The orange smell fades within about 5 minutes; I really think that the smell of sunscreen lasts longer than that so no big deal. The first time I used this I got 15-20% darker and I was only in the tanning bed for 14 minutes and thats with a thin layer of spf4 and thin layer of accelerator so its not necessary to go crazy when you use this thing, a little can go a long way. I havent used this while out in the sun so I have no idea how it would react to it but it does say on the bottle that it is for indoor and outdoor tanning so it should work I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People complained that theirs turned parts of their body orangish the only excuse I can come up with is they got a knock off or maybe they have really fair skin and put way too much on.... Im not sure but just make sure you read reviews on the seller before you purchase from them and dont apply too much.m them and dont apply too much.</li>
            <li> favorite tanning spray ever.  smells good, easy to apply, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light oil that moistens your skin without feeling slimy or greasy.  If you already have a good base tan, it&#x27;s perrfect for laying by the pool.  Most local stores no longer carry many sun products that do not contain a sunscreen, so buying this on-line is the best way to go.</li>
            <li> A great lotion.  Delivered on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Always a great product for starting out in a tanning bed, will not burn you&#x27;re skin and starts you a gradual tan</li>
            <li> Aussie Gold is great stuff.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  I like to have both the spray and lotion BUT it appears that you cannot find the spray anymore.  Everyone who shows the spray bottle just ships the lotion instead.</li>
            <li> It does what I wanted.Good product.</li>
            <li> This work great,ships well and has the smell of being at the beach.Org. found this product at a  tanning shop for much more.</li>
            <li> No added dyes, giving you a natural tan that doesn&#x27;t leave streaks . Smells good and leaves skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and burn easily. This is the best product I have found. I have used it for years with wonderful results. Use as moisturizer for days in advance, sun with SPF 4 Australian Gold lotion and result in a great tan. I had trouble finding locally but Amazon makes keeping it on hand easy!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of the accelerators and so far this is hands down the best. Not only is it MUCH cheaper then alternatives but this one actually works. If you need an accelerator this is the one to get. It also has A and E to help with skin care. Can be used for indoor or outdoor tanning though you have to remember this is all about getting a tan fast, so there are no sunscreens in it. Has a good smell to it as well, I have used a couple I wouldnt put on again to save my life.</li>
            <li> Smells great. And it works great. I usually burn and peel and I didn&#x27;t get this with this one. Good to get the base to get out to the pool.&lt;br /&gt;Price was great and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and has a pleasing smell. And for someone who has Irish skin it is great in preventing a burn.</li>
            <li> It  helps to get a tan faster but you have to be really careful use sunblock and don&#x27;t expose yourself for too long because you can get a terrible sunburn. Especially if you have white/pale skin tone.</li>
            <li> This product will give your skin a nice dark luster, but it goes on very greasy so use it sparingly or you will look like and feel like a slimy mess. If you have fair skin be careful because you will burn faster as it is an accelerator. Not for amateurs or people with light skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and loved it. It is the perfect blend of lotion. It does not have tingle.</li>
            <li> The product works great! I already see the results and i have only used it once. It smells amazing as well. I am very happy with it. :) the only reason it did not get  all five stars is it took a little longer then it said to get to me. Other then that it is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is great for the tanning bed. I save so much time and don&#x27;t have to worry about missing spots. It spells great and I saw instant results. The only downside is putting it on if its cold.</li>
            <li> Had tan lines after 15 minutes in the sun! very nice not to be pale!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning bed body spray. It really helps your skin not dry out as much. Has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> works great and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> If you want a great tan, use this product.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.  Product exactly as described. Somewhat greasy, but it did a great job enhancing my tanning experience, both in a tanning bed and on the beach.</li>
            <li> We have been using Austrailian Gold for years. Love It. Delivered on time as promised. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Perfect for indoor tanning</li>
            <li> Smells great, tans well and leaves no residue!!</li>
