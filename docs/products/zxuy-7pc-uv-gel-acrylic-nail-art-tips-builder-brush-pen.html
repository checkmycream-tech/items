            <li>Love these brushes and so easy to clean</li>
            <li>They are a nice assortment of sizes and seem good qaulity especially for the price.</li>
            <li>product was good and highly recommended it if you need gel brush.</li>
            <li>They look nice, they&#x27;ve worked perfectly, and no brush hairs have come out so far after several uses.</li>
            <li>These are just fine and easily replaceable too.</li>
            <li>working just fine.  </li>
            <li>Still works fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using these to wipe acetone around the edges of my nail to clean up excess gel polish before curing to get a nice crisp edge.</li>
            <li>This set of brushes has really came in handy when applying acrylic nails, gel nails, or designs.</li>
            <li>They are such great brushes I use them on my services all the time and even with acetone</li>

            <li>They are cheap at all.</li>
            <li>I would still definitely recommend these brushes to anyone, they really are a great deal!</li>
            <li>Very sturdy!!!</li>
            <li>Have used them several times and they always clean up great.  </li>
            <li>These are definitely worth the price!  </li>
            <li>they also clean up good, the brushes do not loose and brisels while using or cleaning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these brushes maybe 5 times since I&#x27;ve gotten them and by far they are my favorite brushes!</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff and nice which is good for gel nails.</li>
            <li>Cool.</li>
            <li>However, the quality was relatively good for the low price.</li>
            <li>They really apply acrylic smooth and accurate.</li>
            <li>They come with several different sizes which is great!</li>
            <li>and they work super</li>
            <li>The shape is perfect for removing extra polish especially gel when doing your nails.</li>
            <li>They are made with different brush tips and fit nicely in your hand for ease of gel application.</li>
            <li>Awesome brushes, they came two weeks earlier than expected which is a plus.</li>
            <li>I just love these brushes, they come in seven different sizes to fit each and every nail.</li>
            <li>And see how much fun and complements you will get.</li>
            <li>A nice set especially for the money.</li>
            <li>Love them love them and before someone say that ey not good or cheap when the true problem is that some don&#x27;t know what they are doing.</li>
            <li>For only $9.00 I figured I would be getting a cheap brush set, and they are pretty cheap and flimsy</li>
            <li>Came earlier then expected &amp; works good!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to glue the brush back onto the bottom handle.  </li>
            <li>There are enough sizes to for most functions</li>
            <li>i dont need that many and none worked for doing my french curve</li>
            <li>love the different sizes</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>and I love all the different sizes.</li>
            <li>These are not of super high quality but do seem to work well.</li>
            <li>The handles are a bit short, but easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>These arrived fast.</li>
            <li>they arrived fast, they are just as stated and work verry well with the uv builder gel.</li>
            <li>and I love the pink ivory colored handles.</li>
            <li>Nice brushes however after some use the metal separated from handle on a few.</li>
            <li>(the head fell off one on the first use, but I was able to glue it back on) but for only $9.00, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>They feel very sturdy and high quality and the shorter length provides a lot of control.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice, but not top grade.  </li>
            <li>So far they&#x27;re a pretty decent but for someone who just does their own nails, but idk how they&#x27;d hold up to professional everyday usage.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a better business practice to get back to your customers, especially if they&#x27;ve asked.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>The bristles also feel high quality.</li>
            <li>These are so nice, the handles are either glass or a hard plastic.</li>
            <li>These brushes have a thick handle that was nice to grip.</li>
            <li>save your money, cheap false apart easy.</li>
            <li>For the purchase, and shipping, I could&#x27;ve just driven to my local beauty supply place and got it right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them weekly for months and they still look new and haven&#x27;t shed any bristles.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I have no complaint about these brushes so far.</li>
            <li>Well worth the Very long time it took to deliver.</li>
            <li>no problems so far.  </li>
            <li>it add stones pearl stripe tapes and just let yourself go wild.</li>
            <li>I just received these brushes today and must say they&#x27;re very well made and will last quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty &amp; pink with 7 different sizes to work with all shapes &amp; sizeshe of fingernails.</li>
            <li>Not really a huge deal, you can just snip them off, but I thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super slow as it shipped directly from China.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re willing to wait a few weeks to receive the item.</li>

            <li> Cool.</li>
            <li> However, the quality was relatively good for the low price.</li>
            <li> They really apply acrylic smooth and accurate.</li>
            <li> They come with several different sizes which is great!</li>
            <li> and they work super</li>
            <li> The shape is perfect for removing extra polish especially gel when doing your nails.</li>
            <li> They are made with different brush tips and fit nicely in your hand for ease of gel application.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes, they came two weeks earlier than expected which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I just love these brushes, they come in seven different sizes to fit each and every nail.</li>
            <li> And see how much fun and complements you will get.</li>
            <li> A nice set especially for the money.</li>
            <li> Love them love them and before someone say that ey not good or cheap when the true problem is that some don&#x27;t know what they are doing.</li>
            <li> For only $9.00 I figured I would be getting a cheap brush set, and they are pretty cheap and flimsy</li>
            <li> Came earlier then expected &amp; works good!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be able to glue the brush back onto the bottom handle.  </li>
            <li> There are enough sizes to for most functions</li>
            <li> i dont need that many and none worked for doing my french curve</li>
            <li> love the different sizes</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> and I love all the different sizes.</li>
            <li> These are not of super high quality but do seem to work well.</li>
            <li> The handles are a bit short, but easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> These arrived fast.</li>
            <li> they arrived fast, they are just as stated and work verry well with the uv builder gel.</li>
            <li> and I love the pink ivory colored handles.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes however after some use the metal separated from handle on a few.</li>
            <li> (the head fell off one on the first use, but I was able to glue it back on) but for only $9.00, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> They feel very sturdy and high quality and the shorter length provides a lot of control.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice, but not top grade.  </li>
            <li> So far they&#x27;re a pretty decent but for someone who just does their own nails, but idk how they&#x27;d hold up to professional everyday usage.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a better business practice to get back to your customers, especially if they&#x27;ve asked.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> The bristles also feel high quality.</li>
            <li> These are so nice, the handles are either glass or a hard plastic.</li>
            <li> These brushes have a thick handle that was nice to grip.</li>
            <li> save your money, cheap false apart easy.</li>
            <li> For the purchase, and shipping, I could&#x27;ve just driven to my local beauty supply place and got it right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them weekly for months and they still look new and haven&#x27;t shed any bristles.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I have no complaint about these brushes so far.</li>
            <li> Well worth the Very long time it took to deliver.</li>
            <li> no problems so far.  </li>
            <li> it add stones pearl stripe tapes and just let yourself go wild.</li>
            <li> I just received these brushes today and must say they&#x27;re very well made and will last quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty &amp; pink with 7 different sizes to work with all shapes &amp; sizeshe of fingernails.</li>
            <li> Not really a huge deal, you can just snip them off, but I thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super slow as it shipped directly from China.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re willing to wait a few weeks to receive the item.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a tip stir all UV gel pots from the bottom especially colored UV gels and apply in thin coats curing in between each layer until the true color is achieved.  </li>
            <li> Took forever to arrive and not as flat as I was hoping once I used it in my acrylic monomer.</li>
            <li> a week and a half early yay...</li>
            <li> Long shipping wait</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t realize that it would take so long to receive the item.</li>
            <li> It reach earlier than I expected</li>
            <li> only used a few times and they did not last</li>
            <li> The tips fell off immediately, but a little glue got them back in working order.  </li>
            <li> Work as expected.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> They arrived way faster than was expected, and they look just as pictured.</li>
            <li> I like the pink in these, work well</li>
            <li> I get the brush wet with rubbing alcohol, dab it on a paper towel to remove the excess and then brush off any errors before I cure my nails.</li>
            <li> it came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> the last brushes I purchased seemed to melt with acetone, what a mess!  </li>
            <li> I think the problem is that the bristles are the same plastic as acrylic, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for other uses rather than for applying nail gel.</li>
            <li> Gave one less star because the glue holding the bristles on one of them</li>
            <li> The brushes finally arrived and two were broken.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it a few times already</li>
            <li> The brush handles are small and I&#x27;d like them a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> HEADS ARE A LITTLE SMALL</li>
            <li> None of them have broken apart nor have I had issues with loose bristles.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I am a an amateur uv nail artist.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ve helped me up my nail game.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with the assortment of sizes to choose from.</li>
            <li> I tried one out (using acrylic) and it wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great deal for these brushes. They look nice, they&#x27;ve worked perfectly, and no brush hairs have come out so far after several uses. I&#x27;ve only used one size brush though, but I like the option of having different sizes. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Work as expected.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> These are so nice, the handles are either glass or a hard plastic. The aren&#x27;t bothered by the acetone remover. I ordered a set for my daughter too, can&#x27;t beat it.....</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and very well made!  wow!</li>
            <li> Good quality. Will order again if needed</li>
            <li> Great brushes for acrylic gel! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Boy what a surprise waited some time for delivery-But worth every day!! Great price and for price great quality, will order again and again..</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for the price.  I use them with gel polish and gel builders and they work great.  Gave one less star because the glue holding the bristles on one of them had glued part of one side so the bristles were glued together.  But I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone looking for good nail brushes.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with bristles falling out or anything.</li>
            <li> The brushes finally arrived and two were broken. Had to throw them away.</li>
            <li> Love the size. Does the job great.</li>
            <li> Nice design and they&#x27;ve helped me up my nail game.</li>
            <li> ...one of them came apart while I was emptying the bag they came in.. I&#x27;ll be able to glue the brush back onto the bottom handle.  I informed the seller that I planned to keep them and fix it myself and said I&#x27;d wait for their response before leaving feedback. I included a picture of the brushes. It&#x27;s been a week or so and I have yet to hear anything back. Not a horrible thing, but it&#x27;s a better business practice to get back to your customers, especially if they&#x27;ve asked. Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Have paid much more .. good value!  Happy with purchase!  Purchased to use with Gelish system for the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; step .. working just fine.  Just in case cleaned with acetone prior to using!</li>
            <li> I am a an amateur uv nail artist. Self taught. I have no complaint about these brushes so far. They come in great sizes!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to uses these , they seem to be good quaility</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them weekly for months and they still look new and haven&#x27;t shed any bristles.</li>
            <li> save your money, cheap false apart easy. looks good though. brushes dont work at all.</li>
            <li> Great for gel fullsets. Very sturdy!!! Great price and I love the quality. Will order again when I need more.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it a few times already and they are somehow loosing their shape and become smaller</li>
            <li> Cool. Took forever to arrive and not as flat as I was hoping once I used it in my acrylic monomer. Still works fine</li>
            <li> The brush heads bristles were not cut properly so you have different size strands poking out in different places which of course messes up whatever product you are using with it.</li>
            <li> only used a few times and they did not last and i cleaned them well after every use but the start to lose the bristles</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes to apply a gel nail builder.  Nice sturdy brushes and a variety of sizes.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with the assortment of sizes to choose from.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes, they came two weeks earlier than expected which is a plus. The quality is really nice and they are easy to clean. I use Ibd brush cleaner. I recommend these brushes to any looking for good quality brushes at a great price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price for very good brushes. Well worth the Very long time it took to deliver.</li>
            <li> These arrived fast. They are a nice assortment of sizes and seem good qaulity especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes at a great price! I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. These brushes have a thick handle that was nice to grip. The bristles were various sizes and allowed for various brush strokes. Have used them with acrylic and for various art project - used with glue or paint or chalk/pastels.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great! There are enough sizes to for most functions you&#x27;d need these for. I personally use them to apply glitter, gel, and to make french tips. None of them have broken apart nor have I had issues with loose bristles. These are just fine and easily replaceable too. Very good deal.</li>
            <li> Could never get the acrylic out of these brushes even when using 100% acetone. I think the problem is that the bristles are the same plastic as acrylic, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> nice brushes with a nice weight to them, so far they do not shed any of the strands, very easy to use</li>
            <li> The tips fell off immediately, but a little glue got them back in working order.  The brushes are nice, but not top grade.  They will work well for gel nails or decorating nails.</li>
            <li> Ok.for price. Long shipping wait</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes. They work amazing. They come with several different sizes which is great! I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> These brushes work really good. I like that their not so big and bulky.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED AND WORKS GREAT WITH THE UV GEL SUPPLIES FOR DOING MY NAILS AT HOME, WOULD BUY AGAIN OR RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised. The handles are a bit short, but easy to get used to. The variety of sizes was a welcomed addition to my kit.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes has really came in handy when applying acrylic nails, gel nails, or designs. They&#x27;re pretty &amp; pink with 7 different sizes to work with all shapes &amp; sizeshe of fingernails.</li>
            <li> They arrived way faster than was expected, and they look just as pictured. I tried one out (using acrylic) and it wasn&#x27;t that bad I just have to adjust to using the bigger brush size. So far they&#x27;re a pretty decent but for someone who just does their own nails, but idk how they&#x27;d hold up to professional everyday usage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s came in a promptly manner and I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> The brush handles are small and I&#x27;d like them a little bit longer. The bristles are stiff and nice which is good for gel nails.</li>
            <li> lots of brushes- i dont need that many and none worked for doing my french curve</li>
            <li> The product was what I thought it was and it was a good price. But I didn&#x27;t realize that it would take so long to receive the item. For the purchase, and shipping, I could&#x27;ve just driven to my local beauty supply place and got it right away.</li>
            <li> This brushes are a mirako worker . They get the job done and the price ...thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Came earlier then expected &amp; works good!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for cleaning up polish and for just polishing tip. They r coming from China so delivery took about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I like the pink in these, work well and I may purchase these again.</li>
            <li> These are not of super high quality but do seem to work well. I&#x27;ve had them for a while now and they haven&#x27;t fallen apart.</li>
            <li> no problems so far.  the last brushes I purchased seemed to melt with acetone, what a mess!  These have &amp;#34;plasticish&amp;#34; handles and hold up well for manicures.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes when I started applying my own gel polish. They are excellent for removal of boo-boos. I get the brush wet with rubbing alcohol, dab it on a paper towel to remove the excess and then brush off any errors before I cure my nails.</li>
            <li> I just love these brushes, they come in seven different sizes to fit each and every nail. Perfect for my gelish structure gel!</li>
            <li> They are such great brushes I use them on my services all the time and even with acetone</li>
            <li> product was good and highly recommended it if you need gel brush. it came faster than expected. definitely will order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes. Arrived on time and we&#x27;ll made!</li>
            <li> The shipping was super slow as it shipped directly from China. However, the quality was relatively good for the low price. I would definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re willing to wait a few weeks to receive the item.</li>
            <li> Very handy and  inexpensive. I recommend</li>
            <li> These are great brushes</li>
            <li> For only $9.00 I figured I would be getting a cheap brush set, and they are pretty cheap and flimsy (the head fell off one on the first use, but I was able to glue it back on) but for only $9.00, I can&#x27;t complain. Lots of different sizes and overall just what I was looking for. I use these brushes with the OPI Axxium system.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush set. Love them love them and before someone say that ey not good or cheap when the true problem is that some don&#x27;t know what they are doing. If you learn how to use any UV gel for your nails you will find this set is amazing. Here&#x27;s a tip stir all UV gel pots from the bottom especially colored UV gels and apply in thin coats curing in between each layer until the true color is achieved.  Once you learn that get a set of dotting tools and create amazing nail art that has your style too it add stones pearl stripe tapes and just let yourself go wild. And see how much fun and complements you will get.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes the handle length is perfect, there is no shedding and there different sizes make them a great addition to my collection.</li>

            <li> Nice brushes for gels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these brushes maybe 5 times since I&#x27;ve gotten them and by far they are my favorite brushes!</li>
            <li> These are definitely worth the price!  I&#x27;ll be using these to wipe acetone around the edges of my nail to clean up excess gel polish before curing to get a nice crisp edge.</li>
            <li> I think these worked great and easy to clean I will be ordering more I would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I just received these brushes today and must say they&#x27;re very well made and will last quite awhile.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect for gel application</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I really love it.</li>
            <li> It reach earlier than I expected</li>
            <li> These brushes were shorter than I had envisioned in my head, but I actually really love the length and girth of these brushes. They feel very sturdy and high quality and the shorter length provides a lot of control. The bristles also feel high quality. The only reason I give these brushes a 4 instead of a 5 is because I&#x27;ve found that there are one or two bristles that hang out longer than the others. Not really a huge deal, you can just snip them off, but I thought it was worth mentioning. I would still definitely recommend these brushes to anyone, they really are a great deal!</li>
            <li> A nice set especially for the money. I bought it for the #6 brush to use with Gelish Structure and it did a nice job and the bristles didn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> HEADS ARE A LITTLE SMALL BUT OTHERWISE OK</li>

            <li> I love these brushes and they work well with the acrylic. I will order more of them and I love the color of the handles. In all these brushes do the job they said they would.</li>
            <li> Very good value for money. I bought this product for other uses rather than for applying nail gel.</li>
            <li> Bought them to use with my Gelish Harmony products!  Work great and was a great value!  Have used them several times and they always clean up great.  No bristle loss which is fantastic!</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect with the Harmony Gelish products. The bristles haven&#x27;t/don&#x27;t fall out and are of great quality!</li>

            <li> the brushes are pretty good for your buck! rally happy with them!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for working gel.  I just wish it was a wooden handle so they wouldn&#x27;t get that yucky gummy feel from the acetone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I received my item thank you!</li>
            <li> Great deal! Very pleased with my purchase. Will buy more!</li>

            <li> Takes a while to receive</li>
            <li> These brushes are great!!!  They are made with different brush tips and fit nicely in your hand for ease of gel application.</li>
            <li> It came way before the delivery date and I love the pink ivory colored handles. They really apply acrylic smooth and accurate. The handle was very easy to grip and I love all the different sizes.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price</li>
            <li> These gel nail brushes are awesome</li>
            <li> These brushes are great.  They are cheap at all. They came in a nice case with plastic covers for each brush to protect them.  I would totally buy from these again.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes however after some use the metal separated from handle on a few.</li>
