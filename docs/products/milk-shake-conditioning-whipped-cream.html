            <li> I like to flat iron my hair and this product</li>
            <li> This mousse leave-in conditioner also seems to protect my hair while using my flat iron.</li>
            <li> One cannister of this goes a long way, too; I think it lasted a year or so before I ran out of one bottle, and that was with regular usage.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair to start with</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so frizzy or dry anymore</li>
            <li> I usually start to frizz at the ends as the day progresses, but with this product, I can actually go two days before I have to shampoo and restyle!  </li>
            <li> I have less frizz</li>
            <li> Not worth the $5 savings at all!</li>
            <li> So, while it&#x27;s a bit expensive, this&#x27;ll last you a while.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend the product itself, but I don&#x27;t know how bad the shipping process may be.</li>

            <li> This product was recommended to me by my hair stylist of 12 years.  I have dry hair to start with and I highlight and color my hair adding to the dryness.  This product  makes my hair soft  and manageable. Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the whole Milk Shake line! I can&#x27;t say I got it from Amazon; my salon recommended it for me, and I&#x27;m glad I use it. Not only does it smell great, but I love what it does for my incredibly thick, somewhat curly hair. I would definitely recommend the product itself, but I don&#x27;t know how bad the shipping process may be.</li>
            <li> It is very good for your hair.  It leaves your hair shinning and soft.  I would recommend it. You also save for what your hair dresser charges.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 years and I can tell that this is not an authentic Milk Shake product.  The smell is completely different! I should have known by the price that this wasn&#x27;t the real deal. Not worth the $5 savings at all!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft, shiny, and smelling of vanilla. I only use it once a week and I blow dry after for best results. Love this product and am so glad it&#x27;s easier to find!</li>

I like to flat iron my hair and this product made my hair feel like silk!  I usually start to frizz at the ends as the day progresses, but with this product, I can actually go two days before I have to shampoo and restyle!  FANTASTIC product!  Did I mention how yummy the smell is????</li>
            <li> the mousse is rich and smells fantastic; it does as it promises and leaves hair feeling soft with no sticky mess; on my long soft curly hair, however, the product caused my hair to get frizzy on day two, no matter how much styling gel or re-applying of mousse I tried.

            <li> Like many people, this was recommended to me by my hair stylist. It works amazingly! I get dye jobs quite often, so my hair is a bit... \\&quot;fried.\\&quot; This product takes care of it! It makes me hair soft, sleek, and manageable. It smells absolutely delicious-- just like cake batter! One cannister of this goes a long way, too; I think it lasted a year or so before I ran out of one bottle, and that was with regular usage. So, while it&#x27;s a bit expensive, this&#x27;ll last you a while. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has fried hair or just wants to smell nice. :)</li>
