            <li>and I think this product is just great.  </li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel any of the burning sensations that others have experienced with this product and it removed ALL of the hair on my legs and bikini line.</li>
            <li>Waxing works great but hurts a lot.</li>
            <li>It smelled great.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>was very nice in solving this matter but try another part of their line rather than this.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!!!!</li>
            <li>My skin felt amazing!</li>
            <li>The scent is okay, not the best smell in the world</li>
            <li>I am a very happy customer. :-)</li>
            <li>Also the scent is not altogether pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I leave it on for 10 minutes and it has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>but now the smell disappears fairly quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I decided it was a good alternative.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think, it is supposed to smell good but just doesn&#x27;t to me.  </li>
            <li>I thought this might be a good alternative</li>
            <li>it smelled good</li>
            <li>But I got a good deal at CVS so descided to try it.</li>
            <li>Im so happy :)</li>
            <li>I am very pleased...</li>
            <li>and I made sure to not rub in!</li>
            <li>and I thought it had gotten better, NO!</li>
            <li>On top of the burn, not all of the hair was even removed!</li>
            <li>This was perfect since my first leg had a one minute headstart on my second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t regret buying it one bit, so my better than shaving!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Veet before and the product was amazing</li>
            <li>this product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Its not for everyone, but it is AMAZING for me.</li>
            <li>Hair is gone, skin doesn&#x27;t look so nice.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that I loved it.</li>
            <li>When I put this on my legs I did not feel any kind of pain, it was not until I got in the shower that there was some pain.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and have fairly fine hair</li>
            <li>I am sure my facial expression was priceless when a smooth, beautifully hairless leg was what emerged from under the cream.</li>
            <li>very easy, quick, and effective!</li>
            <li>used Nair many many years ago and aside from the smell, I never had any complaints.</li>
            <li>But for everything else I love it.</li>
            <li>I sent a picture to my sister-in-law and told her she was my favorite person in the world.</li>
            <li>And on top of all that, it didn&#x27;t even remove my hair, so now I have to shave on top of my chemical burns if I feel like leaving the house.</li>
            <li>Bikini line probably needed another minute, since the hair is a bit coarser, but it did remove most of the hair.</li>
            <li>In 3 or 4 minutes, I could see leg hair collapsing in defeat, so I jumped (okay - climbed) into the shower and loofahed both legs.  </li>
            <li>It gets me nice and smooth in every spot.  </li>
            <li>I always want to make sure I&#x27;m nice and smooth for the gentlemen I serve, so I use this exclusively.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but for the love of all that&#x27;s holy do not</li>
            <li>Okay, that sucked, because that one I used for my pubic area</li>
            <li>2 more uses</li>
            <li>As close to a home Brazilian as you can get at home :-)</li>
            <li>Personally, I love the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard that Nair had re-done all of its products and that they were a lot better than they used to be.</li>
            <li>My legs were smooth and hairless but during the process it felt like my legs, underarms, and bikini area were on fire!</li>
            <li>the top layer of my skin as well....</li>
            <li>I have used this product many times and have never had a problem.</li>
            <li>I think is product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s saved me money, time and pain :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad it worked out.</li>
            <li>(many were saying it doesnt)</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>(it stands in the shower), which means trying to remove it was even more</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try it on my bikini line because I wasn&#x27;t sure how my skin would react to it, so I instead did my legs.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it all of the time.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t put any on my thighs.</li>
            <li>Nair continues to be my favorite hair-removal cream.  </li>
            <li>Ok - this (according to the instructions) could be used on bikini line, legs, and underarms.  </li>
            <li>It washed off me really quickly and is much more effective than trying to shave everything.</li>
            <li>Just like laser isn&#x27;t for everyone or works better on light skin/dark hair complexions, Nair will not be for everyone.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the great results.</li>
            <li>A fun reminder of my foray into the hazardous world of Nair products.</li>
            <li>No irritation, no ugly smell, no burnnnn !</li>
            <li>This stuff is fairly easy to use although you do have to remember to put it on BEFORE stepping into the shower</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t get easily irritated by the way.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on, easy to wipe off...</li>
            <li>and it is strong</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product because of how easy it is to apply and it smells better than the original nair and the one with aloe.</li>
            <li>When using make sure no water mixes in because it makes it less effective and make sure to use a good amount to cover the area.</li>
            <li>After showering, my legs feel fine</li>
            <li>So start the 10 minute countdown when you first start applying the product to make sure you are not leaving it on more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>and I figured it would be fine after I put lotion on it.</li>
            <li>I spot-tested this product on my legs, and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>and it seemed fine until I went to wipe it off with the sponge that came with it.  </li>
            <li>but after that I was fine.</li>
            <li>Gives very smooth legs when applied carefully, and a great result every time.  </li>
            <li>Just be smart and FOLLOW the directions, make sure to do a test area and wait the 24 hours before doing more.</li>
            <li>I use this almost every time instead of saveing my bf loves this stuff because mylegs are always so  smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth both directions...with and against the grain.  </li>
            <li>The results on my legs were fantastic.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing and saves me so much time, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>No stragglers, no missed stripes of hair...just smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>It really does stay does stay on while you shower and even smells nice.....</li>
            <li>It leaves my legs smooth for 2 almost 3 days.</li>
            <li>Had been using Veet (which works great) until i saw this recently.</li>
            <li>my legs have never been so smooth.</li>
            <li>I honestly think it works really well.</li>
            <li>I have always had good luck with nair products and don&#x27;t tend to have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>&quot; I was delighted; thought I might be able to go back to removing my \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; without looking like a clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rare that I log on to write a review</li>
            <li>Started to wipe it off and it all came off super easy</li>
            <li>First off, it smells ok  for a depilatory.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t do my whole leg !</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews I reluctantly tried this product for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>first, it went ok, so I tried under arms.</li>
            <li>Super easy and quick.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for the full 10 minutes sometimes 15 minutes on accident</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s still irritates your skin a little, and smells slightly less than pleasant, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I put it on sparingly since it was my first time trying it, and in 10 minutes 98% of my bikini area easily wiped off.</li>
            <li>Doing this takes more time then shaving and is ten times more pain ful when you burn yourself.</li>
            <li>I was pleasently surprised that there was no disgusting stench, just a light fragrant scent that I found quite pleasent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After three minutes my legs were burning and BLEEDING, so I removed the cream quickly.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin nice and smooth with no stubs, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>so waxing hurts more than normal</li>
            <li>I just bought this today, I used it and was amazed at how easy and fast it was.</li>
            <li>Thanks Nair!!</li>
            <li>and I love my results so far!</li>
            <li>and I startd wiping the product off my first leg!</li>
            <li>PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very fair skinned and have had eczema on the bends of my arms since I was in diapers, but the skin on my legs has never been noticeably sensitive to shaving creams or anything like that, so I had no real reason to worry about this product having any effect on me.</li>
            <li>But now I&#x27;m smooth and hairless haha</li>
            <li>I could not have been more surprised.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>(seeing as how I rarely shave my legs were quite hairy)</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had success with creams until NOW..</li>
            <li>Literally, I had bleeding holes on my most sensitive areas because that&#x27;s what happens when you don&#x27;t have a lot of control with the damn sponge.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive that I can&#x27;t shave more than once or twice a week</li>
            <li>Applying deodorant is not an option right now</li>
            <li>I was convinced that Satan himself had stuck me with his pitchfork; right in the twitchet.</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>It works right away,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I took a wash cloth and wiped the clay off and it took the hair right with it.</li>
            <li>This hair removal cream is great at removing hair; on your legs and arm pits as long as you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great for some people, but new users, please be mindful that there are others who get a serious break out.</li>
            <li>I literally chunked this in the trash right after my first use.</li>
            <li>My arm pits are still red and it hurts to touch, imagine how applying deodorant feels, I would never recommend this product to ANYONE who still wants nice, non-burnt skin.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly..</li>
            <li>But with Nair the first time I used it I got a burn</li>
            <li>And i followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>I found the sponge to be a nice add-on but not really practical since it takes forever for me to use it to put on my legs.</li>
            <li>Used it on my WHOLE body and all the hair just washed out in the shower!</li>
            <li>I tried nair probably about 7 years ago now when it first came out</li>
            <li>which is exactly what I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li>At 5 minutes, I turned on the shower and let water warm up, then I got in and just let my hair get wet.</li>
            <li>9 minutes, I put my first leg under the stream of water and udes the sponge as directed to gentl rub off the product.</li>
            <li>Worked exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying anything like this , and I followed all directions exactly.</li>
            <li>Unless you enjoy the sensation of the fires of hell burning near your minge, don&#x27;t do your bikini</li>
            <li>It is a lesson I will not soon forget and wish to prevent others from learning first hand.</li>
            <li>If you do insist on experiencing first hand Pele burning through your inguen, I recommend these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To top it off, it also caused ingrown hairs that scabbed over when the hair does start to grow back.</li>
            <li>I got into the shower and started washing it off from the area I first applied it to).</li>
            <li>It takes care of my leg hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>OK, so I have used Clay Nair 4 times total.  </li>
            <li>Guess I should have learned my lesson the first time</li>
            <li>I did exactly as the bottle instructed and still ended up with chemical burns on my bikini area, legs, and underarms.</li>
            <li>It did remove most of the hair, but it still left quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>So i done exactly as the directions say i did not rub it in an</li>
            <li>i put an even amount over the whole area!</li>
            <li>I was initially apprehensive about this because of the amount of 1 star reviews, but I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen.</li>
            <li>I really cannot even believe the success I just had with this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nair for many years on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>Someone mentioned having used Sally Hanson successfully in the past.</li>
            <li>once I got this product in the mail but the first time I used it, I followed the directions provided which said to leave the clay on for two minutes before showering and leave it on while you shower.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the directions and apply in outside the shower and give it a minute to start working before you step in.  </li>
            <li>The two stars are for the bikini line - worked exactly like it said.  </li>
            <li>I am a complete product junkie and very rarely does something do what it says it will let alone</li>
            <li>Like other women mentioned, I felt a kind of stinging sensation in the first minute of application but ignored it.</li>
            <li>With the first one (the regular one) my legs stung too much and most, but not all, hair was removed.</li>
            <li>so I tried Brazilian bikini wax and was pleased with the results, but the pain was too much for me to do it regularly.</li>
            <li>Make sure you listen to your body, 5 minutes was too long to leave this cream on my skin.</li>
            <li>I pretty much bought this product on whim</li>
            <li>onto the good stuff, I took the sponge and applied a thick amount of the cream onto my legs and my bikini area, i waited a minute from when I first applied it on my first leg</li>
            <li>Even shook it for a ridiculous amount of time to make sure it was okay.</li>
            <li>My legs are super soft.</li>
            <li>I threw the whole brand new bottle in the trash!!</li>
            <li>Still very prickly</li>
            <li>but my underarms are very burned</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several hair removal creams before; mostly Veet and Nair products, and I&#x27;m typically happy with the results, but getting there is usually uncomfortable and takes forever (over the 10 minute max application times).</li>
            <li>I would absolutely use this again.</li>
            <li>But before getting into the shower one night I figured I&#x27;d try out my whole</li>
            <li>This really works for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to shaving thanks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they form to your mossy cleft and refreeze relatively fast.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Left it on for 10minutes and rubbed it off with the sponge, rinsed, and put on lontion and couldnt believe how smooth my legs were.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot, Nair, once again you manage to market satan in a bottle.</li>
            <li>My skin is normally very tolerant.</li>
            <li>I had a burning sensation on the areas I had applied it for a whole day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used waxing strips,purchased the no no, and used several shaving products just to get smooth legs.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my legs after reading all directions, watching the time carefully and making sure not to \\&quot;rub it in\\&quot; as directed on the package.  </li>
            <li>my Brazilian heritage really shows through.</li>
            <li>Tried the product today on bikini area and legs getting ready for the beach.</li>
            <li>I literally stood in shock after i wiped the cream off because it took all of my hair off and left my legs and bikini line smooth.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous about using this after reading them...</li>
            <li>Now this product clings on your skin really well</li>
            <li>Intense burning and irritation and the hair is still all there -</li>
            <li>The sponge is probably good if you are using it for a small area like your underarms or &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34; I use my hand (wash your hands after if you go this route!)</li>
            <li>It maybe missed a few hairs for me but those can easily be plucked with tweezers and you could even use your razor to quickly remove those leftover hairs.</li>
            <li>The bottom half of my legs were smooth and clean while the top half was still Yeti like in appearance.</li>
            <li>The second day when my legs were still (somehow) smooth, I wanted to see how the regrowth would be, so I waited a week and the hair on my legs looks like it normally does on day 3-4 after shaving.</li>
            <li>Shaving has never given me such a clean shave.</li>
            <li>My advice is to clean the floor thoroughly with Windex before stepping back into it.</li>
            <li>Left it on the full 10.  </li>
            <li>and I still can&#x27;t put my arms down because anything touching the burns causes a lot of pain.</li>
            <li>BUT the bottle itself does warn that you can easily burn your skin if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li>this particular formula isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>The mild reaction went away as soon as I showered and all my hair was gone, not a inch left.</li>
            <li>I left it on the the same amount of time but just added some more clay on my legs.</li>
            <li>The Shower Power line in particular has won me over from the Veet side.  </li>
            <li>I would just give it a try, but I didn&#x27;t have high expectations after reading all of the reviews.</li>
            <li>There were a few things about this product that left me less than impressed</li>
            <li>Left on for 7 minutes and completely wiped the bikini line clean.  </li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to much of anything, but it is getting thinner with age...</li>
            <li>But it did not really remove all of the hair on the legs I still had to shave and it left bright red burns under the arms -</li>
            <li>I normally use a Veet product but was in a pinch and saw this at Walgreen&#x27;s</li>
            <li>/&gt;After getting the cream off both legs, I then took my shower normally, with the exception of not using my loofa when applying soap to my legs.</li>
            <li>I thought it was normal and proceeded to get into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Neither did the many ointments, lotions, potions, prayers, begging, pleading, or crying I tried; and I prayed to every god or goddess that came to my pain fogged mind.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really get any burning but my skin is normal, not too sensitive.</li>
            <li>I had no negative reaction, so I tried it on my underarms.</li>
            <li>It is also nice and thick.  </li>
            <li>My wonderful boyfriend has hair on his back/shoulders that is VERY thick and black</li>
            <li>I am surprised to see negative reviews, and glad I didn&#x27;t read them before trying it!</li>
            <li>On top of that it is messy to use and you end up using half the bottle on one application, it did stay on in the shower but does not come off quickly or easily when you are in a hurry to get it off of you.</li>
            <li>I began using veet with positive results, but the store I generally go to was out today.</li>
            <li>I tried this new version and it started tingling after about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>but this new nair Brazilian clay changed that.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>I even tested it on a small area of my leg and everything was fine!</li>
            <li>realize not everyone is the same, but for me, it worked better than I ever expected.</li>
            <li>but I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My sister uses this product and recommended even though she has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>6 minutes in the shower and the hair completely wiped off!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I didn&#x27;t read the instructions properly (totally my fault)</li>
            <li>This product is no way as smelly and the application is not messy!</li>
            <li>I start my 10 minute countdown from the second I apply the first smear of product to my leg.</li>
            <li>wow me like this!</li>
            <li>The hair came off in record time and all hair is completely removed!  </li>
            <li>So far, there are no signs of ingrown hairs and NO RAZOR BUMPS!</li>
            <li>Surprised at how not only was the hair removal what I desired, but the way it has left my skin so soft and smooth reminds me of a wax.</li>
            <li>Make sure you not only rinse it off but then scrub down after you remove it with the sponge or it will stay on your skin and keep working...</li>
            <li>others are have such positive results and I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li>But with this one I only felt a slight tingle on my arms and had a very mild reaction on my right upper forearm.</li>
            <li>Coarse hair areas such as bikini were fine but as soon as I put it on my upper leg it burned.</li>
            <li>You better scrub hard and the flimsy sponge sorta removes it.</li>
            <li>I have allergies and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Like I said, really sensitive skin....</li>
            <li>decided to put some uncented lotion on my legs and so far 10 minutes after, the itching and burning went away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would say if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Like my three year old nephew&#x27;s diaper.</li>
            <li>I was going to try Veet Sensitive Skin but mistakenly bought this</li>
            <li>She said it worked well with her sensitive skin, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>After I get in the shower I try not to let the water hit my legs directly</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I only used a small portion of skin as the bottle says to only use for the first time you use it to make sure there are no adverse effects, but I can&#x27;t believe how well this product works</li>
            <li>IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN WHATSOEVER, I BEG OF YOU</li>
            <li>But they fade fast enough.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not lotion so the area needs to be completely covered.</li>
            <li>The Sensitive Skin one never burned or irritated me.  </li>
            <li>Walmart used to be the last store that carried it, and when I would go in to buy a bottle (rare since the only Walmart near me is 15 minutes out of my way)</li>
            <li>This is not for sensitive skin (or anyone&#x27;s skin) at all.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I swear I didn&#x27;t think this product would work, but I was amazed at how soft it made my legs...</li>
            <li>(maybe it&#x27;s too sensitive or is allergic to some of the ingredients).</li>
            <li>Not messy.</li>
            <li>i dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>With the old Nair, it took 9-10 minutes to see results, but with this one, it was about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin also</li>
            <li>Although this didn&#x27;t get rid of everything, it made my hair so incredibly soft that when I shaved the rest, my skin was not irritated at all.</li>
            <li>No chemical burns but didn&#x27;t use on a sensitive area either.  </li>
            <li>When I discovered the Brazilian formula for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and have not had even a hint of tingling or burning.</li>
            <li>I tried the product today and was quite surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive as well</li>
            <li>A scoop or blade style would work much better for this thick cream.</li>
            <li>Now I know to make sure it is thick all over</li>
            <li>I would try leaving this on for 7-8 minutes and testing a small section of your skin to see if the hair comes off easily.</li>
            <li>When I used it on him, I left it on for three minutes and it worked ok enough, but he was still stubbly, and you could still see the black follicles.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product first on my underarms because it said to try it on a small area first.</li>
            <li>it is stronger than other cream I have used, can remove my hair in like 3 min (other products take 10 min or more), but It waas washed off under shower...</li>
            <li>It is quick and takes less time than shaving.</li>
            <li>I used this today and made the huge mistake of doing every where that needed shaving at the time after testing a small area.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s to be expected of a first time user.</li>
            <li>If you have super dark, coarse hair, and sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I have used Nair before, but it was their regular one for coarse hair and, even though it removed the hair and I lasted quite a bit hair-free, it stung way too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this product is far gentler than the regular and old school versions of Nair.</li>
            <li>this leads to having half of it absorbed in the sponge.  </li>
            <li>My hair grows back much slower - it is the only product that I will use.</li>
            <li>you know &amp;#34;old lady skin.&amp;#34;  This old lady is tired of trying to shave in the shower, without her glasses on, leaving more patches of hair than she&#x27;s removing.  </li>
            <li>In the past year I haven&#x27;t been able to leave the house after Nairing because the area above my lip becomes red and swollen (and stays that way all day).</li>
            <li>I am usually using natural products, and even make my own body butter, so I am not sure if I made my skin sensitive to chemicals or what.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go out in public with a mustache, so I have to use a depilatory, but I sure wish I could find one that adequately removes facial hair (mine is thick and dark) without burning my skin off!</li>
            <li>I used to use the shower power version that came in the blue bottle (for Sensitive Skin)</li>
            <li>For two weeks I could barely wear underwear or jeans.</li>
            <li>I could barely apply deodorant to my armpits</li>
            <li>The last time I checked they weren&#x27;t even carrying it at all, only this new Brazilian Clay formula in the orange bottle and another Argan Oil formula in the teal bottle.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have bad smell like many other creams :)</li>
            <li>I have used Nair basic hair removal creams in the past and honestly had no success, but on a whim bought the basic bottle of the Spa Clay with the sponge.</li>
            <li>So I used the sponge that was included to begin to wipe the cream off, and well, all of the hair really did come off, but my shins were so pink and irritated!</li>
            <li>Not a single hair still attached.  </li>
            <li>Some areas actually bled and are super raw now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided not to do my whole leg since it states several times to absolutely not exceed 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the public pity, Nair.</li>
            <li>It was difficult to sleep that night because my legs were so sensitive that any thing touching them hurt.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this, but since it works so quickly, watching the time closely is probably the key to making sure you don&#x27;t have a bad reaction.</li>
            <li>I am pretty hairy for a female, and my hair is dark blonde, and medium</li>
            <li>Lastly and most importantly it left stubble behind after I removed it as if I had shaved the day or so before.</li>
            <li>And since I don&#x27;t actually put it anywhere particularly sensitive (like it flat out warns against on the package!!)</li>
            <li>It looked like really bad scars throughout the first week, and I can&#x27;t say that it looks any better</li>
            <li>I am a female Hispanic with thick black hair and very light color skin.</li>

            <li> lol.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any of the burning sensations that others have experienced with this product and it removed ALL of the hair on my legs and bikini line.</li>

            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> was very nice in solving this matter but try another part of their line rather than this.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin felt amazing!</li>
            <li> The scent is okay, not the best smell in the world</li>
            <li> I am a very happy customer. :-)</li>
            <li> Also the scent is not altogether pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on for 10 minutes and it has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> but now the smell disappears fairly quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I decided it was a good alternative.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think, it is supposed to smell good but just doesn&#x27;t to me.  </li>
            <li> I thought this might be a good alternative</li>
            <li> it smelled good</li>
            <li> But I got a good deal at CVS so descided to try it.</li>
            <li> Im so happy :)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased...</li>
            <li> and I made sure to not rub in!</li>
            <li> and I thought it had gotten better, NO!</li>
            <li> On top of the burn, not all of the hair was even removed!</li>
            <li> This was perfect since my first leg had a one minute headstart on my second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret buying it one bit, so my better than shaving!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Veet before and the product was amazing</li>
            <li> this product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Its not for everyone, but it is AMAZING for me.</li>
            <li> Hair is gone, skin doesn&#x27;t look so nice.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to say that I loved it.</li>
            <li> When I put this on my legs I did not feel any kind of pain, it was not until I got in the shower that there was some pain.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and have fairly fine hair</li>
            <li> I am sure my facial expression was priceless when a smooth, beautifully hairless leg was what emerged from under the cream.</li>
            <li> very easy, quick, and effective!</li>
            <li> used Nair many many years ago and aside from the smell, I never had any complaints.</li>
            <li> But for everything else I love it.</li>
            <li> I sent a picture to my sister-in-law and told her she was my favorite person in the world.</li>
            <li> And on top of all that, it didn&#x27;t even remove my hair, so now I have to shave on top of my chemical burns if I feel like leaving the house.</li>
            <li> Bikini line probably needed another minute, since the hair is a bit coarser, but it did remove most of the hair.</li>
            <li> In 3 or 4 minutes, I could see leg hair collapsing in defeat, so I jumped (okay - climbed) into the shower and loofahed both legs.  </li>
            <li> It gets me nice and smooth in every spot.  </li>
            <li> I always want to make sure I&#x27;m nice and smooth for the gentlemen I serve, so I use this exclusively.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but for the love of all that&#x27;s holy do not</li>
            <li> Okay, that sucked, because that one I used for my pubic area</li>
            <li> 2 more uses</li>
            <li> As close to a home Brazilian as you can get at home :-)</li>
            <li> Personally, I love the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard that Nair had re-done all of its products and that they were a lot better than they used to be.</li>
            <li> My legs were smooth and hairless but during the process it felt like my legs, underarms, and bikini area were on fire!</li>
            <li> the top layer of my skin as well....</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times and have never had a problem.</li>
            <li> I think is product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s saved me money, time and pain :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad it worked out.</li>
            <li> (many were saying it doesnt)</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> (it stands in the shower), which means trying to remove it was even more</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try it on my bikini line because I wasn&#x27;t sure how my skin would react to it, so I instead did my legs.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it all of the time.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t put any on my thighs.</li>
            <li> Nair continues to be my favorite hair-removal cream.  </li>
            <li> Ok - this (according to the instructions) could be used on bikini line, legs, and underarms.  </li>
            <li> It washed off me really quickly and is much more effective than trying to shave everything.</li>
            <li> Just like laser isn&#x27;t for everyone or works better on light skin/dark hair complexions, Nair will not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the great results.</li>
            <li> A fun reminder of my foray into the hazardous world of Nair products.</li>
            <li> No irritation, no ugly smell, no burnnnn !</li>
            <li> This stuff is fairly easy to use although you do have to remember to put it on BEFORE stepping into the shower</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t get easily irritated by the way.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, easy to wipe off...</li>
            <li> and it is strong</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product because of how easy it is to apply and it smells better than the original nair and the one with aloe.</li>
            <li> When using make sure no water mixes in because it makes it less effective and make sure to use a good amount to cover the area.</li>
            <li> After showering, my legs feel fine</li>
            <li> So start the 10 minute countdown when you first start applying the product to make sure you are not leaving it on more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I figured it would be fine after I put lotion on it.</li>
            <li> I spot-tested this product on my legs, and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> and it seemed fine until I went to wipe it off with the sponge that came with it.  </li>
            <li> but after that I was fine.</li>
            <li> Gives very smooth legs when applied carefully, and a great result every time.  </li>
            <li> Just be smart and FOLLOW the directions, make sure to do a test area and wait the 24 hours before doing more.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every time instead of saveing my bf loves this stuff because mylegs are always so  smooth.</li>
            <li> Smooth both directions...with and against the grain.  </li>
            <li> The results on my legs were fantastic.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing and saves me so much time, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> No stragglers, no missed stripes of hair...just smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> It really does stay does stay on while you shower and even smells nice.....</li>
            <li> It leaves my legs smooth for 2 almost 3 days.</li>
            <li> Had been using Veet (which works great) until i saw this recently.</li>
            <li> my legs have never been so smooth.</li>
            <li> I honestly think it works really well.</li>
            <li> I have always had good luck with nair products and don&#x27;t tend to have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> &quot; I was delighted; thought I might be able to go back to removing my \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; without looking like a clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rare that I log on to write a review</li>
            <li> Started to wipe it off and it all came off super easy</li>
            <li> First off, it smells ok  for a depilatory.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t do my whole leg !</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I reluctantly tried this product for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> first, it went ok, so I tried under arms.</li>
            <li> Super easy and quick.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for the full 10 minutes sometimes 15 minutes on accident</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s still irritates your skin a little, and smells slightly less than pleasant, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I put it on sparingly since it was my first time trying it, and in 10 minutes 98% of my bikini area easily wiped off.</li>
            <li> Doing this takes more time then shaving and is ten times more pain ful when you burn yourself.</li>
            <li> I was pleasently surprised that there was no disgusting stench, just a light fragrant scent that I found quite pleasent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After three minutes my legs were burning and BLEEDING, so I removed the cream quickly.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin nice and smooth with no stubs, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> so waxing hurts more than normal</li>
            <li> I just bought this today, I used it and was amazed at how easy and fast it was.</li>
            <li> Thanks Nair!!</li>
            <li> and I love my results so far!</li>
            <li> and I startd wiping the product off my first leg!</li>
            <li> PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very fair skinned and have had eczema on the bends of my arms since I was in diapers, but the skin on my legs has never been noticeably sensitive to shaving creams or anything like that, so I had no real reason to worry about this product having any effect on me.</li>
            <li> But now I&#x27;m smooth and hairless haha</li>
            <li> I could not have been more surprised.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> (seeing as how I rarely shave my legs were quite hairy)</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had success with creams until NOW..</li>
            <li> Literally, I had bleeding holes on my most sensitive areas because that&#x27;s what happens when you don&#x27;t have a lot of control with the damn sponge.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive that I can&#x27;t shave more than once or twice a week</li>
            <li> Applying deodorant is not an option right now</li>
            <li> I was convinced that Satan himself had stuck me with his pitchfork; right in the twitchet.</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> It works right away,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I took a wash cloth and wiped the clay off and it took the hair right with it.</li>
            <li> This hair removal cream is great at removing hair; on your legs and arm pits as long as you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works great for some people, but new users, please be mindful that there are others who get a serious break out.</li>
            <li> I literally chunked this in the trash right after my first use.</li>
            <li> My arm pits are still red and it hurts to touch, imagine how applying deodorant feels, I would never recommend this product to ANYONE who still wants nice, non-burnt skin.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly..</li>
            <li> But with Nair the first time I used it I got a burn</li>
            <li> And i followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> I found the sponge to be a nice add-on but not really practical since it takes forever for me to use it to put on my legs.</li>
            <li> Used it on my WHOLE body and all the hair just washed out in the shower!</li>
            <li> I tried nair probably about 7 years ago now when it first came out</li>
            <li> which is exactly what I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> At 5 minutes, I turned on the shower and let water warm up, then I got in and just let my hair get wet.</li>
            <li> 9 minutes, I put my first leg under the stream of water and udes the sponge as directed to gentl rub off the product.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying anything like this , and I followed all directions exactly.</li>
            <li> Unless you enjoy the sensation of the fires of hell burning near your minge, don&#x27;t do your bikini</li>
            <li> It is a lesson I will not soon forget and wish to prevent others from learning first hand.</li>
            <li> If you do insist on experiencing first hand Pele burning through your inguen, I recommend these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To top it off, it also caused ingrown hairs that scabbed over when the hair does start to grow back.</li>
            <li> I got into the shower and started washing it off from the area I first applied it to).</li>
            <li> It takes care of my leg hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> OK, so I have used Clay Nair 4 times total.  </li>
            <li> Guess I should have learned my lesson the first time</li>
            <li> I did exactly as the bottle instructed and still ended up with chemical burns on my bikini area, legs, and underarms.</li>
            <li> It did remove most of the hair, but it still left quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> So i done exactly as the directions say i did not rub it in an</li>
            <li> i put an even amount over the whole area!</li>
            <li> I was initially apprehensive about this because of the amount of 1 star reviews, but I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen.</li>
            <li> I really cannot even believe the success I just had with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nair for many years on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Someone mentioned having used Sally Hanson successfully in the past.</li>
            <li> once I got this product in the mail but the first time I used it, I followed the directions provided which said to leave the clay on for two minutes before showering and leave it on while you shower.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the directions and apply in outside the shower and give it a minute to start working before you step in.  </li>
            <li> The two stars are for the bikini line - worked exactly like it said.  </li>
            <li> I am a complete product junkie and very rarely does something do what it says it will let alone</li>
            <li> Like other women mentioned, I felt a kind of stinging sensation in the first minute of application but ignored it.</li>
            <li> With the first one (the regular one) my legs stung too much and most, but not all, hair was removed.</li>
            <li> so I tried Brazilian bikini wax and was pleased with the results, but the pain was too much for me to do it regularly.</li>
            <li> Make sure you listen to your body, 5 minutes was too long to leave this cream on my skin.</li>
            <li> I pretty much bought this product on whim</li>
            <li> onto the good stuff, I took the sponge and applied a thick amount of the cream onto my legs and my bikini area, i waited a minute from when I first applied it on my first leg</li>
            <li> Even shook it for a ridiculous amount of time to make sure it was okay.</li>
            <li> My legs are super soft.</li>
            <li> I threw the whole brand new bottle in the trash!!</li>
            <li> Still very prickly</li>
            <li> but my underarms are very burned</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several hair removal creams before; mostly Veet and Nair products, and I&#x27;m typically happy with the results, but getting there is usually uncomfortable and takes forever (over the 10 minute max application times).</li>
            <li> I would absolutely use this again.</li>
            <li> But before getting into the shower one night I figured I&#x27;d try out my whole</li>
            <li> This really works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to shaving thanks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they form to your mossy cleft and refreeze relatively fast.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Left it on for 10minutes and rubbed it off with the sponge, rinsed, and put on lontion and couldnt believe how smooth my legs were.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot, Nair, once again you manage to market satan in a bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin is normally very tolerant.</li>
            <li> I had a burning sensation on the areas I had applied it for a whole day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used waxing strips,purchased the no no, and used several shaving products just to get smooth legs.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my legs after reading all directions, watching the time carefully and making sure not to \\&quot;rub it in\\&quot; as directed on the package.  </li>
            <li> my Brazilian heritage really shows through.</li>
            <li> Tried the product today on bikini area and legs getting ready for the beach.</li>
            <li> I literally stood in shock after i wiped the cream off because it took all of my hair off and left my legs and bikini line smooth.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about using this after reading them...</li>
            <li> Now this product clings on your skin really well</li>
            <li> Intense burning and irritation and the hair is still all there -</li>
            <li> The sponge is probably good if you are using it for a small area like your underarms or &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34; I use my hand (wash your hands after if you go this route!)</li>
            <li> It maybe missed a few hairs for me but those can easily be plucked with tweezers and you could even use your razor to quickly remove those leftover hairs.</li>
            <li> The bottom half of my legs were smooth and clean while the top half was still Yeti like in appearance.</li>
            <li> The second day when my legs were still (somehow) smooth, I wanted to see how the regrowth would be, so I waited a week and the hair on my legs looks like it normally does on day 3-4 after shaving.</li>
            <li> Shaving has never given me such a clean shave.</li>
            <li> My advice is to clean the floor thoroughly with Windex before stepping back into it.</li>
            <li> Left it on the full 10.  </li>
            <li> and I still can&#x27;t put my arms down because anything touching the burns causes a lot of pain.</li>
            <li> BUT the bottle itself does warn that you can easily burn your skin if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> this particular formula isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> The mild reaction went away as soon as I showered and all my hair was gone, not a inch left.</li>
            <li> I left it on the the same amount of time but just added some more clay on my legs.</li>
            <li> The Shower Power line in particular has won me over from the Veet side.  </li>
            <li> I would just give it a try, but I didn&#x27;t have high expectations after reading all of the reviews.</li>
            <li> There were a few things about this product that left me less than impressed</li>
            <li> Left on for 7 minutes and completely wiped the bikini line clean.  </li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to much of anything, but it is getting thinner with age...</li>
            <li> But it did not really remove all of the hair on the legs I still had to shave and it left bright red burns under the arms -</li>
            <li> I normally use a Veet product but was in a pinch and saw this at Walgreen&#x27;s</li>
            <li> /&gt;After getting the cream off both legs, I then took my shower normally, with the exception of not using my loofa when applying soap to my legs.</li>
            <li> I thought it was normal and proceeded to get into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Neither did the many ointments, lotions, potions, prayers, begging, pleading, or crying I tried; and I prayed to every god or goddess that came to my pain fogged mind.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get any burning but my skin is normal, not too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I had no negative reaction, so I tried it on my underarms.</li>
            <li> It is also nice and thick.  </li>
            <li> My wonderful boyfriend has hair on his back/shoulders that is VERY thick and black</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see negative reviews, and glad I didn&#x27;t read them before trying it!</li>
            <li> On top of that it is messy to use and you end up using half the bottle on one application, it did stay on in the shower but does not come off quickly or easily when you are in a hurry to get it off of you.</li>
            <li> I began using veet with positive results, but the store I generally go to was out today.</li>
            <li> I tried this new version and it started tingling after about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> but this new nair Brazilian clay changed that.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> I even tested it on a small area of my leg and everything was fine!</li>
            <li> realize not everyone is the same, but for me, it worked better than I ever expected.</li>
            <li> but I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My sister uses this product and recommended even though she has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> 6 minutes in the shower and the hair completely wiped off!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I didn&#x27;t read the instructions properly (totally my fault)</li>
            <li> This product is no way as smelly and the application is not messy!</li>
            <li> I start my 10 minute countdown from the second I apply the first smear of product to my leg.</li>
            <li> wow me like this!</li>
            <li> The hair came off in record time and all hair is completely removed!  </li>
            <li> So far, there are no signs of ingrown hairs and NO RAZOR BUMPS!</li>
            <li> Surprised at how not only was the hair removal what I desired, but the way it has left my skin so soft and smooth reminds me of a wax.</li>
            <li> Make sure you not only rinse it off but then scrub down after you remove it with the sponge or it will stay on your skin and keep working...</li>
            <li> others are have such positive results and I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> But with this one I only felt a slight tingle on my arms and had a very mild reaction on my right upper forearm.</li>
            <li> Coarse hair areas such as bikini were fine but as soon as I put it on my upper leg it burned.</li>
            <li> You better scrub hard and the flimsy sponge sorta removes it.</li>
            <li> I have allergies and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Like I said, really sensitive skin....</li>
            <li> decided to put some uncented lotion on my legs and so far 10 minutes after, the itching and burning went away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would say if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Like my three year old nephew&#x27;s diaper.</li>
            <li> I was going to try Veet Sensitive Skin but mistakenly bought this</li>
            <li> She said it worked well with her sensitive skin, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> After I get in the shower I try not to let the water hit my legs directly</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I only used a small portion of skin as the bottle says to only use for the first time you use it to make sure there are no adverse effects, but I can&#x27;t believe how well this product works</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN WHATSOEVER, I BEG OF YOU</li>
            <li> But they fade fast enough.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not lotion so the area needs to be completely covered.</li>
            <li> The Sensitive Skin one never burned or irritated me.  </li>
            <li> Walmart used to be the last store that carried it, and when I would go in to buy a bottle (rare since the only Walmart near me is 15 minutes out of my way)</li>
            <li> This is not for sensitive skin (or anyone&#x27;s skin) at all.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I swear I didn&#x27;t think this product would work, but I was amazed at how soft it made my legs...</li>
            <li> (maybe it&#x27;s too sensitive or is allergic to some of the ingredients).</li>
            <li> Not messy.</li>
            <li> i dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> With the old Nair, it took 9-10 minutes to see results, but with this one, it was about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin also</li>
            <li> Although this didn&#x27;t get rid of everything, it made my hair so incredibly soft that when I shaved the rest, my skin was not irritated at all.</li>
            <li> No chemical burns but didn&#x27;t use on a sensitive area either.  </li>
            <li> When I discovered the Brazilian formula for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and have not had even a hint of tingling or burning.</li>
            <li> I tried the product today and was quite surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive as well</li>
            <li> A scoop or blade style would work much better for this thick cream.</li>
            <li> Now I know to make sure it is thick all over</li>
            <li> I would try leaving this on for 7-8 minutes and testing a small section of your skin to see if the hair comes off easily.</li>
            <li> When I used it on him, I left it on for three minutes and it worked ok enough, but he was still stubbly, and you could still see the black follicles.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product first on my underarms because it said to try it on a small area first.</li>
            <li> it is stronger than other cream I have used, can remove my hair in like 3 min (other products take 10 min or more), but It waas washed off under shower...</li>
            <li> It is quick and takes less time than shaving.</li>
            <li> I used this today and made the huge mistake of doing every where that needed shaving at the time after testing a small area.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected of a first time user.</li>
            <li> If you have super dark, coarse hair, and sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I have used Nair before, but it was their regular one for coarse hair and, even though it removed the hair and I lasted quite a bit hair-free, it stung way too much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this product is far gentler than the regular and old school versions of Nair.</li>
            <li> this leads to having half of it absorbed in the sponge.  </li>
            <li> My hair grows back much slower - it is the only product that I will use.</li>
            <li> you know &amp;#34;old lady skin.&amp;#34;  This old lady is tired of trying to shave in the shower, without her glasses on, leaving more patches of hair than she&#x27;s removing.  </li>
            <li> In the past year I haven&#x27;t been able to leave the house after Nairing because the area above my lip becomes red and swollen (and stays that way all day).</li>
            <li> I am usually using natural products, and even make my own body butter, so I am not sure if I made my skin sensitive to chemicals or what.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go out in public with a mustache, so I have to use a depilatory, but I sure wish I could find one that adequately removes facial hair (mine is thick and dark) without burning my skin off!</li>
            <li> I used to use the shower power version that came in the blue bottle (for Sensitive Skin)</li>
            <li> For two weeks I could barely wear underwear or jeans.</li>
            <li> I could barely apply deodorant to my armpits</li>
            <li> The last time I checked they weren&#x27;t even carrying it at all, only this new Brazilian Clay formula in the orange bottle and another Argan Oil formula in the teal bottle.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have bad smell like many other creams :)</li>
            <li> I have used Nair basic hair removal creams in the past and honestly had no success, but on a whim bought the basic bottle of the Spa Clay with the sponge.</li>
            <li> So I used the sponge that was included to begin to wipe the cream off, and well, all of the hair really did come off, but my shins were so pink and irritated!</li>
            <li> Not a single hair still attached.  </li>
            <li> Some areas actually bled and are super raw now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided not to do my whole leg since it states several times to absolutely not exceed 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the public pity, Nair.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to sleep that night because my legs were so sensitive that any thing touching them hurt.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this, but since it works so quickly, watching the time closely is probably the key to making sure you don&#x27;t have a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I am pretty hairy for a female, and my hair is dark blonde, and medium</li>
            <li> Lastly and most importantly it left stubble behind after I removed it as if I had shaved the day or so before.</li>
            <li> And since I don&#x27;t actually put it anywhere particularly sensitive (like it flat out warns against on the package!!)</li>
            <li> It looked like really bad scars throughout the first week, and I can&#x27;t say that it looks any better</li>
            <li> I am a female Hispanic with thick black hair and very light color skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend placing a small amount on the back of your hand before placing large amounts over your body.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have large red splotches and small chemical burns all over.</li>
            <li> I have never used a hair removal cream on my legs before, but I decided to give this a try since I am pretty lazy when it comes to shaving, and this product promises to keep the hair away for a long time.</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs to try it out, and in the spots that i left pretty thick with the lotion, the hair all came off.</li>
            <li> (I used it twice in a row on the same spot instead of waiting as well as leaving it on too long).</li>
            <li> Since I just used it, I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t leave it on long enough then I have to touch up with a razer.</li>
            <li> ALL GONE (and my hair wasnt even that long) same with bikini area .</li>
            <li> I am a very hairy African American woman, my hair is also thick</li>
            <li> In order to spread it, you either have to rub the cream off directly onto the skin or fold the sponge in half and scrape the cream onto your skin that way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I returned back to the messy and smelly world of hair removal creams, but was pleasantly surprised when tonight I tried the Nair Hair Remover Brazilian Spa Clay.</li>
            <li> But I saw this in the store and looked up the other reviews on this site as I was still looking at it, and noticed that there were some good, and some bad responses of this product.</li>
            <li> I am half spanish, italian and russian...</li>
            <li> it seemed a little sensitive and that did burn so</li>
            <li> Main complaint for me is that there is still a bit left at the bottom that the pump couldn&#x27;t get out.</li>
            <li> It removed the hair somewhat but left it looking like a rough shave...</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t even on that long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice now, and the second time burned even worse than the first.</li>
            <li> i have thick fast growing hair</li>
            <li> Now I will just have to wait and see what the regrowth will be like and how often I will have to do it, but all in all it was easy and quick enough to replace shaving and having nasty razor burn when I want to wear a bikini this summer.</li>
            <li> but I felt bad that such a good product is getting such negative feedback.</li>
            <li> Same as every other Nair product. .. stilll make skin bumpy</li>
            <li> I have used other products before, and I always walk away with the same problems.</li>
            <li> Going back to the other nair products once I stop gagging</li>
            <li> My legs have several little red dots on them, along with redness under my arm pits, that all sting like a bee and ich like a rash.</li>
            <li> Will see how long it lasts now!</li>
            <li> I will not need to be buying razors again as long as Nair continues to sell this!</li>
            <li> it has a faint hair removal cream odor (but not like the original Nair products)&lt;br /&gt;Okay</li>
            <li> I had the same burning sensation that now gave me about 4 little cuts and a bigger one on the lower part of my leg.</li>
            <li> I had previously been unable to get the smooth effect without leaving the cream on too long and getting burn with traditional Nair.</li>
            <li> Not only did it burn like crazy, but it worked on one of my underarms ok and not at all on the other!</li>
            <li> It broke out my inner thighs so badly and burned themto the point where sitting with my thighs touching while wearing a dress was excruciating.</li>
            <li> though I was mostly satisfied with how my legs looked and felt afterwards, the reaction under my arms was bad enough that I&#x27;ll throw this in the trash.</li>
            <li> I think my skin was dry to begin with.</li>
            <li> After I wash my legs and put baby oil on them until I finish up the rest of my shower and then just get out and dry my legs</li>
            <li> the baby oil comes off when I dry</li>
            <li> first it felt like nothing but very thick lotion spreading across my legs.</li>
            <li> I applied from ankle to mid-calf, which took a little over a minute to complete on one leg, then I applied to the other leg.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of products such as this, I would raise questions of, \\&quot;how could that remove my hair?\\&quot; or I would brush it off right away, saying \\&quot;this is just another market ploy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but once I started rinsing it very little hair was removed and my legs began to burn and welts had developed all over.</li>
            <li> I can barely lay down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest trying to get both legs, bikini line, and underarms using only one wipe, because you use up about half of the jar and dont have to go back a few days later to do your legs after doing your underarms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks, the redness is finally calming down.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream remover I&#x27;ve ever used that takes less than the recommended max time.</li>
            <li> (he&#x27;s half greek, half italian)...</li>
            <li> The welts are raised, oddly shaped and red...</li>
            <li> Does leave my skin a little red for an hour or two after i use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed irritation (little red bumps or rashes) for about a day afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Cortisone</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that may last a little longer than shaving and</li>
            <li> It actually burned a little area of skin around my bikini area</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to use it on underarms (definitely a learning curve there) but</li>
            <li> 2nd its veryy hard to get it all back off!!</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I got done and felt how smooth my legs were!</li>
            <li> but I am not very hopeful at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not really how I wanted to kick off my summer.</li>
            <li> Not very user-friendly.</li>
            <li> The applicator is very flimsy, the worse problem is that after 3 mins.</li>
            <li> Also there was absolutely no pain or burns whatsoever.</li>
            <li> , I got in the shower ( I didnt get my body wet)</li>
            <li> After 15 sec</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it to ANYONE who has thick hair, or even slightly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was forced to try it because no one, not even drugstores carries the old Lavender formula, and at that point, I still trusted Nair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how this can be touted as \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; when it&#x27;s clearly worse than the regular Nair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product because I was tired of the same old razor stubble.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviews it stung as soon as it went on, I kept it on for only a few minutes (perhaps contributing to the lack of hair removal) but it hurt so bad</li>
            <li> In that short period of time I went from feeling nothing to a slight burning sensation going all down my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product isn&#x27;t bad but just like other cosmetic products</li>
            <li> I am hoping that my underarms are just too sensitive and will probably try it on a very small area on both of my legs</li>
            <li> I have tried using other nair products and they never really worked.</li>
            <li> but I have to admit I am a little afraid to use it on a larger area like my legs or a sensitive spot like underarms, but I will probably try it in a small area first like the bottle recommends.</li>
            <li> I have used other products and never had a issue.</li>
            <li> You can read from the other shower product from NAIR others</li>
            <li> I did notice that the hair was coming off, but I chalked it up to their possibly being no hair in the small spot when I started the</li>
            <li> I tried other products and they just don&#x27;t get the hair off everywhere.  </li>
            <li> only did a small test patch and within seconds</li>
            <li> I bought this product the other day.</li>
            <li> You then use the other side to remove it.  </li>
            <li> have used other Nair before and never had this reaction.</li>
            <li> If your going to try this product test a small area of the skin you actually want hair removed from....</li>
            <li> I think the chemical burns themselves actually caused my eczema to come back worse than it was on my thighs.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I tried it again this time on my entire body: bikini line, legs, stomach, arms and everything came off and this time no tingling or reaction which I believe was because I didn&#x27;t last so long with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;-the smell was a little off putting but expected</li>
            <li> I was nervous since I had previous allergic reaction to other cream hair removers.</li>
            <li> and I am super mad.  </li>
            <li> I took a pretty mean fall on the slippery shower floor, just bruises but unexpected and scary!  </li>
            <li> it is not worth the pain that I went through for this product and not to mention it didn&#x27;t even take the hair off.</li>
            <li> I shaved my legs this a.m as usual, but few hours later I have stubble already!</li>
            <li> all my dark hair comes off in 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had experience with Nair burning my skin a few years back but decided I was too lazy to shave</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually start removing the cream until it had been on for 10 minutes, I wanted to leave it on for the max time since my hair is so thick.</li>
            <li> (I have thick hair too, I&#x27;m half Iranian and have dark, coarse hair).</li>
            <li> Upside is no hair on my legs, down side, I look like a burn</li>
            <li> I have burns all up and down my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, after reading the other reviews on Amazon, I was scared!</li>
            <li> My hair is dark and not fine, but not as thick and coarse as others.</li>
            <li> so I always leave depilatories on for less than the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li> I think this was because my arm hair is softer and less thicker than my legs</li>
            <li> To suddenly have a massive reaction is scary.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Brazilian, and when it comes to hair...</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I took the sponge and pumped the cream onto the sponge ( the pump made it 100 times easier and less messier) to my surprise</li>
            <li> Because the cream is slightly water resistant, it took some effort to get it all off.</li>
            <li> like I did, its only meant for your legs, but according to some other people who got this product they put it on their face and it burned, I&#x27;m not surprised, over all not impressed.</li>
            <li> when my sister in law first told me about Nair shower power upon seeing my &amp;#34;winter coat&amp;#34; that had grown on my legs while I was sporting jeans in the cold weather.</li>
            <li> I make soap and other body products for a living and am exposed to irritating chemicals on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I literally switched my shower water from hot to cold just to ease the pain of it a little.</li>
            <li> It did get all the hair off but not worth the burns!</li>
            <li> and I sometimes bleeds through the little hair follicles when I am waxed or wax myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It tingles a little but, but it didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I did get a little stinging in the underarms when I applied deordorant afterwards</li>
            <li> the people writing reviews saying that it burns bad when using on their upper lips, the bottle clearly says not to use on your face so I am def not trying that.</li>
            <li> I paid so much for it because I am afraid to use it again.</li>
            <li> But, if you don&#x27;t believe me, waste the money on it yourself.</li>
            <li> SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE PLEASEEEEEEEEEE</li>
            <li> so I wound up with a few welts and redness</li>
            <li> before undiscovered form of flagellation lasted for eternity (or a few days, I&#x27;m still undecided) whilst the chemical burn healed.</li>
            <li> Used it on my bikini area (nowhere near the sensitive lady bits) and it got onto my inner thighs because of the horrible application sponge.</li>
            <li> But recently I&#x27;ve been tired of shaving my legs because it makes my hair feel thicker and grows way too rapidly for my liking.</li>
            <li> Personally, I disagree, its WORSE.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s expensive plus the hair needs to be long in order to be waxed; takes me 3-4 weeks to grow it out long</li>
            <li> , I left the product on for the full 10 minutes and the result was shocking.</li>
            <li> I am a black female that is quite hairy, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t pick it up, which would&#x27;ve been a shame, I literally just stepped out of the shower from using this product the first time, and I was shocked at how well it work</li>
            <li> recommend this product for small areas (like maybe a few hairs on your feet, fingers, or knee).</li>
            <li> I also have dark, thick hair.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE DARK THICK HAIR</li>
            <li> It dissolved pieces of my flesh and turned that skin into raw, bleeding scabs.</li>
            <li> my legs were burning so bad I rinsed and scrubbed if off and am left with red blotches</li>
            <li> I even had a little bit of bleeding coupled with a searing, burning sensation!</li>
            <li> Hair not completely removed, uncomfortable tingling, slight rash and the smell......</li>
            <li> About the application sponge-I have very little control over where the cream goes using this thing.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and noted to leave on no more than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> and I am so not ok with that,</li>
            <li> Ive used Nair in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and my arm hair has always driven me crazy.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been in pain and lazy and didn&#x27;t feel like shaving</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write product reviews but wanted to share my thoughts on this Nair product.</li>
            <li> Maybe the person used it wrong or maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for that specific person&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> cream usually takes care of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also says ON THE BOTTLE for all the ladies saying they followed the instructions to test a small area</li>
            <li> I rinsed thoroughly then applied my usual bath oil after showering.  </li>
            <li> but it rinses off, it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I tried a patch test on my arm (small area)</li>
            <li> I tried a small patch on my arm and had no issue</li>
            <li> they will go away in the next couple days or ill</li>
            <li> but it is hard to get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used nair products in the past and never liked the results.</li>
            <li> It tingled uncomfortably as soon as I applied it and continued to do so long after it was washed off.  </li>
            <li> or I will get horrible razor burn, which is extremely inconvenient because I have really thick, coarse, dark hair that grows back the same day that I shave.</li>
            <li> So I was surprised when a single thin layer of this left on for 2 or 3 minutes gave me a painful, ugly rash (see submitted photo).</li>
            <li> My underarms are a little irritated but the overall experience wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and have had bad reactions to deodorant or ocean water, but never have I had an experience</li>
            <li> in conclusion, THIS STUFF SUCKS.</li>
            <li> kinda sucks</li>
            <li> Picked this up at the local grocery store when Veet gel cream wasn&#x27;t cutting it on my legs.</li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby, also doesn&#x27;t have that horrible smell.</li>
            <li> Nair sucks.</li>
            <li> I decided to go back to Nair (I&#x27;m too much of a chicken to wax anywhere besides my face or underarms, tried it, dont like it.)</li>
            <li> The skin is very raw and</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this cream, is the sponge it comes with, it&#x27;s almost worthless once you get it wet, and I&#x27;d rather have the blade-less razor accompany this product.</li>
            <li> (I find spreading it on thickly gives optimal results).</li>
            <li> For one, it smelt like straight up CRAP --</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spray on thick, but almost like hair spray.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair on my underarms and groin</li>
            <li> When that became unavailable I switched to the Lavender formula in the purple bottle specifically for thick hair.</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs is thick and bountiful (about two or three strands for about 60% of the follicles)</li>
            <li> I would recommend ensuring that the cream is applied thick in order to prevent patches.</li>
            <li> so my hair is Definitely thick.</li>
            <li> My hair is not that thick though</li>
            <li> so I could see how it may not get all the hair if it is thick.</li>
            <li> yesterday i was so excited because i HATE shaving!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is soo messy!!</li>
            <li> It had removed my difficult, thick and dark hair well for years.  </li>
            <li> Both my legs are covered in chemical burns which are so painful I can barely bend my knees.</li>
            <li> Still I left it for the three minutes (shouldn&#x27;t have) and unfortunately it turned into an angry rash.</li>
            <li> A little creepy when you see it just &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Here I am two days later, and I still have a bad rash from this product.</li>
            <li> My inner thighs bled and itched so badly</li>
            <li> Not only did it not remove the hair but it burned my legs and underarms quite badly.</li>
            <li> Again, literally only two skincare products have ever given me a bad reaction---Nair cream and Nair wax strips.</li>
            <li> Bad welts and red rashes.</li>
            <li> I had some type of reaction and my legs are covered in red swollen, itchy, and painful bumps.</li>
            <li> but def wasn&#x27;t the worst thing I have ever smelled, and it all rinses right off.</li>
            <li> but mine was a lot worse with serious welts and</li>
            <li> Movement was horrible, my skin oozed and chafed, and the only thing that worked was an extremely liberal application of vitamin A+D cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-the application process was a little awkward for that part of my body</li>
            <li> My legs have gotten worse in the time it took to type this.</li>
            <li> I saw this product and it sounded as though nair had stepped up their game.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a poor reaction to hair removal creams, including nair.</li>
            <li> I tried to wipe the cream off using a q-tip but that just made it even worse.</li>
            <li> And to make it worse</li>
            <li> The pain was not great</li>
            <li> I figured, if my skin did have a reaction it would be less painful on my legs than on my bikini line.</li>
            <li> And my hair is not thick at all its very thin but this stuff burnd me so bad i couldnt even shave afterwards!!</li>
            <li> i had red patchs all over me that burnd like crazy!!</li>
            <li> As soon as the product touched my skin it burnt pretty bad but the worst part was in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t under stand what I&#x27;m doing wrong and how come</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being skeptical and expecting it not to work, I waited paitently.</li>
            <li> WTF?</li>
            <li> and it was difficult for me to get it out.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to risk anything going wrong in that</li>
            <li> It actually doesn&#x27;t smell too horrible.</li>
            <li> No No is expensive and didn&#x27;t work on my hair and skin type.</li>
            <li> Use it in areas that are too difficult to shave.</li>
            <li> I have tried using coochy shaving creme and ridiculously expensive razors</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> It is painful, red, and feels like terrible sunburn on taut skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am afraid it will scar</li>
            <li> I will probably never use hair removal creams again because I am afraid of this happening again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really mad</li>
            <li> I waited, and as I began to scrape the itchy, aggravating, and sticky spa clay, it began burning badly.</li>
            <li> and it hurts really bad if the slightest thing brushes my underarms.</li>
            <li> never have I had a bad reaction to a hair removal product.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling bad once I wipe it all off.  </li>

            <li> I have allergies and sensitive skin. I also have dark, thick hair. I waited, and as I began to scrape the itchy, aggravating, and sticky spa clay, it began burning badly. My skin was SO inflamed! AND NONE OF THE HAIR WAS EVEN GONE! I prefer shaving to this any day. Here I am two days later, and I still have a bad rash from this product. I would not recommend it to ANYONE who has thick hair, or even slightly sensitive skin. I will never buy this again. But, if you don&#x27;t believe me, waste the money on it yourself.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and the only thing it does is make your legs really gross and slimy, now this not meant to go on your face as it says if you read and follow the directions on the back like I did, its only meant for your legs, but according to some other people who got this product they put it on their face and it burned, I&#x27;m not surprised, over all not impressed.</li>
            <li> I tried this because a friend of mine had great results.  IF YOU HAVE DARK THICK HAIR THIS IS NOT FOR YOU...did it take off hair? Yes but not all of it. the \\&quot;smoothness\\&quot; i got was comparable to a day or so without shaving. Still very prickly I followed the directions exactly..i have thick fast growing hair almost every pore has two hairs in it..only thing that works for me is shaving, even though the next day im prickly again..oh well.returning this tomorow.</li>
            <li> I normally use a Veet product but was in a pinch and saw this at Walgreen&#x27;s so I bought it.  I must admit I was swayed by the clay ingredient. I read the instructions and noted to leave on no more than 10 minutes.  I planned to leave it on for 2 minutes.  First off, it smells ok  for a depilatory. It is also nice and thick.  That&#x27;s where my pleasure ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within about 45 seconds, my legs started to burn and my arm pits (only 30 seconds for them) were literally on fire!  After showering, my legs feel fine but my underarms are very burned and I am so not ok with that, given I followed the directions.  Applying deodorant is not an option right now and I feel like I need to hold my arms out so the skin at underarms don&#x27;t touch.  The skin is very raw and burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to Veet permanently.</li>
            <li> Only reason this got 1 star at all is cause i had to rate it.... This stuff is AWFUL!! I have used other products and never had a issue. I used this today and made the huge mistake of doing every where that needed shaving at the time after testing a small area. I have chemical burns on my legs, underarms, and bikini area. Some areas actually bled and are super raw now.I left it on for 5 minutes. It didn&#x27;t feel like it was burning till i went to use the sponge to get it off by the time i had it all off i was in tears. On top of that it is messy to use and you end up using half the bottle on one application, it did stay on in the shower but does not come off quickly or easily when you are in a hurry to get it off of you. It did get all the hair off but not worth the burns! I DO NOT recommend this stuff at all. My bottle went in the trash</li>
            <li> Ive used Nair in the past.  I tried this new version and it started tingling after about 2 minutes.  When I washed it off my thighs started burning, and around my armpits!  What is in this stuff?  I am usually using natural products, and even make my own body butter, so I am not sure if I made my skin sensitive to chemicals or what.  I think I will be returning it to the store I got it from. A Shame.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical but then i said what the heck. I could not have been more surprised. It worked. It did not burn me or cause any skin problems, however, everyone does not have the same skin sensitvity. I recommend placing a small amount on the back of your hand before placing large amounts over your body.[[ASIN:B006PEL7A2 Nair Hair Remover, Body Cream, Brazilian Spa Clay 13 oz (368 g)]]</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and my arm hair has always driven me crazy. I finally decided I&#x27;d had enough and was gonna get rid of it! Like I said, really sensitive skin.... But I tried it anyway! Like other women mentioned, I felt a kind of stinging sensation in the first minute of application but ignored it. 6 minutes in the shower and the hair completely wiped off! No burns, no marks, no damage. Just hairless arms! Make sure you not only rinse it off but then scrub down after you remove it with the sponge or it will stay on your skin and keep working... Which of course will burn! I am hooked!</li>
            <li> This cream is awsome, my girlfriend uses it and she told me that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Veet before and the product was amazing and I never got burned by the chemicals. But with Nair the first time I used it I got a burn and I made sure to not rub in! I thought maybe I messed up so I used it again and this time the same thing happened! And not all of the hair was removed, especially my armpits! I don&#x27;t under stand what I&#x27;m doing wrong and how come others are have such positive results and I&#x27;m not. Doing this takes more time then shaving and is ten times more pain ful when you burn yourself. I&#x27;m either going to throw this away or find out from a pro on how to use this otherwise I never trusting Nair again. The only upside is you can shower with it</li>
            <li> I recently got my wisdom teeth out so I&#x27;ve been in pain and lazy and didn&#x27;t feel like shaving so I had been seeing this advertise and decided to try it out. OMG worst mistake of my life. As soon as the product touched my skin it burnt pretty bad but the worst part was in the shower. Wiping it off it was burning and I didn&#x27;t make it out of the shower with out my legs burning and itching like crazy!!! My legs have burn marks ALL OVER THEM! I can barely lay down! I will never recommend this product to ANYONE! You can read from the other shower product from NAIR others have had my same reaction. And i followed the directions exactly. My legs have gotten worse in the time it took to type this. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE PLEASEEEEEEEEEE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several hair removal creams before; mostly Veet and Nair products, and I&#x27;m typically happy with the results, but getting there is usually uncomfortable and takes forever (over the 10 minute max application times). This is the only cream remover I&#x27;ve ever used that takes less than the recommended max time. Yes, it&#x27;s still irritates your skin a little, and smells slightly less than pleasant, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used. The only complaint I have about this cream, is the sponge it comes with, it&#x27;s almost worthless once you get it wet, and I&#x27;d rather have the blade-less razor accompany this product.</li>
            <li> I just bought this today, I used it and was amazed at how easy and fast it was. My legs are super soft. ALTHOUGH once I got out of the shower I noticed my legs seemed itchy/burning.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to put some uncented lotion on my legs and so far 10 minutes after, the itching and burning went away. I think my skin was dry to begin with.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product first on my underarms because it said to try it on a small area first. Not only did it burn like crazy, but it worked on one of my underarms ok and not at all on the other! I coated both underarms with the same amount of product and the hair was the same length! I have several red burn marks on both underarms and it hurts really bad if the slightest thing brushes my underarms. I am hoping that my underarms are just too sensitive and will probably try it on a very small area on both of my legs but I am not very hopeful at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say if you have sensitive skin I don&#x27;t recommend even trying this product.</li>
            <li> it is stronger than other cream I have used, can remove my hair in like 3 min (other products take 10 min or more), but It waas washed off under shower...So it works well and it is strong but it doesn&#x27;t work well under shower. and it doesn&#x27;t have bad smell like many other creams :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write product reviews but wanted to share my thoughts on this Nair product. I picked it up at Target and decided to give it a try since I cannot stand shaving the lower halves of my legs; and while getting a leg wax works, it&#x27;s a hassle (it&#x27;s expensive plus the hair needs to be long in order to be waxed; takes me 3-4 weeks to grow it out long enough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Nair many many years ago and aside from the smell, I never had any complaints. The first time I used this, I didn&#x27;t read the instructions properly (totally my fault) so I wound up with a few welts and redness (I used it twice in a row on the same spot instead of waiting as well as leaving it on too long). Now my second try, I&#x27;m using it in phases (since putting it on my legs takes forever and I lose track of time if I try to do both legs at once) -- one lower leg at a time. I found the sponge to be a nice add-on but not really practical since it takes forever for me to use it to put on my legs. The sponge is probably good if you are using it for a small area like your underarms or &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34; I use my hand (wash your hands after if you go this route!) to put it on my leg and then a washcloth when it comes time to remove the cream and hair. I would try leaving this on for 7-8 minutes and testing a small section of your skin to see if the hair comes off easily. I have light/thin hair and 7-8 minutes works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and DO NOT RUB IT IN!!! Just spread it on (I find spreading it on thickly gives optimal results). It maybe missed a few hairs for me but those can easily be plucked with tweezers and you could even use your razor to quickly remove those leftover hairs. And the smell? Well, it has that same smell I remember from all those years ago but it seems a lot weaker now (it used to make the bathroom reek for days after but now the smell disappears fairly quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy and will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Used it on my WHOLE body and all the hair just washed out in the shower! A little creepy when you see it just &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; away lol! I did notice it lasts longer than shaving. But now I&#x27;m smooth and hairless haha</li>
            <li> Same as every other Nair product. .. stilll make skin bumpy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to give this product any stars. For one, it smelt like straight up CRAP -- Like my three year old nephew&#x27;s diaper. Secondly, I tried it on my underarms cause that was the only place that needed shaving at the time and it says I can put it there. My skin is SOOOO burnt it hurts just sitting here typing this. I returned it immediately after I got out the shower and dressed. It even made me bleed in some spots. I tried nair probably about 7 years ago now when it first came out and I thought it had gotten better, NO! I was going to try Veet Sensitive Skin but mistakenly bought this so I just said whatev. I should have returned it and tried the Veet instead. Now, I&#x27;m just going to stick to shaving for the rest of my life it is not worth the pain that I went through for this product and not to mention it didn&#x27;t even take the hair off.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for my arms, legs and armpits. Does leave my skin a little red for an hour or two after i use it but I have very sensitive skin so that didn&#x27;t surprise me. The only reason it got four stars instead of five is because it doesn&#x27;t work well for my bikini line. It removed the hair somewhat but left it looking like a rough shave... which is exactly what I didn&#x27;t want. But for everything else I love it. Just be smart and FOLLOW the directions, make sure to do a test area and wait the 24 hours before doing more. Over all i like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used nair products in the past and never liked the results. I began using veet with positive results, but the store I generally go to was out today. I saw this product and it sounded as though nair had stepped up their game. Well, no. I&#x27;ve never had a poor reaction to hair removal creams, including nair. I always read instructions thoroughly, and applied it before I got in the shower. I had it on for about 7 minutes and it started to tingle on my bikini line. I went to wipe it off and now I have chemical burns on my bikini line - both sides! It is painful, red, and feels like terrible sunburn on taut skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I even knew how to treat the burn is because my boyfriend is a chemist and read the ingredients. On top of the burn, not all of the hair was even removed! I have already thrown out my bottle, and I will never recommend this product to anyone. Awful, awful experience.</li>
            <li> I am a black female that is quite hairy, unfortunately. I have tried every hair removal method out there including laser hair removal, which by the way has not worked. I returned back to the messy and smelly world of hair removal creams, but was pleasantly surprised when tonight I tried the Nair Hair Remover Brazilian Spa Clay. I was nervous since I had previous allergic reaction to other cream hair removers. This product is no way as smelly and the application is not messy! Please give it a try and \\&quot;read\\&quot; the instructions before using. Since I just used it, I don&#x27;t know how long it will last. Oh, if you have any cuts on your legs, even the tiniest, please avoid that area.</li>
            <li> I have used other products before, and I always walk away with the same problems. Hair not completely removed, uncomfortable tingling, slight rash and the smell......putrid. I was extremely skeptical when my sister in law first told me about Nair shower power upon seeing my &amp;#34;winter coat&amp;#34; that had grown on my legs while I was sporting jeans in the cold weather. My hair is dark and not fine, but not as thick and coarse as others. She said it worked well with her sensitive skin, so I decided to give it a try.When I went to the store, I found the spa clay instead. It works in the same manner so I decided it was a good alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided not to do my whole leg since it states several times to absolutely not exceed 10 minutes. I have a feeling some people apply the product, then start their 10 minute countdown. I start my 10 minute countdown from the second I apply the first smear of product to my leg. I applied from ankle to mid-calf, which took a little over a minute to complete on one leg, then I applied to the other leg. I was pleasently surprised that there was no disgusting stench, just a light fragrant scent that I found quite pleasent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being skeptical and expecting it not to work, I waited paitently. At 5 minutes, I turned on the shower and let water warm up, then I got in and just let my hair get wet. At 7 minutes, I spot tested an area on my ankle. I did notice that the hair was coming off, but I chalked it up to their possibly being no hair in the small spot when I started the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 9 minutes, I put my first leg under the stream of water and udes the sponge as directed to gentl rub off the product. I am sure my facial expression was priceless when a smooth, beautifully hairless leg was what emerged from under the cream. By the time I had finished rinsing the cream thoroughly off one leg, I had hit the 10 minute mark. This was perfect since my first leg had a one minute headstart on my second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting the cream off both legs, I then took my shower normally, with the exception of not using my loofa when applying soap to my legs. After the shower, I applied some body butter to my legs, and was astonished. The bottom half of my legs were smooth and clean while the top half was still Yeti like in appearance. I sent a picture to my sister-in-law and told her she was my favorite person in the world. I am never going back to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize not everyone is the same, but for me, it worked better than I ever expected. So start the 10 minute countdown when you first start applying the product to make sure you are not leaving it on more than 10 minutes. (I used a stop watch since I had one on hand. lol.)</li>
            <li> Oh my this stuff works but it is hard to get past the smell. It smells like a locker room. Going back to the other nair products once I stop gagging</li>
            <li> My legs have never been smoother. I follow the directions and the hair comes off perfectly. If I don&#x27;t leave it on long enough then I have to touch up with a razer. S  I leave it on for the full 10 minutes sometimes 15 minutes on accident and I won&#x27;t go into the shower until that time is up. After I get in the shower I try not to let the water hit my legs directly then I turn the water to come out the faucet instead of the shower head then I remove the hair and rinse the sponge in the running water. After I wash my legs and put baby oil on them until I finish up the rest of my shower and then just get out and dry my legs the baby oil comes off when I dry and then your legs are even smoother and I have sensitive skin so it helps to sooth them. I always have to apply lotion too and I use lotion with aloe  in it. Or unscented. I use this almost every time instead of saveing my bf loves this stuff because mylegs are always so  smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fairly easy to use although you do have to remember to put it on BEFORE stepping into the shower (yes I do forget). It does not smell chemical. And since I don&#x27;t actually put it anywhere particularly sensitive (like it flat out warns against on the package!!) this is not an issue. It washed off me really quickly and is much more effective than trying to shave everything. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worked great for me.  Yes, there was a bit of tingling, but no rash or burn afterwards.  Left on for 7 minutes and completely wiped the bikini line clean.  Not a single hair still attached.  Smooth both directions...with and against the grain.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and have had bad reactions to deodorant or ocean water, but never have I had an experience this horrific, and never have I had a bad reaction to a hair removal product. I used it on my legs and under arms and after only leaving the cream on for a couple minutes, my skin was burning. My legs have several little red dots on them, along with redness under my arm pits, that all sting like a bee and ich like a rash. The day after I used the cream, the burns on my legs were an open layer of skin that had peeled off, two days after I used the cream it seems as if my legs are heeling with those open wounds now scabing. My arm pits are still red and it hurts to touch, imagine how applying deodorant feels, I would never recommend this product to ANYONE who still wants nice, non-burnt skin. And on top of all that, it didn&#x27;t even remove my hair, so now I have to shave on top of my chemical burns if I feel like leaving the house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, after reading the other reviews on Amazon, I was scared! Chemical burns on my lady parts?! NO thank you. I had already purchased the product by the time I got around to seeing the reviews, so I decided to take caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions on the bottle and left it on for 1 minute outside the shower and then for about 2 minutes inside the shower before thoroughly wiping it all off. The results on my legs were fantastic. Worked exactly as promised. Bikini line probably needed another minute, since the hair is a bit coarser, but it did remove most of the hair. I would absolutely use this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of products such as this, I would raise questions of, \\&quot;how could that remove my hair?\\&quot; or I would brush it off right away, saying \\&quot;this is just another market ploy\\&quot;. But I saw this in the store and looked up the other reviews on this site as I was still looking at it, and noticed that there were some good, and some bad responses of this product. I almost didn&#x27;t pick it up, which would&#x27;ve been a shame, I literally just stepped out of the shower from using this product the first time, and I was shocked at how well it work (seeing as how I rarely shave my legs were quite hairy) I only used a small portion of skin as the bottle says to only use for the first time you use it to make sure there are no adverse effects, but I can&#x27;t believe how well this product works I&#x27;ll be saying goodbye to my 40+ minutes of trying to get rid of the hair on my body and say hello to the only 10 minutes of time this product needs to work. The only time you&#x27;d need a razor is if you take the product off too soon before it can work, which I did this time but that&#x27;s to be expected of a first time user. Short answer: this product is amazing and saves me so much time, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I have never used a hair removal cream on my legs before, but I decided to give this a try since I am pretty lazy when it comes to shaving, and this product promises to keep the hair away for a long time. IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN WHATSOEVER, I BEG OF YOU, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very fair skinned and have had eczema on the bends of my arms since I was in diapers, but the skin on my legs has never been noticeably sensitive to shaving creams or anything like that, so I had no real reason to worry about this product having any effect on me. I even tested it on a small area of my leg and everything was fine! But before getting into the shower one night I figured I&#x27;d try out my whole legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it felt like nothing but very thick lotion spreading across my legs. The scent is okay, not the best smell in the world but it doesn&#x27;t stink or anything. So I did as the instructions said and waited one minute before entering the shower. In that short period of time I went from feeling nothing to a slight burning sensation going all down my legs. I thought it was normal and proceeded to get into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 3 minutes before I was supposed to sponge this stuff off my legs were on fire! So I used the sponge that was included to begin to wipe the cream off, and well, all of the hair really did come off, but my shins were so pink and irritated! I even had a little bit of bleeding coupled with a searing, burning sensation! It was horrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I am, about 3 weeks after that incident and I STILL have marks on my shins from this garbage! It looked like really bad scars throughout the first week, and I can&#x27;t say that it looks any better now.&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, THIS STUFF SUCKS.</li>
            <li> This really works for me. I use it on my bikini area and it doesn&#x27;t burn. The regular Nair does burn the skin in that area. I am really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Correction:  does well.  My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to much of anything, but it is getting thinner with age...you know &amp;#34;old lady skin.&amp;#34;  This old lady is tired of trying to shave in the shower, without her glasses on, leaving more patches of hair than she&#x27;s removing.  On a whim, I bought Nair Spa Clay, threw caution to the wind and smeared it on both legs without doing a patch test.  Life on the edge.  In 3 or 4 minutes, I could see leg hair collapsing in defeat, so I jumped (okay - climbed) into the shower and loofahed both legs.  Perfect.  No stragglers, no missed stripes of hair...just smooth skin.  Now I can get that pedicure this week without imagining that the nail ladies at the salon are chatting in Vietnamese about my hairy legs.  Spider veins, yes.  Hair, no.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sissy cross-dresser and I think this product is just great.  It gets me nice and smooth in every spot.  I always want to make sure I&#x27;m nice and smooth for the gentlemen I serve, so I use this exclusively.  I tried other products and they just don&#x27;t get the hair off everywhere.  This one does. Again care should be made when using this around one&#x27;s nether regions, as it can burn, but it will remove the hair there lol.  It fragrance kinda sucks I think, it is supposed to smell good but just doesn&#x27;t to me.  But it doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling bad once I wipe it all off.  I use it the day before I meet my gentlemen dates because it may leave a couple red splotches.  But they fade fast enough.</li>
            <li> Picked this up at the local grocery store when Veet gel cream wasn&#x27;t cutting it on my legs. I have sensitive skin so I always leave depilatories on for less than the recommended amount of time. After three minutes my legs were burning and BLEEDING, so I removed the cream quickly. Both my legs are covered in chemical burns which are so painful I can barely bend my knees. My photos are the next-day result. Don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> The best nair i have never used! i will buy again</li>
            <li> Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this once and it worked well. Second time? Disaster. I had some type of reaction and my legs are covered in red swollen, itchy, and painful bumps. Upside is no hair on my legs, down side, I look like a burn victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(and yes, I followed the directions exactly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m off to a pool party where I have to answer &amp;#34;what happened to you&amp;#34; a thousand times. Thanks for the public pity, Nair. Not really how I wanted to kick off my summer.</li>
            <li> I have never had a bad reaction to a hair removal cream until this one. I am fair skinned and have fairly fine hair so I tend to use this type of product only so I don&#x27;t have to shave while on vacation. Nair Spa Clay was definitely not made for me! Coarse hair areas such as bikini were fine but as soon as I put it on my upper leg it burned. Still I left it for the three minutes (shouldn&#x27;t have) and unfortunately it turned into an angry rash. Hair is gone, skin doesn&#x27;t look so nice.</li>
            <li> I am a very hairy African American woman, my hair is also thick and I haven&#x27;t had success with creams until NOW.. I had previously been unable to get the smooth effect without leaving the cream on too long and getting burn with traditional Nair. THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!! Smooth as a baby, also doesn&#x27;t have that horrible smell. Best product out there.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying anything like this , and I followed all directions exactly. Its terrible and it stinks and it burns like heck. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t do my whole leg ! I&#x27;ll stick to shaving thanks. 😉</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even give it one star but I can&#x27;t submit a review without one. I wish I knew if it actually worked. I followed the instructions. Even shook it for a ridiculous amount of time to make sure it was okay. It slides off of my body after a minute or two. It doesn&#x27;t spray on thick, but almost like hair spray.</li>
            <li> I love it. It works. When using make sure no water mixes in because it makes it less effective and make sure to use a good amount to cover the area. It&#x27;s not lotion so the area needs to be completely covered. Unless you get patches with hair and no hair. The bottle has strict instructions....It was an excellent buy from a excellent seller.Thank you so much!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This hair removal cream is great at removing hair; on your legs and arm pits as long as you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. It really does stay does stay on while you shower and even smells nice.....but for the love of all that&#x27;s holy do not, I repeat, DO NOT get this on your face or bikini area. Unless you enjoy the sensation of the fires of hell burning near your minge, don&#x27;t do your bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only did a small test patch and within seconds I was convinced that Satan himself had stuck me with his pitchfork; right in the twitchet. Rinsing and washing it off did NOTHING to alleviate my suffering. Neither did the many ointments, lotions, potions, prayers, begging, pleading, or crying I tried; and I prayed to every god or goddess that came to my pain fogged mind. The only thing that worked was having my grundle covered by only an ice pack sans frillies or pants and walking like a bow legged sailor. By Hawkin&#x27;s Chair I could kiss the inventor of the skirt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This before undiscovered form of flagellation lasted for eternity (or a few days, I&#x27;m still undecided) whilst the chemical burn healed. It is a lesson I will not soon forget and wish to prevent others from learning first hand. If you do insist on experiencing first hand Pele burning through your inguen, I recommend these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Cryopak-Flexible-Ice-Mats-Set/dp/B0058BQW9E/ref&#x3D;sr_1_117?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1440223050&amp;sr&#x3D;1-117&amp;keywords&#x3D;ice+pack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they form to your mossy cleft and refreeze relatively fast.</li>
            <li> I would give no stars but Amazon will not let me do so. I stopped using Nair products after my experience with this one product. I used to use the shower power version that came in the blue bottle (for Sensitive Skin) then all the stores in my area within a 30 mile radius stopped carrying it. Okay, that sucked, because that one I used for my pubic area and it was perfect. I have extremely thick hair on my underarms and groin and I want it gone because it traps odor (and IMHO, it just looks disgusting). The Sensitive Skin one never burned or irritated me.  When that became unavailable I switched to the Lavender formula in the purple bottle specifically for thick hair. That one worked well too. I cannot remember ever getting any burns or blisters on my skin from that one, and I used it for years.Then all of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t find the Lavender formula anywhere. WTF? Walmart used to be the last store that carried it, and when I would go in to buy a bottle (rare since the only Walmart near me is 15 minutes out of my way) they would always be sold out. The last time I checked they weren&#x27;t even carrying it at all, only this new Brazilian Clay formula in the orange bottle and another Argan Oil formula in the teal bottle.  I was forced to try it because no one, not even drugstores carries the old Lavender formula, and at that point, I still trusted Nair. It had removed my difficult, thick and dark hair well for years.  I hate this formula. Used it on my bikini area (nowhere near the sensitive lady bits) and it got onto my inner thighs because of the horrible application sponge. About the application sponge-I have very little control over where the cream goes using this thing. In order to spread it, you either have to rub the cream off directly onto the skin or fold the sponge in half and scrape the cream onto your skin that way. Not very user-friendly. A scoop or blade style would work much better for this thick cream. It broke out my inner thighs so badly and burned themto the point where sitting with my thighs touching while wearing a dress was excruciating. My inner thighs bled and itched so badly I thought I was having a severe eczema reaction. I think the chemical burns themselves actually caused my eczema to come back worse than it was on my thighs.  It got on my lady bits another time and I swear I wanted to die. Literally, I had bleeding holes on my most sensitive areas because that&#x27;s what happens when you don&#x27;t have a lot of control with the damn sponge. I tried to wipe the cream off using a q-tip but that just made it even worse. It tingled and burned so badly that by the time I was in the shower to rinse I was in tears. Soap stung. Water stung. Urine stung. It dissolved pieces of my flesh and turned that skin into raw, bleeding scabs. For two weeks I could barely wear underwear or jeans. Movement was horrible, my skin oozed and chafed, and the only thing that worked was an extremely liberal application of vitamin A+D cream. I still have the scars from that experience. The skin is a different color where the scars are. It&#x27;s terrible. To top it off, it also caused ingrown hairs that scabbed over when the hair does start to grow back. This is not for sensitive skin (or anyone&#x27;s skin) at all. It&#x27;s awful. I will never use Nair Shower Power again.  I am switching to Veet now and hope that it doesn&#x27;t cause me the agony that the Nair did. I go to Target, Walgreens, or CVS now and this is always sitting on the shelf, stocked to the very front with no bottles missing. No one buys it. I can see and understand why! Shame on Nair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used hair removal cream before and I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use it again. Nair sucks. It burned my bikini line and didn&#x27;t even effect my hair. It did absolutely nothing for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Nair Brazilian spa cream for anyone!!!!!</li>
            <li> I never thought this product would do such wonders! I don&#x27;t regret buying it one bit, so my better than shaving! Leaves your skin nice and smooth with no stubs, I definitely recommend it. I didn&#x27;t get any irritation from it and I have sensitive skin, I left the product on for the full 10 minutes and the result was shocking.</li>
            <li> I swear I didn&#x27;t think this product would work, but I was amazed at how soft it made my legs... I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving.</li>
            <li> Main complaint for me is that there is still a bit left at the bottom that the pump couldn&#x27;t get out. It&#x27;s about enough for ~ 2 more uses and it was difficult for me to get it out. I enjoy using this product because of how easy it is to apply and it smells better than the original nair and the one with aloe.</li>
            <li> I have not used Nair in some time and decided to give it a try again. The applicator is very flimsy, the worse problem is that after 3 mins. my legs were burning so bad I rinsed and scrubbed if off and am left with red blotches/burns all over my legs and still hair left. Also the scent is not altogether pleasant.  Do not buy!</li>
            <li> As close to a home Brazilian as you can get at home :-)</li>
            <li> so I recently moved and hadn&#x27;t found a salon that I could go to to get my lady bits groomed and since I didn&#x27;t want to go back to shaving I thought this might be a good alternative (and it was on sale for $5). There were a few things about this product that left me less than impressed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-the application process was a little awkward for that part of my body I didn&#x27;t feel like I had the control I wanted&lt;br /&gt;-the smell was a little off putting but expected&lt;br /&gt;- Lastly and most importantly it left stubble behind after I removed it as if I had shaved the day or so before. (I left it on for a total of 6mins, 1outside the shower and 5 inside) I could have left it on longer but I didn&#x27;t want to risk anything going wrong in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall I&#x27;m sure this product isn&#x27;t bad but just like other cosmetic products this particular formula isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rare that I log on to write a review but I felt bad that such a good product is getting such negative feedback. Maybe the person used it wrong or maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for that specific person&#x27;s skin (maybe it&#x27;s too sensitive or is allergic to some of the ingredients). Just like laser isn&#x27;t for everyone or works better on light skin/dark hair complexions, Nair will not be for everyone. Personally, I love the product. The hair on my legs is thick and bountiful (about two or three strands for about 60% of the follicles) so waxing hurts more than normal and I sometimes bleeds through the little hair follicles when I am waxed or wax myself. I have used Nair before, but it was their regular one for coarse hair and, even though it removed the hair and I lasted quite a bit hair-free, it stung way too much. But recently I&#x27;ve been tired of shaving my legs because it makes my hair feel thicker and grows way too rapidly for my liking. I decided to go back to Nair (I&#x27;m too much of a chicken to wax anywhere besides my face or underarms, tried it, dont like it.) and when I read about the mango and acai and saw that it was a bit different I decided to go ahead and try it. I am pleased to say that I loved it. With the first one (the regular one) my legs stung too much and most, but not all, hair was removed. But with this one I only felt a slight tingle on my arms and had a very mild reaction on my right upper forearm. I think this was because my arm hair is softer and less thicker than my legs and I left it on for a bit longer than necessary. The mild reaction went away as soon as I showered and all my hair was gone, not a inch left. Needless to say, I tried it again this time on my entire body: bikini line, legs, stomach, arms and everything came off and this time no tingling or reaction which I believe was because I didn&#x27;t last so long with it on(as soon as I finished putting it on I got into the shower and started washing it off from the area I first applied it to). Recommended it to my co-worker and she loves it as well and I will</li>
            <li> The reviews on this are on point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I had no chemical reaction to the clay, but as it starts to tingle at about 2-3 minutes, I immediately scrub it off. DO NOT USE IT IF YOU HAVE A CUT ANYWHERE. I had a cut that I was unaware of, and OH EM GEE it burned.&lt;br /&gt;2. It takes care of my leg hair pretty well. I am pretty hairy for a female, and my hair is dark blonde, and medium coarseness.&lt;br /&gt;3. HOWEVER... My wonderful boyfriend has hair on his back/shoulders that is VERY thick and black (he&#x27;s half greek, half italian)... When I used it on him, I left it on for three minutes and it worked ok enough, but he was still stubbly, and you could still see the black follicles. If you have super dark, coarse hair, and sensitive skin... This is not for you.</li>
            <li> I have always had good luck with nair products and don&#x27;t tend to have sensitive skin but this new nair Brazilian clay changed that. Not only did it not remove the hair but it burned my legs and underarms quite badly. Like many of the other reviews it stung as soon as it went on, I kept it on for only a few minutes (perhaps contributing to the lack of hair removal) but it hurt so bad I had to wash it off. I have large red splotches and small chemical burns all over. Don&#x27;t use this product! I like Nair and their customer service rep was very nice in solving this matter but try another part of their line rather than this.</li>
            <li> WOW.firstly I never write reviews, but after this I had to. I shaved my legs this a.m as usual, but few hours later I have stubble already! So I thought I would give this product a try. I couldnt believe it actually worked! Left it on for 10minutes and rubbed it off with the sponge, rinsed, and put on lontion and couldnt believe how smooth my legs were. Will see how long it lasts now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard that Nair had re-done all of its products and that they were a lot better than they used to be. Personally, I disagree, its WORSE. This product literally burned HOLES in my skin after only 3 minutes. Now Im going to have scarring. Thanks a lot, Nair, once again you manage to market satan in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! My skin is so sensitive that I can&#x27;t shave more than once or twice a week or I will get horrible razor burn, which is extremely inconvenient because I have really thick, coarse, dark hair that grows back the same day that I shave. I have tried hair removal creams before and they irritated my skin and didn&#x27;t remove all the hair, and I also recently tried the Nair Wax and it was so time consuming, it hurt, and also didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair. I bought this thinking I would just give it a try, but I didn&#x27;t have high expectations after reading all of the reviews. So I bought it, went home, read the directions, put it on and waited about 5 minutes, then got in the shower. I didn&#x27;t actually start removing the cream until it had been on for 10 minutes, I wanted to leave it on for the max time since my hair is so thick. I was shocked when I got done and felt how smooth my legs were! I didn&#x27;t feel any of the burning sensations that others have experienced with this product and it removed ALL of the hair on my legs and bikini line. My skin felt amazing! The second day when my legs were still (somehow) smooth, I wanted to see how the regrowth would be, so I waited a week and the hair on my legs looks like it normally does on day 3-4 after shaving. I think I finally found a replacement to shaving!</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to reek! It actually doesn&#x27;t smell too horrible. I used it on my legs to try it out, and in the spots that i left pretty thick with the lotion, the hair all came off. Whereever I used only a tiny amount, the hair was left. Now I know to make sure it is thick all over and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> OK, so I have used Clay Nair 4 times total.  Each time weeks apart, followed the directions etc.  No issues.  However, on the 4th time, the same product, same bottle, etc, my legs got severely burned.  It starting burning the minute I smeared it on my legs! I hoped in the shower, started trying to wipe it off with the Nair sponge, which of course was very painful, all to no avail.  I have burns all over my legs.  I am afraid it will scar and I am super mad.  Why on earth this happened all the sudden I do not know but this product should be banned.  To suddenly have a massive reaction is scary.  Try Veet instead.  It has never burned me, bought Nair on sale.  MISTAKE.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I reluctantly tried this product for the first time tonight. I actually used it for my legs, bikini line, and underarms. I was pleasantly surprised with the great results. I would recommend ensuring that the cream is applied thick in order to prevent patches. Make sure you listen to your body, 5 minutes was too long to leave this cream on my skin. I waited approx. 3 minutes to remove the hair, if I had waited longer I would burned badly. My underarms are a little irritated but the overall experience wasn&#x27;t bad. It beats shaving any day! Know your body and follow the instructions... I would recommend this to a friend, it was recommended to me.</li>
            <li> My skin is normally very tolerant. I make soap and other body products for a living and am exposed to irritating chemicals on a daily basis. So I was surprised when a single thin layer of this left on for 2 or 3 minutes gave me a painful, ugly rash (see submitted photo). It tingled uncomfortably as soon as I applied it and continued to do so long after it was washed off.  Again, literally only two skincare products have ever given me a bad reaction---Nair cream and Nair wax strips. Guess I should have learned my lesson the first time, right?  Oh... and did I mention that it didn&#x27;t even remove the hair?  Update: It&#x27;s been three days and the rash is still there. A fun reminder of my foray into the hazardous world of Nair products.</li>
            <li> It works right away,&lt;br /&gt;but I&#x27;ve noticed irritation (little red bumps or rashes) for about a day afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Cortisone cream usually takes care of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product is far gentler than the regular and old school versions of Nair.</li>
            <li> I wish I could do under 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;I did the spot test and it was perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;I followed all of the directions, then it started to burn. I have burns all up and down my legs. My legs are burning and they itch. I suggest taking an Aveeno oatmeal bath for the burning.</li>
            <li> Do not buy!! I was looking for something that may last a little longer than shaving and yes, in that sense...it did what it was supposed to do. My legs were smooth and hairless but during the process it felt like my legs, underarms, and bikini area were on fire! I did exactly as the bottle instructed and still ended up with chemical burns on my bikini area, legs, and underarms. I literally switched my shower water from hot to cold just to ease the pain of it a little. I had a burning sensation on the areas I had applied it for a whole day. I could barely apply deodorant to my armpits this product left my skin so irritated and burnt. My skin doesn&#x27;t get easily irritated by the way. I literally chunked this in the trash right after my first use. Don&#x27;t even bother wasting your money unless you like your body to feel like it&#x27;s on fire and end up with chemical burns all over.</li>
            <li> Add me to the chemically burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to give a product a 1.  Especially when I know for a fact that it&#x27;s a matter of your skin type, but this is not a product I could use.  On the plus side, the hair came off!  I&#x27;m pretty sure the top layer of my skin as well....</li>
            <li> I love this product!! Awesome! Removes all my hair in all my unwanted places....but be forewarned...it SAYS ON THE BOTTLE that you may use the product with no problems and have a reaction at any give time, including burning. It also says ON THE BOTTLE for all the ladies saying they followed the instructions to test a small area EACH TIME you use the product since your reaction may be different. That being said...this product is AMAZING. No smell. Not messy. Easy to put on, easy to wipe off...all my dark hair comes off in 5-6 minutes. I have used this product many times and have never had a problem. BUT the bottle itself does warn that you can easily burn your skin if you aren&#x27;t careful. Its not for everyone, but it is AMAZING for me. I used to get waxed and get brazilians and now I don&#x27;t need to! Great value!! I am a very happy customer. :-)</li>
            <li> I am a female Hispanic with thick black hair and very light color skin. I&#x27;ve used waxing strips,purchased the no no, and used several shaving products just to get smooth legs. Waxing works great but hurts a lot. The No No is expensive and didn&#x27;t work on my hair and skin type. Shaving works but I hate shaving every day.Several months ago I decided to purchase Nair and have been using it since. It leaves my legs smooth for 2 almost 3 days.</li>
            <li> It did remove most of the hair, but it still left quite a bit.  It itched a lot and gave me some chemical burns and it wasn&#x27;t even on that long.  I&#x27;m really mad I paid so much for it because I am afraid to use it again.</li>
            <li> Okay heres my experience!!! I finally got this stuff yesterday i was so excited because i HATE shaving!!! So i done exactly as the directions say i did not rub it in an i put an even amount over the whole area! It says u can leave it on up to 10mins but no longer!! So i did 1st this stuff is soo messy!! 2nd its veryy hard to get it all back off!! 3rd it burned my skin so bad an i dont have sensitive skin ive used nair products before with no problem!! But this stuff burnd so bad i had red patchs all over me that burnd like crazy!! And to make it worse it didnt even remove any hair!!!!! And my hair is not thick at all its very thin but this stuff burnd me so bad i couldnt even shave afterwards!! Its been 3hrs and it still hurts and itchs really bad but it hurts to touch! I will NEVER NEVER AGAIN buy this product!! I threw the whole brand new bottle in the trash!! smhhh!!!</li>
            <li> I think is product is fantastic!  I bought it for my bikini area and I was worried when I read some reviews saying that people were burned.  With the old Nair, it took 9-10 minutes to see results, but with this one, it was about 3 minutes.  I kept checking every 30 seconds because I was so worried about burning, but after 3 minutes, I could wipe everything away.  I would definitely recommend this, but since it works so quickly, watching the time closely is probably the key to making sure you don&#x27;t have a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> As someone with VERY coarse hair, I was AMAZED by the results. I was initially apprehensive about this because of the amount of 1 star reviews, but I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen. I put it on sparingly since it was my first time trying it, and in 10 minutes 98% of my bikini area easily wiped off. Shaving has never given me such a clean shave. Also there was absolutely no pain or burns whatsoever. If this didn&#x27;t work I would&#x27;ve had to resorted to waxing so this was definitely an answer to my prayers! It&#x27;s saved me money, time and pain :)</li>
            <li> The minute it went on it felt like my upper lip was on fire.  I removed it 5 minutes later and now I have blisters, swelling and redness all around my mouth.  Going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. I would never purchase this product again. It actually burned a little area of skin around my bikini area and I didn&#x27;t even come close to having it on the recommended time.</li>
            <li> I really cannot even believe the success I just had with this product. I am a complete product junkie and very rarely does something do what it says it will let alone wow me like this! I have used Nair basic hair removal creams in the past and honestly had no success, but on a whim bought the basic bottle of the Spa Clay with the sponge. I used it on my underarms and legs and I literally feel like I was just waxed. I would like to get a lifetime supply of this product! I have really sensitive skin also and it did not bother me at all. I will not need to be buying razors again as long as Nair continues to sell this! Yay! Finally something that does what it says it will!</li>
            <li> I bought this product the other day. I&#x27;ve had experience with Nair burning my skin a few years back but decided I was too lazy to shave so I tried this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tingles a little but, but it didn&#x27;t bother me. However, when you get in the shower to remove the cream, it caused a part of my leg to flare. I also came out with quite a number of scratches. It did, however, remove almost all of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for small areas (like maybe a few hairs on your feet, fingers, or knee). Use it in areas that are too difficult to shave. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll be keeping mine around (despite the really awful smell). Otherwise, beware of using it in larger areas.</li>
            <li> I read all reviews here and decided I would order here then proceed with caution.  I tried it on my legs after reading all directions, watching the time carefully and making sure not to \\&quot;rub it in\\&quot; as directed on the package.  The hair came off in record time and all hair is completely removed!  I rinsed thoroughly then applied my usual bath oil after showering.  I can not stop toughing my legs!  I will definitely use again instead of shaving and hope to experience the same results in the bikini area.  Thanks Nair!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Brazilian, and when it comes to hair... my Brazilian heritage really shows through. Also, I have the WORST problem with ingrown hairs. It&#x27;s awful. I have tried using coochy shaving creme and ridiculously expensive razors and I would still get ingrown hairs. I have tried using other nair products and they never really worked. That being said, I was hesitant to purchase yet another. However, I did, and let me say... Best. Purchase. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t shaved in over 3 weeks, because I was trying to get rid of some of the ingrown hairs I had. Although this didn&#x27;t get rid of everything, it made my hair so incredibly soft that when I shaved the rest, my skin was not irritated at all. This is a god send for me. So far, there are no signs of ingrown hairs and NO RAZOR BUMPS! Hellooo bikini season!!!</li>
            <li> Hi ladies! I have a history with getting razor bumps so I tried Brazilian bikini wax and was pleased with the results, but the pain was too much for me to do it regularly. Had been using Veet (which works great) until i saw this recently. Tried the product today on bikini area and legs getting ready for the beach. Followed instructions and I love my results so far! Surprised at how not only was the hair removal what I desired, but the way it has left my skin so soft and smooth reminds me of a wax. Will continue using and recommend to try! Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I pretty much bought this product on whim and I&#x27;m glad it worked out. I had to leave it on for the maximum time, but it actually worked! I literally stood in shock after i wiped the cream off because it took all of my hair off and left my legs and bikini line smooth. The only problem i have with this product is that there are only two wipes for such a big jar. I&#x27;d suggest trying to get both legs, bikini line, and underarms using only one wipe, because you use up about half of the jar and dont have to go back a few days later to do your legs after doing your underarms.</li>
            <li> This stuff burned the minute it went on.  No chemical burns but didn&#x27;t use on a sensitive area either.  Only halfway removed hair and now I itch.  Left it on the full 10.  The application directions say to use the sponge...this leads to having half of it absorbed in the sponge.  You then use the other side to remove it.  You better scrub hard and the flimsy sponge sorta removes it.</li>
            <li> LOVE! very easy, quick, and effective! I used it for my legs and Bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;You MUST follow directions.&lt;br /&gt;First I took the sponge and pumped the cream onto the sponge ( the pump made it 100 times easier and less messier) to my surprise it smelled good (many were saying it doesnt) it has a faint hair removal cream odor (but not like the original Nair products)&lt;br /&gt;Okay onto the good stuff, I took the sponge and applied a thick amount of the cream onto my legs and my bikini area, i waited a minute from when I first applied it on my first leg , I got in the shower ( I didnt get my body wet) I just stood there waiting lol (the exitement!) i didnt even have to wait 5 minutes and I startd wiping the product off my first leg! ALL GONE (and my hair wasnt even that long) same with bikini area . Super easy and quick. No irritation, no ugly smell, no burnnnn ! Im so happy :)</li>
            <li> I have been using Nair for many years on my upper lip. In the past year I haven&#x27;t been able to leave the house after Nairing because the area above my lip becomes red and swollen (and stays that way all day). When I discovered the Brazilian formula for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; I was delighted; thought I might be able to go back to removing my \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; without looking like a clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; formula burns like fire! I&#x27;ve used it twice now, and the second time burned even worse than the first. In fact, it burned immediately upon contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how this can be touted as \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; when it&#x27;s clearly worse than the regular Nair. I can&#x27;t go out in public with a mustache, so I have to use a depilatory, but I sure wish I could find one that adequately removes facial hair (mine is thick and dark) without burning my skin off! Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying this again. Someone mentioned having used Sally Hanson successfully in the past. I think I&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
            <li> When I put this on my legs I did not feel any kind of pain, it was not until I got in the shower that there was some pain. The pain was not great and I figured it would be fine after I put lotion on it. An hour later I noticed swelling on some parts of my leg. It was difficult to sleep that night because my legs were so sensitive that any thing touching them hurt. Now here I am in the morning writing this review because I have serval spots on my leg that have a scab on it. It feels like the worst sunburn I have ever had!!  I will probably never use hair removal creams again because I am afraid of this happening again. The cream was only on my legs for about 3 minutes in total time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product yesterday, before reading reviews. I was very nervous about using this after reading them... all the burning and horror! I will straight-up say, that this product did not burn whatsoever. It smelled great. And I also only had to leave it on for 3-4 minutes for it to work. I am half spanish, italian and russian... so my hair is Definitely thick. This product worked wonderfully. I am very pleased... my legs have never been so smooth.</li>
            <li> I was so excited once I got this product in the mail but the first time I used it, I followed the directions provided which said to leave the clay on for two minutes before showering and leave it on while you shower. Once I got out of the shower I had the worst burning sensation for about 15 minutes and NOTHING would help. I left it on my shelf for about a week or two until I decided I wanted to try it again. I left it on the the same amount of time but just added some more clay on my legs. Once I got out the shower I had the same burning sensation that now gave me about 4 little cuts and a bigger one on the lower part of my leg. Definitely not purchasing this product or any of their products and I will definitely not recommend it to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see negative reviews, and glad I didn&#x27;t read them before trying it! I have sensitive skin, and have not had even a hint of tingling or burning. I love the product. I used it before I went on vacation and didn&#x27;t have to shave each day. For me, it lasts between 4-6 days before I get prickly. It is quick and takes less time than shaving. My husband used it on his chest and became a fan too.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews on this and didn&#x27;t buy it initially. But I got a good deal at CVS so descided to try it. I honestly think it works really well. The smell isn&#x27;t great but it rinses off, it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I didn&#x27;t really get any burning but my skin is normal, not too sensitive. I did get a little stinging in the underarms when I applied deordorant afterwards but it wasn&#x27;t bad. My hair is not that thick though so I could see how it may not get all the hair if it is thick.</li>
            <li> Nightmare. I tried a patch test on my arm (small area) first, it went ok, so I tried under arms. After 15 sec or so I had an incredible level of pain. Now this product clings on your skin really well (it stands in the shower), which means trying to remove it was even more painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a look after I stepped out of the shower. Bad welts and red rashes. Very similar to the user who posted her photo of her red rashes but mine was a lot worse with serious welts and the red rashes had open wounds, bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks, the redness is finally calming down. Any clothes that touch the area hurt bad still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other Nair before and never had this reaction. This is a never-again item. I&#x27;m sure it works great for some people, but new users, please be mindful that there are others who get a serious break out.</li>
            <li> I spot-tested this product on my legs, and it worked fine. I had no negative reaction, so I tried it on my underarms. Big mistake. Within thirty seconds, I felt this horrible burning, so I jumped in the shower and started to rinse it off. Because the cream is slightly water resistant, it took some effort to get it all off. By then, I ended up with reddish-purple chemical burns in the creases of my armpits. It has been about 8 hrs and I still can&#x27;t put my arms down because anything touching the burns causes a lot of pain. I&#x27;m using ice and Neosporin, but pain is terrible. If I still feel bad in the morning, I&#x27;m going to see a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I was mostly satisfied with how my legs looked and felt afterwards, the reaction under my arms was bad enough that I&#x27;ll throw this in the trash. I</li>
            <li> I tried the product today and was quite surprised how well it worked. I didn&#x27;t try it on my bikini line because I wasn&#x27;t sure how my skin would react to it, so I instead did my legs. I did it a bit differently than the instructions said: instead of getting in the shower after a min and waiting another three I just waited the 4 min out of the shower then got in. I took a wash cloth and wiped the clay off and it took the hair right with it. I figured, if my skin did have a reaction it would be less painful on my legs than on my bikini line.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it all of the time.  I use it to remove ALL of my body hair and have never had a problem.  No rash, no burning and I leave it on for 10 minutes and it has a pleasant scent.  My hair grows back much slower - it is the only product that I will use.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product because I was tired of the same old razor stubble. My sister uses this product and recommended even though she has very sensitive skin. I tried a small patch on my arm and had no issue and so I put it on my lower legs and knees. It tingled a bit but nothing I thought was painful, I didn&#x27;t go over the recommended time but once I started rinsing it very little hair was removed and my legs began to burn and welts had developed all over. I&#x27;m just hoping they won&#x27;t scar and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t put any on my thighs. I don&#x27;t typically have sensitive skin and I hadn&#x27;t shaved for a couple of days. The welts are raised, oddly shaped and red... They also sting when they come into contact with anything. Finger cross they will go away in the next couple days or ill be making an appointment with my doctor. If your going to try this product test a small area of the skin you actually want hair removed from.... Though I would rather be safe then sorry and avoid this product all together considering the results</li>
            <li> The product pictured is not the one I used.  I used the Nair Sprays Away with Moroccan Argan Oil.  This product did work well, however, a word of caution when applying.  I followed the suggestion of spraying my legs while standing in the shower stall, stepped out to wait the time, then stepped back into the shower stall to shower.  I took a pretty mean fall on the slippery shower floor, just bruises but unexpected and scary!  My advice is to clean the floor thoroughly with Windex before stepping back into it.</li>
            <li> I only had this on two minutes and used running water to take this OFF but my skin came off also. Now I have red marks all over my legs &amp; summer isn&#x27;t over.  It looks like burns...</li>
            <li> Nair continues to be my favorite hair-removal cream.  The Shower Power line in particular has won me over from the Veet side.  Make sure you read the directions and apply in outside the shower and give it a minute to start working before you step in.  Gives very smooth legs when applied carefully, and a great result every time.  It&#x27;s a little tricky to use it on underarms (definitely a learning curve there) but manageable, just be patient with it.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Ok - this (according to the instructions) could be used on bikini line, legs, and underarms.  The two stars are for the bikini line - worked exactly like it said.  But it did not really remove all of the hair on the legs I still had to shave and it left bright red burns under the arms - I only had it on for 3 minutes and it seemed fine until I went to wipe it off with the sponge that came with it.  Intense burning and irritation and the hair is still all there - it just looks all frizzled from the chemicals!  It still hurts too bad to shave the remaining hairs or wear deodorant and it&#x27;s been over 24 hours. I&#x27;ll stick with a razor!</li>
            <li> I used this on my bikini area, because I hate waxing and shaving gives me really bad razor burn and bumps and I wanted to try something new. I read the directions exactly, left it on for about 2 mins or so before hopping in the shower. I set a timer on my phone too so I would know when 2-3 was up. Started to wipe it off and it all came off super easy (I have thick hair too, I&#x27;m half Iranian and have dark, coarse hair). My skin is sensitive as well and I had no issues with any burning etc. after I got out of the shower, I tried to put some lotion on my skin bc it seemed a little sensitive and that did burn so I immediately wiped off the lotion but after that I was fine. I tried this without reading any reviews but I have to admit I am a little afraid to use it on a larger area like my legs or a sensitive spot like underarms, but I will probably try it in a small area first like the bottle recommends. Also- the people writing reviews saying that it burns bad when using on their upper lips, the bottle clearly says not to use on your face so I am def not trying that. The smell wasn&#x27;t great but def wasn&#x27;t the worst thing I have ever smelled, and it all rinses right off. Now I will just have to wait and see what the regrowth will be like and how often I will have to do it, but all in all it was easy and quick enough to replace shaving and having nasty razor burn when I want to wear a bikini this summer.</li>
