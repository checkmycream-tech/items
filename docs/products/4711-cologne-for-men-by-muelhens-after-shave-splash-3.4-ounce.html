            <li>Excellent and love Muelhens.</li>
            <li>Pleasant fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower everyone within smelling range.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn as it goes one smells good</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good for a change now and again.</li>
            <li>the smells is so good.</li>
            <li>Good smell and works well.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Feels great on your face after a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>It has a very distinct scent that I find very pleasant without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Addicting as crank, and want more like money!</li>
            <li>Free shipping, smells great.</li>
            <li>This after shave cologne is so amazing, its cheaper and</li>
            <li>This is a great, light, citrusy-smelling aftershave.</li>
            <li>I have always liked 4711 cologne and now I have the aftershave to go with it.  </li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular, reminds me of DR Harris&#x27; Arlington which I prefer over this.  </li>
            <li>but I was very pleased with its light and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>This ia a favorite of my husband&#x27;s,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite smell</li>
            <li>tsa allowed limit :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this aftershave.</li>
            <li>Applied it rapidly cools the face and leaves a very clean, refreshing note.  </li>
            <li>The price here is exceptional and the product is first rate.  </li>
            <li>I know scents like tastes are subjective, but, I would describe this more as a light industrial chemical scent(cleaner?/lubricant?) than a cologne.</li>
            <li>Smells good and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>For those of you who are unfamiliar with 4711 it is a very light citrus scent and is not overly strong, sweet or cloying.  </li>
            <li>I just love the clean scent of 4711 -</li>
            <li>This is a lovely, light, clean fragrance...  </li>
            <li>Maintain your objectives (get back to the basics) and get the first and arguably the best, without over spending.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine as an after shave if you don&#x27;t want a scent or want to use a cologne afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The scent, while nice (musky lemons) is very short-lived.</li>
            <li>light scent and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>You might enjoy it, but for me, my search continues.</li>
            <li>A nice tingling 1/2 old spice bracing effect, wont make you tear up, but will feel refreshing.</li>
            <li>Has a nice touch for when your just done shaving in the shower and you want that grown and sexy smell not to strong but not to weak all around a great buy</li>
            <li>A light clean citrusy scent with almost no staying power</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>clean crisp scent and bracing after a good shave a true classic</li>
            <li>I loved using this back when I shaved!</li>
            <li>so was delighted to find it on Amazon at a terrific price- pure luck!!</li>
            <li>but it was well worthy the wait.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I must say that this particular scent is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Mild citrus is the smell ladies prefer and this is it.  </li>
            <li>It is much more light and sophisticated than the average drug store aftershave.  </li>
            <li>I use it at home, after a shower or a shave, or as an invigorating splash in the mid day or before bed on warm nights.</li>
            <li>Besides doing what it was purchased to do (keep me from getting razor burn), it has an old school, sophisticated smell</li>
            <li>For the price it was well worth purchasing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>The vendor shipped very fast and my after shave splashes were very well packed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly citrusy and refreshing but it does not last long -- maybe 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This IS an alcohol based splash, so don&#x27;t expect much moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Package Arrrived fast and packaged with care...</li>
            <li>It also was a very delightfull smell</li>
            <li>, you can splash it on liberally and enjoy the splash.&lt;br /&gt;Why only three stars?</li>
            <li>4711 is a classic scent.  </li>
            <li>BUT, decided it&#x27;s too masculine and gave to my brother who loves it!!</li>
            <li>Very brisk with a lite citrus scent, it&#x27;s not overpowering in the office, in the car or near any humanoid.</li>
            <li>Very old world scent.</li>
            <li>For those of you who prefer to be surrounded in a cloud of scent like the average Axe user, this is not for you; but if you are looking for an adult, classic, clean scent, give this a try.</li>
            <li>Less hype, more bite - which is to mean more lasting oils.</li>
            <li>Smells masculine to me.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a splash to accompany the cologne, which I also got when I was feeling nostalgic one night and was pleasantly surprised to find Amazon offering these at such great</li>
            <li>This is a classic after shave scent that has been around for a long time.</li>
            <li>Aftershave advertisements are too subjective in general.  </li>
            <li>The dry down is not as pleasant, with a faint whiff of laundry detergent.</li>

            <li> It also lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This was an old favourite growing up in a hot country where it was not uncommon to see a gentleman splash some 4711 on a handkerchief and pat his neck with it for an afternoon cooldown!</li>
            <li> Has some vegetal/herbal tones that are a pleasant relief from the boring but helpful neutrogena white cap that is my standby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this after shave splash on the recommendation of the members of the Badger and Blade Wet Shaving Web Site.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this improved the odor on the boat</li>
            <li> At this price, you can chuck it if you really hate it that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rank it below Aqua Velva and but above Clubman in terms of moisturizing ability.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed, is it for men?</li>

            <li> This ia a favorite of my husband&#x27;s, so was delighted to find it on Amazon at a terrific price- pure luck!! Got two bottles for him.</li>
            <li> Has a nice touch for when your just done shaving in the shower and you want that grown and sexy smell not to strong but not to weak all around a great buy</li>
            <li> Addicting as crank, and want more like money! Nothin like it. You either love it or hate it.</li>

            <li> Free shipping, smells great. Very old world scent. Gents, Don&#x27;t be scared by \\&quot;For men and Women\\&quot;. Smells masculine to me. At this price, you can chuck it if you really hate it that much. Has some vegetal/herbal tones that are a pleasant relief from the boring but helpful neutrogena white cap that is my standby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This IS an alcohol based splash, so don&#x27;t expect much moisturizing. A nice tingling 1/2 old spice bracing effect, wont make you tear up, but will feel refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is a classic after shave scent that has been around for a long time. Doesn&#x27;t burn as it goes one smells good and it contains glycerin and castor oils as humectants sealing in moisture. It&#x27;s not my favorite smell but it&#x27;s good for a change now and again.</li>
            <li> . Sometimes elevator fragrance is overdone and heavy. This is a lovely, light, clean fragrance...  Package Arrrived fast and packaged with care...BUT, decided it&#x27;s too masculine and gave to my brother who loves it!!</li>

            <li> I bought this after shave splash on the recommendation of the members of the Badger and Blade Wet Shaving Web Site.  I was not disappointed.  It has a very distinct scent that I find very pleasant without being overpowering.  It also lasts a long time.  YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary) definitely applies because we do not all like the same scents.  As for me when my two bottles run out I will reorder again.  The vendor shipped very fast and my after shave splashes were very well packed.  Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> Alcohol &amp; fragrance, about all this stuff is.  I&#x27;d rank it below Aqua Velva and but above Clubman in terms of moisturizing ability.  The scent, while nice (musky lemons) is very short-lived.</li>
            <li> This after shave cologne is so amazing, its cheaper and the smells is so good. I would recommend this for your husband or boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Good smell and works well.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing it is well within the airport tsa allowed limit :)</li>
            <li> Product was very good as it soothed  my skin and made me feel refreshed It also was a very delightfull smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been forever since I tried 4711 cologne so when I saw an after shave version being offered, [[ASIN:B0006NYCRI 4711 by Muelhens - After Shave 3.3 oz]] I thought it would be an excellent product. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Very brisk with a lite citrus scent, it&#x27;s not overpowering in the office, in the car or near any humanoid.</li>
            <li> Nice aftershave!  light scent and not overpowering at all. Husband loves it, and I do too.  will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect summer scent. A light clean citrusy scent with almost no staying power, you can splash it on liberally and enjoy the splash.&lt;br /&gt;Why only three stars? The dry down is not as pleasant, with a faint whiff of laundry detergent. Kinda spoils it for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Nothing spectacular, reminds me of DR Harris&#x27; Arlington which I prefer over this.  I&#x27;m not planning to repurchase.</li>
            <li> clean crisp scent and bracing after a good shave a true classic</li>
            <li> I just love the clean scent of 4711 - I use the aftershave and cologne. When I am out, I hear a lot of, &amp;#34;You smell nice.&amp;#34; It is great stuff.</li>
            <li> The 4711 product line is great.  It took a little while to get this product shipped but it was well worthy the wait.  I have received lots of comments about this aftershave.</li>
            <li> I love this aftershave. Besides doing what it was purchased to do (keep me from getting razor burn), it has an old school, sophisticated smell which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to see why JFK was a 4711 guy.</li>
            <li> For the price it was well worth purchasing.  It has a great scent as I get compliments from the ladies whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> This smells and feels great. I loved using this back when I shaved!</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower everyone within smelling range.</li>
            <li> 4711 is a classic scent.  It&#x27;s lightly citrusy and refreshing but it does not last long -- maybe 5 minutes.  It&#x27;s fine as an after shave if you don&#x27;t want a scent or want to use a cologne afterwards.  If you like a scent that lingers this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for historical reasons.  I found out this cologne was issued to U boat crews in WWII because there was no way for them to bathe for weeks on end while they were on patrol.  I&#x27;m not sure if this improved the odor on the boat but I was very pleased with its light and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent and love Muelhens.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of aftershaves.  That being said, I must say that this particular scent is not my favorite.  You might enjoy it, but for me, my search continues.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, is it for men?, is it for women?, is it for both??, well I think it may be for machines. I know scents like tastes are subjective, but, I would describe this more as a light industrial chemical scent(cleaner?/lubricant?) than a cologne. Find a sample before you buy....</li>
            <li> This is a great, light, citrusy-smelling aftershave. Feels great on your face after a nice close shave. Really excellent in combination with the cologne.</li>
            <li> Smells good and reasonably priced. Mild citrus is the smell ladies prefer and this is it.  JFK used it...and look at the ladies he got!!!!</li>
