    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care for the brush, but the color is beautiful!</li>
            <li>Beautiful color,</li>
            <li>This is a great brand, too.</li>
            <li>This is a great color for almost any eye color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for the best colours and smoothest application, and I love this gel liner.  </li>
            <li>I recommend Ben Nye Lumiere Grand Colour in Royal Purple for both tasks done perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a great eyeliner and goes on smoothly with no &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; on your eye skin.</li>
            <li>Very nice price and pretty color though!</li>
            <li>...lasts most of the day and into the evening.</li>
            <li>, this is what I use! :)</li>
            <li>I love eyeliner - I&#x27;d skip shadow in a pinch, but never liner.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I had been told to try eyeliner gel instead of liquid or pencil, because I had been told you have much more control over gel.</li>
            <li>And I wear it with my purple mascara. :)</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with eye makeup remover, though I must mention that I use remover designed for waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>Easy to work with and not cakey at all.</li>
            <li>this liner goes on smoothly but it fades throughout the day and waterproof?</li>
            <li>Nice eyeliner, but had hoped it would have been more vibrant on the first application.  </li>
            <li>It more of a darker plum color, but pretty.  </li>
            <li>I usually use a separate, higher end brush with any non-pencil liner, but the brush that came with this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>but it applies on okay and takes several applications before you can get a nice vibrant color out of it.</li>
            <li>Seller ships fairly fast!</li>
            <li>The color is pretty</li>
            <li>The color is pretty but wish it were usable.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been rubbing my eyes;-)</li>
            <li>Really pretty color and stays put.  </li>
            <li>color is nice and vibrant... as long as your willing to work with it.</li>
            <li>and this really makes them stand out....smooth, and blends well</li>
            <li>Cannot really be called a gel anymore.</li>
            <li>It picks up just enough to get a smooth line without wasting any, and it&#x27;s buildable - one swipe will give a nice, slightly translucent line, and it only takes three swipes to get the bold colour you see in the image.  </li>
            <li>I do not recommend this eye liner for the 45 and older crowd, it does not spread the smoothest and is sort of drying...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the solid, bold royal purple I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this liner - I would have bought the 12-colour set, but I just don&#x27;t see wearing some of the colours.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be a little more vivid.  </li>
            <li>Your eye area needs to have absolutely no moistness for this to apply properly-and I often have to apply a second, light coat, for complete coverage.</li>
            <li>I live in Baltimore, where it is generally blustery this time of year, which tends to make my eyes water.  </li>
            <li>Evidently I can wear off even the longest of long lasting waterproof eyeliner by the time I hit the office.</li>
            <li>The pot seems very small when you open it, but it really is a lot of liner because you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>

            <li> (Same review left for Violet Purple, Midnight Sky, Teal Green, Titanium Silver and Pixie Dust.)</li>
            <li> This tries to go on a bit clumpy, and also is too translucent.</li>
            <li> My only problem with the Violet is that it doesn&#x27;t seem as thick as the lighter colors.  </li>
            <li> but on bottom lash line it was down to my cheek before the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I have green eyes</li>
            <li> This was all dried up.</li>
            <li> I usually have to touch up my bottom lid after walking to my destination, but this liner withstands the wind and water.  </li>
            <li> The brush is small but not so small that it is hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting it to be vibrant against the skin, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is not smudge proof unfortunately.</li>

            <li> I have green eyes and this really makes them stand out....smooth, and blends well...lasts most of the day and into the evening.</li>
            <li> I bought this just to test the purple waterproof liquid liner, and I like it! Even tho I still always wear my two faced waterproof purple liner, when Im out of that, this is what I use! :) Seller ships fairly fast!</li>
            <li> I love eyeliner - I&#x27;d skip shadow in a pinch, but never liner.  I&#x27;m always looking for the best colours and smoothest application, and I love this gel liner.  The pot seems very small when you open it, but it really is a lot of liner because you don&#x27;t need to use much.  I usually use a separate, higher end brush with any non-pencil liner, but the brush that came with this is perfect.  It picks up just enough to get a smooth line without wasting any, and it&#x27;s buildable - one swipe will give a nice, slightly translucent line, and it only takes three swipes to get the bold colour you see in the image.  The brush is small but not so small that it is hard to work with.  I live in Baltimore, where it is generally blustery this time of year, which tends to make my eyes water.  I usually have to touch up my bottom lid after walking to my destination, but this liner withstands the wind and water.  In fact, I fell asleep with my makeup on and woke up without shadow but with liner intact.  It comes off easily with eye makeup remover, though I must mention that I use remover designed for waterproof mascara.  I highly recommend this liner - I would have bought the 12-colour set, but I just don&#x27;t see wearing some of the colours.  (Same review left for Violet Purple, Midnight Sky, Teal Green, Titanium Silver and Pixie Dust.)</li>
            <li> Nice eyeliner, but had hoped it would have been more vibrant on the first application.  Very nice price and pretty color though!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stick to eye...</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this eye liner for the 45 and older crowd, it does not spread the smoothest and is sort of drying...</li>
            <li> This tries to go on a bit clumpy, and also is too translucent. It&#x27;s not the solid, bold royal purple I was hoping for. I have purple hair and got this for eyeliner and to fill in my brows to match my hair. It doesn&#x27;t quite cut the mustard on either task. I recommend Ben Nye Lumiere Grand Colour in Royal Purple for both tasks done perfectly.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner smears the instant you put it on. The color is pretty but that&#x27;s about it. You look like you have two bruised eyes every time you put it on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. I had been told to try eyeliner gel instead of liquid or pencil, because I had been told you have much more control over gel. Now that I&#x27;ve tried it, I feel like my pencils can&#x27;t compare! This is a great brand, too. Easy to work with and not cakey at all. I wish all of my liners were gel.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be a little more vivid.  It more of a darker plum color, but pretty.  It is not smudge proof unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeliner and goes on smoothly with no &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; on your eye skin. My only problem with the Violet is that it doesn&#x27;t seem as thick as the lighter colors.  Your eye area needs to have absolutely no moistness for this to apply properly-and I often have to apply a second, light coat, for complete coverage.</li>
            <li> This is not eyeliner gel in the slightest, it&#x27;s a cream eyeshadow. If you&#x27;re expecting it to be vibrant against the skin, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> When product arrived, there was crack line around the &#x27;gel&#x27;. This was all dried up. Cannot really be called a gel anymore. The color is pretty but wish it were usable.</li>
            <li> color is nice and vibrant... as long as your willing to work with it. It&#x27;s not the easiest gel liner to work with but it applies on okay and takes several applications before you can get a nice vibrant color out of it. Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s pretty. And I wear it with my purple mascara. :)</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t waterproof. It runs. Beautiful color, but on bottom lash line it was down to my cheek before the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This is a great color for almost any eye color. And the product lasts and doesn&#x27;t smear. You can intentionally smudge for a smokier look as well.</li>
            <li> this liner goes on smoothly but it fades throughout the day and waterproof? NO</li>
            <li> Evidently I can wear off even the longest of long lasting waterproof eyeliner by the time I hit the office. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been rubbing my eyes;-)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the brush, but the color is beautiful!</li>
            <li> Really pretty color and stays put.  Would buy it again!!</li>
