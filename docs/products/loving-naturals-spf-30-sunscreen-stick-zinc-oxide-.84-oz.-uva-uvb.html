            <li>Priced better than most competitors and works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After trying &amp; loving the sunscreen, I knew I had to give the sunscreen stick a try.</li>
            <li>I researched Loving Naturals on [...] to check the score (how safe it is to use on your body) &amp; every procust by Loving Naturals</li>
            <li>Try it, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li>Works great, no scary endocrine disruptors!</li>
            <li>We have been using Loving Naturals since the summer of 2010 and love all of the sun products that we have tried.  </li>
            <li>I like the concistency,the smell and more than anything, to see how effective it is without compromising the safety of the ingredients...</li>
            <li>It is the best Natural sunscreen stick I have ever tried.   </li>
            <li>I have used this three summers in a row for my children and it is the best sunscreen for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The stick is easy to apply, feels nice against my skin, and even smells nice.</li>
            <li>I was used to using a sunblock stick for the face, so I was very excited when Loving Naturals released this product.</li>
            <li>It goes on so easily too!</li>
            <li>The stick makes it nice and easy to apply around the eyes without having to worry about it going in them.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with it, but it only came in lotion form.</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s a stick</li>
            <li>Would be okay</li>
            <li>I have to start this review, saying that I love this brand..</li>
            <li>I also love that the Sunscreen is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave me looking pasty.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but it&#x27;s overpriced for what you get.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I think I will get more wrinkles trying to spread it on my face than i would avoid by not getting sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Read the ingredients and feel confident in putting in your baby or child.</li>
            <li>I think for my purposes a lotion or cream would be much better.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I knew the stick was available...</li>
            <li>Always love supporting people who make things that are healthy and safe.  </li>
            <li>It contains almost 25% zinc oxide which is what our doctor recommended to look for as the active ingredient as this is the best protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li>as one of my sons doesn&#x27;t like anything on his face, It has made so easy to protect him after we got it....</li>
            <li>Easy to manage it with bb cream from Dior .l</li>
            <li>Zinc oxide is the way to go when you want strong uv protection.</li>
            <li>Super product!</li>
            <li>You get the same great sun protection as the lotion.</li>
            <li>I love Loving Naturals&#x27; products because they are made of safe organic ingredients which is exactly what I want for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>This is a very good natural/mineral sunscreen which costs less than some comparable products.  </li>
            <li>Right away I was sold on the company!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Loving Naturals sunscreen lotion for my 15-month old and decided to try out the stick.</li>
            <li>I used it while pregnant and then continued to use it afterwards both for myself and my kids.  </li>
            <li>Initial reaction: LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I started using the regular Loving Naturals Sunscreen [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for making this product also available!</li>
            <li>I am always on the hunt or the safest most natural product I can find to use on myself &amp; my family.</li>
            <li>Loving Naturals is the only brand we&#x27;ll use in our home, for sunscreen!!</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are still natural, but this product has ZERO spreadability.</li>
            <li>Great product for all of those hot spots and helps to apply sunscreen to little ones faces easier.</li>
            <li>All right maybe not all, but you get the point.  </li>
            <li>By the end of last summer with daily exposure to the sun while swimming in our pool and playing a sandbox, they were sunburn free and still quite fair.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of the stick was almost exactly like a glue stick.</li>
            <li>Great natural SPF sunscreen stick with the list of ingredients you could eat every single one of them-they are that natural!  </li>
            <li>Pretty much unusable.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise another product sold to me by my dermatologist (Murad)</li>
            <li>like it to much .the</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This stick works better than any other brand I have tried.</li>
            <li>so I tried this and would say that the new formula that goes on clear is even better than the original one that left them looking a shiny, white color.  </li>
            <li>Although a dermatologist recommended the Blue Lizard Baby brand, I prefer this one due to the gentle formula and the fact that Loving Naturals advocates re-application.  </li>
            <li>This is the only face stick that went on clear and smooth, and I did not have to rub it into their skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this sunscreen solely based on high ratings from the Environmental Working Group review.  </li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen is highly rated by the Environmental Working Group.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen stick because of the high ratings.</li>
            <li>Highly portable</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and very subtle.  </li>
            <li>but I can live with it.  </li>
            <li>If I were using it for the beach, however, it would be terrific and pretty water-proof.</li>
            <li>Having bought the liquid version of this stuff before, I had pretty different expectations.</li>
            <li>and I use it on my young children as well.</li>
            <li>I may have gotten an old stick, but when I tried to apply it to my 3 year old, it was so waxy</li>
            <li>but so is every natural mineral sun block that DOESNT have harmful imgredients.</li>
            <li>I garden frequently and need sunscreen for this purpose.</li>
            <li>It allowed my sensitive children to enjoy a sunny day out in the yard without sunburns on their faces..and without the sticky hard to wash off residue after their bath...  </li>
            <li>BTW, the slightly white appearance is caused by the zinc oxide, which is the only real way to protect your kids from the harmful UVA rays, which cause the deeper skin damage and cancer.</li>
            <li>I only bought this because the liquid wasn&#x27;t available - Please don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely clear and doesn&#x27;t turn white at all.</li>
            <li>For young children it is necessary to re-apply because they wipe their faces and it can come off.</li>
            <li>Only brand that doesn&#x27;t cause acne or hives on my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As long as it blocks the UVA/UVB rays I can live with what I perceive as, the two drawbacks of this product.</li>
            <li>This went right into the trash - total waste of money!</li>

            <li> This went right into the trash - total waste of money!</li>
            <li> It also seems to glide on easier than other natural sunscreens I have used in tube form.</li>
            <li> Although, it is a little more expensive than others it is made from 100% Natural organic Ingredients</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is because my skin is oily but the sunscreen really adds a layer of slick.  </li>
            <li> It is a little oily, but it goes on clear, unlike other mineral-based natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> My daughter also has long hair and it got stuck to her body from the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who is outside in the sun and elements everyday but wasn&#x27;t a fan of coating him with chemical laden sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is the 5th sunblock I have tried in the last six months and is by far the worse.</li>
            <li> We applied the product as directed and were in the sun (dry) for less than two hours.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like trying to paste half dry clay onto your&#x27;s kid&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the other glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> He may just be picky, but I will still encourage him to use it over other products we have tried.</li>
            <li> It is such a waste!</li>
            <li> I apply it so there is a bit of a \\&quot;white\\&quot; look to the face which some may find a little off-putting, however I prefer to make sure to keep the bad stuff off faces of my kids.</li>
            <li> I have two young boys, the youngest is 20 months &amp; it can be hard to get sunscreen on their faces &amp; ears!</li>
            <li> The zinc oxide made you white and hard to rub in.  </li>
            <li> only think it is little bit thick .</li>
            <li> It did seem to be a little greasy</li>
            <li> To me smells a little salty.</li>
            <li> I tried California Baby, Aqua Sport, Babyganics to name a few.</li>
            <li> I usually overlook the faults of the &#x27;test&#x27; sunscreens I buy because I don&#x27;t want to waste the money, but this one I threw away.</li>
            <li> it is a small price to pay</li>
            <li> Maybe I got an old stick, but this was impossible to apply.</li>
            <li> This product is so thick and sticky that I had difficulty getting it out of the tube and spreading it on.</li>
            <li> I am troubled with Melasma and need to wear sunscreen under my foundation.  </li>
            <li> When it did work for a couple of times, consistency was very thick and gooey - unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This product is so thick that it&#x27;s difficult to put on, and especially difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> We both were badly burned.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>

            <li> I started using the regular Loving Naturals Sunscreen [[ASIN:B002C0CZEU Loving Naturals SPF 30 Sunscreen Zinc Oxide 5 Oz. UVA/UVB Vegan]]  on my kids about a year ago. I bought it when I saw that it was the top-rated sunscreen on the Environmental Working Group website. I was very happy with it, but it only came in lotion form. I was used to using a sunblock stick for the face, so I was very excited when Loving Naturals released this product. This stick works better than any other brand I have tried. For young children it is necessary to re-apply because they wipe their faces and it can come off. However, once on the face it is great. I apply it so there is a bit of a \\&quot;white\\&quot; look to the face which some may find a little off-putting, however I prefer to make sure to keep the bad stuff off faces of my kids. BTW, the slightly white appearance is caused by the zinc oxide, which is the only real way to protect your kids from the harmful UVA rays, which cause the deeper skin damage and cancer.</li>
            <li> A sunscreen stick that is easy to apply, is chemical free, and has excellent sun protection. The stick makes it nice and easy to apply around the eyes without having to worry about it going in them. My kids think it smells like chocolate milk. You get the same great sun protection as the lotion.</li>
            <li> Great product for all of those hot spots and helps to apply sunscreen to little ones faces easier. Priced better than most competitors and works great. Have used it for a day at the zoo and it offered great protection.  Also convenient to just pop it in your purse.  It also seems to glide on easier than other natural sunscreens I have used in tube form. It did seem to be a little greasy but I can live with it.  If I have to deal with that to have my child (and myself) protected from burns and skin cancer it is a small price to pay</li>
            <li> We have been using Loving Naturals since the summer of 2010 and love all of the sun products that we have tried.  The sunsticks are great for my kids who can apply them without assistance.  We all use them daily and know that we are protecting our skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen solely based on high ratings from the Environmental Working Group review.  I try to use only oil-free sunscreen.  Much to my surprise another product sold to me by my dermatologist (Murad) didn&#x27;t fare well in the Environmental Working Group review so I thought I&#x27;d try this sunscreen.  I am troubled with Melasma and need to wear sunscreen under my foundation.  Although the packaging says that it is non-greasy, that is definitely not the case with me.  Perhaps it is because my skin is oily but the sunscreen really adds a layer of slick.  This product does produce a white color after applied but the suggestion I read earlier from another reviewer, that is, to add some foundation to color the lotion before applying sounds like a good one(I wear mineral powder so that won&#x27;t work for me).  It is has a heavier consistency than the oil-free Murad sunscreen.  The scent is pleasant and very subtle.  As long as it blocks the UVA/UVB rays I can live with what I perceive as, the two drawbacks of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Loving Naturals sunscreen lotion for my 15-month old and decided to try out the stick. Initial reaction: LOVE it! I love Loving Naturals&#x27; products because they are made of safe organic ingredients which is exactly what I want for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin. It contains almost 25% zinc oxide which is what our doctor recommended to look for as the active ingredient as this is the best protection from the sun.  We love the lotion, but the stick is great for keeping in your purse/diaper bag. I carry it with me everywhere just in case we do an inpromptu play session outside and I love that it&#x27;s a stick so I don&#x27;t have to get it all over my hands.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product.  The zinc oxide made you white and hard to rub in.  Would be okay if you didn&#x27;t care that you looked like a ghost!!!</li>
            <li> I have asked for a refund and Amazon is great because they make it so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t work. We applied the product as directed and were in the sun (dry) for less than two hours. We both were badly burned.</li>
            <li> I have to start this review, saying that I love this brand.. I was very excited when I knew the stick was available...as one of my sons doesn&#x27;t like anything on his face, It has made so easy to protect him after we got it....I like the concistency,the smell and more than anything, to see how effective it is without compromising the safety of the ingredients... no allergies on my boys ...I highly recomend this product.  It allowed my sensitive children to enjoy a sunny day out in the yard without sunburns on their faces..and without the sticky hard to wash off residue after their bath...  It is the best Natural sunscreen stick I have ever tried.   Thanks so much for making this product also available!</li>
            <li> I apply this sunscreen in the morning and I use it on my young children as well. Although, it is a little more expensive than others it is made from 100% Natural organic Ingredients so it&#x27;s worth it! I also love that the Sunscreen is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave me looking pasty. Try it, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt or the safest most natural product I can find to use on myself &amp; my family. I researched Loving Naturals on [...] to check the score (how safe it is to use on your body) &amp; every procust by Loving Naturals came up 0-1 meaning low hazard. Right away I was sold on the company! I wanted to buy &amp; try everything they made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying &amp; loving the sunscreen, I knew I had to give the sunscreen stick a try. I have two young boys, the youngest is 20 months &amp; it can be hard to get sunscreen on their faces &amp; ears! With this stick it is finally a breeze to wipe sunscreen on their noses, ears, neck or even tops of their feet! I am very happy with this product. Loving Naturals is the only brand we&#x27;ll use in our home, for sunscreen!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good natural/mineral sunscreen which costs less than some comparable products.  The sunscreen is highly rated by the Environmental Working Group.</li>
            <li> This product is so thick and sticky that I had difficulty getting it out of the tube and spreading it on.</li>
            <li> Easy to manage it with bb cream from Dior .l like it to much .the only think it is little bit thick .</li>
            <li> It is a little oily, but it goes on clear, unlike other mineral-based natural sunscreens.  Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great, no scary endocrine disruptors!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It goes on so easily too! I highly recommend it! It protects my body from the harmful rays and it&#x27;s non-toxic! Super product!</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen stick because of the high ratings. I may have gotten an old stick, but when I tried to apply it to my 3 year old, it was so waxy I could not even rub it in. The consistency of the stick was almost exactly like a glue stick. Pretty pointless if it just leaves chunks of wax on your skin. My daughter also has long hair and it got stuck to her body from the sunscreen. This went right into the trash - total waste of money! Will stick to California Baby from now on.</li>
            <li> Great natural SPF sunscreen stick with the list of ingredients you could eat every single one of them-they are that natural!  All right maybe not all, but you get the point.  It scored 1 on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep cosmetics database.  I used it while pregnant and then continued to use it afterwards both for myself and my kids.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Love the product, but it&#x27;s overpriced for what you get.</li>
            <li> I have used this three summers in a row for my children and it is the best sunscreen for sensitive skin.  Another sunscreen left my children with bumps/rashes everywhere so I tried this and would say that the new formula that goes on clear is even better than the original one that left them looking a shiny, white color.  By the end of last summer with daily exposure to the sun while swimming in our pool and playing a sandbox, they were sunburn free and still quite fair.  My children are so fair their pediatrician jokingly said I should put sunscreen on them while they were inside.  Consequently, I follow the directions and reapply the sunscreen after they have been in the pool 40+ minutes and it works quite well.  Although a dermatologist recommended the Blue Lizard Baby brand, I prefer this one due to the gentle formula and the fact that Loving Naturals advocates re-application.  Although Blue Lizard claims to last longer and resist water, I have read some reviews that suggested it wears off at the same rate as sunscreens that suggest you re-apply them.</li>
            <li> After researching the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s 2014 Guide to Sunscreens, I tried a lot of the zinc-face sticks that were rated well/safer. I tried California Baby, Aqua Sport, Babyganics to name a few. This is the only face stick that went on clear and smooth, and I did not have to rub it into their skin. My kids love it, and I am happy that this product protects my kids from the sun, is fast and convenient, and is one of the best rated for sunscreen safety.</li>
            <li> Always love supporting people who make things that are healthy and safe.  The product itself functioned perfectly as well.  Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. Only brand that doesn&#x27;t cause acne or hives on my highly sensitive skin. Highly portable and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it leaking in the bag or car.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the other glowing reviews. Maybe I got an old stick, but this was impossible to apply. I think I will get more wrinkles trying to spread it on my face than i would avoid by not getting sun exposure.  This is the 5th sunblock I have tried in the last six months and is by far the worse. I usually overlook the faults of the &#x27;test&#x27; sunscreens I buy because I don&#x27;t want to waste the money, but this one I threw away.</li>
            <li> The stick melted inside the tube, then broke and got permanently stuck inside, hence leaving the product unusable. When it did work for a couple of times, consistency was very thick and gooey - unpleasant. Pretty much unusable. Avoid...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who is outside in the sun and elements everyday but wasn&#x27;t a fan of coating him with chemical laden sunscreen. I like it for myself but he complains that it is sticky and he doesn&#x27;t like the texture of it on his face. He may just be picky, but I will still encourage him to use it over other products we have tried.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s pricey but so is every natural mineral sun block that DOESNT have harmful imgredients. Read the ingredients and feel confident in putting in your baby or child. It&#x27;s completely clear and doesn&#x27;t turn white at all. Water beads off skin so you can totally tell if you missed a spot. I actually like that. No offensive smell. To me smells a little salty. Not sweaty,. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I garden frequently and need sunscreen for this purpose. This product is so thick that it&#x27;s difficult to put on, and especially difficult to wash off. If I were using it for the beach, however, it would be terrific and pretty water-proof. I think for my purposes a lotion or cream would be much better.</li>
            <li> Having bought the liquid version of this stuff before, I had pretty different expectations. I love that the ingredients are still natural, but this product has ZERO spreadability. It is such a waste! It just comes out of the tube in clumps and even when you try to spread it by hand it&#x27;s like trying to paste half dry clay onto your&#x27;s kid&#x27;s skin. I bought two tubes and I never use it. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I only bought this because the liquid wasn&#x27;t available - Please don&#x27;t waste your money like I did. I can&#x27;t believe they changed their product to something so unstisfactory - and the tubes are TINY - not like you can use it anyway.</li>
            <li> I bought this to protect my tattoo from the sun and I think it&#x27;s going to do a great job. The stick is easy to apply, feels nice against my skin, and even smells nice. Zinc oxide is the way to go when you want strong uv protection.</li>
