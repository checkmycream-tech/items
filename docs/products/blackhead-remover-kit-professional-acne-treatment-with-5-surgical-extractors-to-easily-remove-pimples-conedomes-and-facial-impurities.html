            <li>I would advise anyone buying this kit to make sure to sterilize the tools before and after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tools are mostly pain free, and my teenager loves them!</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>but when I do and try the product I will update my review with more info and if I find any issues with this item.</li>
            <li>and then apply your favorite moisturizer for smoothness.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all over my nose and forehead mostly.</li>
            <li>so many things don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure how to use these and why there were so many shapes and sizes</li>
            <li>She thinks the flat loops works best for pimples.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to receive the tools and put them to good use, as everyone in the house as some sort of acne.</li>
            <li>This kit is not only removes blackhead effortlessly and pain free, but they each piece is also great for removing zits as well!</li>
            <li>But If you get a good angle then you don&#x27;t have to dig into your face much with it.</li>
            <li>The zippered case provides easy access to the tools,&lt;br /&gt;each having a strap to keep the tools separate and organized.  </li>

            <li>She couldn&#x27;t believe how easy this kit worked on blackheads.</li>
            <li>Comes in a nifty sturdy zipper case for easy storage or transport.  </li>
            <li>so I suppose its fine, kinda....</li>
            <li>I got this product for free for my review.</li>
            <li>The tools in this Blackhead Remover Kit are fantastic.</li>
            <li>If it does not come out the first time, try it again with more pressure.</li>
            <li>Finally wash your face again with a good quality</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use and really do work.</li>
            <li>Great little acne Blackhead remover Kit.  </li>
            <li>She was very thankful that I got it for her and was super excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>Each piece is a diff size to accommodate to the size of blemish you are working with and that is amazing because as we all know, not all blackheads or zits are created equally!</li>
            <li>And its so useful.</li>
            <li>I ordered these for my teenage daughter and she was thrilled when they were delivered.</li>
            <li>Steamed my face (very important) to open my pores...</li>
            <li>the tools make it super easy to give yourself an at home facial!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it hurt a bit.</li>
            <li>Very grateful for these!  </li>
            <li>And after seeing the videos I was able to use this properly on the husband.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to finally find something that removes blackheads accordingly with no pain.  </li>
            <li>They also come in a nice red and black case, which happen to be his favorite colors, so it works out</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also comes with a nice storage case with a tie down for each tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it is already white then you do not have to use as much pressure, it will pop pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>Her review says this kit works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>They are professional&lt;br /&gt;grade stainless steel material.  </li>
            <li>so I looked up some YouTube videos about tools like these and that was really helpful.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected</li>
            <li>Its takes a little practice but once you get the hang of it, it is very easy to use the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay so i never knew about these until I happen across them the other day.</li>
            <li>Easy to use tools with a rough grip handle to keep from sliding.  </li>
            <li>Figured with a decent discount I&#x27;ll try it.</li>
            <li>We have several similar kits which we all love.  </li>
            <li>Highly, highly, recommended.</li>
            <li>Cute little carrying case.  </li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it, it does what it is supposed to do for blackheads that are really near the surface and are ready.</li>
            <li>And he had no marking, or damaging of his skin, and he never complained about pain.</li>
            <li>A very hard habit to break so easiest when learning to use these handy devices at an early age when breakouts first begin.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure how to use the tools at first, but with a little trial and error it started to actually work!</li>
            <li>all The tools helped pick out alot of my blackheads and made me black head free.</li>
            <li>So easy, extremely sterile,  &amp; actually works.  </li>
            <li>Totally professional.</li>
            <li>but my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>Has all the needed tools to do a professional job at taking care of your skin.  </li>
            <li>I am kind of confused what some of the tools are for.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to receive this product so that I could get rid of those pesky black heads everyone hates!</li>
            <li>only negative is the instructions that come with the kit are not really that good.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed, I have a few blackheads on other areas besides my face that are hard to reach and this little set has been wonderful in helping me extract those.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently started using new face products and it&#x27;s bringing a lot to the surface</li>
            <li>Ordering this I was kind of skeptical.  </li>
            <li>(worse before it&#x27;s better) and these help to bring it all out.</li>
            <li>help!&lt;br /&gt;4)  Press down gently and the blackhead or blemish will pop out through the loop.&lt;br /&gt;5)  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> help!&lt;br /&gt;4)  Press down gently and the blackhead or blemish will pop out through the loop.&lt;br /&gt;5)  </li>
            <li> Pick a black head, appropriate sized utensil and a little bit of pressure and the black head comes out.</li>
            <li> I have never used one of these before, and the instructions were not very clear for me, so I had to YouTube it.</li>
            <li> Tools smaller then expects as I&#x27;ve had other extractors.</li>
            <li> Not a big enough negative to take away a star.</li>
            <li> Not a big enough negative to take away a star.</li>
            <li> Put the loop over the center of the blackhead.</li>
            <li> Press downward into the skin and while still applying pressure, slowly drag the loop over the blackhead.</li>
            <li> These tools help to pull out the bacteria and dead cells without breaking it and allowing it to drain into your body, potentially causing an infection.</li>
            <li> if they don&#x27;t then that means you&#x27;re being too rough!</li>
            <li> other tools are for getting to harder to reach areas like the ears or black heads that are deeper into the skin.</li>
            <li> Some of those little things are harder to get out than others.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more irritating in this world then seeing those annoying black heads, trying to remove them with your fingernails &amp;&amp; walking around with red marks on your face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go overboard tho with ones that are clearly not ready.</li>
            <li> The little tools are quality and I like the little storage case.  </li>
            <li> It does leave little loop marks but those go away and</li>
            <li> but it goes away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Totally misleading and false advertisement.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to use this and see how it works.</li>
            <li> The tools do leave behind a little mark</li>
            <li> The 5 different tools are extremely helpful in getting those ones in those tough painful places like the corners of your nose.</li>
            <li> You literally have every tool you&#x27;d ever need to remove splinters, blackheads, small cysts, milia, and even visible earwax!</li>
            <li> She seriously loves this thing and keeps it in her purse so that it&#x27;s always with her in case she needs it.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re so hard to get rid of!</li>
            <li> /&gt;  with cold water</li>

            <li> Okay so i never knew about these until I happen across them the other day. I ordered and they came in 2 days. I tried them out for the first time and I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how absolutely amazing this is! They take the pain out of &amp;#34;beauty is pain&amp;#34;. They are so easy to use and really do work. I&#x27;m still in shock! Highly, highly, recommended.</li>
            <li> Tools smaller then expects as I&#x27;ve had other extractors. They should do the job though will update review when I use them some.</li>
            <li> Product delivered only has three tools.</li>
            <li> The one I got had three tools, not 5 as pictured, avoid this, it is not as pictured or described.</li>
            <li> Just tried it out. Never used one of these kits before until now. Seems to do the trick. Nice and portable. Very handy. Promotional product received.</li>
            <li> They work great!  Very well made.  Cute little carrying case.  I did receive a discount for a review.</li>
            <li> Kit only came with 3 pieces.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage daughter so the review is coming from her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great little set to get rid of those nasty ugly blackheads and zits. Its takes a little practice but once you get the hang of it, it is very easy to use the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I asked my daughter how to use the kit here is what she told me:&lt;br /&gt;1. Be sure you sterilize the tools before and after you use them. I use basic rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;2. Wash your face with a good cleaner before you start the process.&lt;br /&gt;3 She likes to use the wire loop for blackheads. Put the loop over the center of the blackhead. Press downward into the skin and while still applying pressure, slowly drag the loop over the blackhead. If it does not come out the first time, try it again with more pressure. Some of those little things are harder to get out than others.&lt;br /&gt;4. She thinks the flat loops works best for pimples. Basically you do the same thing as you did with the blackheads. If it is already white then you do not have to use as much pressure, it will pop pretty easy. Continue the process until the zit starts to bleed.&lt;br /&gt;5. After you are done sterilize the tools again before you put them away.&lt;br /&gt;6. Finally wash your face again with a good quality cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;7. Leave the tools all over the bathroom counter so mom will have to put them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other tools are for getting to harder to reach areas like the ears or black heads that are deeper into the skin. Just have to do lots of trial and error.  Practice makes perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a nice storage case with a tie down for each tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know these are the instructions my teenage daughter gave me and are not meant to be the official instructions.  She says there are also some good instruction on the web just Google how to use Blackhead Remover Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the instructions that come with the kit are not really that good. It does not tell you what to use each tool for.  Not a big enough negative to take away a star.Not a big enough negative to take away a star.</li>
            <li> I bought these before, great quality arrived on time</li>
            <li> I got this at discounted price. I like it. And its so useful.</li>
            <li> Great kit if you know what you&#x27;re doing, otherwise it takes alot of patience and guidance to be able to use these tools correctly. Takes alot of trial and error but once you get the hang of it, it does what it is supposed to do for blackheads that are really near the surface and are ready. Don&#x27;t go overboard tho with ones that are clearly not ready. It also comes with a nice storage case that has a place for each tool for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my teenage daughter and she was thrilled when they were delivered. Her review says this kit works very well. A+</li>
            <li> I was super excited to receive the tools and put them to good use, as everyone in the house as some sort of acne. I wasn&#x27;t really sure how to use the tools at first, but with a little trial and error it started to actually work! I would advise anyone buying this kit to make sure to sterilize the tools before and after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools are mostly pain free, and my teenager loves them! They also come in a nice red and black case, which happen to be his favorite colors, so it works out great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Works great and very easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed, I have a few blackheads on other areas besides my face that are hard to reach and this little set has been wonderful in helping me extract those.  The little tools are quality and I like the little storage case.  I am very happy with this set.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free for my review. I really like this I tried it out as soon as I got it. I am kind of confused what some of the tools are for. I used them and it got a a good amount of the ones who were stuck between my nose. It will probably work even better after a warm shower or after being out in the sun. My best friend is very jealous.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review of this product. I would highly recommend this to anyone! The picture doesn&#x27;t show the quality that these tool actually are. Not to mention the great storage case they come with. I was extremely excited to receive this product so that I could get rid of those pesky black heads everyone hates! The 5 different tools are extremely helpful in getting those ones in those tough painful places like the corners of your nose.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more irritating in this world then seeing those annoying black heads, trying to remove them with your fingernails &amp;&amp; walking around with red marks on your face. Ordering this I was kind of skeptical.  Is there really actually something that will help those blackheads without leaving marks on my face. Figured with a decent discount I&#x27;ll try it. Well I received this the day before my wedding. It can go one of two ways, work as it&#x27;s advertised  to or I&#x27;ll have a bunch of marks on my face during my wedding. Steamed my face (very important) to open my pores...And used the utensils in this kit to remove them. Pick a black head, appropriate sized utensil and a little bit of pressure and the black head comes out. So easy, extremely sterile,  &amp; actually works.  This actually removes all the blackheads that i tried... With ease. I was super excited to finally find something that removes blackheads accordingly with no pain.  5 stars...2 thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> Totally professional. I love this kit. Great value....my husband isn&#x27;t a fan because every night I use it on his back lol</li>
            <li> Only came with two tools! That&#x27;s not what was shown. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to use this and see how it works. I haven&#x27;&#x27;t received this yet but when I do and try the product I will update my review with more info and if I find any issues with this item. I got this in return of a review</li>
            <li> The tools in this Blackhead Remover Kit are fantastic. We purchased the kit in a&lt;br /&gt;promotion for testing and review.  The zippered case provides easy access to the tools,&lt;br /&gt;each having a strap to keep the tools separate and organized.  They are professional&lt;br /&gt;grade stainless steel material.  They should be sanitized before and after each use.&lt;br /&gt;The tools work beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions on package:&lt;br /&gt;1) Steam your face with a towel for 4-6 minutes.  This will soften the pores and make it&lt;br /&gt;  easy to remove blemish.&lt;br /&gt;2) Soak your extractor in Isopropyl alcohol for 1 minute.  This will sterilize the tool.&lt;br /&gt;3)  Place the extractor loop over the blackhead or blemish.  Using a magnifying glass&lt;br /&gt;  or mirror will help!&lt;br /&gt;4)  Press down gently and the blackhead or blemish will pop out through the loop.&lt;br /&gt;5)  Re-sterilize the extractor with rubbing alcohol then repeat.  Continue until you&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;  successfully removed all blemishes.  To close your pores back, wash your face&lt;br /&gt;  with cold water and then apply your favorite moisturizer for smoothness.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome blackhead remover kit! Each piece is great quality and easy to use. I love that it came in a nice zip pouch that has a specified spot for each tool. This kit is not only removes blackhead effortlessly and pain free, but they each piece is also great for removing zits as well! Each piece is a diff size to accommodate to the size of blemish you are working with and that is amazing because as we all know, not all blackheads or zits are created equally! This is an amazing set to have around and fits perfectly in any purse or bag.</li>
            <li> this works great. all The tools helped pick out alot of my blackheads and made me black head free. This kit helped me get blackheads out that i have been trying for years.</li>
            <li> good product @ a good price</li>
            <li> I got this Blackhead Remover Kit for my roommate because she has problems with blackheads. She was very thankful that I got it for her and was super excited to try it out. She started using it almost immediately and I heard her in the bathroom keep saying &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; over and over again. She couldn&#x27;t believe how easy this kit worked on blackheads. She seriously loves this thing and keeps it in her purse so that it&#x27;s always with her in case she needs it. The tools do leave behind a little mark but it goes away after a few minutes. I would definitely recommend this Blackhead Remover Kit as a gift or for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try one of these. I have a lot of blackheads and they&#x27;re so hard to get rid of! They&#x27;re all over my nose and forehead mostly. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of face product but my skin is sensitive so many things don&#x27;t work for me. I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure how to use these and why there were so many shapes and sizes so I looked up some YouTube videos about tools like these and that was really helpful. These tools help to pull out the bacteria and dead cells without breaking it and allowing it to drain into your body, potentially causing an infection. Picking at pimples can be dangerous and these tools can literally be a life saver. The first time I used it, it hurt a bit. But If you get a good angle then you don&#x27;t have to dig into your face much with it. It definitely pulled a lot of gunk out of my face. It does leave little loop marks but those go away and if they don&#x27;t then that means you&#x27;re being too rough! I&#x27;ve recently started using new face products and it&#x27;s bringing a lot to the surface (worse before it&#x27;s better) and these help to bring it all out. Very grateful for these!  I revieved this product in exchange for my review</li>
            <li> I bought this kit in addition to the 3 piece kit to keep in my medic aid bag. You literally have every tool you&#x27;d ever need to remove splinters, blackheads, small cysts, milia, and even visible earwax! A handy kit to have. Definitely would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> love this! the case is super cute and perfect for travel. the tools make it super easy to give yourself an at home facial!</li>
            <li> Great little acne Blackhead remover Kit.  Has all the needed tools to do a professional job at taking care of your skin.  Easy to use tools with a rough grip handle to keep from sliding.  Comes in a nifty sturdy zipper case for easy storage or transport.  The #1 cause of infection is from pimple picking with our fingers.  A very hard habit to break so easiest when learning to use these handy devices at an early age when breakouts first begin.  We have several similar kits which we all love.  This kit will go to one of our granddaughters as she is now pre teen age and blemishes are just starting to appear.  I purchased this product at a reduced rate to review and am very pleased I did.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this!!!!!! The kit does not look like the picture and it only comes with THREE extractors, not five like the picture. Totally misleading and false advertisement.</li>
            <li> Once I got hang of tools they was easy an worked great</li>
            <li> the metal looks like it wasn&#x27;t buffed out. does the job though</li>
            <li> This blemish kit is nicely packaged and easy to use..good quality and perfect set for blemish.</li>
            <li> I have never used one of these before, and the instructions were not very clear for me, so I had to YouTube it. And after seeing the videos I was able to use this properly on the husband. And he had no marking, or damaging of his skin, and he never complained about pain. This works great!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I purchased a 5 piece set and only received 3.  Returning item.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected</li>
            <li> Get 4 of the tools instead of 5 but it still works so I suppose its fine, kinda....</li>
