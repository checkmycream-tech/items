            <li>Perhaps that&#x27;s my own fault</li>

            <li>love love love this</li>
            <li>Great seller thanks</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it does better than the majority of products out there.</li>
            <li>My favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I guarantee I will be using Matrix shampoo and conditioner for many years, just  like my  friend</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of just a lovely scented scalp, I was left with the best results any conditioner has ever given me before.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Using this product for years and still love it.</li>
            <li>but I am pleased that the product has not changed in years like many hair products seem to do.</li>
            <li>I found Matrix conditioning balm at walmart for a bit higher price, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part of this conditioner though has to be the fantastic scent.</li>
            <li>I was very lucky to have found this product</li>
            <li>clean smooth hair everytime, and i get compliments on how my hair smells from my boyfriend!</li>
            <li>My hair greases easily</li>
            <li>Great for my dry, over processed hair.</li>
            <li>great for dry and treated hair.  </li>
            <li>so I tried this product and was instantly satisfied with how much it hydrated my damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I think it is a good deal when I can find it on sale, but I will still always try to buy this over any department store conditioners.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Good conditioning with out weighing down fine hair.</li>
            <li>i smile knowing i saved about 50% buying it on amazon.</li>
            <li>I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>fresh smelling..</li>
            <li>It helps keep my hair soft and shiny, rather than wiry, like most gray hair.</li>
            <li>but this does not weigh down my fair</li>
            <li>Exactly what I said for their shampoo-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR</li>
            <li>I am aware of the havoc chlorine wreaks on my hair; biolage assuages some of the damage</li>
            <li>I can always find it and it is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>and I am able to use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>My hair was left shiny, manageable, full of healthy moisture, and it was soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have to do a lot of straitening to my hair, specifically my bangs because I have a cowlick that curls my hair up in one spot, though the rest of my hair is pretty straight.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, though, and made hair all bouncy, but not worth the snapped hairs.</li>
            <li>This conditioner was really soapy, so I could use it to co-wash, but it made my hair fall out (too strong) and further snagged and tangled my 4C hair as I washed it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, but I can save money and get a similar product from Garnier.  </li>
            <li>The scent was what drew me in initially, with a very gorgeous musky fragrance that is both thick yet light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was sooo worth the splurge as I would have spent far more on cheap products trying to achieve the same results.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for a miracle and this is not it.  </li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t do much for the frizz.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Though this conditioner doesn&#x27;t help enough with all the damage I get from straitening, it still moisturizes the rest of my hair (making it silky smooth) without leaving it greasy at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m using too much...</li>
            <li>Really, really helps with frizzy hair, and I have tried everything.</li>
            <li>This stuff seals off the dry ends of my hair and leaves it very soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>For the First time in Years--- my hair is SHINNY- and soft.--</li>
            <li>I find all Biolage products to be gentle on the hair and very high quality; an opinion shared by my professional hairstylist.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>If you have very fine hair only use every other shampoo.</li>
            <li>Biolage Hydratherapie Conditioning Balm by Matrix literally transformed my dull and dry damaged hair into hair that did not even feel like it was my own!</li>
            <li>It also does not weigh hair down, which is important to me since im prone to oily roots.  </li>
            <li>(I have to wash it almost everyday to keep the grease out), but it also dries out easily as well.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel soft immediately.  </li>
            <li>It gives my naturally curly, graying hair that silky feeling (close to post haircut).</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is now soft, shiny with no trace of damage.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but well worth it!</li>
            <li>I am not able to use conditioners since I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I really like it does make my thick and dry hair look so much better , I also have highlight done on my hair ever three month</li>
            <li>I try to not wash my hair everyday, but between the dog park and gym, I took 3 showers, and it never got greasy or dry after so many shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I found this one for almost $20.00 at a local super center, I figured what the hell... and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>And it does a fine job; it may be thick, but it leaves my hair soft and silky, not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>I had my hair lightened and highlighted, then had to dye it brown three times to get it back to its natural color.  </li>
            <li>Less breakage, shinier, and more manageable are just a few of the benefits.  </li>
            <li>had tried lots of high end hair care products with minimal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really helps my hair be less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I even frequently use it on my dry styled hair as a smoothing balm</li>
            <li>Very concentrated, so you only have a use a little bit.</li>

            <li> Very concentrated, so you only have a use a little bit.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works very well, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am 65 and have long gray hair.</li>
            <li> so my hair tends to be dry, also from using the curling brush.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes deeply without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, fairly thick, hair that is sometimes curly, sometimes straight, and usually Oily.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t squeeze a big blob into your palm -- a little dab will do ya&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> I just slightly towel dry my hair and then rub in a pea size amount into my scalp.  </li>
            <li> My hair and scalp is less dry after just 3 uses.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> The 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the amount of product I have to put in to get the effect.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried a lot of other salon-grade products, and this is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> this is one of two products that leaves my hair feeling nourished and not weighed down after rinsing</li>
            <li> I like to color my hair on a regular basis, however after years of processing my hair, it became dull, dry, and hard to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I personally find it slightly difficult to entirely remove.  </li>
            <li> Over coloring had dried my hair out</li>
            <li> I usually buy it from drugstore</li>
            <li> I do not dye my hair, however, I usually get a Perm 2x a year--</li>
            <li> My hair was in bad condition, very dry and rough.  </li>
            <li> I use this with our very hard water, and it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> And this supplier is no more expensive than the salon price, and I don&#x27;t have to travel to get it!</li>
            <li> I never could be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for my dry, over processed hair.</li>
            <li> It works great as a leave in conditioner.  I just slightly towel dry my hair and then rub in a pea size amount into my scalp.  I no longer have problems with an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I use this with our very hard water, and it works wonders.  It&#x27;s been a year since my last hair cut and I love the way my hair feels.  I have coarse, fairly thick, hair that is sometimes curly, sometimes straight, and usually Oily.  I try to not wash my hair everyday, but between the dog park and gym, I took 3 showers, and it never got greasy or dry after so many shampoos.  I love this conditioner, I just wish it smelled like Nexxus Therappe... The smell it does have is vey nice. not overpowering at all</li>
            <li> Use this all the time.  Really helps my hair be less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I was very lucky to have found this product and I was happy it was as claimed.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used. I got some samples of it at my salon and have never gone back! It makes my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Not same as the one I bought in store. It work the same neither.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I said for their shampoo-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR THIS PRICE?! i thought ehhh no-what if its &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;? but i said ok ill just try it.. i am in love- its like im at the salon everytime i use this, and whenever i see it in stores i smile knowing i saved about 50% buying it on amazon. clean smooth hair everytime, and i get compliments on how my hair smells from my boyfriend! love love love this</li>
            <li> Great conditioner to use on damaged hair. Very concentrated, so you only have a use a little bit. A little pricey but well worth it!</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel soft immediately.  Over coloring had dried my hair out so I tried this product and was instantly satisfied with how much it hydrated my damaged hair.  It feels so much better now!</li>
            <li> This conditioner works very well, a little goes a long way. If you have very fine hair only use every other shampoo. Good value for the cost.</li>
            <li> great size - as an avid swimmer I am aware of the havoc chlorine wreaks on my hair; biolage assuages some of the damage</li>
            <li> This stuff seals off the dry ends of my hair and leaves it very soft and healthy looking. I use it a couple times a week</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for my keratin straightened hair. I even frequently use it on my dry styled hair as a smoothing balm</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Great seller thanks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t squeeze a big blob into your palm -- a little dab will do ya&#x27;. And it does a fine job; it may be thick, but it leaves my hair soft and silky, not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was really soapy, so I could use it to co-wash, but it made my hair fall out (too strong) and further snagged and tangled my 4C hair as I washed it. It is probably best for girls with straight hair. Smells nice, though, and made hair all bouncy, but not worth the snapped hairs.</li>
            <li> This product was great. Good conditioning with out weighing down fine hair. A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as expected.  Quality of the product was superb, and I am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for a miracle and this is not it.  It&#x27;s fine, but I can save money and get a similar product from Garnier.  Too bad!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. It gives my naturally curly, graying hair that silky feeling (close to post haircut). The 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the amount of product I have to put in to get the effect. Also it doesn&#x27;t do much for the frizz. Nonetheless, it does better than the majority of products out there.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair products ever. I never could be disappointed with this purchase. One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Love everything Biolage!</li>
            <li> great for dry and treated hair.  Adds moisture and shine.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but it is worth it.  Salon quality!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome.  It&#x27;s the only thing that makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner for dry/flaky hair. My hair and scalp is less dry after just 3 uses. Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes deeply without weighing hair down. It smells great, too! I have hair that dries out on the ends but gets greasy at the roots, and this conditioner works great for me.</li>
            <li> My hair greases easily (I have to wash it almost everyday to keep the grease out), but it also dries out easily as well. I have to do a lot of straitening to my hair, specifically my bangs because I have a cowlick that curls my hair up in one spot, though the rest of my hair is pretty straight. Though this conditioner doesn&#x27;t help enough with all the damage I get from straitening, it still moisturizes the rest of my hair (making it silky smooth) without leaving it greasy at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of other salon-grade products, and this is a bit pricey. Personally, I think it is a good deal when I can find it on sale, but I will still always try to buy this over any department store conditioners.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great. It gets all the knots out of my hair. I usually buy it from drugstore but Amazon had a good price.</li>
            <li> I find all Biolage products to be gentle on the hair and very high quality; an opinion shared by my professional hairstylist.  I would have given this product five stars but I personally find it slightly difficult to entirely remove.  It takes extra rinsing before one doesn&#x27;t feel the excess product in the hair.  Perhaps that&#x27;s my own fault and I&#x27;m using too much...</li>
            <li> Best cream rinse I&#x27;ve ever used. Works great even on my colored hair. I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested I try the Matrix shampoo and conditioner...I am so glad/ happy that i have.  after every shampoo my hair is shinny and  fresh smelling.. I do not dye my hair, however, I usually get a Perm 2x a year-- so my hair tends to be dry, also from using the curling brush. For the First time in Years--- my hair is SHINNY- and soft.-- I love it!!! I guarantee I will be using Matrix shampoo and conditioner for many years, just  like my  friend , that recommend this.  This is the BEST!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dorothy</li>
            <li> I really like it does make my thick and dry hair look so much better , I also have highlight done on my hair ever three month so the balm does a nice work conditioning my hair :-)</li>
            <li> I had my hair lightened and highlighted, then had to dye it brown three times to get it back to its natural color.  My hair was in bad condition, very dry and rough.  I found Matrix conditioning balm at walmart for a bit higher price, and loved it.  My hair is now soft, shiny with no trace of damage.  It also does not weigh hair down, which is important to me since im prone to oily roots.  I definitely recommend for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I like to color my hair on a regular basis, however after years of processing my hair, it became dull, dry, and hard to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried lots of high end hair care products with minimal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I found this one for almost $20.00 at a local super center, I figured what the hell... and gave it a try. The scent was what drew me in initially, with a very gorgeous musky fragrance that is both thick yet light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hoped the scent would stay, if anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of just a lovely scented scalp, I was left with the best results any conditioner has ever given me before. Biolage Hydratherapie Conditioning Balm by Matrix literally transformed my dull and dry damaged hair into hair that did not even feel like it was my own! My hair was left shiny, manageable, full of healthy moisture, and it was soft and silky. No frizz, no puff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this one is now the only conditioner I will buy. It was sooo worth the splurge as I would have spent far more on cheap products trying to achieve the same results.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product several times online.  I can always find it and it is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing! I am not able to use conditioners since I have fine hair but this does not weigh down my fair and I am able to use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Really, really helps with frizzy hair, and I have tried everything. I use it as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This will leave the dryest of hair silky and allow for movement. I love this product. The scent isnt as great as the shampoo but still love it and the price is awesome. Will order again!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and it&#x27;s still the best.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years--I am 65 and have long gray hair. It helps keep my hair soft and shiny, rather than wiry, like most gray hair. And this supplier is no more expensive than the salon price, and I don&#x27;t have to travel to get it!</li>
            <li> Think the formula changed.  No longer works as well as it used to.</li>
            <li> this is one of two products that leaves my hair feeling nourished and not weighed down after rinsing</li>
            <li> great! love this product!</li>
            <li> Using this product for years and still love it. I do not think everyone loves it (my wife for example) but I am pleased that the product has not changed in years like many hair products seem to do.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is one of the best I have tried. Noticeably fewer split ends in my hair.</li>
            <li> Wow what a great price!!!!  Arrived quickly. I have been using this product off and on for 15 years now.  I alternate between this and a cheaper conditioner to stretch my dollar. The effect of this product on my hair is noticeable after just one use. Less breakage, shinier, and more manageable are just a few of the benefits.  My favorite part of this conditioner though has to be the fantastic scent.</li>
