            <li>It is not my favorite Fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>_ Do not stay in clothing for more than a quarter of an hour</li>
            <li>and I was glad to order this item.</li>
            <li>Sexy smells gd</li>
            <li>, I feel soo sexy wearing this cologne</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I like smell of this at mosque the sows love to sniff my schlonger.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is AMAZING and the seller wrapped this so securely it could have withstood a typhoon.</li>
            <li>Simply the best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I have purchased cheaper colognes that smell better</li>
            <li>We will be purchasing many more fragrances from this quality company</li>
            <li>But it is more like body spray than cologne.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge though</li>
            <li>Great product definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Nice price for the real thing.</li>
            <li>smells great and last along time</li>
            <li>original quality.</li>
            <li>Great Smell and seller delivered ontime and as expected.</li>
            <li>It is not overpowering and smells sweet.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, great price for such a LARGE bottle!</li>
            <li>Excellent scent, last long time.</li>
            <li>strong and last all day, top class in my book.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m happy overall with it and will occasionally have people tell me that they enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Great smell clone and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I often have allergic reactions to deodorants (even Dove&#x27;s Sensitive Clean Comfort deodorant).</li>
            <li>we were surprised at how quickly the item came and it iS exactly as called.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very potent for first 4 hours or so and subtle for another 4-5 hours after.</li>
            <li>The next day I developed a sore throat--this may be a coincidence, but I rarely have sore throats in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note: You can not return colognes and perfumes, even if it&#x27;s purchased through an Amazon seller or fullfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very masculine scent, would recommend.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge so it should last a very long time and the scent with just two sprays lasts all day.</li>
            <li>so tried this and was really pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>the fragance dont last 30 minutes very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Scent seems to last for a decent time frame.</li>
            <li>not sure this is original</li>

            <li> Compliments all the time!!!</li>
            <li> I often have allergic reactions to deodorants (even Dove&#x27;s Sensitive Clean Comfort deodorant). This smelled like a deodorant spray (which I can&#x27;t stand) and gave me a rash. The next day I developed a sore throat--this may be a coincidence, but I rarely have sore throats in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note: You can not return colognes and perfumes, even if it&#x27;s purchased through an Amazon seller or fullfilled by Amazon. I&#x27;ve been in contact with customer service and they seem to be helpful.</li>
            <li> not sure this is original</li>

            <li> I love this product. The bottle is huge so it should last a very long time and the scent with just two sprays lasts all day. It also smells amazing. This is a scent that should attract no complaints. Only compliments. It is not overpowering and smells sweet. Great product at a great price.</li>
