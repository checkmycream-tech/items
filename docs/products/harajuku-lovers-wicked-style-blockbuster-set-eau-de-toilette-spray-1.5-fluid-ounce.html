            <li>Excellent, Bigger than describe (better)...</li>
            <li>and/or who love Stefani&#x27;s perfumes.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love all the Harajuku fragrances except one.  </li>
            <li>Product is adorable</li>
            <li>I love all of the Harajuku perfumes.</li>
            <li>and I love the box.</li>
            <li>omg this is so cute</li>
            <li>it was way cute</li>
            <li>I show this to my friends and all of them ask me where I got it and want one cause its so cute</li>
            <li>Love it, so cute and nice and the fragrance is sweet.</li>
            <li>The box is cool and the different scents are awesome.</li>
            <li>Purchased as gifts:  21 year old neice thought they were cute but actually loved the fragrances after she tried them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger than I thought and the fragances smell great.</li>
            <li>overall a pretty good product just wish they made the display box more durable.</li>
            <li>The true size of the Box is (10x10x4).  </li>
            <li>I was going to give it to my granddaughter, but I love it so much</li>
            <li>The girls are soo super sweet &amp; smell sooo</li>
            <li>I also gave set to a 10 year old neice who said she loved them and was only going to wear them on very special and fancy occasions.</li>
            <li>it light weight it opens in both sides well pack and way fast</li>
            <li>I love the old version of Harajuku lovers.  </li>
            <li>and it was received with very much excitement.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I feel like they have been improved from the first presentation or maybe is the &amp;#34;wicked style&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I personally really like 4 out of 5 of the sents and really would have never guessed which ones before buying this set.</li>
            <li>Very summery scents.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m using the whole mini mall as a perfume boot</li>
            <li>Love what someone else said about using it for nail polish or lipstick late, but I plan to leave the girls in place for full effect.</li>
            <li>I adore the little figurines on top of each one.</li>
            <li>And the little box makes a great little doll-house/ carrying case for a child!</li>
            <li>I love the perfume set its like a small suite case that I just wanted to get it cause</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 14 yr old daughter....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cool for storage and display of lipsticks or small nail polish bottles along with the perfums bottles.</li>
            <li>only complaint I may have is that the display box despite it being appropriate for the perfumes visual aesthetics; it was very fragile.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect gift  for any girl , she will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li>If I could I&#x27;d buy a spare as I just know that when my daughter gets a little older, she&#x27;ll be raiding this to play with!</li>

            <li> ; wide; each door is 2&amp;#34; wide with two floors 5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and as I have 2 granddaughters, it is a little cost-prohibitive to buy two of them.  </li>
            <li> , exact measurements of the mall are: 10&amp;#34; tall and 10&amp;#34; wide, base floor 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> your self or as a gift you will not go wrong with this one</li>

            <li> Excellent, Bigger than describe (better)... Is a very nice case, I recommend it to everyone.  The true size of the Box is (10x10x4).  It&#x27;s a very nice gift.</li>
            <li> Very cute and good variety. I personally really like 4 out of 5 of the sents and really would have never guessed which ones before buying this set. Plus, likeing 4 out of 5 makes the set cheeper than buying then individually.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t help it, I&#x27;m hooked on the Harajuku Lovers Room Sets (I also have the house). This is great, like feeding your childhood joy of dolls houses in a grown up perfume kind of way! A perfect gift for any girl/woman who used to enjoy her dollhouses and/or who love Stefani&#x27;s perfumes. The fragrances are very fresh, the costumes are delightful.If I could I&#x27;d buy a spare as I just know that when my daughter gets a little older, she&#x27;ll be raiding this to play with!</li>

            <li> everything darn near perfect. the perfumes themselves and the quality of them was spot on as well as the display box that came with it. only complaint I may have is that the display box despite it being appropriate for the perfumes visual aesthetics; it was very fragile. the corners began to start to peel off and I had to seal it with glue. overall a pretty good product just wish they made the display box more durable.</li>
            <li> *Product is adorable&lt;br /&gt;*Fast shipping &amp; great packing$&lt;br /&gt;$Cost Wonderful considering how exspensive  Gwens girls are by them self &amp; in sets it is a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;* The girls are soo super sweet &amp; smell sooo fab.&lt;br /&gt;*The display is a styling work of art.&lt;br /&gt;*For your self or as a gift you will not go wrong with this one</li>

            <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this set for long time and at last I found it!! It&#x27;s bigger than I thought and the fragances smell great. In fact, I feel like they have been improved from the first presentation or maybe is the &amp;#34;wicked style&amp;#34; hint on them. Because I collect  dolls, I removed them from the bottles and I&#x27;m using the whole mini mall as a perfume boot, exact measurements of the mall are: 10&amp;#34; tall and 10&amp;#34; wide, base floor 2&amp;#34; wide; each door is 2&amp;#34; wide with two floors 5&amp;#34; tall each. It&#x27;s really cool for storage and display of lipsticks or small nail polish bottles along with the perfums bottles. Truly an amazing gift (to anyone or yourself).</li>
