            <li>The price is amazingly affordable .</li>
            <li>Was bought for a gift for someone, they said they liked it</li>
            <li>Excellent product, that&#x27;s really works.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice and relaxing...not sticky like most products in this category...</li>
            <li>it needs a much better scent....</li>
            <li>This is the first time me using this cream and the result is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love the cooling feeling I get at the end of the massage with this product...</li>
            <li>got here fast great service thank you</li>
            <li>Okay, so yes, I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li>I applied the product around arm pit area, all over stomach and on my sides mostly.</li>
            <li>but it would work better with exercise</li>
            <li>and my skin feels more smooth.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend to others.</li>
            <li>Its more of an aid and it does leave the skin smooth and has a minty scent not bad.</li>
            <li>This stuff really work I love it!</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to purchase this amazing product :)</li>
            <li>This product is ok, it smells great and absorbs well into the skin, but I didn&#x27;t see an improvement after 3 weeks, Not sure if I would get this again.</li>
            <li>But this cream gives an extra push to looking good.</li>
            <li>It feels tingly when put on almost a cool feeling?</li>
            <li>Thank you for sending it to me as quickly as you did.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different ones!  </li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t measure the exact amount of days I used it</li>
            <li>I use this cream in the morning (after washing my whole stomach area including the sides with warm water, then pat dry)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying the 2nd tube a lot more liberally than the first (almost twice as much as I used the first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>some more finding parabens were also found in male breast cancer patients, now this alarmed me because I&#x27;m applying this to my stomach and underarms which are VERY close to my moobs (man boobs)</li>
            <li>This stuff really works if you are consistent with it.  </li>
            <li>oh btw I received 2 bottles 1 for sensitive skin and 1 for full strength.</li>
            <li>It was very embarrassing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any tightening of the skin nor disappearance of cellulite (and yes I do have some on my stomach).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a different stretch mark cream (a paraben free one) that I will begin using as soon as I use up this tube.</li>
            <li>If this cream was paraben free I would have added another star, and if it had tightened skin and reduced my cellulite it would have got a solid 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I really like this line of products.</li>
            <li>your butt really looks</li>
            <li>The smell is hard to pin down, to me it smells kind of like Coors Light or a cheap table wine.</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first few days and its cheap!</li>
            <li>It actually firms skin and tightens body, but it doesn&#x27;t work for stretch mark, my tighs look smaller but my stretch marks do not look any better</li>
            <li>I love the tingling it has and made my stomach feel a little tighter after each use.</li>
            <li>each time I use this cream, which is normal.</li>
            <li>However (I am a little more than halfway through my 2nd tube)</li>
            <li>I use it everyday faithfully and have noticed a huge change, I will always use this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if maybe its too early</li>
            <li>I use the same quarter size amount and rub it on the whole area of the stomach.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 2 weeks so far</li>
            <li>So as far as showing no fatty areas.</li>
            <li>I will use the whole bottle and get back with you.</li>
            <li>This cream didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin and offers a cooling sensation.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any improvement in stretch marks since the use of this second tube.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking this product has done about as much as it can possibly do.</li>
            <li>I really like this product second time ordering.</li>
            <li>It helped a little with cellulite but nothing significant.</li>
            <li>Have used this product along with other Eveline anti-cellulite products - a decent result - as much as you can expect of a cream in fighting internal issues of your body.</li>
            <li>The others like :Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Serum Shaping Waist, Abdomen and Buttocks and Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Cellulite Serum gave great results.</li>
            <li>I definitely felt a difference with firmness though not sure about the slimming part, which is fine.</li>
            <li>The small of these is like mint and stays in your body for a while, so not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>This item is not like the other ones, it is a more slow process.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I ordered this along with some other lotions offering the same effects.</li>
            <li> As any other brand, this one needs regularity and frequency of application for you to actually see the difference.</li>
            <li> I will also make it a point to avoid paraben products in the future or at least ones that are applied near or to my \\&quot;chest area\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> this product only worked a little for me.  </li>
            <li> I did not achieve the desired results that I expected.</li>
            <li> A little thick - I much prefer their other products.</li>
            <li> I began looking for other stretch mark solutions and found other creams stating \\&quot;Paraben</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than I thought it would be.i can&#x27;t wait to try the other products that go along with it</li>
            <li> This product smells so bad on your skin, you can not wear it long enough to see if it can really work.  </li>
            <li> I felt a cooling sensation that last at least 10-15 min.</li>
            <li> No exercise at all simply through portion control and healthier food choices, therefore stretch marks have been a problem as of late.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been losing weight like crazy, I&#x27;ve lost nearly 30 lbs in about 3-4 months time.</li>
            <li> So I prefer the previous ones.</li>
            <li> I rub a bunch on and wrap my stomach up for a few hours with a binder and when it drys in slimmer..</li>
            <li> I used it everyday for a year.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> skinny...can&#x27;t say that, but it does firm up our skin and that is noticable.</li>
            <li> This is the type of product that you must use everyday in order to see results, although i dont use this everyday i have noticed it does tone and tighten</li>
            <li> but Im not sure what to think about this product yet.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it does yet.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> I became addicted to the cooling sensation it caused after application.</li>
            <li> Disappointed to day the least.</li>
            <li> The few times I wore it during the day everyone mentioned how terrible the smell was.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff really work I love it! I rub a bunch on and wrap my stomach up for a few hours with a binder and when it drys in slimmer.. Especially gd for the saggy mommy tummy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> This product smells so bad on your skin, you can not wear it long enough to see if it can really work.  The few times I wore it during the day everyone mentioned how terrible the smell was. It was very embarrassing. I wore it at night hoping to see if it made a difference....nothing noticeable.    I would not recommenend to anyone....it needs a much better scent....maybe baby powder or floral.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with some other lotions offering the same effects. I don&#x27;t know if maybe its too early but Im not sure what to think about this product yet. Thank you for sending it to me as quickly as you did.</li>
            <li> This is the first time me using this cream and the result is amazing! I use this cream in the morning (after washing my whole stomach area including the sides with warm water, then pat dry)  before I do my 15 min. exercise 4x a week. Then, before going to to bed I use the same quarter size amount and rub it on the whole area of the stomach. I felt a cooling sensation that last at least 10-15 min. each time I use this cream, which is normal. That when you know it working. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 2 weeks so far and I feel and see the firming of the stomach. I wanted to work on the little baby fat off near the pouch area. Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> I can definitely see results after just two uses! Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love the cooling feeling I get at the end of the massage with this product... It feels nice and relaxing...not sticky like most products in this category...&lt;br /&gt;I will  definitely continue using it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different ones!  I saw results within the first few days and its cheap! I will definitely continue to purchase this amazing product :)</li>
            <li> this product only worked a little for me.  I had to use it several times a day.  I love the tingling it has and made my stomach feel a little tighter after each use.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in conjunction with exercises and compression sleep tights.</li>
            <li> i believe it does work!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 7 days. So as far as showing no fatty areas. or Cellulite reduction. i cant say for sure yet! but it does smell good. and my skin feels more smooth. I will use the whole bottle and get back with you. oh btw I received 2 bottles 1 for sensitive skin and 1 for full strength. got here fast great service thank you</li>
            <li> this cream is doing a good work...cellulite is visibly reducing...</li>
            <li> This stuff really works if you are consistent with it.  I use it everyday faithfully and have noticed a huge change, I will always use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for 2weeks and I can already tell a difference in my stretch marks. And my skin it starting to tone but of course will take longer to do.</li>
            <li> This cream didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin and offers a cooling sensation. I did not like the scent, however, and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> all 3 products are excellent thank u</li>
            <li> Okay, so yes, I&#x27;m a guy and I bought and used this product. I actually bought two tubes of it. I&#x27;ve recently been losing weight like crazy, I&#x27;ve lost nearly 30 lbs in about 3-4 months time. No exercise at all simply through portion control and healthier food choices, therefore stretch marks have been a problem as of late. Tube one lasted about a month, I didn&#x27;t measure the exact amount of days I used it but I did however use it religiously (once in morning after shower and once before bed every night) I became addicted to the cooling sensation it caused after application. (which lasts about 15-20 mins) I haven&#x27;t really noticed any tightening of the skin nor disappearance of cellulite (and yes I do have some on my stomach). The smell is hard to pin down, to me it smells kind of like Coors Light or a cheap table wine. The scent does not last that long, an hour after application I don&#x27;t recall smelling it at all. I applied the product around arm pit area, all over stomach and on my sides mostly. There was noticeable fading to the all stretch marks the cream was applied to. However (I am a little more than halfway through my 2nd tube) I haven&#x27;t really noticed any improvement in stretch marks since the use of this second tube. I&#x27;m thinking this product has done about as much as it can possibly do. I&#x27;ve been applying the 2nd tube a lot more liberally than the first (almost twice as much as I used the first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I began looking for other stretch mark solutions and found other creams stating \\&quot;Paraben Free\\&quot; I had never looked into what parabens are or why they are \\&quot;bad\\&quot;. For those that don&#x27;t know basically what I found is parabens are a preservative used in lotions and cream to keep them from getting moldy, some studies are linking parabens to cancer. I read into it some more finding parabens were also found in male breast cancer patients, now this alarmed me because I&#x27;m applying this to my stomach and underarms which are VERY close to my moobs (man boobs) anda couple times I did actually apply the product to my moobs, I&#x27;m kicking myself for that now. So anyway after finding out what I did about parabens I&#x27;ve bought a different stretch mark cream (a paraben free one) that I will begin using as soon as I use up this tube. I will also make it a point to avoid paraben products in the future or at least ones that are applied near or to my \\&quot;chest area\\&quot;. If this cream was paraben free I would have added another star, and if it had tightened skin and reduced my cellulite it would have got a solid 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I really like this product second time ordering.</li>
            <li> Have used this product along with other Eveline anti-cellulite products - a decent result - as much as you can expect of a cream in fighting internal issues of your body. As any other brand, this one needs regularity and frequency of application for you to actually see the difference. If I am not mistaken this cream can give your skin a feeling of heat/cold when applied.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday for a year. It helped a little with cellulite but nothing significant. I did not achieve the desired results that I expected.</li>
            <li> Feel good to use it at summer time. But don&#x27;t see the different yet.</li>
            <li> It actually firms skin and tightens body, but it doesn&#x27;t work for stretch mark, my tighs look smaller but my stretch marks do not look any better</li>
            <li> I have ordered 3 of these different slim creams. This item is not like the other ones, it is a more slow process. The others like :Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Serum Shaping Waist, Abdomen and Buttocks and Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Cellulite Serum gave great results. The reason why I bought this one is because it says thermal body shaping. The small of these is like mint and stays in your body for a while, so not crazy about the scent. So I prefer the previous ones.</li>
            <li> A little thick - I much prefer their other products.</li>
            <li> Was bought for a gift for someone, they said they liked it</li>
            <li> Did not work! Smelly it did not help with my cellulites at all! Tsk tsk tsk. Disappointed to day the least.</li>
            <li> I really like this line of products. This 1 does what it says, I can&#x27;t promise lasting effects or it don&#x27;t. not without continued use. But it smells good when appled. Non staining. And works. So great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, that&#x27;s really works.  Used it before great results were noticed. I strongly recommend to others. Will definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> No good. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> When I started using the cream, I was like what it is going to do, how will I look when it dries.  After the next, I noticed a difference in my thighs.  Does it work, I can say yes. Does it ake ou skinny...can&#x27;t say that, but it does firm up our skin and that is noticable.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it does yet. I have only used it for one week. Ask me later.</li>
            <li> Does not do what it suggests and also causes the skin to feel itchy.</li>
            <li> I like it feels good on my skin</li>
            <li> I am truly loving this cream! I swear I can already feel it starting to work. The price is amazingly affordable . Shipping was faster than I thought it would be.i can&#x27;t wait to try the other products that go along with it and Amazon.com carries them all.</li>
            <li> makes your skin very smooth!</li>
            <li> This product is ok, it smells great and absorbs well into the skin, but I didn&#x27;t see an improvement after 3 weeks, Not sure if I would get this again.</li>
            <li> Yes thank you I have not used it like I should but seems to work</li>
            <li> This is the type of product that you must use everyday in order to see results, although i dont use this everyday i have noticed it does tone and tighten but it would work better with exercise so dont expect a big change using this alone. Its more of an aid and it does leave the skin smooth and has a minty scent not bad.</li>
            <li> This cream works.  When my husband said \\&quot;Hey Hunny your butt really looks nice\\&quot;  I knew this was working.  I also hike 2 miles a day 5 days a week.  But this cream gives an extra push to looking good.</li>
            <li> I definitely felt a difference with firmness though not sure about the slimming part, which is fine. It feels tingly when put on almost a cool feeling? Which I wasn&#x27;t expecting lol but it wasn&#x27;t too bad. I may use it again since it did seem to reduce strech marks and cellulite for me personally.</li>
