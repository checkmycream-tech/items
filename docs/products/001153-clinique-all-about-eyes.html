            <li>This stuff works great</li>

            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice product.</li>
            <li>It has made a nice difference in the appearance of my under eye area, not to mention how great it feels, not too greasy.  </li>
            <li>Amazon always has a good price.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with how quickly the purchased arrived.  </li>
            <li>I use it morning and night, and it&#x27;s doing a great job to keep my eye area very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this eye cream!</li>
            <li>My sister recommended this eye cream to me, and I&#x27;m glad she did!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!!!!</li>
            <li>It was not as nice as what I got from the Clinique counter</li>
            <li>This clinique product is reliable and effective.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m more prone to these kind of things.</li>
            <li>I think there are better and cheaper creams out there.</li>
            <li>And I think my eyes look better now without makeup unlike before that</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is why i love it, as i wear a lot of eye make</li>
            <li>So in my opinion that is the better deal.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>My favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li>Love this Clinique Eye Cream.  </li>
            <li>This cream feels so luxurious and smooth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more oily than I was expecting and takes a while to absorb, but it works as advertised.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It is very rich</li>
            <li>I bought it to treat fine lines but the side effects are too many</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this was at the duty free shop in Puerto Rico and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Helps your makeup look more flawless, not sure it reduces puffiness the verdict is still pending on that.</li>
            <li>but if you spend $50 you get free shipping, plus two free make up trails.  </li>
            <li>I do enjoy using it, but I enjoy all the clinique products I use.</li>
            <li>Still testing it, but I like the smooth silky feeling.</li>
            <li>I have sure the whole jar; it makes under eyes and around eyes very nice and soft, but does not deliver any results it says on box.</li>
            <li>I have tried many (many, many, MANY) eye creams, but think I finally stumbled upon the one that&#x27;s just right for me.</li>
            <li>but I still had bags and significant puffiness.</li>
            <li>Just right!  </li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Upon first use, I was concerned that it didn&#x27;t soak in fast (or fully) enough for my liking - if you need to apply makeup right away, this might not be the best choice.</li>
            <li>Love this cream - made lines around my eyes better instantly!</li>
            <li>It was as described and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Works great for dark circles.  </li>
            <li>When I spent $53 dollars at Clinique.com and got the eye cream, a nice blush, and two free trail size items.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream is great because it absorbs fast unlike other creams that are greasy.</li>
            <li>I could not give 5 stars to this product because although its really good, it is really &amp;#34;drippy&amp;#34; and it takes some time to dry.  </li>
            <li>nothing can for my dark circles except a good concealer)&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s certainly doing it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately at 88, it no longer does a thing for me.  </li>
            <li>This is despicable if not illegal.</li>
            <li>My first online cosmetic purchase.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>If you buy for them, just be aware of that is was part of a gift set....</li>
            <li>Gets rid of puffiness first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating!  </li>
            <li>It is fresh and very watery.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It was purchased for a man and he absolutely loves this eye cream!  </li>
            <li>The product is smaller than I expected but still a great product.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it felt like I was putting pure silk on my eye area.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and the product is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Worth 20 bucks considering the normal retail value.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is very moisturizing and does not sting/tingle even when I apply it where eyeliners go.</li>
            <li>the product, it moisturizes well without being overly greasy, reduces puffiness to an extent, but doesn&#x27;t do much with circles.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do much else.</li>
            <li>Well this cream didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li>I am not sure which was the good product and which was the old product.</li>
            <li>and I found that sometimes my eyes were worse for using it, especially through the night, but so far Clinique has been nothing but great!</li>
            <li>And if I don&#x27;t use eye cream, my top eyelid along the lash line have dry and flaky skin in the winter, which is impossible to fix with make up and most moisturizer, even most eye creams, stings when you apply it along the lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>,it is very damp,and it suits young woman.</li>
            <li>The area also tends to get really taut and sensitive.</li>
            <li>If I use it during fall/summer/spring, it feels very greasy and I get tiny bumps from too much eye grease/oily</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not magic, it won&#x27;t magically change my genetics</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommend if you have dry skin, or dry combo, or most eye cream irritates you.</li>
            <li>its also an excellent one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just personally like the richness of this cream - and pls note that i dont mean heavy rich.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant texture, thin enough to apply comfortably, but thick enough to feel rich and soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs completely and makes my skin feel moisturized and pampered.</li>
            <li>Box and jar were completely in tact like purchased from a dept store.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of Clinique All About Eyes a few months back and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it if you are in your early twenties or younger, with sensitive skin and often puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dark undereye circles that are prone to puffiness in the mornings, so I am hopeful that long-term use of this cream will help to diminish both of those.  </li>
            <li>I have very puffy under-eyes due to severe allergies.</li>
            <li>not depuff (have not tried in the fridge), small effect on lines and dark circle (same as any other good eye</li>
            <li>The first time it took the puffiness around my eyes down, the second time it took longer to do that.</li>
            <li>The previous eye-cream I used was a little too strong</li>
            <li>and though it won&#x27;t magically change your skin&#x27;s tendency toward circles or puffiness, it will lessen them and keep the area looking much brighter and healthier, and get rid of that unpleasant stretched-too-tight feeling.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for black circles or puffines, so I probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>

            <li> Once you get the hang of it though, its fabulous and will have your eyes looking less puffy and rejuvinated after just a few uses!</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if it needs to be stored or shipped a certain way.</li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> this eye cream moisturizes extremely well and prevents age lines from sun, general environment exposure and lots of make</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have dark circles but when I use this cream, the skin around my eyes becomes really really pale and puffy.</li>
            <li> I have oily combination skin, with dry cheeks in the winter.</li>
            <li> I am 30 and have pesky, constant dark under-eye circles, even when I&#x27;m not overtired.</li>
            <li> But I discovered that the lingering sheen is actually a plus - it brightens the eye area and helps deflect attention from dark circles and/or puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I do see a difference, I&#x27;ve always had dark circles and puffy eyes due to genetics and after using this cream 2x daily for two weeks</li>
            <li> Also, use ONLY a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I used to have Shisheido moisture recharge for my eyes, but I was curious to try something else.</li>
            <li> So, even though this is expensive for me;  I think that it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs immediately and makes my make up last as it provides a great base for it, and i do wear a lot of dramatic eye make up, esp</li>
            <li> the other products are serum-like and &#x27;lighter&#x27;, so if you feel you dont want a creamy feel then go for Clarins,</li>
            <li> , it will not make your dark circles disappear, (</li>
            <li> I still have dark circles</li>
            <li> Not worth the money and did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I have bought this previously on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> but they are noticeably lighter and my eyes are less puffy.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few, like body shop and clarins, and this one is my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply this stuff in the morning and let it dry before applying my make up and within minutes I can see a dramatic improvement.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it this is the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Each time I use this at night, I wake up feeling like my eyes are very heavy.  </li>
            <li> If you use it, put it on at least 30 minutes before your makeup or your makeup will just slide off.  </li>
            <li> Not as thick as what I&#x27;ve had before</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical but no (obvious) harm was done</li>
            <li> and I am a few months shy of 31</li>
            <li> , I stopped using it for a while and the circles under my eyes seemed to get worse...</li>
            <li> I WAS SENT THE WRONG PRODUCT</li>
            <li> (I do, however, suspect it would make a helpful base for powder eye shadows.)</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re under 65, this eye cream works great.  Unfortunately at 88, it no longer does a thing for me.  But the cream worked well before.</li>
            <li> Last a long time. It is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I used to have Shisheido moisture recharge for my eyes, but I was curious to try something else. This eye cream is great because it absorbs fast unlike other creams that are greasy. And I think my eyes look better now without makeup unlike before that I need to use concealer every time I go out.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Clinique All About Eyes a few months back and fell in love with it.  It has made a nice difference in the appearance of my under eye area, not to mention how great it feels, not too greasy.  Just right!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered the \\&quot;All about eyes\\&quot; cream by Clinique from this seller. I had used the cream for 15 years and when I received my order from \\&quot;BeautiEncounters&#x27; I applied the cream to my eyes, as I have done for years, but this time my eyes started to burn and the area around my eyes turned red. I contacted the seller to tell them that I don&#x27;t know what is in the jar, but I do know it&#x27;s not all about eyes, the cream I have used for 15 years. 4 Days later I received a response saying that they \\&quot;Tested\\&quot; the cream and found that it was tampered with. They are sending out some cream and selling it as name brand creams. This is despicable if not illegal.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few, like body shop and clarins, and this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;No, it will not make your dark circles disappear, (nothing can for my dark circles except a good concealer)&lt;br /&gt;but this eye cream moisturizes extremely well and prevents age lines from sun, general environment exposure and lots of make up!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why i love it, as i wear a lot of eye make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the other products are serum-like and &#x27;lighter&#x27;, so if you feel you dont want a creamy feel then go for Clarins, its also an excellent one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just personally like the richness of this cream - and pls note that i dont mean heavy rich.&lt;br /&gt; It absorbs immediately and makes my make up last as it provides a great base for it, and i do wear a lot of dramatic eye make up, esp the smokey eye look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have oily combination skin, with dry cheeks in the winter. And if I don&#x27;t use eye cream, my top eyelid along the lash line have dry and flaky skin in the winter, which is impossible to fix with make up and most moisturizer, even most eye creams, stings when you apply it along the lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this one. This is very moisturizing and does not sting/tingle even when I apply it where eyeliners go. It feels like velvet going on. It is very rich so I only use it in the winter. If I use it during fall/summer/spring, it feels very greasy and I get tiny bumps from too much eye grease/oily stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not depuff (have not tried in the fridge), small effect on lines and dark circle (same as any other good eye cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend if you have dry skin, or dry combo, or most eye cream irritates you.</li>
            <li> I have very puffy under-eyes due to severe allergies. I apply this stuff in the morning and let it dry before applying my make up and within minutes I can see a dramatic improvement.  I have bought all kinds of eye creams from the drug store and none of them have ever worked like this one. So, even though this is expensive for me;  I think that it is worth it. I have bought this previously on Amazon.com. However this time, I choose to buy mine from Clinique.com.  It is $29 there but if you spend $50 you get free shipping, plus two free make up trails.  Since, this is not eligible for prime shipping, it was almost $40.  When I spent $53 dollars at Clinique.com and got the eye cream, a nice blush, and two free trail size items.  So in my opinion that is the better deal.</li>
            <li> It was not as nice as what I got from the Clinique counter</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect nor did I get a miracle. But I do see a difference, I&#x27;ve always had dark circles and puffy eyes due to genetics and after using this cream 2x daily for two weeks I still have dark circles but they are noticeably lighter and my eyes are less puffy. It&#x27;s not magic, it won&#x27;t magically change my genetics but I do see results and I never have so I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this was at the duty free shop in Puerto Rico and I loved it. The last time I bought it was through Amazon and the texture was different. I am not sure which was the good product and which was the old product. The first time it took the puffiness around my eyes down, the second time it took longer to do that. I believe in the product but I am not sure if it needs to be stored or shipped a certain way.</li>
            <li> My first online cosmetic purchase. I was very skeptical but no (obvious) harm was done and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this and store purchased ones. I see mixed reviews on this seller though, so I wonder if there are multiple suppliers and you just get lucky/unlucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product, it moisturizes well without being overly greasy, reduces puffiness to an extent, but doesn&#x27;t do much with circles. I&#x27;d recommend it if you are in your early twenties or younger, with sensitive skin and often puffy eyes. It does the basics well but it doesn&#x27;t do much else.</li>
            <li> I have sure the whole jar; it makes under eyes and around eyes very nice and soft, but does not deliver any results it says on box. Not sure it this is the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love this cream - made lines around my eyes better instantly!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the purchase. It was as described and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I had reached the end of the jar I had purchased from the mall, and it was cheaper to order a \\&quot;refill\\&quot; online, so I did.  I was very happy with how quickly the purchased arrived.  It was exactly what I ordered.  And from the fact I constantly get carded and I am a few months shy of 31, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s certainly doing it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li> Seller was great as well as the product!</li>
            <li> The product is smaller than I expected but still a great product. Worth 20 bucks considering the normal retail value.</li>
            <li> I could not give 5 stars to this product because although its really good, it is really &amp;#34;drippy&amp;#34; and it takes some time to dry.  If you use it, put it on at least 30 minutes before your makeup or your makeup will just slide off.  My suggestion is to use it at night time.  Then it works perfectly!  Also, use ONLY a little bit.  It will drip into your eyes otherwise.  Once you get the hang of it though, its fabulous and will have your eyes looking less puffy and rejuvinated after just a few uses!</li>
            <li> In the botton of my jar it was written NOT FOR SALE... When I asked the seller they replied saying the marking of &amp;#34;not for sale&amp;#34; is because this item was sourced through &amp;#34;Gift with Purchase&amp;#34;.  If you buy for them, just be aware of that is was part of a gift set....</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream! It absorbs completely and makes my skin feel moisturized and pampered. Amazon always has a good price. Box and jar were completely in tact like purchased from a dept store.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye cream. Delivery was fast and the product is exactly what I was expecting. Gets rid of puffiness first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> Love this Clinique Eye Cream.  Works great for dark circles.  This eye cream is a keeper and something I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> this is a quality product with great results. This is one of those skincare products where you need to figure you get what you pay for; and do!</li>
            <li> I like the results of this cream but was concern that the jar was not sealed when I got it.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this eye cream to me, and I&#x27;m glad she did!  The first time I used it it felt like I was putting pure silk on my eye area.  It&#x27;s very hydrating!  I use it morning and night, and it&#x27;s doing a great job to keep my eye area very smooth.  I have pretty dark undereye circles that are prone to puffiness in the mornings, so I am hopeful that long-term use of this cream will help to diminish both of those.  The previous eye-cream I used was a little too strong and I found that sometimes my eyes were worse for using it, especially through the night, but so far Clinique has been nothing but great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice product. I do enjoy using it, but I enjoy all the clinique products I use.</li>
            <li> Not as thick as what I&#x27;ve had before</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have dark circles but when I use this cream, the skin around my eyes becomes really really pale and puffy. I bought it to treat fine lines but the side effects are too many so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Well this cream didn&#x27;t work very well for me. It will keep the area around my eyes moistured during the summer, but it&#x27;s not enough during the winter.In fact as weather gets colder my skin gets drier and I can feel it burn everytime i put this on. It didn&#x27;t do much for black circles or puffines, so I probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work too well for me.  It actually made me break out under my eyes.  I have very sensitive skin so I&#x27;m more prone to these kind of things.</li>
            <li> This cream feels so luxurious and smooth! I&#x27;ve been using it for years now. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I like it,it is very damp,and it suits young woman.It is fresh and very watery. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This clinique product is reliable and effective.  I purchased it at lower cost than at my local department store. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product.  It was purchased for a man and he absolutely loves this eye cream!  He says it makes a world of difference with his under eye circles.</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle-in-a-jar wrinkle-reducing eye cream. That said, it has turned out to be PERFECT for my needs. I am 30 and have pesky, constant dark under-eye circles, even when I&#x27;m not overtired. The area also tends to get really taut and sensitive. I have tried many (many, many, MANY) eye creams, but think I finally stumbled upon the one that&#x27;s just right for me. It&#x27;s a pleasant texture, thin enough to apply comfortably, but thick enough to feel rich and soothing to the skin. Upon first use, I was concerned that it didn&#x27;t soak in fast (or fully) enough for my liking - if you need to apply makeup right away, this might not be the best choice. (I do, however, suspect it would make a helpful base for powder eye shadows.) But I discovered that the lingering sheen is actually a plus - it brightens the eye area and helps deflect attention from dark circles and/or puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a soothing cream that I look forward to using (in fact, it&#x27;s rather addicting - I apply it multiple times throughout the day!) and though it won&#x27;t magically change your skin&#x27;s tendency toward circles or puffiness, it will lessen them and keep the area looking much brighter and healthier, and get rid of that unpleasant stretched-too-tight feeling.</li>
            <li> Not bad. It&#x27;s more oily than I was expecting and takes a while to absorb, but it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Still testing it, but I like the smooth silky feeling. Helps your makeup look more flawless, not sure it reduces puffiness the verdict is still pending on that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after the burts bees radiance eye cream I had didn&#x27;t work. This took away some of the puffiness but I still had bags and significant puffiness. Not worth the money and did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!!!!</li>
            <li> I WAS SENT THE WRONG PRODUCT THE COMPANY DID NOT EVEN LOOK AT MY ORDER THEY SENT ME A EYE ROLLER IN A TUBE THAT IS NOT WHAT I ORDER . I CONTACTED THEM AND THEY SAID TO SENT IT BACK TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO FOR ME LIKE CALLING ME A LIAR . I JUST KEPT THE PRODUCT EVEN IF I DONT USE IT</li>
            <li> I think it works okay, I stopped using it for a while and the circles under my eyes seemed to get worse...</li>
