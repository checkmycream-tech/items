            <li>The full face mask I bought already had a cushion on it.</li>
            <li>Much better to replace the face cushion than the whole mask.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to learn I could just replace the face cushion and didn&#x27;t have to buy the whole face mask.</li>

            <li>Bought to have when the first cushion wears out!</li>
            <li>I ordered the wrong clip and cushion but ended up purchasing the mask to fit this one and am very happy that I did.  </li>
            <li>So these were needed and very well appreciated :)</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick and the product was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>My husband uses the C-pap and right now we are in between doctors since we moved from Va where my husband retired from the Navy.</li>
            <li>I realized after I purchased the full face mask that I did not need it, but I am sure I will use it in the future.</li>
            <li>this was the right product, right size and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>High quality product, and, at a better price than what I normally pay at the CPAP Store online.</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>you very much,</li>
            <li>This arrived in one week and that night was the first I slept all night in about 10 days.</li>
            <li>Thank a congressman more medical device taxes.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It was our first time ordering CPAP supplies on line and we will do it again.</li>
            <li>Same product I pay much more for thru our insurance</li>
            <li>Better price than my local health care provider.  </li>
            <li>Did exactly what was promised.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it, does the job but doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should, it is a great product otherwise</li>
            <li>This is the only full face mask to wear!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too</li>
            <li>Compares very well to produt</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for these.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Saved me so much money.</li>
            <li>It is of high quality and does what its supposed to.</li>
            <li>and it is working wonders for her i highly recommend</li>
            <li>Delivery seemed a bit slower than normal.  </li>
            <li>Made mask feel just like new one.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly the same as I have been using except 1/5 the price that my insurance charges!</li>

            <li>I will certainly use them again for any needs of this type and I publicly thank them.</li>
            <li>The product completely met my expectatioins.  </li>
            <li>I was overdue for a mask insert and the loud leaking kept waking me up with my old one.</li>
            <li>This allowed me to replace the parts necessary on the mask without having to get the whole assembly.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping, which is what I needed after my cat ate my last mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The old one had started to wear.</li>
            <li>This product arrived sooner than I expected and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This one brought my sleep back to normal.</li>
            <li>This mask works just as well if not better then the original I had.</li>
            <li>My young dog had gotten ahold of my face cushion and chewed just enough off to make it useless---sucked air constantly.  </li>

            <li> My young dog had gotten ahold of my face cushion and chewed just enough off to make it useless---sucked air constantly.  </li>
            <li> The reason why I cant give the mask a 5 is because I feel the cushion on the mask has been changed and  does not have the same cushion as before and because of that it does not last long</li>
            <li> Easy to order, less expensive than other medical suppliers made it so much easier and affordable to get the supplies I needed!</li>
            <li> Received prior to time expected.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that all Quattro &amp;#34;cushions&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve had, leave a red mark on the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> The silicone on this Mask is very loose and doesn&#x27;t seal my face well.  </li>
            <li> It came sealed in ResMed packaging unlike some other products on here</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t aware it was the wrong size until I tried to put in together.</li>
            <li> It cost me less than a copay.</li>
            <li> Its hard to rate this item as I flat out hate using my C-pap machine and no matter what I do, my mask doesn&#x27;t really fit my face.  </li>
            <li> My health insurance would not pay for a replacement at this point and to buy it directly from our local retailer was very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it 3 times from regular supplier and got wrong one.</li>
            <li> SAME AGAIN, PURCHASED THE WRONG SIZE</li>
            <li> I ordered a small received a medium and now its to late to return it.</li>
            <li> I make it work, but I&#x27;m not thrilled.</li>
            <li> This is a lot less expensive here, than having to go through a specialty company.</li>
            <li> This was unnecessary.</li>
            <li> The guide at the bottom (customers who bought this also bought these) led me to believe I needed it, but now I have an expensive spare.</li>
            <li> All of the others leak bad.  </li>
            <li> It smells disgusting!</li>
            <li> It is insanely priced for a piece of rubber and plastic though.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Good replacement part. No problems.</li>
            <li> Delivery seemed a bit slower than normal.  But item has functioned well.  Adequately packaged. Seems quite durable.</li>
            <li> Whoever stored this didnt care to keep it (despite the fact it was in sealed packaging) from second hand smoke exposure! It smells disgusting! Like an ash tray! Unacceptable!!! Especially when this is supposed to be an inch from your mouth and nose all night!</li>
            <li> The product completely met my expectatioins.  It arrived very fast.I use the product with a c pap machine,&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much,</li>
            <li> Item was received in a timely manner.  I have not used this item as of this date.  I realized after I purchased the full face mask that I did not need it, but I am sure I will use it in the future.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what is described and it fits wonderfully! It came sealed in ResMed packaging unlike some other products on here that only sy they are ResMed!  this was the right product, right size and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Its hard to rate this item as I flat out hate using my C-pap machine and no matter what I do, my mask doesn&#x27;t really fit my face.  I make it work, but I&#x27;m not thrilled.</li>
            <li> Thier customer service was very good! There had been a mix up with my order, but they corrected the problem immediatly. They responded to my inquiery within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I have been using the mirage Quattro mask for years now with no problem. The reason why I cant give the mask a 5 is because I feel the cushion on the mask has been changed and  does not have the same cushion as before and because of that it does not last long</li>
            <li> Bought to have when the first cushion wears out!</li>
            <li> I was overdue for a mask insert and the loud leaking kept waking me up with my old one. This arrived in one week and that night was the first I slept all night in about 10 days. Fits properly (small insert) and works great!</li>
            <li> this is a great price for the same product you get from the CPAP suppliers or online stores. go for it</li>
            <li> Works great . I would recommend to any one .  I have used this type for 3 years , Great pricing</li>
            <li> This is the only full face mask to wear! These replacement cushions are the best deal around allowing you to replace more often.</li>
            <li> This mask works just as well if not better then the original I had. Work perfect. Will buy from again.</li>
            <li> No one likes to spend money on medical needs but this product is a good value and works for my needs.  Never had an issue when I&#x27;ve purchased.  Fast shipping too</li>
            <li> I like the product as it is the same as what I used to get through prescription. It is insanely priced for a piece of rubber and plastic though. Thank a congressman more medical device taxes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it, does the job but doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should, it is a great product otherwise</li>
            <li> This was unnecessary. The full face mask I bought already had a cushion on it. The guide at the bottom (customers who bought this also bought these) led me to believe I needed it, but now I have an expensive spare. The mask, cushion and headgear all came separately so when the mask came last I had already opened this so I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong clip and cushion but ended up purchasing the mask to fit this one and am very happy that I did.  The mask fits better and seems sturdier.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. I ordered it 3 times from regular supplier and got wrong one. Thanks for getting it right!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before. It is of high quality and does what its supposed to. This review is actually about the service I got from the vendor, Somniair. Instead of the Mirage Quattro face cushion, I mistakenly ordered the Quattro Fx Face cushion- the name is similar and the appearance on the web page is similar, too. I realized my error after I took the item out of the package. I contacted Somniair via Amazon. They responded within hours. They have offered to send me the correct item, with 2 day delivery, at no charge to me. This is despite the fact that they have no use for the returned item, since a sanitary medical product, once opened, cannot be sent to another customer. Rarely have I experienced such extraordinary, responsive and understanding customer service. I will certainly use them again for any needs of this type and I publicly thank them.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly the same as I have been using except 1/5 the price that my insurance charges! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It was our first time ordering CPAP supplies on line and we will do it again. Same product I pay much more for thru our insurance</li>
            <li> Made mask feel just like new one. Fit perfectly good price!</li>
            <li> Exact replacement mask as prescribed by physician at one third the cost. Arrived quickly and in excellent condition. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Easy to order, less expensive than other medical suppliers made it so much easier and affordable to get the supplies I needed! I will definatly  order again!</li>
            <li> This is the only mask I can wear.  All of the others leak bad.  This one is very comfortable.  I sleep all night without waking up to leaks and noises.</li>
            <li> My young dog had gotten ahold of my face cushion and chewed just enough off to make it useless---sucked air constantly.  My health insurance would not pay for a replacement at this point and to buy it directly from our local retailer was very expensive.  I save about $100 ordering it from Resmed.  The delivery was quick and the product was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This allowed me to replace the parts necessary on the mask without having to get the whole assembly. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has to sleep with a cpap machine. these worked great , good quality and good price! will buy again</li>
            <li> this was to replace my one when it came time. I ordered a small received a medium and now its to late to return it. I didn&#x27;t open it until I needed it so I wasn&#x27;t aware it was the wrong size until I tried to put in together.</li>
            <li> High quality product, and, at a better price than what I normally pay at the CPAP Store online.</li>
            <li> 2nd time ordering this product, and will again....no problems at all</li>
            <li> This product arrived sooner than I expected and was exactly as described. This is exactly what I was looking for and has enabled me to get a better night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li> Mask was perfect and was an exact match to it&#x27;s replacement. Seller shipped same day as promised.</li>
            <li> Exact fit. Better price than my local health care provider.  Recommend others to this provider.  Received prior to time expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom because she needed one and it is working wonders for her i highly recommend</li>
            <li> SAME AGAIN, PURCHASED THE WRONG SIZE AND IT STILL FITS PRETTY GOOD. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE STILL SLEEPING LIKE A BABY.</li>
            <li> It fits well and works great.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Compares very well to produt we ordered from the medical supplier. Definetly will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This is a lot less expensive here, than having to go through a specialty company. Was easy to put together &amp; was a great fit. It&#x27;s just what I needed. The only complaint I have is that all Quattro &amp;#34;cushions&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve had, leave a red mark on the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what was promised. Will use this company again</li>
            <li> I love it, just the right fit.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for these. My husband uses the C-pap and right now we are in between doctors since we moved from Va where my husband retired from the Navy. So these were needed and very well appreciated :)</li>
            <li> Got the exact part I needed, fast, and at a good price.  Much better to replace the face cushion than the whole mask.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my wife and it fits just like the original.  It&#x27;s easier to buy it here than try to get it through the insurance.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. I was so pleased to learn I could just replace the face cushion and didn&#x27;t have to buy the whole face mask. I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> The silicone on this Mask is very loose and doesn&#x27;t seal my face well.  The mask just like this, I&#x27;ve been getting from my Medical supplier were much tighter and sealed my face great.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for this product. I bought as a replacement when mine tore...I think this one fits even better than the original. Thanks</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping, which is what I needed after my cat ate my last mask.</li>

            <li> very happy with the price; will buy the product again.</li>
            <li> The price was amazing. Saved me so much money. It fit perfectly. I will definitely be back when I need a replacement. It cost me less than a copay. It was a perfect replacement for my cpap.</li>
            <li> This cushion was great and as exactly like the one I was replacing.&lt;br /&gt;The old one had started to wear. This one brought my sleep back to normal.</li>
