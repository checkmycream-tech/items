            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>Too many words are required.</li>
            <li>The Revlon Teal eyeliner is lovely</li>
            <li>but I wish it could have been more on the turquoise side of color.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are green/blue so it helps to bring out both colors and is most flattering.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Nice color to make a calm look</li>
            <li>and it comes off easily.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, does not smudge, and it stays put until you take it off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s astounding how fast this product disappears from your skin.</li>

            <li>The color is great, but I wish it were a little darker.</li>
            <li>The Revlon ColorStay in teal that I had bought from the store seemed to be a bit lighter than this, but it&#x27;s still beautiful and makes green eyes really pop!</li>
            <li>I like, I would&#x27;ve NEVER paid that much!</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li>I love the Dark blue and the Teal</li>
            <li>This teal green shade is no longer available in stores, so if you like it, stock up.</li>

            <li> I love the teal color because my eyes are green/blue.  I cannot find this Revlon product in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Great color to go with denim and other blues.</li>
            <li> The Revlon ColorStay in teal that I had bought from the store seemed to be a bit lighter than this, but it&#x27;s still beautiful and makes green eyes really pop!</li>
            <li> Nice color to make a calm look POP! I I love it. Super Duper Buy. Cant beat it. Great look</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted , I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> I love this color, I wanted to try something new with my eyes, and this color and product is the best.  The color does not spread all over the eye and it is true to color</li>
            <li> I wish I did not have to order it when I need it I love the Dark blue and the Teal My favorit eye line, this is the only eye line I use. It stays on until you take it off. It dosn&#x27;t sweat off eaither!</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeliner !  It goes on smoothly, does not smudge, and it stays put until you take it off. There is a sharpener on the end , which works well.  This teal green shade is no longer available in stores, so if you like it, stock up.</li>
            <li> Love them.  It was so nice to be able to locate this color because I could not find it in my local store.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Quick service, great product.</li>
            <li> I like Revlon products and it was just as anticipated. I would buy it again. Too many words are required.</li>
            <li> The Revlon Teal eyeliner is lovely but I wish it could have been more on the turquoise side of color.  My eyes are green/blue so it helps to bring out both colors and is most flattering.</li>
            <li> REVLON NEEDS TO CONTINUE THIS COLOR FOR ME</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this waterproof eyeliner. I have a lot of allergies and my eyes water a lot. This eyeliner doesn&#x27;t budge. It takes a little time to get used to applying it but it stays until you take it off. I use Mary Kay make up remover and it comes off easily. The shipping cost was outrageous though! If I didn&#x27;t have so much trouble finding the color I like, I would&#x27;ve NEVER paid that much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s astounding how fast this product disappears from your skin. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you apply it to bare skin, eyeshadow base, primer, powder, or some combination. Also, it does NOT go onto your inner lids/waterlines at all. Finally, it is also not possible to sharpen it at all, so once it&#x27;s been used, you&#x27;re stuck with the same thickness of line.</li>
            <li> From Mrs. Mara:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner WAS in fact in the package together with the book. At first I didn&#x27;t see it. The color is great, but I wish it were a little darker. But I still like it!</li>
