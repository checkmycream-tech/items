            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>You better believe I&#x27;ll buy this product again and again and again.</li>
            <li>I have the most stubborn hair ever.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just not in love with it.  </li>
            <li>This product is okay</li>
            <li>My hair never looked better</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>It works best when applied before my hair starts to dry at all.  </li>
            <li>This product not only added wave but incredible volume and body.</li>
            <li>a very quick touch up with the blow dryer to soften it .</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Volume, beautiful waves that last for days.  </li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>like this product ,hairdresser introduced me to it , and it is great for people with the short hair styles</li>
            <li>Great for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Keeps my curls beautiful all day long.</li>
            <li>Once my hair stylist used this on my amazing new haircut, I knew I had to replicate the outcome!</li>
            <li>Oh yea, and i&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>GIVES SO MUCH TEXTURE AND BODY TO VERY FINE HAIR.</li>
            <li>The cream is very tacky and a little goes a long way- Great for adding just a bit of texture for the perfect undone look.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy me a full size tube.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok don&#x27;t use much though</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but don&#x27;t buy it through the seller &amp;#34;MY FAVORITE THINGS!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Perfect for my short hair (about 6 inches long).</li>
            <li>I have short fine hair, and this product give my hair lots of body, and it continues to work day after day without adding more</li>
            <li>He thought it was worth a try</li>
            <li>if you have long hair and want that slept in, surfer look or want to want those long strands of hair, this product is real good.</li>
            <li>so worth the money for those of us with that baby texture hair.</li>
            <li>Its a bit sticky and takes some practice to find the right look</li>
            <li>I think it will work better for my husband&#x27;s super short hair.</li>
            <li>He can only use a tiny bit and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something to make it look piecey and kind of slept in and loose</li>
            <li>If he wants more hold he just adds a little more.  </li>
            <li>The product has satisfied the requirements related to be in the hair gel needed, as in this case of Bumble and Bumble Texture Hair</li>
            <li>First time using this product.  </li>
            <li>and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how this stuff works.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and using this cream allows me to blow dry my hair and style it without the use of a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, but not a thick texture, making hair products build up easily.</li>
            <li>but this was light, applied easily and did not wear my hair down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly short, but I&#x27;ve used this when it was longer with the same, fantastic results I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Item was delivered fast, exactly as described</li>
            <li>Taking this into account the price is worth it even though it will run out quickly with regular use.</li>
            <li>they replaced it with is&#x27;t the real thing.</li>
            <li>really like it</li>
            <li>This stuff tamed my hair really well</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use to much..</li>
            <li>really adds texture.</li>
            <li>The whole routine takes 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and a lot of products weigh it down.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and tends to be limp, but this gives it just the right amount of grit!</li>
            <li>All I have to do in the morning after showering is quickly work this product through my hair, then twirl to form several large sections on each side.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine short hair that goes flat without using product on it.  </li>
            <li>His hair is held in place nicely without being hard and can still move it around during the day.</li>
            <li>I have thick, kind of wavy, but kind of not hair that is hard to style.  </li>
            <li>but I can tell I&#x27;ll be able to use this bottle for a long long time even if I use it every day.</li>
            <li>I can let my hair down &amp; curl like usual &amp; still look great.</li>
            <li>I love using this with sumotechâ€”but usually 1 tube will outlast 4 jars of sumotech.</li>
            <li>Takes only small amount and keeps hair perfectly straight, or can be combed out for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>Just a little goes a long way - styles and holds fine hair really well!</li>
            <li>For my long, baby-fine but naturally curly hair, this does the trick for styling better than any other hair product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I once got it permed and the perm was out and my hair was back straight within 7</li>
            <li>but its not tacky enough to really hold your hair in place unless you use ALOT of it.  </li>
            <li>And like some other reviews I have seen you can actually get away with next day styling without needing much more product if at all.</li>
            <li>Finally a product that offers some life to my usually limp fine hair.</li>
            <li>This product works great on my hair which is thick and can be hard to manage.  </li>
            <li>I went to a new salon and they use only Bumble and Bumble products which I had never heard about before.</li>
            <li>Im guessing I will be able to make this one last at least a year.</li>
            <li>the texture it left behind was nice.</li>
            <li>hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight, thick and very fine hair with a little wave.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thick and fine.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine but thick hair</li>
            <li>I have used many products to style my very thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>2nd day it still looks like those VS models&#x27; purposely semi messy hair but pretty.  </li>
            <li>Gives my fine, thin hair the body it needs.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Gives my fine, thin hair the body it needs.  </li>
            <li> For me, this cream didn&#x27;t have enough hydration, so my hair ended up feeling tacky not soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and I expected it to be better based upon what I read in the description.</li>
            <li> If I am in too big of a hurry to do any twirling, I can spin my hair up in a loose ball and then take it out in and hour or two and do the twirling.  </li>
            <li> Fluff it around the next morning.</li>
            <li> I wear it layered from 2 to 5 inches long.  </li>
            <li> I squirt about 1 inch into my palms and rub them together and then scrunch it through wet hair before styling on low heat with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused to whether this was a real bumble and bumble product because it felt different from the same product I&#x27;ve used on my hair.</li>
            <li> Blow dry with a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> just a tad does the trick) and let it air dry</li>
            <li> (I air dry) without leaving frizz or stickiness.</li>
            <li> I use it on my dry hair, style, then follow with B&amp;B spray.  </li>
            <li> and I use this after I dry and style.  </li>
            <li> It will leave end with a crispy dry touch</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to blow dry, or do anything else.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> The only down side is its cost.</li>

            <li> It took some practice to get it to work for my hair, but I like it now. I have very fine hair, and a lot of products weigh it down. Here is how I use it:&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply a nickel-sized amount to wet (not damp) hair. Work through.&lt;br /&gt;2. Blow dry with a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;3. Sleep on it.&lt;br /&gt;4. Fluff it around the next morning. May need to apply a bit more product to ends.</li>
            <li> Would love ot buy more!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  GIVES SO MUCH TEXTURE AND BODY TO VERY FINE HAIR.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, but not a thick texture, making hair products build up easily. However, B&amp;B leaves my hair in ringlets with texture and body, leaving no residue.</li>
            <li> This was used on me by a stylist for a wedding event. Normally I use gels and I hate muds, but this was light, applied easily and did not wear my hair down. And like some other reviews I have seen you can actually get away with next day styling without needing much more product if at all. Taking this into account the price is worth it even though it will run out quickly with regular use.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to recreate a gritty second day hair look (think mary kate and ashley olsen, kate moss, lara stone.) I have very thick hair that lies a few inches below my shoulders. This product not only added wave but incredible volume and body. I start with a pea sized amount and work it through wet hair and continue adding. I then ruffle it up a little bit and let it air dry for about 15 minutes. I then use a diffuser to finish it off and... Viola! perfect straight-from-the-beach, piecey-morning-after hair. And the best part: you can get by two maybe even three days without washing your hair- minimal effort AND perfect hair?! You better believe I&#x27;ll buy this product again and again and again.</li>
            <li> This is thick cream and gives hair lots of body and texture that holds all day.  I finish with some hair spray, but you might not need that.  The only down side is its cost.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this.  Instruction was too small to read so I just applied it after I towel dried my hair, blow dry &amp; curl as usual.  But the result was obviously better, my hair/curled waves were more textured &amp; even got more volume!!  2nd day it still looks like those VS models&#x27; purposely semi messy hair but pretty.  I am going to buy me a full size tube.  I was thinking of an updo for a future party but now, I think w/ this product,(I have a bit of thin/wavy hair) I can let my hair down &amp; curl like usual &amp; still look great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok don&#x27;t use much though</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and using this cream allows me to blow dry my hair and style it without the use of a curling iron.  This is the best product I have ever used</li>
            <li> I have used many products to style my very thick, coarse hair.  I wear it layered from 2 to 5 inches long.  This is the only product that will give my thick hair lift and hold it all day.  Sometimes I add Sumotech to finish it and define the curls/waves.  Can recommend this product without hesitation for all-day hold.  I squirt about 1 inch into my palms and rub them together and then scrunch it through wet hair before styling on low heat with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Just need a tiny dab, but it makes your hair look thicker without making it greasy.  I would buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I have the most stubborn hair ever.  I once got it permed and the perm was out and my hair was back straight within 7 hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight, thick and very fine hair with a little wave.  I put this product in when damp (just a tad does the trick) and let it air dry and my hair has voluminous waves for days.  Doesn&#x27;t get greasy and smells great.  A little goes a long way, so it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years.  Takes only small amount and keeps hair perfectly straight, or can be combed out for a more natural look.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products. My hair is thick and fine. It&#x27;s fairly short, but I&#x27;ve used this when it was longer with the same, fantastic results I LOVE this stuff. It adds texture without adding heavy weight or making it look greasy. It&#x27;s the perfect amount of texture so that my hair doesn&#x27;t fly away. A tube this size also lasts like a year! I love using this with sumotechâ€”but usually 1 tube will outlast 4 jars of sumotech. So 30 bucks for this is actually a valid price.</li>
            <li> I have very thick flat hair and this product gives it body.  Just don&#x27;t over due the amount used. Usually lasts got two days.</li>
            <li> Perfect  for styling!!!</li>
            <li> This was a really good product.</li>
            <li> Perfect. As expected! The product has satisfied the requirements related to be in the hair gel needed, as in this case of Bumble and Bumble Texture Hair</li>
            <li> Gives my fine, thin hair the body it needs.  I can tell a huge difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but don&#x27;t buy it through the seller &amp;#34;MY FAVORITE THINGS!&amp;#34; When I got the package the container was obviously tampered with...the end was cut open and the product was oozing out. Oh yea, and i&#x27;m pretty sure the weird smelling gunk they replaced it with is&#x27;t the real thing.</li>
            <li> it works great...really like it</li>
            <li> Perfect for my short hair (about 6 inches long). I just throw this in while my hair is wet and once it air dries, it&#x27;s all styled.</li>
            <li> like this product ,hairdresser introduced me to it , and it is great for people with the short hair styles</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiancee&#x27; and it is wonderful for his naturally curly hair.  He can only use a tiny bit and it looks great.  If he wants more hold he just adds a little more.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Try it on dry hair instead of wet. Gives a great matte texture.</li>
            <li> Thnx. Grt service and product.</li>
            <li> Great hold for curly hair! I add a little oil to it in my palms before working and combing it thru. Nothing else compares.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin but wavy and I have a lot of it. This stuff tamed my hair really well (I air dry) without leaving frizz or stickiness. I feel like I&#x27;ve been searching for this product for a loooong time. love it!</li>
            <li> First time using this product.  It&#x27;s a bit sticky so your hand sticks to your hair but the texture it left behind was nice.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser showed this to my husband while she was doing my hair. He thought it was worth a try and he absolutely loves it! His hair is held in place nicely without being hard and can still move it around during the day. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Maybe I just haven&#x27;t found the perfect use for this yet.  I have used on both wet and dry hair and I&#x27;m just not in love with it.  I find that it leaves the hair a little harder than I wanted it.  I was looking for something to make it look piecey and kind of slept in and loose but this just isn&#x27;t doing it for me.  The search continues.</li>
            <li> For my long, baby-fine but naturally curly hair, this does the trick for styling better than any other hair product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused to whether this was a real bumble and bumble product because it felt different from the same product I&#x27;ve used on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is okay but its not tacky enough to really hold your hair in place unless you use ALOT of it.  It&#x27;s expensive and I expected it to be better based upon what I read in the description.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that offers some life to my usually limp fine hair. Its a bit sticky and takes some practice to find the right look but I will be purchasing another bottle after this one runs out. After using this product 2-3 times a week Im guessing I will be able to make this one last at least a year.</li>
            <li> Nothing else works on my very fine hair.  I use it on my dry hair, style, then follow with B&amp;B spray.  Keeps my hair from looking greasy (which it does by the end of the day without this product).  This is the best stuff ever!</li>
            <li> Great for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a beard and want that out of bed messy hair look and this helps me get that. And it doesn&#x27;t look stupidly sleek or shiny. It just blends in wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now keep a backup tube at home.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly how this stuff works.  It&#x27;s like teflon coating, but with no significant change in texture and no greasy feeling.  I have short, fine but thick hair and I use this after I dry and style.  My hair doesn&#x27;t droop or have fly aways all day, but it also doesn&#x27;t feel or look like a helmet.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> The cream is very tacky and a little goes a long way- Great for adding just a bit of texture for the perfect undone look. I also love using it when I put my hair in a pony to keep the fly aways in place. To me it&#x27;s a pricey product but I can tell I&#x27;ll be able to use this bottle for a long long time even if I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I really loved this cream . All I did was put a small amount on  and  rush my hair into the shape I wanted and let it dry&lt;br /&gt;Then a very quick touch up with the blow dryer to soften it . My hair never looked better</li>
            <li> I have very fine short hair that goes flat without using product on it.  This B&amp;B product adds body &amp; intentional mussed up texture.  I use it with Alterna Bamboo Volume 48 hr. &amp; am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair is fine and tends to be limp, but this gives it just the right amount of grit!</li>
            <li> I went to a new salon and they use only Bumble and Bumble products which I had never heard about before. Once my hair stylist used this on my amazing new haircut, I knew I had to replicate the outcome! As long as you follow the styling directions/recommendations, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> if you have long hair and want that slept in, surfer look or want to want those long strands of hair, this product is real good. It will leave end with a crispy dry touch but you can easily enough run fingers thru hair to unclump, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and I can&#x27;t exist without this product.. Keeps my curls beautiful all day long. Don&#x27;t use to much..</li>
            <li> For me, this cream didn&#x27;t have enough hydration, so my hair ended up feeling tacky not soft.  I think it will work better for my husband&#x27;s super short hair.</li>
            <li> I have short fine hair, and this product give my hair lots of body, and it continues to work day after day without adding more</li>
            <li> You only use a pinch and it last a while -- so worth the money for those of us with that baby texture hair. really adds texture.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  Best I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  I have thick, kind of wavy, but kind of not hair that is hard to style.  Volume, beautiful waves that last for days.  Perfect.  I don&#x27;t have to blow dry, or do anything else.  And it smells great!  Will never use anything else...</li>
            <li> Item was delivered fast, exactly as described</li>
            <li> This product works great on my hair which is thick and can be hard to manage.  This product gives me great hold and finish every day and I have been using it for over 3 years now.  All I have to do in the morning after showering is quickly work this product through my hair, then twirl to form several large sections on each side.  It works best when applied before my hair starts to dry at all.  It is so easy to use.  The whole routine takes 5 minutes.  If I am in too big of a hurry to do any twirling, I can spin my hair up in a loose ball and then take it out in and hour or two and do the twirling.  Texture makes it so easy to have good hair days, I just love it!  A tube probably lasts me 2 months and I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way - styles and holds fine hair really well!</li>
