            <li>My husband and I love this bidet!</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>I have another bidet installed for much longer and still works perfectly.</li>
            <li>to install if you&#x27;re fairly handy.</li>
            <li>handy.</li>
            <li>Great pressure and right on spot!  </li>
            <li>I like this product, for its simplicity, easy to install and good price.</li>
            <li>She liked it very much, it was a good deal and a good help.</li>
            <li>Great value does exactly what it should can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Ordered the Joy Bidet because of all the positive reviews on Amazon, but the seller (SimplyBeautiful) sent the PureClean bidet instead.</li>
            <li>Very healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I recommend skipping this one and buying something  better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s like a shower for your bottom and much more convenient than using a handheld shower head in the shower every time.  </li>
            <li>and it actually is more than what I paid for this unit.</li>
            <li>Love this thing</li>
            <li>After having it 2 weeks, it started leaking at the &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; fitting.  </li>
            <li>Tried to find another &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; fitting to replace it with and could not find one.  </li>
            <li>, the cute girl brought it to me, and before I realized it just shipped in the RETAIL box</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you don&#x27;t want everyone prying into your #2 hole then don&#x27;t have it delivered to the cute girl.</li>
            <li>We are completely satisfied with our purchase with Amazon.</li>
            <li>Also, it seems more of a stream than a spray.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more again</li>
            <li>Very use full, easy to install, effective and a great value for money.</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s a OK product but needs more fine tunes in design.</li>
            <li>It was easy to install but do make sure you have a wrench and a screwdriver</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and working good  and so easy to install it, also u can control the water with different levels , i liked so much&lt;br /&gt;Viva</li>
            <li>A universal fit design would make it perfect.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this to anyone who cares about clean!</li>
            <li>this brand has reasonable price combined by a good</li>
            <li>only reason I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is that a 5 star system may be a bit more industrial, but this model for $25 is awesome and priced just right.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product,function well and even better than what I had before,very easy to install,shipping was at time as mentioned,the price is very fare.</li>
            <li>does what it is supposed to do, easy to install.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to be installed, easy to be used even by kids</li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>Installation easy , adjustments to fittings depends .</li>
            <li>It would be easy for someone to install it and try to overtighten it and break it, so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did I have to spend for such a great product. :)</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, easy to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I learned about the goodness of these kind of things while staying in Japan, and I am delighted to find that there are some simple, low-cost options for these in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I like this better, more convenient and accurate, hits just at the right spot which can be adjusted with the slotted bolt holes.</li>
            <li>till now is doing fine.</li>
            <li>This bidet works fine 1 year.</li>
            <li>and it has worked fine.</li>
            <li>works fine which means it is acceptable for use</li>
            <li>Reasonable price good quality good plastic material logo package makes it easy to present to my Customer</li>
            <li>This item works great, just do not contact the distributor because they will not get back to you!</li>
            <li>You need to find something to support the front ring from bottom to secure it.</li>
            <li>The sprayer is fantastic on these and don&#x27;t splash and hit the spot for all users.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived in r√©cord time and i Could not make it fit</li>
            <li>I have gifted these to many people all ready.</li>
            <li>Glad to see this reasonably priced gadget for better hygiene.</li>
            <li>and it come with an easy to read full of pics manual; almost like a map.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works great and still better than not.</li>
            <li>The older this tubing gets, and the more times it gets knocked or pulled by cleaning, the more I&#x27;ll worry about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>spray is ok, pretty good pressure, more then I expected.  </li>
            <li>you are 100% clean.</li>
            <li>The Pure Clean bidet has a better spray.</li>
            <li>I ever did specially for the woman&#x27;s and the girls</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it, not horrible, but I fear the cheap plastic near the attachment will crack after extended use since the significant amount of weight is being pressured there first over and over again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can be very powerful at first!</li>
            <li>The squirt control knob on the unit is kind of sensitive.</li>
            <li>The numbers didn&#x27;t jive, but I decided that it was worth a try given the inexpensive &amp;#34;introductory offer&amp;#34; that was available at the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Saw a similar one in a Home Depot store for USD 59, so this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>The fine spray streams can be a bit irritating but may you have to find the best combo of power and cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you will miss the bidet and the truly clean fresh feeling</li>
            <li>The idea of using bidet is to minimize toilet paper and also get good cleaning.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this product for better hygiene.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>useful in the restroom/bath for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful</li>
            <li>Also as a tip ensure you have a tape handy to avoid any future leakages and can be used during installation.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>the rare occasion you use the facilities outside your own home</li>
            <li>it will keep you fresh</li>
            <li>Defently recamend it worth every penny &amp; not a lot of pennies</li>
            <li>Prior to the purchase I switched to baby wipes, but don&#x27;t even use them as much, because of the nice clean feel you get with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I have now upgraded the Pure Clean&#x27;s star rating to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pure clean</li>
            <li>This product will clean most posteriors on low setting.  </li>
            <li>In a rental right now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is priced right.</li>
            <li>Good Value for the money, highly recommend it if you are not ready to spend a lot more for a high end one.</li>
            <li>Very easy to setup and very simple to use.</li>
            <li>Only the brave will try any setting higher than the low setting.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much, it is working perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>price is also very reasonable...</li>
            <li>i initially chose it for the cheap price, and was NOT disappointed, works exactly as advertized.</li>
            <li>As a first time bidet user, I am sold as a result of this purchase.</li>
            <li>The first one began to leak a week or so after installation.</li>
            <li>My first impulse was to monitor this equipment for leaks and after a month, there are none.</li>
            <li>would recommend the product and the seller , If I need more I am most likely to order the same</li>
            <li>OK bidet but only has plastic tube from water supply to this unit.  </li>
            <li>The device was not complicated to install for someone with no plumbing knowledge.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Not difficult to install, there was some minor leaking but tightening it more than just with my hands helped.&lt;br /&gt;No heated water but not an issue in Florida.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a pretty smart low-tech non-electric</li>
            <li>liked it so much that this is the xecond one I&#x27;m buying for my other bathroom,&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Pros: easy to install (if the fixed slots width fit your toilet seat screw position), works as designed for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>NOT very comfortable to own and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After nearly four years of regular use, the Pure Clean bidet is still going strong.</li>
            <li>I changed from my previous brand, which I liked, for pricing reasons.</li>
            <li>B008R54IQM Pure Clean Fresh Water Spray Non-Electric Mechanical Bidet Toilet Seat Attachment]]</li>
            <li>it is only 1 month but doing really fine.</li>
            <li>This produce does what its suppose to do and does it very well.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>also calculated how much I used to spend on wipes per year</li>
            <li>the delivery was very timely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The products are similar, but the dial is slightly different than the Joy Bidet C-1; no big deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, flush before you use bidet to see how much poop was cleaned out.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>the whole system doesnt \\&quot;fit\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Functionally it works very well.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase two more for the other restrooms.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>We had bought a Big John seat and it is great and no more breaking trash seats.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why you would want to use a setting higher than low because it is that powerful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was easy to install; however, the fitting at the bidet itself is pretty flimsy and if there is a failure it would likely be at that point.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, it seems like it does the main job it was intended, but we&#x27;ll see after a couple of months of use.  </li>
            <li>Love the new control handle and pop down spout.....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>it lists pretty much every mainstream disorder a person can have related to their #2 hole.</li>
            <li>I purchased this bidet to make life a little easier following surgery and have to say, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I have average house water pressure, and the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; setting on this unit is quite strong, so</li>
            <li>The only draw back is instead of fine stream of water</li>
            <li>if they have this product available in other colours also...</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get a new one.</li>
            <li>just got it, at my new workplace (always deliver stuff to work, no one home)</li>
            <li>it comes out as a spray needing more toilet paper to dry covered area.</li>
            <li>I would recommend use of this product to family and friends, however, I am the only one interested in using it.</li>
            <li>I paid more for my very simple other bidet&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far!</li>
            <li>The water pressure is a little strong.  </li>
            <li>But so far, after 3 months of usage, it still works as new.  </li>
            <li>2) only three fixed slots to fit the toilet seat screws.</li>
            <li>This is gentle, and the switch is nice and gradual, a soft start of water, not some butthole destroying water stream from hell like on other models.</li>
            <li>The pressure on it is very high, but I have a very old toilet that takes a long time to fill up, so I need to keep the water pressure high to fill it in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>&gt; The product is managed by Amazon directly</li>
            <li>I called Amazon and their solution was to only swipe whole product by another.</li>
            <li>This is a much cleaner bathroom practice, and it not only saves money, it saves trees.  </li>
            <li>and so far all going well</li>
            <li>My first model broke after a long time</li>
            <li>They need to hire the adult toys packaging companies here,</li>
            <li>However I had ordered quantity of 3, but 1 of them has shut off issues where it is marked as &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I fall in love with the concept of this product few years back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a piece of cake to install!&lt;br /&gt;Warning be very careful the first 15 times you use it!</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase a new part to use the t-connection as a spare part then returned the newly purchased product with the defective t-connection back.</li>
            <li>Install sucks, depending on what kind of toilet u have, YMMV, but even when done,</li>
            <li>Have been using this for 5 months so far with no other issues.</li>
            <li>but it is only a temporary deterrent) because it is definitely powerful enough even at the low</li>
            <li>Is the only one that has fit my low profile toilet which is wider than regular toilets.  </li>
            <li>like off white or creamish shade to exactly match our toilet seat....</li>
            <li>The only draw back: It makes the toilet seat a bit higher at the rear.</li>
            <li>I have had a full bidet in my previous home with faucets and separate unit next to the toilet.</li>
            <li>The company would only support me if I purchased it directly from them and referred me back to Amazon in a stern manner; this is not their issue.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>/&gt;Our water pressure is pretty low, so much so that the stream doesn&#x27;t flow until one notch past &amp;#34;low,&amp;#34; which is awfully direct spray, so I have to set it to that point for the nozzle to extend and then back it down to &amp;#</li>
            <li>Worked great for approx 12 months, out of the blue sprung a leak, water damage now :(</li>
            <li>Too bad I only use this on weekends pretty much because of long weekday work days, so it wont really get that much use.</li>
            <li>so now the back end of my toilet seat is about half an inch higher than the front.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it is wonderful and really does the job!</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this bidet!</li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> I have another bidet installed for much longer and still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> to install if you&#x27;re fairly handy.</li>
            <li> handy.</li>
            <li> Great pressure and right on spot!  </li>
            <li> I like this product, for its simplicity, easy to install and good price.</li>
            <li> She liked it very much, it was a good deal and a good help.</li>
            <li> Great value does exactly what it should can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Joy Bidet because of all the positive reviews on Amazon, but the seller (SimplyBeautiful) sent the PureClean bidet instead.</li>
            <li> Very healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I recommend skipping this one and buying something  better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s like a shower for your bottom and much more convenient than using a handheld shower head in the shower every time.  </li>
            <li> and it actually is more than what I paid for this unit.</li>
            <li> Love this thing</li>
            <li> After having it 2 weeks, it started leaking at the &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; fitting.  </li>
            <li> Tried to find another &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; fitting to replace it with and could not find one.  </li>
            <li> , the cute girl brought it to me, and before I realized it just shipped in the RETAIL box</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you don&#x27;t want everyone prying into your #2 hole then don&#x27;t have it delivered to the cute girl.</li>
            <li> We are completely satisfied with our purchase with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Also, it seems more of a stream than a spray.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more again</li>
            <li> Very use full, easy to install, effective and a great value for money.</li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s a OK product but needs more fine tunes in design.</li>
            <li> It was easy to install but do make sure you have a wrench and a screwdriver</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and working good  and so easy to install it, also u can control the water with different levels , i liked so much&lt;br /&gt;Viva</li>
            <li> A universal fit design would make it perfect.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this to anyone who cares about clean!</li>
            <li> this brand has reasonable price combined by a good</li>
            <li> only reason I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is that a 5 star system may be a bit more industrial, but this model for $25 is awesome and priced just right.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product,function well and even better than what I had before,very easy to install,shipping was at time as mentioned,the price is very fare.</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do, easy to install.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to be installed, easy to be used even by kids</li>
            <li> Easy to install.</li>
            <li> Installation easy , adjustments to fittings depends .</li>
            <li> It would be easy for someone to install it and try to overtighten it and break it, so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did I have to spend for such a great product. :)</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, easy to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I learned about the goodness of these kind of things while staying in Japan, and I am delighted to find that there are some simple, low-cost options for these in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I like this better, more convenient and accurate, hits just at the right spot which can be adjusted with the slotted bolt holes.</li>
            <li> till now is doing fine.</li>
            <li> This bidet works fine 1 year.</li>
            <li> and it has worked fine.</li>
            <li> works fine which means it is acceptable for use</li>
            <li> Reasonable price good quality good plastic material logo package makes it easy to present to my Customer</li>
            <li> This item works great, just do not contact the distributor because they will not get back to you!</li>
            <li> You need to find something to support the front ring from bottom to secure it.</li>
            <li> The sprayer is fantastic on these and don&#x27;t splash and hit the spot for all users.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived in r√©cord time and i Could not make it fit</li>
            <li> I have gifted these to many people all ready.</li>
            <li> Glad to see this reasonably priced gadget for better hygiene.</li>
            <li> and it come with an easy to read full of pics manual; almost like a map.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works great and still better than not.</li>
            <li> The older this tubing gets, and the more times it gets knocked or pulled by cleaning, the more I&#x27;ll worry about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> spray is ok, pretty good pressure, more then I expected.  </li>
            <li> you are 100% clean.</li>
            <li> The Pure Clean bidet has a better spray.</li>
            <li> I ever did specially for the woman&#x27;s and the girls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it, not horrible, but I fear the cheap plastic near the attachment will crack after extended use since the significant amount of weight is being pressured there first over and over again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can be very powerful at first!</li>
            <li> The squirt control knob on the unit is kind of sensitive.</li>
            <li> The numbers didn&#x27;t jive, but I decided that it was worth a try given the inexpensive &amp;#34;introductory offer&amp;#34; that was available at the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Saw a similar one in a Home Depot store for USD 59, so this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> The fine spray streams can be a bit irritating but may you have to find the best combo of power and cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you will miss the bidet and the truly clean fresh feeling</li>
            <li> The idea of using bidet is to minimize toilet paper and also get good cleaning.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend this product for better hygiene.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> useful in the restroom/bath for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful</li>
            <li> Also as a tip ensure you have a tape handy to avoid any future leakages and can be used during installation.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> the rare occasion you use the facilities outside your own home</li>
            <li> it will keep you fresh</li>
            <li> Defently recamend it worth every penny &amp; not a lot of pennies</li>
            <li> Prior to the purchase I switched to baby wipes, but don&#x27;t even use them as much, because of the nice clean feel you get with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I have now upgraded the Pure Clean&#x27;s star rating to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pure clean</li>
            <li> This product will clean most posteriors on low setting.  </li>
            <li> In a rental right now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is priced right.</li>
            <li> Good Value for the money, highly recommend it if you are not ready to spend a lot more for a high end one.</li>
            <li> Very easy to setup and very simple to use.</li>
            <li> Only the brave will try any setting higher than the low setting.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much, it is working perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> price is also very reasonable...</li>
            <li> i initially chose it for the cheap price, and was NOT disappointed, works exactly as advertized.</li>
            <li> As a first time bidet user, I am sold as a result of this purchase.</li>
            <li> The first one began to leak a week or so after installation.</li>
            <li> My first impulse was to monitor this equipment for leaks and after a month, there are none.</li>
            <li> would recommend the product and the seller , If I need more I am most likely to order the same</li>
            <li> OK bidet but only has plastic tube from water supply to this unit.  </li>
            <li> The device was not complicated to install for someone with no plumbing knowledge.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Not difficult to install, there was some minor leaking but tightening it more than just with my hands helped.&lt;br /&gt;No heated water but not an issue in Florida.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a pretty smart low-tech non-electric</li>
            <li> liked it so much that this is the xecond one I&#x27;m buying for my other bathroom,&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Pros: easy to install (if the fixed slots width fit your toilet seat screw position), works as designed for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> NOT very comfortable to own and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After nearly four years of regular use, the Pure Clean bidet is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I changed from my previous brand, which I liked, for pricing reasons.</li>
            <li> B008R54IQM Pure Clean Fresh Water Spray Non-Electric Mechanical Bidet Toilet Seat Attachment]]</li>
            <li> it is only 1 month but doing really fine.</li>
            <li> This produce does what its suppose to do and does it very well.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> also calculated how much I used to spend on wipes per year</li>
            <li> the delivery was very timely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The products are similar, but the dial is slightly different than the Joy Bidet C-1; no big deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , flush before you use bidet to see how much poop was cleaned out.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> the whole system doesnt \\&quot;fit\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Functionally it works very well.</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase two more for the other restrooms.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> We had bought a Big John seat and it is great and no more breaking trash seats.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why you would want to use a setting higher than low because it is that powerful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was easy to install; however, the fitting at the bidet itself is pretty flimsy and if there is a failure it would likely be at that point.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, it seems like it does the main job it was intended, but we&#x27;ll see after a couple of months of use.  </li>
            <li> Love the new control handle and pop down spout.....</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> it lists pretty much every mainstream disorder a person can have related to their #2 hole.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bidet to make life a little easier following surgery and have to say, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I have average house water pressure, and the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; setting on this unit is quite strong, so</li>
            <li> The only draw back is instead of fine stream of water</li>
            <li> if they have this product available in other colours also...</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get a new one.</li>
            <li> just got it, at my new workplace (always deliver stuff to work, no one home)</li>
            <li> it comes out as a spray needing more toilet paper to dry covered area.</li>
            <li> I would recommend use of this product to family and friends, however, I am the only one interested in using it.</li>
            <li> I paid more for my very simple other bidet&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far!</li>
            <li> The water pressure is a little strong.  </li>
            <li> But so far, after 3 months of usage, it still works as new.  </li>
            <li> 2) only three fixed slots to fit the toilet seat screws.</li>
            <li> This is gentle, and the switch is nice and gradual, a soft start of water, not some butthole destroying water stream from hell like on other models.</li>
            <li> The pressure on it is very high, but I have a very old toilet that takes a long time to fill up, so I need to keep the water pressure high to fill it in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> &gt; The product is managed by Amazon directly</li>
            <li> I called Amazon and their solution was to only swipe whole product by another.</li>
            <li> This is a much cleaner bathroom practice, and it not only saves money, it saves trees.  </li>
            <li> and so far all going well</li>
            <li> My first model broke after a long time</li>
            <li> They need to hire the adult toys packaging companies here,</li>
            <li> However I had ordered quantity of 3, but 1 of them has shut off issues where it is marked as &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I fall in love with the concept of this product few years back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a piece of cake to install!&lt;br /&gt;Warning be very careful the first 15 times you use it!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase a new part to use the t-connection as a spare part then returned the newly purchased product with the defective t-connection back.</li>
            <li> Install sucks, depending on what kind of toilet u have, YMMV, but even when done,</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 5 months so far with no other issues.</li>
            <li> but it is only a temporary deterrent) because it is definitely powerful enough even at the low</li>
            <li> Is the only one that has fit my low profile toilet which is wider than regular toilets.  </li>
            <li> like off white or creamish shade to exactly match our toilet seat....</li>
            <li> The only draw back: It makes the toilet seat a bit higher at the rear.</li>
            <li> I have had a full bidet in my previous home with faucets and separate unit next to the toilet.</li>
            <li> The company would only support me if I purchased it directly from them and referred me back to Amazon in a stern manner; this is not their issue.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> /&gt;Our water pressure is pretty low, so much so that the stream doesn&#x27;t flow until one notch past &amp;#34;low,&amp;#34; which is awfully direct spray, so I have to set it to that point for the nozzle to extend and then back it down to &amp;#</li>
            <li> Worked great for approx 12 months, out of the blue sprung a leak, water damage now :(</li>
            <li> Too bad I only use this on weekends pretty much because of long weekday work days, so it wont really get that much use.</li>
            <li> so now the back end of my toilet seat is about half an inch higher than the front.  </li>
            <li> After trying the other brand where I had difficulty of pushing small plastic water tube over small fittings at both ends,  I got this one and found it very customer friendly from installation point.</li>
            <li> maybe 0.4 inches--under the back of your toilet seat.</li>
            <li> You will also need to buy bolts to install it as the ones in your current seat will not be long enough.</li>
            <li> and my toilet is a one piece unit , too low to the floor to attach the plumbing , so</li>
            <li> For some reason it takes a little extra turn of the knob which almost feels like you&#x27;re turning it too far,</li>
            <li> I mean absolutely NONE!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another rater mentioned correctly that this unit causes your toilet seat to incline downward a bit, because the unit adds a bit of height--</li>
            <li> Also you will need to add rubber spacers underneath you toilet seat so that it can seat</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll want one for every toilet in your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seller offered a partial refund if I decided to keep it; she explained that the manufacturer is the same and that it is the same model.</li>
            <li> , it worked with my toilet and does the job.</li>
            <li> Now we all fight over the one toilet!</li>
            <li> I was a little leery at first about a bidet, not familiar with them, but decided I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> The water is cold, but for us that is OK.</li>
            <li> How on earth have we give so long without one?&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is that you have to be careful with water pressure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: After ~4 months of using now it starts to leak water from the sprayer, not much but constantly dropping.</li>
            <li> last tip: once you have everything connected and the water turned back on, don&#x27;t turn the control knob on unless you are sitting down.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing and agree that why anyone would need to use a setting other than low is beyond me unless of course you are trying to deter your nosy cat from drinking out of the toilet</li>
            <li> 3) once installed under the back side of the seat ring as designed, the front half has a big gap between the ring and the bowl.</li>
            <li> Adding a 2nd one to our other bath.</li>
            <li> We have high pressure water and you have to slowly move the knob</li>
            <li> This unit was leaking after installation, I had to take it apart and file off part of the control knob housing in order to get the dial to turn off completely, I had to do this with a small file.</li>
            <li> It installed with no problems (other than some issues relating to my toilet, not the bidet).</li>
            <li> listen carefully and you&#x27;ll hear a click and it will be completely turned off and voila no more dripping water.</li>
            <li> This item will not fit a Big John seat, so we put it on our other toilet</li>
            <li> As I want and expected but it lack</li>
            <li> Money well spent...</li>
            <li> However, with this one, you have to sit all the way back, and I mean all the way, then it does splash on the back of the  seat and has to be wiped after each use.  </li>
            <li> NOT good for New England winter/spring.</li>
            <li> thing I did notice is that the bidet tends to drip a little bit if it&#x27;s not completely turned to the &amp;#34;Off&amp;#34; position.</li>
            <li> it have one way spray not like other one which I had</li>
            <li> Though I am still using it as I got lazy to uninstall it and send it back.</li>
            <li> I turned them pretty tight, but afraid to go tighter for obvious reasons, esp the plastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little cold but that will be fixed in my new home</li>
            <li> The white plastic water tube (connecting the under-tank adapter to the bidet unit) is a bit hard to push onto its fittings.</li>
            <li> Since having bought and installed this we are down to a roll a week.</li>
            <li> Broke in less than a year.</li>
            <li> As a household we were going through at least a roll of toilet paper per day.</li>
            <li> This is pretty inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> but it still leaks a little.  </li>
            <li> After seeing the results left in the bowl, it&#x27;s truly amazing and disgusting what tissues paper leaves behind.</li>
            <li> Broke after few months of use.</li>
            <li> Some of the lower cost bidets can be HARSH spray.</li>
            <li> Someone who is unfamiliar with pipes/tubes may have a hard time installing the compression pipe fittings correctly, since instructions are VERY minimal.</li>
            <li> It feels a little bit funny when you sit, but not too bad</li>
            <li> Two small complaints.  </li>
            <li> When I used toilet paper, all that poop use to go on my underwear and would dry and harden in butt making it painful to walk.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Sep 5th 2013, the switch is not working anymore, it got broken in less than a year</li>
            <li> I do not own this item</li>
            <li> : 1) cold water ONLY.....</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After the adjustment it turned out to constanst drip in the Noel with the valve off , not good</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> The poor mans bidet.</li>
            <li> Sturdy,well designed,better than the really expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I became frustrated w/ the wiping and not feeling like</li>
            <li> I HATE having to use the bathroom away from home because I don&#x27;t have my bidet.</li>
            <li> The bad part is there is nowhere to adjust the tension of the spring inside of the sprayer!</li>
            <li> Also I suffered from painful &#x27;roids and this bidet cured that!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is very painful at Med setting with our water</li>
            <li> worst part is the leak.  </li>

            <li> Worked great for approx 12 months, out of the blue sprung a leak, water damage now :(</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do, easy to install.  Good Value for the money, highly recommend it if you are not ready to spend a lot more for a high end one.</li>
            <li> This produce does what its suppose to do and does it very well.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install - even for a non-handy-person.&lt;br /&gt;Would be great if it came with choice of colors like off-white, baige etc.</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Broke after few months of use.</li>
            <li> Broke in less than a year. Started leaking from multiple spots. I have another bidet installed for much longer and still works perfectly. When I contacted the seller I was only given the option of buying another one with $5 discount.</li>
            <li> i ordered three of these for someone else..i already had two in my home...these are just excellent and&lt;br /&gt;extremely well priced...i have seen some at $500 that do not work as well as these do...SUPER BUY</li>
            <li> Works well for us! We bought this as a replacement for another bidet, and I appreciate that this actually has different pressures.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and working good  and so easy to install it, also u can control the water with different levels , i liked so much&lt;br /&gt;Viva Egypt</li>
            <li> till now is doing fine. i dont know later how will it be. it is only 1 month but doing really fine.</li>
            <li> i initially chose it for the cheap price, and was NOT disappointed, works exactly as advertized. leaves me a LOT cleaner and since I&#x27;m just drying with the TP it goes in a wastebasket and not in my septic. Also I suffered from painful &#x27;roids and this bidet cured that! I HATE having to use the bathroom away from home because I don&#x27;t have my bidet.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, it is working perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was just on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for SimplyBeautiful Family&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008R54IQM Pure Clean Fresh Water Spray Non-Electric Mechanical Bidet Toilet Seat Attachment]]</li>
            <li> This works and beats wipies.  It does the job of cleaning the underside.  Two small complaints.  1.  Mine drips.  I have tried adjusting it and cleaning the nozel but it still leaks a little.  2.  The water pressure is a little strong.  But it cleans.</li>
            <li> I fall in love with the concept of this product few years back. Since then I have been purchasing them for my residential places, family, friends, and even the my worshiping places. I love it. I changed from my previous brand, which I liked, for pricing reasons. I like this brand has reasonable price combined by a good product.&lt;br /&gt; The product is managed by Amazon directly, I tried to call the manufacturer asking for the t connection as it was defective after I installed almost everything but the tank water piping to the unit.&lt;br /&gt; The company would only support me if I purchased it directly from them and referred me back to Amazon in a stern manner; this is not their issue.&lt;br /&gt; I called Amazon and their solution was to only swipe whole product by another. I decided to purchase a new part to use the t-connection as a spare part then returned the newly purchased product with the defective t-connection back. It took some extra work and buying 2 products at the same time in order not uninstall the product and reinstall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line, this is a great product which I&#x27;d recommend for its great functionality and price.</li>
            <li> it is very great compare the price and the great value of product, it is very good. I recommend it to buy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to be installed, easy to be used even by kids&lt;br /&gt;so useful in the restroom/bath for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful</li>
            <li> This item works great, just do not contact the distributor because they will not get back to you! We had bought a Big John seat and it is great and no more breaking trash seats. This item will not fit a Big John seat, so we put it on our other toilet and it is wonderful and really does the job! Now we all fight over the one toilet! LOL</li>
            <li> I learned about the goodness of these kind of things while staying in Japan, and I am delighted to find that there are some simple, low-cost options for these in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install if you&#x27;re fairly handy. The white plastic water tube (connecting the under-tank adapter to the bidet unit) is a bit hard to push onto its fittings. Someone who is unfamiliar with pipes/tubes may have a hard time installing the compression pipe fittings correctly, since instructions are VERY minimal. I installed it yesterday and have not encountered any dripping so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well at cleaning the underside. The water is cold, but for us that is OK. We&#x27;re not too picky! It&#x27;s really a pretty smart low-tech non-electric design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I share the concern of another rater who mentions that the plastic tubing could lead to flooding. I can imagine that some people might not install the fittings well, too, which could lead to same. The older this tubing gets, and the more times it gets knocked or pulled by cleaning, the more I&#x27;ll worry about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure on these depends on your regular house water pressure. The squirt control knob on the unit is kind of sensitive. I have average house water pressure, and the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; setting on this unit is quite strong, so I&#x27;m guessing it should work even if your water pressure is somewhat low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another rater mentioned correctly that this unit causes your toilet seat to incline downward a bit, because the unit adds a bit of height--maybe 0.4 inches--under the back of your toilet seat. It feels a little bit funny when you sit, but not too bad--there&#x27;s a good chance I&#x27;ll just get used to it. If not, I&#x27;m thinking that I might add some sort of extra spacer under the front of the seat so that it will level it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last tip: once you have everything connected and the water turned back on, don&#x27;t turn the control knob on unless you are sitting down. If you do, you&#x27;ll get an unwanted surprise!</li>
            <li> This unit was leaking after installation, I had to take it apart and file off part of the control knob housing in order to get the dial to turn off completely, I had to do this with a small file. You will also need to buy bolts to install it as the ones in your current seat will not be long enough. Also you will need to add rubber spacers underneath you toilet seat so that it can seat flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already had a unit from a different brand, that unit did not leak, so maybe that&#x27;s an issue just with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I modified the housing the unit works great! This is the second one of this devices that I buy although the firsts was from a different brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Sep 5th 2013, the switch is not working anymore, it got broken in less than a year</li>
            <li> The screw and the pipe that feeds the water are plastic. I bought a different brand before and the pipe was braided steel. I recommend skipping this one and buying something  better.</li>
            <li> As a first time bidet user, I am sold as a result of this purchase. I purchased this bidet to make life a little easier following surgery and have to say, I absolutely love it! Installation was a breeze. I read all the reviews before purchasing and agree that why anyone would need to use a setting other than low is beyond me unless of course you are trying to deter your nosy cat from drinking out of the toilet (yes I have done this a time or two but it is only a temporary deterrent) because it is definitely powerful enough even at the low setting.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like a shower for your bottom and much more convenient than using a handheld shower head in the shower every time.  After seeing the results left in the bowl, it&#x27;s truly amazing and disgusting what tissues paper leaves behind. I plan to purchase two more for the other restrooms.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice is that the bidet tends to drip a little bit if it&#x27;s not completely turned to the &amp;#34;Off&amp;#34; position. For some reason it takes a little extra turn of the knob which almost feels like you&#x27;re turning it too far, listen carefully and you&#x27;ll hear a click and it will be completely turned off and voila no more dripping water. Have been using this for 5 months so far with no other issues.</li>
            <li> The US needs to learn from Europe.  This is a much cleaner bathroom practice, and it not only saves money, it saves trees.  Use of the Bidets also improves the function of septic systems.  The cost of the units is nominal and the savings and health benefits are numerous.</li>
            <li> This is my second bidet. The first one began to leak a week or so after installation. So I decided to give this system a try. Everything necessary for installation was in the box and installation was a breeze. My first impulse was to monitor this equipment for leaks and after a month, there are none. I mean absolutely NONE! The bidet is as described and operates flawlessly. I would recommend use of this product to family and friends, however, I am the only one interested in using it.</li>
            <li> It was easy to install but do make sure you have a wrench and a screwdriver handy. Also as a tip ensure you have a tape handy to avoid any future leakages and can be used during installation.</li>
            <li> As a household we were going through at least a roll of toilet paper per day. Since having bought and installed this we are down to a roll a week. It is very convenient and easy to use. Installation was very simple and took about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> needed it for a friend who had back surgery. She liked it very much, it was a good deal and a good help.</li>
            <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve made for my bum. I&#x27;ve had this now for about 3-4 months and have not had any issues with it. It installed with no problems (other than some issues relating to my toilet, not the bidet). The pressure on it is very high, but I have a very old toilet that takes a long time to fill up, so I need to keep the water pressure high to fill it in a reasonable amount of time. I use it on the low setting and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also calculated how much I used to spend on wipes per year and it actually is more than what I paid for this unit. So if this only lasts me one year, I still end up $5 ahead!</li>
            <li> I like this product, for its simplicity, easy to install and good price. The only draw back: It makes the toilet seat a bit higher at the rear. A universal fit design would make it perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much that this is the xecond one I&#x27;m buying for my other bathroom,&lt;br /&gt;Also the delivery was very timely.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this bidet! How on earth have we give so long without one?&lt;br /&gt;It was a piece of cake to install!&lt;br /&gt;Warning be very careful the first 15 times you use it! I can be very powerful at first!</li>
            <li> Great product! Easy to install. Highly recommended. It has been 3 months with no issues at all. Buy it now</li>
            <li> Is the only one that has fit my low profile toilet which is wider than regular toilets.  My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> The bottom screw which holds the water pressure broke after 10 days of use on both the pieces I had bought. I returned the items.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and it was a good deal I installed it and so far all going well&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product and the seller , If I need more I am most likely to order the same</li>
            <li> Simple and effective. Not difficult to install, there was some minor leaking but tightening it more than just with my hands helped.&lt;br /&gt;No heated water but not an issue in Florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy one and you&#x27;ll want one for every toilet in your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the rare occasion you use the facilities outside your own home you will miss the bidet and the truly clean fresh feeling you are left with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is that a 5 star system may be a bit more industrial, but this model for $25 is awesome and priced just right. My first model broke after a long time and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get a new one.</li>
            <li> Affordable and yet its works the same.  I like how the hose retracts when it is off.  Pressure wise, very strong.</li>
            <li> OK bidet but only has plastic tube from water supply to this unit.  Best to buy a bidet with steel line to unit so no flooding.</li>
            <li> Love this thing it&#x27;s the Best Buy I ever did specially for the woman&#x27;s and the girls it will keep you fresh</li>
            <li> Some of the lower cost bidets can be HARSH spray. This is gentle, and the switch is nice and gradual, a soft start of water, not some butthole destroying water stream from hell like on other models.</li>
            <li> Sturdy,well designed,better than the really expensive ones. I have gifted these to many people all ready. All have loved it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to setup and very simple to use. components are self explanatory and it come with an easy to read full of pics manual; almost like a map. I had one for over 3 months, and I had to buy another one for my parents. The only thing is that you have to be careful with water pressure.</li>
            <li> very good.. i love it!</li>
            <li> This bidet works fine 1 year. After that you have to buy another one. I read before on the reviews they lasted to 2 years, but not for me</li>
            <li> Recommend for the elderly as well as children.. Have purchased 4 Bidets .. Installation easy , adjustments to fittings depends .</li>
            <li> Beats the more expensive models in the ease of installation and has the same effectiveness ... I do highly recommend this product for better hygiene.</li>
            <li> A very good and reliable product! Easy to install, and very good to use. Please keep up the great effort and add more products.</li>
            <li> works good&lt;br /&gt;easy installation</li>
            <li> After a while it started leaking.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Joy Bidet because of all the positive reviews on Amazon, but the seller (SimplyBeautiful) sent the PureClean bidet instead. Seller offered a partial refund if I decided to keep it; she explained that the manufacturer is the same and that it is the same model. The numbers didn&#x27;t jive, but I decided that it was worth a try given the inexpensive &amp;#34;introductory offer&amp;#34; that was available at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products are similar, but the dial is slightly different than the Joy Bidet C-1; no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to install; however, the fitting at the bidet itself is pretty flimsy and if there is a failure it would likely be at that point. It would be easy for someone to install it and try to overtighten it and break it, so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our water pressure is pretty low, so much so that the stream doesn&#x27;t flow until one notch past &amp;#34;low,&amp;#34; which is awfully direct spray, so I have to set it to that point for the nozzle to extend and then back it down to &amp;#34;low.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bathroom this is installed in is on a second floor, so there is plenty of indoor plumbing for water to sit in before it&#x27;s routed to the bidet. That being said, there has been no issue with the water being too cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- UPDATED 5/28/13 -&lt;br /&gt;Sent a JoyBidet as a gift several months ago and the review is so-so. The Pure Clean bidet has a better spray. I have now upgraded the Pure Clean&#x27;s star rating to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- UPDATED 8/8/2016: After nearly four years of regular use, the Pure Clean bidet is still going strong. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I was a little leery at first about a bidet, not familiar with them, but decided I would give it a try. I became frustrated w/ the wiping and not feeling like you are 100% clean. Prior to the purchase I switched to baby wipes, but don&#x27;t even use them as much, because of the nice clean feel you get with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> After having it 2 weeks, it started leaking at the &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; fitting.  Tried to find another &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; fitting to replace it with and could not find one.  Ordered another bidet and it has worked fine.</li>
            <li> Great value does exactly what it should can&#x27;t beat the price. The poor mans bidet. Defently recamend it worth every penny &amp; not a lot of pennies did I have to spend for such a great product. :)</li>
            <li> The device was not complicated to install for someone with no plumbing knowledge.  It is a wonderful product that you will not regret purchasing.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted. We don&#x27;t have space for a full-size bidet in our bathroom, so I decided to give this a try. Saw a similar one in a Home Depot store for USD 59, so this is a good deal. Works great!</li>
            <li> I do not own this item but I&#x27;d just like to quote someone from slickdeals.net:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;After you poop, flush before you use bidet to see how much poop was cleaned out. When I used toilet paper, all that poop use to go on my underwear and would dry and harden in butt making it painful to walk. Not anymore.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well said, my friend.  Well said..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Another user posed the following -&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Some people in the comments on another bidet suggested relaxing and letting it fill you up, then holding it in and \\&quot;gargling\\&quot; with it. How does one go about doing this?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has had fruitful experience learning to gargle with one&#x27;s anus please leave helpful tips here.  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2:  A tale of warning and woe from Shinra&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;SOOOOOOOBBBBBBBBBBB... just got it, at my new workplace (always deliver stuff to work, no one home), the cute girl brought it to me, and before I realized it just shipped in the RETAIL box (yes, with a picture and everything) and I could say \\&quot;Its not for me!\\&quot; she already walked away. GREAT. JUST GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If u just saw the list on the side of the box for \\&quot;IDEAL SOLUTION FOR PEOPLE WITH\\&quot; it lists pretty much every mainstream disorder a person can have related to their #2 hole. Nice, very nice. They need to hire the adult toys packaging companies here, CMON MAN.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you don&#x27;t want everyone prying into your #2 hole then don&#x27;t have it delivered to the cute girl.</li>
            <li> Very use full, easy to install, effective and a great value for money. We are completely satisfied with our purchase with Amazon.</li>
            <li> works fine which means it is acceptable for use however too soon tell if it passes the test of time.</li>
            <li> Pros: easy to install (if the fixed slots width fit your toilet seat screw position), works as designed for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 1) cold water ONLY.....NOT good for New England winter/spring. 2) only three fixed slots to fit the toilet seat screws. If your seat screws are spaced wider or narrower, it won&#x27;t install. 3) once installed under the back side of the seat ring as designed, the front half has a big gap between the ring and the bowl. You need to find something to support the front ring from bottom to secure it. 4) If you want to return it, forget about it. Seller won&#x27;t respond at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a OK product but needs more fine tunes in design. NOT very comfortable to own and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After ~4 months of using now it starts to leak water from the sprayer, not much but constantly dropping. The bad part is there is nowhere to adjust the tension of the spring inside of the sprayer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little cold but that will be fixed in my new home I&#x27;m building with heated water. In a rental right now. Other than that, it works great and still better than not. I have had a full bidet in my previous home with faucets and separate unit next to the toilet. I like this better, more convenient and accurate, hits just at the right spot which can be adjusted with the slotted bolt holes. I&#x27;m a builder, took about 15 mins to install.</li>
            <li> I have simpler designed bidet&#x27;s installed in all 3 bathrooms I&#x27;ve had for the last 14 yrs!  The sprayer is fantastic on these and don&#x27;t splash and hit the spot for all users.  However, with this one, you have to sit all the way back, and I mean all the way, then it does splash on the back of the  seat and has to be wiped after each use.  Also, it seems more of a stream than a spray.  We have high pressure water and you have to slowly move the knob or else you risk poking through an addition hole in your rear!  Yes, it is very painful at Med setting with our water pressure.&lt;br /&gt;The design seems good. Installation does require tooling and care so you don&#x27;t break fittings.  But so far, after 3 months of usage, it still works as new.  Got used to the sprayer but don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it worked with my toilet and does the job. It&#x27;s is priced right. I paid more for my very simple other bidet&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Had to buy one for my existing one to be replaced. We have found this equipment to be  the best investment of all! No complaints so far!</li>
            <li> Reasonable price good quality good plastic material logo package makes it easy to present to my Customer thanks pure clean I will buy more again</li>
            <li> Love the new control handle and pop down spout.....Great pressure and right on spot!  I will recommend this to anyone who cares about clean!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product,function well and even better than what I had before,very easy to install,shipping was at time as mentioned,the price is very fare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product....price is also very reasonable...I will definitely recommend this product to all my friends and family. Just one suggestion....if they have this product available in other colours also...like off white or creamish shade to exactly match our toilet seat....otherwise it&#x27;s a great product....</li>
            <li> As I want and expected but it lack one think which is 2 way spray...it have one way spray not like other one which I had</li>
            <li> The product arrived in r√©cord time and i Could not make it fit oitvwas a one porvenir and my toilet is a one piece unit , too low to the floor to attach the plumbing , so i had to make an adjustment&lt;br /&gt;After the adjustment it turned out to constanst drip in the Noel with the valve off , not good</li>
            <li> Install sucks, depending on what kind of toilet u have, YMMV, but even when done, the whole system doesnt \\&quot;fit\\&quot; so now the back end of my toilet seat is about half an inch higher than the front.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it, not horrible, but I fear the cheap plastic near the attachment will crack after extended use since the significant amount of weight is being pressured there first over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray is ok, pretty good pressure, more then I expected.  The fine spray streams can be a bit irritating but may you have to find the best combo of power and cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is the leak.  There are 2-3 leaks, and 2 of them are from the plastic parts and hose attachment.  I turned them pretty tight, but afraid to go tighter for obvious reasons, esp the plastic.  This is pretty inconvenient.  I guess I can use some silicone or something, or waterproof taping, but thats a crappy hassle for a simple attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it seems like it does the main job it was intended, but we&#x27;ll see after a couple of months of use.  Too bad I only use this on weekends pretty much because of long weekday work days, so it wont really get that much use.</li>
            <li> Excellent bang for your buck!  This product will clean most posteriors on low setting.  Only the brave will try any setting higher than the low setting.  Let me say that another way.  I don&#x27;t know why you would want to use a setting higher than low because it is that powerful.  Money well spent...</li>
            <li> My family loves it. Very healthy and clean. Adding a 2nd one to our other bath.</li>
            <li> Assembly was a pain. Had to buy additional parts. Product is good but wish it could heat the water. ;-)</li>
            <li> Great system and easy to install!</li>
            <li> It is a great product, convenient to install. However I had ordered quantity of 3, but 1 of them has shut off issues where it is marked as &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. Probably QA  was not done correctly. Though I am still using it as I got lazy to uninstall it and send it back.</li>
            <li> It started leaking water after 6 months</li>
            <li> After trying the other brand where I had difficulty of pushing small plastic water tube over small fittings at both ends,  I got this one and found it very customer friendly from installation point. It literally took only about 15 minutes to install. Functionally it works very well. The only draw back is instead of fine stream of water it comes out as a spray needing more toilet paper to dry covered area. The idea of using bidet is to minimize toilet paper and also get good cleaning. This also should help save some trees if adopted by masses.  Please try to correct this anomaly and everything will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to install this bidet on all our toilets. Glad to see this reasonably priced gadget for better hygiene.</li>
            <li> very good product. It is easy to use, easy to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
