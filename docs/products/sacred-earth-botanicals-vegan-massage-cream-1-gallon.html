            <li>I like the product very much, my massage therapist uses it during all massages and we both are happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I always use this product and love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite massage cream.</li>
            <li>I feel confident touching&lt;br /&gt;clients</li>
            <li>I found this cream through a friend over a year ago and immediately fell in love.</li>

            <li>My clients love it.</li>
            <li>My clients love the ingredients and how their skin feels after.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, I have been a therapist for almost 9 years and have yet to find anything better.  </li>
            <li>Thanks sacred earth!!!!</li>
            <li>Clean, amazing consistence, and non staining.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a clinical therapist for nearly 11 years, and this in the purest, loveliest, most sacred creme that you can manipulate to act as glide as you require, and do some GREAT trigger point/</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best out of everything.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a massage therapist for over 13 years and this is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Very mild scent with a great consistency for both swedish and deep tissue massage.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re very particular about your massage products of being as chemical free as possible, and unscented, this is the  perfect massage creme for you to use on clients.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for deep tissue and hot stone massage plus it does not smell.</li>
            <li>It has glide but still good for deep tissue work.</li>
            <li>so I am lucky to be able to drive to a direct supplier to buy it.</li>
            <li>Nice slip / grip ratio, low scent, doesn&#x27;t leave clients feeling &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Excellent consistency, maintains glide with minimal usage so the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Lasts long and great for deep tissue work.</li>
            <li>SEB cream has more and longer lasting glide than their lotion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Further, if you have any clients that are allergic to nuts, this product is completely nut oil free.  </li>
            <li>The cream is better suited for swedish massage, clients with dry skin or body hair.</li>
            <li>It stays around long enough to provide nice glide, but melts right into the skin leaving no residue.</li>
            <li>I am highly allergic to lotions and creams and this product has no ill affects.</li>
            <li>It is also totally chemical free.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really a pleasure to work with.</li>
            <li>It works well with light touch and well as myofascial or deep work.</li>
            <li>They are also very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for massage therapists and anyone looking for a cream for their bodies!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is just lovely, fluffy cream.</li>
            <li>This stuff is made in the town where I live</li>
            <li>It is very comparable to Biotone massage cream, I can switch back and forth between the two with no problem.</li>
            <li>a professional massage therapist.  </li>
            <li>but Coghlan&#x27;s makes one that is nearly identical to biotone&#x27;s, and they are sold at REI in the camping section for food use on camping trips.  </li>
            <li>I love it, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>especially if clients have kids at home with such allergies that seem to be on the rise and are very</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years now, after my skin became sensitive to using biotone products.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out, a little bit goes a long way, and it&#x27;s VEGAN :)</li>
            <li>got a gallon, this time, just because I have started going more often and this should last me for at least 6+ months!</li>
            <li>It is just right, a little goes a long way and stays on the skin for the time you are working on an area but absorbs after, making that greasy feeling non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> My massage therapists love this cream, it has great slide and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.  It is also totally chemical free.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;ve been a clinical therapist for nearly 11 years, and this in the purest, loveliest, most sacred creme that you can manipulate to act as glide as you require, and do some GREAT trigger point/NMT work using it to strip, remove TP&#x27;s. etc. Just amazing.</li>
            <li> Excellent massage cream. Lasts long and great for deep tissue work.</li>
            <li> Loved the product!  Ordering more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed massage therapist and have been using this product for over 2 years for massages and it is an excellent lubricant. It has glide but still good for deep tissue work.</li>
            <li> Truly one of the best massage creams I have used in my practice. Thank you for a quality cream.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite massage cream and have been using it for 7 years. My clients like that it is unscented and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling at the end of their massage. Added bonus is that in winter they get the extra moisture that they forget to give their bodies during the cold/dry weather. It is mostly hypo-allergenic except for my clients who are allergic to lavender. Since I use it every day I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with developing a sensitivity to the ingredients like what had happened when I had been using biotone at the beginning of my practice.</li>
            <li> This massage cream has been loved by every massage therapist I have brought it to. It has a great feel too it, little to no odor at all and it lasts!&lt;br /&gt;I got a gallon, this time, just because I have started going more often and this should last me for at least 6+ months!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Doesn&#x27;t dry out, a little bit goes a long way, and it&#x27;s VEGAN :)</li>
            <li> Excellent consistency, maintains glide with minimal usage so the product lasts a long time. Ingredients are mostly organic, with no parabens. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Sacred Earth Vegan Massage Cream is the best massage cream on the market.  It has the perfect blend of friction versus glide.  And you won&#x27;t find a more organic cream anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist, but I also use this massage cream as a regular body moisturizer for my family.</li>
            <li> this is a great massage lotion that has an oil-like glide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has a VERY light lotion smell but it otherwise UNSCENTED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend warming it a little but it does warm on the body and hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**VEGAN**</li>
            <li> Recommended for all massage professionals.  Finest cream on the market, 100% pure--vegan.  Great glide. Have tried other creams but none compared.</li>
            <li> i do believe this is one of the best if not the very best massage cream. I have used it from time to time. However, i&#x27;m not always up for paying the price. This stuff is made in the town where I live so I am lucky to be able to drive to a direct supplier to buy it. The only problem is, the last time I drove over there they were out of it. This is why i shop at Amazon. If you want me to buy locally you have to keep up with your inventory. I&#x27;m so over driving all over town to look for stuff that is out of stock... but back to the cream- it&#x27;s really a pleasure to work with. if it cost a bit less i don&#x27;t think id ever use anything else.</li>
            <li> I am highly allergic to lotions and creams and this product has no ill affects. Very good quality and great for any type of massage! Thanks sacred earth!!!!</li>
            <li> SEB cream has more and longer lasting glide than their lotion.  I&#x27;m a LMT and use their lotion for deep tissue. The cream is better suited for swedish massage, clients with dry skin or body hair. Excellent product from a company I trust.</li>
            <li> This is just lovely, fluffy cream. It stays around long enough to provide nice glide, but melts right into the skin leaving no residue. I greatly appreciate that there are no soy products as I&#x27;m allergic. Please do not change the formula to go for cheaper oils and ingredients.</li>
            <li> I always use this product and love it. Not too greasy and you get great glide when needed.</li>
            <li> Best massage cream I&#x27;ve used in my 14 years in practice.  Also, no stains on any of my Sposh microfiber sheets.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite massage cream. It is organic and silky. I feel confident touching&lt;br /&gt;clients with this quality product as well as letting the ingredients contained in this&lt;br /&gt;cream to penetrate my skin.</li>
            <li> Very good product, quick delivery</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re very particular about your massage products of being as chemical free as possible, and unscented, this is the  perfect massage creme for you to use on clients.  I use this for Ashiatsu (barefoot)massage.  It&#x27;s oily enough to provide a glide, but not too slippery to where my feet slide off, like if I was to use oil.  The instructors recommend another brand of massage creme for Ashiatsu work, but it had its share of chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Best Massage Cream ever!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the product very much, my massage therapist uses it during all massages and we both are happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic and all, it does not have any harsh ingredients which could irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product 4 stars and not 5 because I am not too too crazy about the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t hate it or anything, but it does have a slight scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go home after a massage and take a shower [what one is supposed to do anyways]</li>
            <li> Like this cream south I traded all my biotone orders. Do not like the sharp edged cream jar as if cuts into spatula and hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 7 years.  I&#x27;ve tried others, but nothing else compares. My clients love it too! There is no scent and it doesn&#x27;t leave them feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and I love this massage cream! It is very comparable to Biotone massage cream, I can switch back and forth between the two with no problem. I have been using this cream for about a year and a half now and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I am tried creams lotions and oils.  This is hands down the best out of everything.  Highly recommended for massage therapists and anyone looking for a cream for their bodies!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a professional massage therapist.  I will NEVER buy anything else again!</li>
            <li> I found this cream through a friend over a year ago and immediately fell in love. It has great glide, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot which is great because it is a pricey. It&#x27;s great for deep tissue and hot stone massage plus it does not smell. This is the only cream I use. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a really great cream.  Wonderful for deep tissue, glides well and doesn&#x27;t clump up like some others.  Fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a massage therapist for over 13 years and this is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve ever used! Clean, amazing consistence, and non staining.  It works well with light touch and well as myofascial or deep work.</li>
            <li> This is, without a doubt the loveliest cream ever!&lt;br /&gt;Buy this... your hands will thank you</li>
            <li> My clients love it. I love it, a little goes a long way. Wonderful for all modalities just, use good judgment on amount being used. You will have wonderful results. This cream is TOPS!!!</li>
            <li> I have been a massage therapist for 13 years and this is one of the best creams I have come by. Very mild scent with a great consistency for both swedish and deep tissue massage. My clients love the ingredients and how their skin feels after.</li>
            <li> This product has been a mainstay of my practice since I found it. Nice slip / grip ratio, low scent, doesn&#x27;t leave clients feeling &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now, after my skin became sensitive to using biotone products.  It is not too heavy, so clients do not need to shower after treatments.  It is just right, a little goes a long way and stays on the skin for the time you are working on an area but absorbs after, making that greasy feeling non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, if you have any clients that are allergic to nuts, this product is completely nut oil free.  I always worried about using products with nuts in them since even trace amounts can cause severe reactions in some... especially if clients have kids at home with such allergies that seem to be on the rise and are very dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it took a little bit of searching to find a refillable tube to put the stuff in but Coghlan&#x27;s makes one that is nearly identical to biotone&#x27;s, and they are sold at REI in the camping section for food use on camping trips.  They are also very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I have been a therapist for almost 9 years and have yet to find anything better.  And it&#x27;s all organic, so no pesticides seeping into your skin from daily use.</li>
