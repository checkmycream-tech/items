            <li>This epilator is WONDERFUL!  </li>

            <li>Very good device, will get rid of the hair</li>
            <li>It was very good and pushed me towards the purchase.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a very good amount of time and recharges rapidly.  </li>
            <li>I think this is great product.</li>
            <li>This a great product.</li>
            <li>The Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive is a great epilator.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great not having to be close to an outlet.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone, because it was after all a costy price tag for a not so great epilator.</li>
            <li>This product is great</li>
            <li>This epilator does a great job at ripping out hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m daaaaarn happy</li>
            <li>This has worked GREAT for me.  </li>
            <li>The shaver attachment works great.  </li>
            <li>The rechargeable unit is great, no bother with cords when trying to get those tricky areas.  </li>
            <li>it works great on my underarms.</li>
            <li>Great in any way for what was designed to do.</li>
            <li>A co-worker suggested the lower model and showed me all these great customer reviews, being how I am, I wanted all the bells and whistles</li>
            <li>I just do my underarms and bikini line now and still shave in between once in a great while.</li>
            <li>A great tip I got was to put powder on the area your doing, it makes it easier</li>
            <li>Anyway, the product is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: Three weeks on and it&#x27;s been great not having to shave under my arms every couple of days.</li>
            <li>The bag is great to keep everything together.  </li>
            <li>Great being rechargable now and heaps quieter.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>It still works great</li>
            <li>I will b happy.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I did.</li>
            <li>This is great.</li>
            <li>We both love it!!  </li>
            <li>I tried the epilater &amp; love it!!</li>
            <li>I found the combination of the epilator and the princereigns to be very effective.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you keep your skin taut to get the best results!</li>
            <li>and I found bending my arm across the top of my head was the best I could do</li>
            <li>The product is great and in good condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Braun for a wonderful product :)</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>and I thought this would be a good option to save money.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after my sister got one and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this epilator and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good thing is that you can both epilate and trim.  </li>
            <li>The under arm cap might be good to do it, but I haven&#x27;t tried.    </li>
            <li>My boyfriend has also used it and found the product to be a good buy.</li>
            <li>this was a good thing.</li>
            <li>good luck!&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimming/shaving head also does a good job and switching between the two heads is effortless.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product and value for money.</li>
            <li>I returned it, and bought the 7681 from another company; and am delighted with it.</li>
            <li>After shopping price found the best one right here on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Luckily this comes with the shaver WHICH IS AWESOME!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, worth the money.</li>
            <li>Truly this is a great product and I will be recommending it to my daughter as shaving has been a source of literal irritation. :)</li>
            <li>the best product ever, totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>and it was SO rewarding to see all the hair piled up on it, as well as under the caps when I cleaned the devise!  </li>
            <li>The best invention ever XD and the light makes it much more amazing.</li>
            <li>The Braun epilator did not remove as many hairs as the Emjoi!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!    </li>
            <li>you guys would love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>So if like me you&#x27;re scared of the pain - stick with it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li>The rechargeable battery is phenomenal!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li>LOve it !</li>
            <li>You need a very light touch to get a good contact.  </li>
            <li>The light on the epilator is great because it enables you to see the hair as you are trying to remove it.</li>
            <li>Another great feature is the light.</li>
            <li>The shaver head is absolutely amazing beacuse</li>
            <li>and it really works great!</li>
            <li>and then you are good to go. :-)     </li>
            <li>its your own fault.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing about this epilator is that it comes with a shaving head.  </li>
            <li>Although it worked well in the beginning, it was no longer effective after using it for couple of times and eventually died.</li>
            <li>Waxing has always been spottily effective for me.    </li>
            <li>Also, the shaver head is handy to trim bikini hair, and to shave areas</li>
            <li>but my wife, who had all kind of epilators, says there it&#x27;s no comparison.</li>
            <li>I really liked seeing a demonstration of how it worked.    </li>
            <li>They went away overnight, so I would give yourself a day or two if you are planning on nice legs for an event.  </li>
            <li>I honestly think it doesn&#x27;t hur</li>
            <li>I dont mind it though as I have my own wipes</li>
            <li>I had to replace an older model that I lost, but this model is the best I&#x27;d ever had.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li>I think setting aside time every week to use the epilator is a good schedule to go over areas that might not be as smooth as you want them</li>
            <li>so its nice to be able to just shave those areas.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Braun Silk-Epil for over 10 years, and this model is by far the best!</li>
            <li>BE SURE to follow the directions and clean your skin immediatly before using the epilator!!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I got really brave and decided to try my bikini area...</li>
            <li>This is my first ever epilator, I&#x27;m so happy on choosing Braun as they are long-time proven and tested on epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too many attachments</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be better at using it.  </li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature is the battery, this model lets you plug it and charge it, and use it anywhere.</li>
            <li>I also think there has to be a better way to remove hair.  </li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t made it to the bikini area yet, but I&#x27;m sure I will.      </li>
            <li>The Braun removed more hairs, faster.  </li>
            <li>I loathe and love epilating my bikini line</li>
            <li>I have been using it all summer and am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>: when you change legs while epiating, you will feel it more.</li>
            <li>The epilator itself is adorable and sparkly</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Ok, so let me start out by saying that I have had my epilator for almost 4 months</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how short my hair could be</li>
            <li>Note to anyone who might buy this, make sure that you are using an exfoliator on your legs each day once you start epilating or you WILL get ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>5.5 - Lower legs hurt more than the thighs, and I&#x27;ve had more ingrown hairs on my lower legs.</li>
            <li>This is definitely more preferable to waxing.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, this review has been helpful to most.</li>
            <li>so I purchased it and was sooo impressed and decided to give it to my daughter who has the same issues.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on each product and the reviews were so convincing that I bought it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many epilators before I found this one.</li>
            <li>I notice a lot more hair growth then when I use this product.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is rechargeable and can use it without the cord getting in the way.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>However, I also must admit that I was able to epilate my legs without problems.</li>
            <li>In summary, I don&#x27;t recommend this product because you will not be able to use it for all parts of your body.</li>
            <li>Or even better, buy an epilator which works as described and claimed...</li>
            <li>- Use the pre-epilation wipes (anyone know where you can get more of those???).  </li>
            <li>my hubby gifted Braun Silk epil on my birthday...</li>
            <li>and in the morning TA DA......I love my skin....</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I love this epilator, I bought it after doing an extensive online search for the product, I found the best deal on amazon for it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I just love the results.</li>
            <li>My underarms have been smooth and no bumps!</li>
            <li>The epilator has gotten SO MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li>I have used it three times since then and I still get the occasional ingrown, but I have been exfoliating a ton, which is what helps the best.</li>
            <li>and I am no longer ripping off layers of my skin! :-) :-)</li>
            <li>and I love it, but I noticed it cuts hair instead of pulling them..</li>
            <li>This was the most painless epilation experience I had</li>
            <li>My legs stay smooth for almost 2 weeks!     </li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>I love this hair remover.  </li>
            <li>~LOVE</li>
            <li>Tried it a couple more times as an epilator</li>
            <li>I also feel like I am more thorough.  </li>
            <li>I also feel like I am more thorough.  </li>
            <li>It hurts a bit but the pain will decrease the more you use it.</li>
            <li>My legs truly have never felt or looked better.  </li>
            <li>It did pinch a bit, but with practice, it should be ok.</li>
            <li>which one is better quality.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s best to use when the hair growth is tiny.</li>
            <li>our older product from Braun was still good and we gifted it to someone!    </li>
            <li>I am usually pretty good at understanding instructions because most of the time it is self-explanatory.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator and just bought it because my sister bought it too and loved it.   </li>
            <li>I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED!     </li>
            <li>My boy friend loves to use it to shave his mustache than his own because it shaves more smoothly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>Amazon is always awesome with most of it&#x27;s products &amp; prices, sometimes deals you can find here cannot be found at other places.</li>
            <li>Very cool product.    </li>
            <li>There are also suggestions to make the experience more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The battery is great, so far I&#x27;ve epilated my under arm 3 times and my lower let 2 times</li>
            <li>I bought it primarily for my face, but will resort to electrolysis which is more permanent.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and looks so cute with the gillter on it :)</li>
            <li>so easy to use, love the light feature and that you can use it cordless.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a great product, I love that it is cordless.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy for a newbie to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Doing my legs was a easy, as I said I&#x27;ve done them before anyway but</li>
            <li>No matter how much you think that you have a good lighting, you will just appreciate the light in it.</li>
            <li>The light is very useful, and love that it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li>All the functions are very good, and keeps my legs smooth for quite a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just zapped thefew really fine hairs that had started to appear under my arms.</li>
            <li>I have been using epilators for several years and I must stay that this one is certainly the best I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Time will tell whether I decide to buy more, though, based on cost as well as if they are still useful as the hair thins out.      </li>
            <li>Your legs will never feel that smooth with this no matter how often you use it.  </li>
            <li>My legs wouldn&#x27;t get as smooth as they do with shaving, but I could go about a week without having to re-do them.  </li>
            <li>but you end up have a smooth shave</li>
            <li>the pain was worth it:)....</li>
            <li>I saw this model and decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;Its smooth -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, the area is now smooth as silk, but it was a lot of work.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the area is now smooth as silk, but it was a lot of work.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product last month and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>and it leaves the skin smooth with NO bumps.</li>
            <li>Yes it hurts, but you have smooth skin for over a week.</li>
            <li>I was not eager to spend so much money on a device that would cause me pain, but I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my investment.</li>
            <li>I also have fair, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that you can charge up the piece and the charge keeps for a fair long time</li>
            <li>I tried different caps and found the normal massaging head was the best.  </li>
            <li>The light is useful if you have really fine or light hair.     </li>
            <li>My skin is so dry shaving just causes too much irritation, I&#x27;m so happy I gave this a try!</li>
            <li>If you can withstand the pain in the underarms, the results are well worth it!</li>
            <li>First off I&#x27;d like to say this is an OKAY epilator.</li>
            <li>It has a really cool light that helps you to see the hair</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.    </li>
            <li>First time I used, I was before my period, so much more sensible.</li>
            <li>~having to wait for significant regrowth between treatments is a MYTH.  </li>
            <li>This purchase was replacing a 12+ year old Braun that I was very happy with, but finally died.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is great &amp; worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Near the end, I was much more confident and had conquered the pain.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping to have better luck with the epilator and so far it feels better.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping to have better luck with the epilator and so far it feels better.  </li>
            <li>But overall, the product is good and very useful.</li>
            <li>I have tried Braun&#x27;s Soft perfection, silk x&#x27;elle, Pansonic&#x27;s wet and dry epilator and also Phillips satinelle and the Braun 7781 was the best, most superior epilator I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>You must use this frequently (short hair) and practice exfoliation however, being a fair skinned person no amount of exfoliation relieves me of bumps.  </li>
            <li>Epilating is now not painful at all.</li>
            <li>&amp; I absolutely fell in love with......</li>
            <li>When I use the epil, I get a full two weeks.  </li>
            <li>on the whole I love my Silk epil....</li>
            <li>So I think my plan of weekly until the hairs grow back slower is a good idea.    </li>
            <li>It is even not painful for me.</li>
            <li>The light can be difficult to work with, it can \\&quot;hide\\&quot; hairs as some have noted, it is very bright, but if you look at an angle across the light you can see the ultra fine hairs, as well as the ultra-smooth results!  </li>
            <li>easy to use, recharge fast and smooth .</li>
            <li>It does seem pretty well constructed and easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and convenient to use, the first time I used it, it hurt a lot.</li>
            <li>I have an earlier version of Braun&#x27;s Silk - Epil which although took some time to get used to, did an excellent job in getting a clean shave that last for weeks.  </li>
            <li>Clean up is easy and fast.</li>
            <li>It does take several passes to get all of the hairs, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be more efficient at it with time.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product to use in your legs, but extremely painfull for bikini area and underarms.</li>
            <li>First of all, when you use it on your legs, don&#x27;t expect a smooth feel</li>
            <li>Be aware, you won&#x27;t get the perfectly smooth, just shaved with a razor, feel when epilating.  </li>
            <li>That was the very first time I ever used it.</li>
            <li>After one week my legs felt still pretty smooth</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Day4: Took the epilator to both legs and it clearly found more hairs on the originally shaved leg.</li>
            <li>Really like this one, it&#x27;s easy to use, painless, fast and clean!</li>
            <li>It took a couple of minutes and hardly felt anything (honestly!!)</li>
            <li>Also I should say that I have very fair and sensitive skin, dark hair and well-rooted but fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It works very well, and it is not painful!</li>
            <li>When I heard of this epilator of Braun, I thought it would be time for a change, for a new, more professionel model.</li>
            <li>I really like it, I can&#x27;t say if another one is better or not since this is my first one</li>
            <li>I used some aloe gel on my legs to soothe them after the first session, and the pain and redness were reduced almost immediately!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this epilator regularly for 6 weeks, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>and I am not even aware of any discomfort!     </li>
            <li>Yes the first time it did pinch, but no razor cuts or pulling of hairs in-mass out of my body!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>And it takes a little time to get the hang of it, and it takes a lot of guts to keep going, but once you decide to do so, the results are great.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful to know about some information</li>
            <li>Honestly, I may just go back to waxing.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>I doubt I&#x27;ll make my easing into the most sensitive areas until after swimsuit season</li>
            <li>I just finished using my epilator for the first time tonight (full bikini area).  </li>
            <li>Of course I was much more determined to complete the bikini area since it&#x27;s the reason I bought this product, and I don&#x27;t mind shaving my underarms</li>
            <li>Of course I was much more determined to complete the bikini area since it&#x27;s the reason I bought this product, and I don&#x27;t mind shaving my underarms every day.</li>
            <li>I have more sensitive skin and the redness lasted two days.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used it on my underarms, but I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li>It does its job pretty quickly</li>
            <li>I love all the different attachments and the fact that I can clean it with water.</li>
            <li>I suggest to spend few more dollars and buy this product than a Remington!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use it.</li>
            <li>and it is true at i got is more like Braun 7681 Silk-Epil 7 Xpressive Pro Epilator with the extra head</li>
            <li>but like most of us I&#x27;ve pretty sensitive skin, whick reacts to tiniest of irritation..</li>
            <li>I bought this product through amazon at a fantastic price, mainly because it is washable and also works with and without the cord, although I don&#x27;t recommend it with the cord while in the shower.</li>
            <li>Luckily hair grows at different rates and I should be able to remove it in stages from now on, as it starts to grow back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a general note, trim your hairs if they are longer than 1/4\\&quot;, because the epilator will hurt more otherwise.    </li>
            <li>So much more economical than burning through batteries left and right.  </li>
            <li>overall I strongly recommend everyone out there to have one!</li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be standing in the shower wasting water whilst I used it!</li>
            <li>It hurts the first time, but it&#x27;s very tolerable and quick.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>Stomach and lower back: 1-1.5 - Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I suppose if you have a high pain tolerance you might think that its not painful at all</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is very smooth on your skin, and have several accessories to adapt to different parts of your body.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to exfoliate frequently as this area is highly prone to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that was very important, but even with all my bathroom lights on, the incorporated light helps you find those hidden hairs you missed.    </li>
            <li>Absolute garbage!  </li>
            <li>I got my knee caps done and it worked pretty well on them.  </li>
            <li>And after the first time, it is a walk in the park.</li>
            <li>Just so you are aware</li>
            <li>So just be aware of it.</li>
            <li>;-))</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I think that for this price Amazon should make sure that the product is sealed and if returned should be properly cleansed.</li>
            <li>and I know for a fact that if I didn&#x27;t have that, I would have many patches of hair left over.  </li>
            <li>Which, of course, at first i wanted to blame the product on but its not the products fault if you get ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>really well!    </li>
            <li>I was afarid at first of one of the reviewers who mentioned that the photo is not what you get</li>
            <li>It delivers exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it HURT.</li>
            <li>Had I not read these reviews that encourage you to keep on using it, I would have given up in the first minute.</li>
            <li>it charges pretty fast and NO!</li>
            <li>I can get rid of deadskin and also Tan;)</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t pull out all of them at the first.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m a masochist, but I like the way it feels on my legs, but when I moved to my upper arms, it was a bit of a shock, and I did feel more pain there,</li>
            <li>Epilating will hurt the first time (...Epilators are plucking a group of hairs at once).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it felt like taking hot sandpaper to my lower legs.</li>
            <li>Time it took to do the lower and most of the upper legs: the first time it took about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t lie, it really hurt!</li>
            <li>I bought a home laser removal system (HPL) but haven&#x27;t kept at it consistently</li>
            <li>I epilated my underarms first because I heard it was easier if you were accustomed to waxing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but buy it without thinking this is one of the best.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>However, that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a great product.    </li>
            <li>I had my first bikini wax at a salon recently and loved the immediate result, but it didn&#x27;t last as my skin almost immediately became irritated</li>
            <li>I had my first bikini wax at a salon recently and loved the immediate result, but it didn&#x27;t last as my skin almost immediately became irritated</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest reading the instructions first, as there are so many different heads with different purposes.  </li>
            <li>At best you&#x27;re removing 1/2 the hairs as the other half are in the resting stages.</li>
            <li>The Braun rarely misses a hair, and the built in light allows you to catch those few easily.  </li>
            <li>Waxing left my fair skin with redness for several days.  </li>
            <li>Having been a little skeptical about the ability of the Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator to effectively remove all hair, I must say I have been impressed with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>I thought that I was getting the dry epilator (which was fine), but they sent me the upgraded wet/dry version!</li>
            <li>The first minut is really a pain, but then you get used to it.</li>
            <li>If you can make it through the first pass, I would think that maintenance going forward is much easier.    </li>
            <li>if you were old belive me it is true so you will have to avoid all of this.  </li>
            <li>Trusting my own experience and ignoring the reviews I ordered the product and my decision didn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my wife, had same brand in the past, very happy with it, so far problem free, truly German engineering and made, she thinks to keep it as long as it is working or a new technology comes up, even the old Braun, she gave it away in a perfect condition, used it for over 10 years, hoping this one to last 20!</li>
            <li>Additionally, I found that this model is too large to get close  to the nose area.</li>
            <li>The quality is very high and the variety of attachments makes epilating an easy, if not totally painless process.</li>
            <li>I heard about epilating from a friend of mine...but was reluctant to experiment new thing!!....</li>
            <li>As a veteran epilator of many years, I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of my new Braun.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks just tiny fine hairs appeared and were even easier to remove.</li>
            <li>Luckily hair grows at different rates and I should be able to remove it in stages from now on, as it starts to grow back.    </li>
            <li>But I persevered, gritted my teeth, did the breathing exercises they tell you to do for child birth and stuck with it (then treated myself to a large glass of wine afterwards which really helped</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fully charged I was ready, gave my legs a quick wipe with the included Pre-epilation wipes and proceeded.&lt;br /&gt;Not having to be next to a power point (my old one was corded) is a great bonus and the smartlight really shows up the little hairs that you&#x27;d otherwise miss&lt;br</li>
            <li>This handy little shaver/epilator is a must for every gal.</li>
            <li>but I think your pain tolerance has to be pretty darn high.  </li>
            <li>If you are on the fence about this product, be assured it is a very high quality and very well made device.</li>
            <li>we are happy with it so far and hope that it will go same long way as our older product.</li>
            <li>And while at first, the pain is similar to the first time waxing, or quickly removing a strong adhesive bandage, it does not take long to become accustomed to it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to wash and what could seem like a gadget the little light on it really allows you to see every single hairs you are trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li>It was so painful, but it&#x27;s great for touching up the bikini line.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the discomfort is really nothing if you are used to waxing.</li>
            <li>had to order the part I really wanted from someone else</li>
            <li>if you move the epil too fast, it won&#x27;t pick up all the hair.  </li>
            <li>They were smooth immediately after but became prickly the next day which never happens when I wax.     </li>
            <li>However, the towels and the massaging head didn&#x27;t really make any difference with the pain</li>
            <li>It really minimizes hair growth if you use it all the time.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not quite ready to try the epilator on.</li>
            <li>I think that for this part, I&#x27;ll keep going to the saloon, even because there are parts we can&#x27;t reach very well</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t come with the face cap.</li>
            <li>grow so much eather</li>
            <li>when I tried the epilator head on underarms it hurt so much</li>
            <li>Regardless, I think this product is much safer (</li>
            <li>field\\&quot;. Very versatile and practical.</li>
            <li>That really helps with the itches and ingrowns.</li>
            <li>And really if you can deal with the pain (which I think is nothing on my legs and underarms)</li>
            <li>Ok, really, I&#x27;m not ready to dump my shaver as I&#x27;m still scared of trying the underarms.</li>
            <li>Before I bought the product, I did research it and appreciated EVERYONE&#x27;S reviews, here on Amazon and just googling the web.</li>
            <li>I went through a year&#x27;s worth of laser treatments (COMPLETELY PAINLESS, BTW) in my bikini area</li>
            <li>But you also won&#x27;t have to allow the hair to grow out as much as you do in between waxes, and you won&#x27;t have to pay $48 for the service.  </li>
            <li>But you also won&#x27;t have to allow the hair to grow out as much as you do in between waxes, and you won&#x27;t have to pay $48 for the service.  </li>
            <li>It works very well for the underarms.  </li>
            <li>I just fried my Braun 2370 epilator after about 5 yrs, not having appreciated that my overseas converter didn&#x27;t have a transformer also.</li>
            <li>My legs are SO much smoother, and for longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and works very well, charging process takes around 40-45 min.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it on my underarms, that I couldn&#x27;t do, too much pain.  </li>
            <li>My legs are a different story, the first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t heed the warnings of my co-worker and just went all out with a leg full of hair.</li>
            <li>And yes, the facial epilator works very well, although, that is the most sensitive area I&#x27;ve done yet.</li>
            <li>If I attempt to shave more frequently than once every 3 days, my skin gets irritated, itchy, and red.    </li>
            <li>It charges completely in 1 hour, which lets you get right in there and start.  </li>
            <li>It feels like little shocks, but after pulling out the first hairs, it get much better.</li>
            <li>As far as the pain goes, the sections that proved to be pretty intense were the underarm and the bikini area.</li>
            <li>- the first session seems time consuming (30 minutes for both legs) compared to a quick shave in the shower, but I think it will be better next time as there will be less hair</li>
            <li>I have been waxing EVERYTHING for over a year (underarms, full brazilian, and legs; I get my eyebrows threaded because my skin is too sensitive) and it is a pain to get waxed because the lady I go to is really far away from my house</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t any more pleasant or painful than I had imagined.</li>
            <li>and now I can&#x27;t live without it !</li>
            <li>It is much better than the previous one I had before.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly i think it&#x27;s actually more painful than waxing or just plucking by hand.</li>
            <li>I have an older Braun epilator and was in need of an upgrade.</li>
            <li>Have yet to try it on my underarms as I would get a lot of ingrown hairs from using the older one.  </li>
            <li>I had tried the older model which was non-chargable.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t go for the 7281 mainly because it supposedly does not turn on when in the charger mode for safety reasons</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thoroughly recommend this model, compared to my older model</li>
            <li>I choose this model for the quick rechargable feature as I am a working mom and not extra time on my hands.  </li>
            <li>it gave a very close shave in sensitive areas but felt absolutely safe unlike a conventional razor.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this particular model.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re nervous or hesitant, I highly recommend going to YouTube and searching for Braun epil.</li>
            <li>The enclosed wipes are helpful in that if you wipe in the direction you&#x27;re going to epilate then the hairs stand up a little better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure, due to the nature of what the machine is doing, there is no such thing as a painless epilator.  </li>
            <li>The beginner cap was OK, but removes so little hair at one time, it&#x27;s sort of like prolonging the torture.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Decided it was time to invest in a new one and particularly wanted one for doing under my arms.</li>
            <li>But overall, this is quite useful</li>
            <li>My legs, however, will never see a normal razor again.</li>
            <li>However, the results are worth the initial pain</li>
            <li>Definitely tolerable and so worth the results.  </li>
            <li>Day3 result: Shaved leg is finally starting to feel just barely stubbly, while epilated leg still feels 97% smooth like day1.</li>
            <li>The hair growth is normal.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s brilliant and does a much better job, much quicker and less painfully</li>
            <li>Charges quick and holds the charge a long time.  </li>
            <li>but if you are new to epilating there are somethings you have to learn about, like exfoliating...</li>
            <li>6- here is somthing new with all the stretching &amp; bulling  of the skin that comes with the waxing your skin with time will look like</li>
            <li>Since I have been using an epilator for a while I didn&#x27;t have the pain that comes with being new epilating.  </li>
            <li>The Silk-Epil truly is a new generation.  </li>
            <li>I am brand new to epilating and didn&#x27;t know if this was for me.  </li>
            <li>I was content with it, but it was night compared to the day of this new model.</li>
            <li>As the upper lip was primarily the reason for purchasing the newer model, I finally gave up and  repackaged this Braun.</li>
            <li>I did get red bumps, but I have very sensitive skin, so it is pretty normal for me regardless of shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Olay pre-epilation wipes, they don&#x27;t seem to take away the pain, but they do help relieve some of the post-epilation stinging and sensitivity (use them as directed, my skin is really sensitive post epilation</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also very loud.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty fine, and I have a lot of it, blonde peach fuzz and dark hairs.</li>
            <li>And every week I&#x27;d go a little further up my inner thigh (I&#x27;m a good 5 inches below the bikini area.</li>
            <li>(this is my third one, I still keep the first one I bought about 15 years ago as a back-up).</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t tolerate pain, I recommend you shave first and start using you epilator every two-three days as the hairs start growing back.</li>
            <li>The day I got it, I also purchased a loofa, just to prevent ingrown hairs, and so far I haven&#x27;t had one!     </li>
            <li>The first time the red bumps disappeared after about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>last note:  the first area I tried to epilate was my underarm.  </li>
            <li>One last note:  the first area I tried to epilate was my underarm.  </li>
            <li>Shaving typically takes a good half hour in the shower for me.</li>
            <li>I sucked it up and got the area done, but it is very scary to do that area because you have to stretch the skin and the angles make it more challenging.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just not worth the pain, especially since it takes many passes to get all the hair.  </li>
            <li>Just go slow and pull the skin taut, it&#x27;s better than shaving or waxing and since I have light colored skin and dark hair</li>
            <li>If the hairs are kept sparse and short, the process hurts less, but you will have to remove hairs more often.</li>
            <li>The person who wanted it had already used it in past &amp; liked it so much that wanted to go with same one, don&#x27;t know what happened to the last one that person had.</li>
            <li>But now, three months later, the hairs have diminished in number and coarseness, and are more organized and disciplined, making their appearance as a group and much less frequently.  </li>
            <li>It hurt a little bit more than waxing, only because I had to go slower -</li>
            <li>I probably should have saved that money and invested it in a better quality epilator, but it is hard to know until you try these things</li>
            <li>OK so I&#x27;m no stranger to epilating and have done my legs for years with my trusty, old epilator but tried my underarms once and hardly even got going</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now using moisturizers and antibiotic ointment to hopefully clear up the problem, but my doctor says it could take months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had  my old one for over ten years and have really appreciated it.</li>
            <li>When I did my legs and my under arms, it was a whole different story because I&#x27;ve always shaved these.  </li>
            <li>On a side note, this machine is loud</li>
            <li>Also, it is so much faster to do a touch-up whenever necessary than with wax or a razor.      </li>
            <li>Took them weeks to completely heal.</li>
            <li>It shaves much closer than a regular electric razor, lasts longer.</li>
            <li>for reasons like, smooth skin, getting rid of Dead skin and so on...</li>
            <li>Upon receiving this kit I was pleasantly surprised that everything listed and shown in the photo was included.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m using the Olay wips as they cam with it.</li>
            <li>There is a young lady that did a 10 minute video introducing you to the epilator.</li>
            <li>so far so</li>
            <li>My old epilator missed lots of hairs and also ran on batteries.  </li>
            <li>I started near my ankle on the outer side of my leg...</li>
            <li>The one complaint I have is I still feel it sometimes \\&quot;breaks\\&quot; hair instead of pulling it, and there is definitely more ingrown hair than with waxing,</li>
            <li>When you are so busy, you can&#x27;t go to a salon for waxing or you want to save money instead of going to the salon.</li>
            <li>I use to spend 20 minutes plus doing my lower legs and barely spend 10 now!!!</li>
            <li>I will caution you that the epilator doesn&#x27;t get EVERY SINGLE HAIR, but the long lasting effects are still 10 times better than shaving.</li>
            <li>It was nearly painless (I have very little underarm hair--and it is fine).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to use, no mess</li>
            <li>On the leg I epilated 3 days ago, it was almost completely pain free, like running a regular electric shaver down my leg...</li>
            <li>The up front cost may seem a bit much, but after just the first couple uses I don&#x27;t know how I put up with all the trouble of waxing.</li>
            <li>This did not happen only in the first time, but everytime I feel the same.</li>
            <li>Legs were a piece of cake, very little noticable hair pull, other, more tender areas, very noticable.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say even though it had many more gadgets it was not worth the price and having already tried the Emjoi epilator there is no comparison!</li>
            <li>It even has small LED light that will highlight the \\&quot;working</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what difference they make bust since all is going smoothly</li>
            <li>I am fair skin and would have to shave everyday not to see the dark stubble, so I was looking for something to solve my problems, This IS IT!!!  </li>
            <li>The new one finally came today</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still using it and only ordered one new head even though I have this for about 5 years</li>
            <li>I really like this product because, unlike waxing, the hair does not have to be very long.  </li>
            <li>3- to have more control and avoid all the mess that come with the other methods.</li>
            <li>I think the basic Epilator is the same, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Unlike a salon wax, you aren&#x27;t going to get all the hair yanked out in a few quick motions.  </li>
            <li>Unlike a salon wax, you aren&#x27;t going to get all the hair yanked out in a few quick motions.  </li>
            <li>The dermatologist told me I wouldn&#x27;t be a good candidate for laser hair removal since I don&#x27;t have thick, dark coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>Because of that, I chose to use the cortisone cream with aloe afterwards as my skin was really itchy (very dry skin as well).</li>
            <li>It was much more painful (as I expected) and the pain lingered a bit more.  </li>
            <li>Back to old faithful.</li>
            <li>So far I have had it for 2 weeks and have yet to epilate for the second time.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace my Remington Smooth &amp; Silky because I found it to be slow, noisy and broke off hairs instead of removing them.  </li>
            <li>But after the first time, not all of the hair grows back at the same time, so there is always less to do than the initial time, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much.  </li>
            <li>I tried the epilator on my UA without applying heavy pressure, and it does indeed pull out the hairs right from the roots.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the special Olay wipes, they have nothing in them to numb your leg, just to clean it.  </li>
            <li>I will add that I had  waited for well over a week without plucking or epilating and the hair was long enough to have been pulled  with my older unit.</li>
            <li>First of all, if you DO NOT have a high tolerance for pain, I strongly suggest that you not purchase this product, especially because this set it very expensive.</li>
            <li>The epilator works ok and hair on my legs grew back slower and softer than that of a razor, but using it on my face was really tough.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is worlds better than a Remington I owned which was really bad with \\&quot;breaking\\&quot; and caused more ingrown hair, among other complaints.</li>
            <li>I decided to try a higher rated and more expensive epilator by Braun due to all the reviews and mind you</li>
            <li>Pretty painful the first time you use it, I did my bikini line, legs and under arms and needed some wine to get me thru it, but after your first time it&#x27;s way easier!</li>
            <li>The Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator can remove hair that is barely visible above the skin&#x27;s surface!</li>
            <li>but you need to follow up every week, it does hurt the first few times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money not to shave everyday!</li>
            <li>If you are new to epilators, i would also recommend the wet/dry panasonic epilator as you can use it in the shower, so your skin is less sensitive.</li>
            <li>with this model it was quick, efficient and hardly felt a thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if this is normal or not since I don&#x27;t have any other epilator to test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whoever put together this instruction booklet obviously did not care too much and just decided to throw it together less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>and I also managed to do my legs in 1/3rd the time it normally takes me with other epilators because this has a head that tilts at various angles to give u the closest epilation without having to go over the area over and over.</li>
            <li>Yes, the hairs are gone a little longer, but shaving is easier and much faster.</li>
            <li>Like the other reviewers I have very sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> This epilator is WONDERFUL!  </li>
            <li> but the best thing is that you can still use it during the charge.</li>
            <li> it is WONDERFUL.</li>

            <li> I think this is great product.</li>
            <li> This a great product.</li>
            <li> The Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive is a great epilator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great not having to be close to an outlet.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone, because it was after all a costy price tag for a not so great epilator.</li>
            <li> This product is great</li>
            <li> This epilator does a great job at ripping out hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m daaaaarn happy</li>
            <li> This has worked GREAT for me.  </li>
            <li> The shaver attachment works great.  </li>
            <li> The rechargeable unit is great, no bother with cords when trying to get those tricky areas.  </li>
            <li> it works great on my underarms.</li>
            <li> Great in any way for what was designed to do.</li>
            <li> A co-worker suggested the lower model and showed me all these great customer reviews, being how I am, I wanted all the bells and whistles</li>
            <li> I just do my underarms and bikini line now and still shave in between once in a great while.</li>
            <li> A great tip I got was to put powder on the area your doing, it makes it easier</li>
            <li> Anyway, the product is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: Three weeks on and it&#x27;s been great not having to shave under my arms every couple of days.</li>
            <li> The bag is great to keep everything together.  </li>
            <li> Great being rechargable now and heaps quieter.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> It still works great</li>
            <li> I will b happy.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I did.</li>
            <li> This is great.</li>
            <li> We both love it!!  </li>
            <li> I tried the epilater &amp; love it!!</li>
            <li> I found the combination of the epilator and the princereigns to be very effective.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you keep your skin taut to get the best results!</li>
            <li> and I found bending my arm across the top of my head was the best I could do</li>
            <li> The product is great and in good condition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Braun for a wonderful product :)</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> and I thought this would be a good option to save money.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after my sister got one and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good thing is that you can both epilate and trim.  </li>
            <li> The under arm cap might be good to do it, but I haven&#x27;t tried.    </li>
            <li> My boyfriend has also used it and found the product to be a good buy.</li>
            <li> this was a good thing.</li>
            <li> good luck!&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimming/shaving head also does a good job and switching between the two heads is effortless.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product and value for money.</li>
            <li> I returned it, and bought the 7681 from another company; and am delighted with it.</li>
            <li> After shopping price found the best one right here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Luckily this comes with the shaver WHICH IS AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Truly this is a great product and I will be recommending it to my daughter as shaving has been a source of literal irritation. :)</li>
            <li> the best product ever, totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> and it was SO rewarding to see all the hair piled up on it, as well as under the caps when I cleaned the devise!  </li>
            <li> The best invention ever XD and the light makes it much more amazing.</li>
            <li> The Braun epilator did not remove as many hairs as the Emjoi!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!    </li>
            <li> you guys would love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> So if like me you&#x27;re scared of the pain - stick with it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery is phenomenal!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li> LOve it !</li>
            <li> You need a very light touch to get a good contact.  </li>
            <li> The light on the epilator is great because it enables you to see the hair as you are trying to remove it.</li>
            <li> Another great feature is the light.</li>
            <li> The shaver head is absolutely amazing beacuse</li>
            <li> and it really works great!</li>
            <li> and then you are good to go. :-)     </li>
            <li> its your own fault.  </li>
            <li> The nice thing about this epilator is that it comes with a shaving head.  </li>
            <li> Although it worked well in the beginning, it was no longer effective after using it for couple of times and eventually died.</li>
            <li> Waxing has always been spottily effective for me.    </li>
            <li> Also, the shaver head is handy to trim bikini hair, and to shave areas</li>
            <li> but my wife, who had all kind of epilators, says there it&#x27;s no comparison.</li>
            <li> I really liked seeing a demonstration of how it worked.    </li>
            <li> They went away overnight, so I would give yourself a day or two if you are planning on nice legs for an event.  </li>
            <li> I honestly think it doesn&#x27;t hur</li>
            <li> I dont mind it though as I have my own wipes</li>
            <li> I had to replace an older model that I lost, but this model is the best I&#x27;d ever had.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li> I think setting aside time every week to use the epilator is a good schedule to go over areas that might not be as smooth as you want them</li>
            <li> so its nice to be able to just shave those areas.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Braun Silk-Epil for over 10 years, and this model is by far the best!</li>
            <li> BE SURE to follow the directions and clean your skin immediatly before using the epilator!!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I got really brave and decided to try my bikini area...</li>
            <li> This is my first ever epilator, I&#x27;m so happy on choosing Braun as they are long-time proven and tested on epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too many attachments</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be better at using it.  </li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite feature is the battery, this model lets you plug it and charge it, and use it anywhere.</li>
            <li> I also think there has to be a better way to remove hair.  </li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t made it to the bikini area yet, but I&#x27;m sure I will.      </li>
            <li> The Braun removed more hairs, faster.  </li>
            <li> I loathe and love epilating my bikini line</li>
            <li> I have been using it all summer and am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> : when you change legs while epiating, you will feel it more.</li>
            <li> The epilator itself is adorable and sparkly</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Ok, so let me start out by saying that I have had my epilator for almost 4 months</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how short my hair could be</li>
            <li> Note to anyone who might buy this, make sure that you are using an exfoliator on your legs each day once you start epilating or you WILL get ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> 5.5 - Lower legs hurt more than the thighs, and I&#x27;ve had more ingrown hairs on my lower legs.</li>
            <li> This is definitely more preferable to waxing.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, this review has been helpful to most.</li>
            <li> so I purchased it and was sooo impressed and decided to give it to my daughter who has the same issues.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on each product and the reviews were so convincing that I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many epilators before I found this one.</li>
            <li> I notice a lot more hair growth then when I use this product.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is rechargeable and can use it without the cord getting in the way.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> However, I also must admit that I was able to epilate my legs without problems.</li>
            <li> In summary, I don&#x27;t recommend this product because you will not be able to use it for all parts of your body.</li>
            <li> Or even better, buy an epilator which works as described and claimed...</li>
            <li> - Use the pre-epilation wipes (anyone know where you can get more of those???).  </li>
            <li> my hubby gifted Braun Silk epil on my birthday...</li>
            <li> and in the morning TA DA......I love my skin....</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> I love this epilator, I bought it after doing an extensive online search for the product, I found the best deal on amazon for it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I just love the results.</li>
            <li> My underarms have been smooth and no bumps!</li>
            <li> The epilator has gotten SO MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li> I have used it three times since then and I still get the occasional ingrown, but I have been exfoliating a ton, which is what helps the best.</li>
            <li> and I am no longer ripping off layers of my skin! :-) :-)</li>
            <li> and I love it, but I noticed it cuts hair instead of pulling them..</li>
            <li> This was the most painless epilation experience I had</li>
            <li> My legs stay smooth for almost 2 weeks!     </li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> I love this hair remover.  </li>
            <li> ~LOVE</li>
            <li> Tried it a couple more times as an epilator</li>
            <li> I also feel like I am more thorough.  </li>
            <li> I also feel like I am more thorough.  </li>
            <li> It hurts a bit but the pain will decrease the more you use it.</li>
            <li> My legs truly have never felt or looked better.  </li>
            <li> It did pinch a bit, but with practice, it should be ok.</li>
            <li> which one is better quality.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s best to use when the hair growth is tiny.</li>
            <li> our older product from Braun was still good and we gifted it to someone!    </li>
            <li> I am usually pretty good at understanding instructions because most of the time it is self-explanatory.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and just bought it because my sister bought it too and loved it.   </li>
            <li> I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED!     </li>
            <li> My boy friend loves to use it to shave his mustache than his own because it shaves more smoothly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Amazon is always awesome with most of it&#x27;s products &amp; prices, sometimes deals you can find here cannot be found at other places.</li>
            <li> Very cool product.    </li>
            <li> There are also suggestions to make the experience more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The battery is great, so far I&#x27;ve epilated my under arm 3 times and my lower let 2 times</li>
            <li> I bought it primarily for my face, but will resort to electrolysis which is more permanent.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and looks so cute with the gillter on it :)</li>
            <li> so easy to use, love the light feature and that you can use it cordless.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a great product, I love that it is cordless.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy for a newbie to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Doing my legs was a easy, as I said I&#x27;ve done them before anyway but</li>
            <li> No matter how much you think that you have a good lighting, you will just appreciate the light in it.</li>
            <li> The light is very useful, and love that it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li> All the functions are very good, and keeps my legs smooth for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just zapped thefew really fine hairs that had started to appear under my arms.</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for several years and I must stay that this one is certainly the best I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Time will tell whether I decide to buy more, though, based on cost as well as if they are still useful as the hair thins out.      </li>
            <li> Your legs will never feel that smooth with this no matter how often you use it.  </li>
            <li> My legs wouldn&#x27;t get as smooth as they do with shaving, but I could go about a week without having to re-do them.  </li>
            <li> but you end up have a smooth shave</li>
            <li> the pain was worth it:)....</li>
            <li> I saw this model and decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;Its smooth -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the area is now smooth as silk, but it was a lot of work.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the area is now smooth as silk, but it was a lot of work.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product last month and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> and it leaves the skin smooth with NO bumps.</li>
            <li> Yes it hurts, but you have smooth skin for over a week.</li>
            <li> I was not eager to spend so much money on a device that would cause me pain, but I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my investment.</li>
            <li> I also have fair, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that you can charge up the piece and the charge keeps for a fair long time</li>
            <li> I tried different caps and found the normal massaging head was the best.  </li>
            <li> The light is useful if you have really fine or light hair.     </li>
            <li> My skin is so dry shaving just causes too much irritation, I&#x27;m so happy I gave this a try!</li>
            <li> If you can withstand the pain in the underarms, the results are well worth it!</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;d like to say this is an OKAY epilator.</li>
            <li> It has a really cool light that helps you to see the hair</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.    </li>
            <li> First time I used, I was before my period, so much more sensible.</li>
            <li> ~having to wait for significant regrowth between treatments is a MYTH.  </li>
            <li> This purchase was replacing a 12+ year old Braun that I was very happy with, but finally died.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is great &amp; worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Near the end, I was much more confident and had conquered the pain.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping to have better luck with the epilator and so far it feels better.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping to have better luck with the epilator and so far it feels better.  </li>
            <li> But overall, the product is good and very useful.</li>
            <li> I have tried Braun&#x27;s Soft perfection, silk x&#x27;elle, Pansonic&#x27;s wet and dry epilator and also Phillips satinelle and the Braun 7781 was the best, most superior epilator I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> You must use this frequently (short hair) and practice exfoliation however, being a fair skinned person no amount of exfoliation relieves me of bumps.  </li>
            <li> Epilating is now not painful at all.</li>
            <li> &amp; I absolutely fell in love with......</li>
            <li> When I use the epil, I get a full two weeks.  </li>
            <li> on the whole I love my Silk epil....</li>
            <li> So I think my plan of weekly until the hairs grow back slower is a good idea.    </li>
            <li> It is even not painful for me.</li>
            <li> The light can be difficult to work with, it can \\&quot;hide\\&quot; hairs as some have noted, it is very bright, but if you look at an angle across the light you can see the ultra fine hairs, as well as the ultra-smooth results!  </li>
            <li> easy to use, recharge fast and smooth .</li>
            <li> It does seem pretty well constructed and easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and convenient to use, the first time I used it, it hurt a lot.</li>
            <li> I have an earlier version of Braun&#x27;s Silk - Epil which although took some time to get used to, did an excellent job in getting a clean shave that last for weeks.  </li>
            <li> Clean up is easy and fast.</li>
            <li> It does take several passes to get all of the hairs, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be more efficient at it with time.  </li>
            <li> Very nice product to use in your legs, but extremely painfull for bikini area and underarms.</li>
            <li> First of all, when you use it on your legs, don&#x27;t expect a smooth feel</li>
            <li> Be aware, you won&#x27;t get the perfectly smooth, just shaved with a razor, feel when epilating.  </li>
            <li> That was the very first time I ever used it.</li>
            <li> After one week my legs felt still pretty smooth</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Day4: Took the epilator to both legs and it clearly found more hairs on the originally shaved leg.</li>
            <li> Really like this one, it&#x27;s easy to use, painless, fast and clean!</li>
            <li> It took a couple of minutes and hardly felt anything (honestly!!)</li>
            <li> Also I should say that I have very fair and sensitive skin, dark hair and well-rooted but fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, and it is not painful!</li>
            <li> When I heard of this epilator of Braun, I thought it would be time for a change, for a new, more professionel model.</li>
            <li> I really like it, I can&#x27;t say if another one is better or not since this is my first one</li>
            <li> I used some aloe gel on my legs to soothe them after the first session, and the pain and redness were reduced almost immediately!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this epilator regularly for 6 weeks, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> and I am not even aware of any discomfort!     </li>
            <li> Yes the first time it did pinch, but no razor cuts or pulling of hairs in-mass out of my body!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> And it takes a little time to get the hang of it, and it takes a lot of guts to keep going, but once you decide to do so, the results are great.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful to know about some information</li>
            <li> Honestly, I may just go back to waxing.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I doubt I&#x27;ll make my easing into the most sensitive areas until after swimsuit season</li>
            <li> I just finished using my epilator for the first time tonight (full bikini area).  </li>
            <li> Of course I was much more determined to complete the bikini area since it&#x27;s the reason I bought this product, and I don&#x27;t mind shaving my underarms</li>
            <li> Of course I was much more determined to complete the bikini area since it&#x27;s the reason I bought this product, and I don&#x27;t mind shaving my underarms every day.</li>
            <li> I have more sensitive skin and the redness lasted two days.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used it on my underarms, but I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> It does its job pretty quickly</li>
            <li> I love all the different attachments and the fact that I can clean it with water.</li>
            <li> I suggest to spend few more dollars and buy this product than a Remington!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use it.</li>
            <li> and it is true at i got is more like Braun 7681 Silk-Epil 7 Xpressive Pro Epilator with the extra head</li>
            <li> but like most of us I&#x27;ve pretty sensitive skin, whick reacts to tiniest of irritation..</li>
            <li> I bought this product through amazon at a fantastic price, mainly because it is washable and also works with and without the cord, although I don&#x27;t recommend it with the cord while in the shower.</li>
            <li> Luckily hair grows at different rates and I should be able to remove it in stages from now on, as it starts to grow back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a general note, trim your hairs if they are longer than 1/4\\&quot;, because the epilator will hurt more otherwise.    </li>
            <li> So much more economical than burning through batteries left and right.  </li>
            <li> overall I strongly recommend everyone out there to have one!</li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be standing in the shower wasting water whilst I used it!</li>
            <li> It hurts the first time, but it&#x27;s very tolerable and quick.</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> Stomach and lower back: 1-1.5 - Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you have a high pain tolerance you might think that its not painful at all</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is very smooth on your skin, and have several accessories to adapt to different parts of your body.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to exfoliate frequently as this area is highly prone to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that was very important, but even with all my bathroom lights on, the incorporated light helps you find those hidden hairs you missed.    </li>
            <li> Absolute garbage!  </li>
            <li> I got my knee caps done and it worked pretty well on them.  </li>
            <li> And after the first time, it is a walk in the park.</li>
            <li> Just so you are aware</li>
            <li> So just be aware of it.</li>
            <li> ;-))</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I think that for this price Amazon should make sure that the product is sealed and if returned should be properly cleansed.</li>
            <li> and I know for a fact that if I didn&#x27;t have that, I would have many patches of hair left over.  </li>
            <li> Which, of course, at first i wanted to blame the product on but its not the products fault if you get ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> really well!    </li>
            <li> I was afarid at first of one of the reviewers who mentioned that the photo is not what you get</li>
            <li> It delivers exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it HURT.</li>
            <li> Had I not read these reviews that encourage you to keep on using it, I would have given up in the first minute.</li>
            <li> it charges pretty fast and NO!</li>
            <li> I can get rid of deadskin and also Tan;)</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t pull out all of them at the first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m a masochist, but I like the way it feels on my legs, but when I moved to my upper arms, it was a bit of a shock, and I did feel more pain there,</li>
            <li> Epilating will hurt the first time (...Epilators are plucking a group of hairs at once).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it felt like taking hot sandpaper to my lower legs.</li>
            <li> Time it took to do the lower and most of the upper legs: the first time it took about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t lie, it really hurt!</li>
            <li> I bought a home laser removal system (HPL) but haven&#x27;t kept at it consistently</li>
            <li> I epilated my underarms first because I heard it was easier if you were accustomed to waxing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but buy it without thinking this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> However, that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a great product.    </li>
            <li> I had my first bikini wax at a salon recently and loved the immediate result, but it didn&#x27;t last as my skin almost immediately became irritated</li>
            <li> I had my first bikini wax at a salon recently and loved the immediate result, but it didn&#x27;t last as my skin almost immediately became irritated</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest reading the instructions first, as there are so many different heads with different purposes.  </li>
            <li> At best you&#x27;re removing 1/2 the hairs as the other half are in the resting stages.</li>
            <li> The Braun rarely misses a hair, and the built in light allows you to catch those few easily.  </li>
            <li> Waxing left my fair skin with redness for several days.  </li>
            <li> Having been a little skeptical about the ability of the Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator to effectively remove all hair, I must say I have been impressed with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> I thought that I was getting the dry epilator (which was fine), but they sent me the upgraded wet/dry version!</li>
            <li> The first minut is really a pain, but then you get used to it.</li>
            <li> If you can make it through the first pass, I would think that maintenance going forward is much easier.    </li>
            <li> if you were old belive me it is true so you will have to avoid all of this.  </li>
            <li> Trusting my own experience and ignoring the reviews I ordered the product and my decision didn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife, had same brand in the past, very happy with it, so far problem free, truly German engineering and made, she thinks to keep it as long as it is working or a new technology comes up, even the old Braun, she gave it away in a perfect condition, used it for over 10 years, hoping this one to last 20!</li>
            <li> Additionally, I found that this model is too large to get close  to the nose area.</li>
            <li> The quality is very high and the variety of attachments makes epilating an easy, if not totally painless process.</li>
            <li> I heard about epilating from a friend of mine...but was reluctant to experiment new thing!!....</li>
            <li> As a veteran epilator of many years, I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of my new Braun.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks just tiny fine hairs appeared and were even easier to remove.</li>
            <li> Luckily hair grows at different rates and I should be able to remove it in stages from now on, as it starts to grow back.    </li>
            <li> But I persevered, gritted my teeth, did the breathing exercises they tell you to do for child birth and stuck with it (then treated myself to a large glass of wine afterwards which really helped</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fully charged I was ready, gave my legs a quick wipe with the included Pre-epilation wipes and proceeded.&lt;br /&gt;Not having to be next to a power point (my old one was corded) is a great bonus and the smartlight really shows up the little hairs that you&#x27;d otherwise miss&lt;br</li>
            <li> This handy little shaver/epilator is a must for every gal.</li>
            <li> but I think your pain tolerance has to be pretty darn high.  </li>
            <li> If you are on the fence about this product, be assured it is a very high quality and very well made device.</li>
            <li> we are happy with it so far and hope that it will go same long way as our older product.</li>
            <li> And while at first, the pain is similar to the first time waxing, or quickly removing a strong adhesive bandage, it does not take long to become accustomed to it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to wash and what could seem like a gadget the little light on it really allows you to see every single hairs you are trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li> It was so painful, but it&#x27;s great for touching up the bikini line.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the discomfort is really nothing if you are used to waxing.</li>
            <li> had to order the part I really wanted from someone else</li>
            <li> if you move the epil too fast, it won&#x27;t pick up all the hair.  </li>
            <li> They were smooth immediately after but became prickly the next day which never happens when I wax.     </li>
            <li> However, the towels and the massaging head didn&#x27;t really make any difference with the pain</li>
            <li> It really minimizes hair growth if you use it all the time.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not quite ready to try the epilator on.</li>
            <li> I think that for this part, I&#x27;ll keep going to the saloon, even because there are parts we can&#x27;t reach very well</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t come with the face cap.</li>
            <li> grow so much eather</li>
            <li> when I tried the epilator head on underarms it hurt so much</li>
            <li> Regardless, I think this product is much safer (</li>
            <li> field\\&quot;. Very versatile and practical.</li>
            <li> That really helps with the itches and ingrowns.</li>
            <li> And really if you can deal with the pain (which I think is nothing on my legs and underarms)</li>
            <li> Ok, really, I&#x27;m not ready to dump my shaver as I&#x27;m still scared of trying the underarms.</li>
            <li> Before I bought the product, I did research it and appreciated EVERYONE&#x27;S reviews, here on Amazon and just googling the web.</li>
            <li> I went through a year&#x27;s worth of laser treatments (COMPLETELY PAINLESS, BTW) in my bikini area</li>
            <li> But you also won&#x27;t have to allow the hair to grow out as much as you do in between waxes, and you won&#x27;t have to pay $48 for the service.  </li>
            <li> But you also won&#x27;t have to allow the hair to grow out as much as you do in between waxes, and you won&#x27;t have to pay $48 for the service.  </li>
            <li> It works very well for the underarms.  </li>
            <li> I just fried my Braun 2370 epilator after about 5 yrs, not having appreciated that my overseas converter didn&#x27;t have a transformer also.</li>
            <li> My legs are SO much smoother, and for longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and works very well, charging process takes around 40-45 min.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it on my underarms, that I couldn&#x27;t do, too much pain.  </li>
            <li> My legs are a different story, the first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t heed the warnings of my co-worker and just went all out with a leg full of hair.</li>
            <li> And yes, the facial epilator works very well, although, that is the most sensitive area I&#x27;ve done yet.</li>
            <li> If I attempt to shave more frequently than once every 3 days, my skin gets irritated, itchy, and red.    </li>
            <li> It charges completely in 1 hour, which lets you get right in there and start.  </li>
            <li> It feels like little shocks, but after pulling out the first hairs, it get much better.</li>
            <li> As far as the pain goes, the sections that proved to be pretty intense were the underarm and the bikini area.</li>
            <li> - the first session seems time consuming (30 minutes for both legs) compared to a quick shave in the shower, but I think it will be better next time as there will be less hair</li>
            <li> I have been waxing EVERYTHING for over a year (underarms, full brazilian, and legs; I get my eyebrows threaded because my skin is too sensitive) and it is a pain to get waxed because the lady I go to is really far away from my house</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t any more pleasant or painful than I had imagined.</li>
            <li> and now I can&#x27;t live without it !</li>
            <li> It is much better than the previous one I had before.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly i think it&#x27;s actually more painful than waxing or just plucking by hand.</li>
            <li> I have an older Braun epilator and was in need of an upgrade.</li>
            <li> Have yet to try it on my underarms as I would get a lot of ingrown hairs from using the older one.  </li>
            <li> I had tried the older model which was non-chargable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t go for the 7281 mainly because it supposedly does not turn on when in the charger mode for safety reasons</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thoroughly recommend this model, compared to my older model</li>
            <li> I choose this model for the quick rechargable feature as I am a working mom and not extra time on my hands.  </li>
            <li> it gave a very close shave in sensitive areas but felt absolutely safe unlike a conventional razor.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this particular model.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re nervous or hesitant, I highly recommend going to YouTube and searching for Braun epil.</li>
            <li> The enclosed wipes are helpful in that if you wipe in the direction you&#x27;re going to epilate then the hairs stand up a little better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure, due to the nature of what the machine is doing, there is no such thing as a painless epilator.  </li>
            <li> The beginner cap was OK, but removes so little hair at one time, it&#x27;s sort of like prolonging the torture.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Decided it was time to invest in a new one and particularly wanted one for doing under my arms.</li>
            <li> But overall, this is quite useful</li>
            <li> My legs, however, will never see a normal razor again.</li>
            <li> However, the results are worth the initial pain</li>
            <li> Definitely tolerable and so worth the results.  </li>
            <li> Day3 result: Shaved leg is finally starting to feel just barely stubbly, while epilated leg still feels 97% smooth like day1.</li>
            <li> The hair growth is normal.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s brilliant and does a much better job, much quicker and less painfully</li>
            <li> Charges quick and holds the charge a long time.  </li>
            <li> but if you are new to epilating there are somethings you have to learn about, like exfoliating...</li>
            <li> 6- here is somthing new with all the stretching &amp; bulling  of the skin that comes with the waxing your skin with time will look like</li>
            <li> Since I have been using an epilator for a while I didn&#x27;t have the pain that comes with being new epilating.  </li>
            <li> The Silk-Epil truly is a new generation.  </li>
            <li> I am brand new to epilating and didn&#x27;t know if this was for me.  </li>
            <li> I was content with it, but it was night compared to the day of this new model.</li>
            <li> As the upper lip was primarily the reason for purchasing the newer model, I finally gave up and  repackaged this Braun.</li>
            <li> I did get red bumps, but I have very sensitive skin, so it is pretty normal for me regardless of shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Olay pre-epilation wipes, they don&#x27;t seem to take away the pain, but they do help relieve some of the post-epilation stinging and sensitivity (use them as directed, my skin is really sensitive post epilation</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also very loud.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty fine, and I have a lot of it, blonde peach fuzz and dark hairs.</li>
            <li> And every week I&#x27;d go a little further up my inner thigh (I&#x27;m a good 5 inches below the bikini area.</li>
            <li> (this is my third one, I still keep the first one I bought about 15 years ago as a back-up).</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t tolerate pain, I recommend you shave first and start using you epilator every two-three days as the hairs start growing back.</li>
            <li> The day I got it, I also purchased a loofa, just to prevent ingrown hairs, and so far I haven&#x27;t had one!     </li>
            <li> The first time the red bumps disappeared after about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> last note:  the first area I tried to epilate was my underarm.  </li>
            <li> One last note:  the first area I tried to epilate was my underarm.  </li>
            <li> Shaving typically takes a good half hour in the shower for me.</li>
            <li> I sucked it up and got the area done, but it is very scary to do that area because you have to stretch the skin and the angles make it more challenging.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just not worth the pain, especially since it takes many passes to get all the hair.  </li>
            <li> Just go slow and pull the skin taut, it&#x27;s better than shaving or waxing and since I have light colored skin and dark hair</li>
            <li> If the hairs are kept sparse and short, the process hurts less, but you will have to remove hairs more often.</li>
            <li> The person who wanted it had already used it in past &amp; liked it so much that wanted to go with same one, don&#x27;t know what happened to the last one that person had.</li>
            <li> But now, three months later, the hairs have diminished in number and coarseness, and are more organized and disciplined, making their appearance as a group and much less frequently.  </li>
            <li> It hurt a little bit more than waxing, only because I had to go slower -</li>
            <li> I probably should have saved that money and invested it in a better quality epilator, but it is hard to know until you try these things</li>
            <li> OK so I&#x27;m no stranger to epilating and have done my legs for years with my trusty, old epilator but tried my underarms once and hardly even got going</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using moisturizers and antibiotic ointment to hopefully clear up the problem, but my doctor says it could take months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had  my old one for over ten years and have really appreciated it.</li>
            <li> When I did my legs and my under arms, it was a whole different story because I&#x27;ve always shaved these.  </li>
            <li> On a side note, this machine is loud</li>
            <li> Also, it is so much faster to do a touch-up whenever necessary than with wax or a razor.      </li>
            <li> Took them weeks to completely heal.</li>
            <li> It shaves much closer than a regular electric razor, lasts longer.</li>
            <li> for reasons like, smooth skin, getting rid of Dead skin and so on...</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this kit I was pleasantly surprised that everything listed and shown in the photo was included.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m using the Olay wips as they cam with it.</li>
            <li> There is a young lady that did a 10 minute video introducing you to the epilator.</li>
            <li> so far so</li>
            <li> My old epilator missed lots of hairs and also ran on batteries.  </li>
            <li> I started near my ankle on the outer side of my leg...</li>
            <li> The one complaint I have is I still feel it sometimes \\&quot;breaks\\&quot; hair instead of pulling it, and there is definitely more ingrown hair than with waxing,</li>
            <li> When you are so busy, you can&#x27;t go to a salon for waxing or you want to save money instead of going to the salon.</li>
            <li> I use to spend 20 minutes plus doing my lower legs and barely spend 10 now!!!</li>
            <li> I will caution you that the epilator doesn&#x27;t get EVERY SINGLE HAIR, but the long lasting effects are still 10 times better than shaving.</li>
            <li> It was nearly painless (I have very little underarm hair--and it is fine).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to use, no mess</li>
            <li> On the leg I epilated 3 days ago, it was almost completely pain free, like running a regular electric shaver down my leg...</li>
            <li> The up front cost may seem a bit much, but after just the first couple uses I don&#x27;t know how I put up with all the trouble of waxing.</li>
            <li> This did not happen only in the first time, but everytime I feel the same.</li>
            <li> Legs were a piece of cake, very little noticable hair pull, other, more tender areas, very noticable.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say even though it had many more gadgets it was not worth the price and having already tried the Emjoi epilator there is no comparison!</li>
            <li> It even has small LED light that will highlight the \\&quot;working</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what difference they make bust since all is going smoothly</li>
            <li> I am fair skin and would have to shave everyday not to see the dark stubble, so I was looking for something to solve my problems, This IS IT!!!  </li>
            <li> The new one finally came today</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still using it and only ordered one new head even though I have this for about 5 years</li>
            <li> I really like this product because, unlike waxing, the hair does not have to be very long.  </li>
            <li> 3- to have more control and avoid all the mess that come with the other methods.</li>
            <li> I think the basic Epilator is the same, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Unlike a salon wax, you aren&#x27;t going to get all the hair yanked out in a few quick motions.  </li>
            <li> Unlike a salon wax, you aren&#x27;t going to get all the hair yanked out in a few quick motions.  </li>
            <li> The dermatologist told me I wouldn&#x27;t be a good candidate for laser hair removal since I don&#x27;t have thick, dark coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Because of that, I chose to use the cortisone cream with aloe afterwards as my skin was really itchy (very dry skin as well).</li>
            <li> It was much more painful (as I expected) and the pain lingered a bit more.  </li>
            <li> Back to old faithful.</li>
            <li> So far I have had it for 2 weeks and have yet to epilate for the second time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my Remington Smooth &amp; Silky because I found it to be slow, noisy and broke off hairs instead of removing them.  </li>
            <li> But after the first time, not all of the hair grows back at the same time, so there is always less to do than the initial time, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much.  </li>
            <li> I tried the epilator on my UA without applying heavy pressure, and it does indeed pull out the hairs right from the roots.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the special Olay wipes, they have nothing in them to numb your leg, just to clean it.  </li>
            <li> I will add that I had  waited for well over a week without plucking or epilating and the hair was long enough to have been pulled  with my older unit.</li>
            <li> First of all, if you DO NOT have a high tolerance for pain, I strongly suggest that you not purchase this product, especially because this set it very expensive.</li>
            <li> The epilator works ok and hair on my legs grew back slower and softer than that of a razor, but using it on my face was really tough.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is worlds better than a Remington I owned which was really bad with \\&quot;breaking\\&quot; and caused more ingrown hair, among other complaints.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a higher rated and more expensive epilator by Braun due to all the reviews and mind you</li>
            <li> Pretty painful the first time you use it, I did my bikini line, legs and under arms and needed some wine to get me thru it, but after your first time it&#x27;s way easier!</li>
            <li> The Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator can remove hair that is barely visible above the skin&#x27;s surface!</li>
            <li> but you need to follow up every week, it does hurt the first few times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money not to shave everyday!</li>
            <li> If you are new to epilators, i would also recommend the wet/dry panasonic epilator as you can use it in the shower, so your skin is less sensitive.</li>
            <li> with this model it was quick, efficient and hardly felt a thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this is normal or not since I don&#x27;t have any other epilator to test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whoever put together this instruction booklet obviously did not care too much and just decided to throw it together less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I also managed to do my legs in 1/3rd the time it normally takes me with other epilators because this has a head that tilts at various angles to give u the closest epilation without having to go over the area over and over.</li>
            <li> Yes, the hairs are gone a little longer, but shaving is easier and much faster.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Contrary to the many reviews I read prior to purchase, this model did a very poor job on my upper  lip.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to purchase an epilator due to growing issues after shaving, my skin has become extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> The new &#x27;wet &amp; dry&#x27; model from braun can be used under shower and is substantially chearper than 7781.</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t like to use it on a purely battery mode if I&#x27;m close to a power point since the battery can run out after sometime and</li>
            <li> but this is expected for these things in general.</li>
            <li> If you want the following;1- investing your money in  a long lasting method that you do not have to repurchase waxes , cleaning products, blades etc.</li>
            <li> I would previously have extremely sensitive skin from waxing and now this product has replaced my need for waxing.  </li>
            <li> that is a less sensitive area to get a feel for how it will go.  </li>
            <li> You feel it a little at the very beginning of the session but 10 seconds or so in, your mind starts thinking about other things</li>
            <li> I hate shaving and have dark hair and fair and SENSITIVE skin.    </li>
            <li> The price might seem a little steep, but the utility of this product will far surpass the price of razors and waxings that you will have to buy in the time you will have, use, and keep the epilator.</li>
            <li> About half an hour after my shower, I wiped my &#x27;experimental&#x27; leg with the Pre-Epilation Wipes and read the instructions while waiting for it to fully dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to get the skin under your arms really taut</li>
            <li> It just won&#x27;t happen because you cannot get every single hair that is above your skin every single time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving and waxing, but shaving never lasted long, and all the at home waxes I tried didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of home waxing systems and there is no comparison.</li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t believe that I went this long without knowing about it.  </li>
            <li> Despite repeated tries, I still had hair that simply would not be pulled.</li>
            <li> The hair stays away just as long as waxing</li>
            <li> and I have saved over the long term vs. waxing.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous about the investment as I was unable to see this model in person, but I can definitely say it was worth every penny, and with the current prices on razorblades, I will recoup my money in no time.</li>
            <li> with minimal pain when occasional teeny hairs get pulled out.    </li>
            <li> This is unbelievably faster than my old one!</li>
            <li> I researched other epilators and went back to the Braun.</li>
            <li> I am happier with a standard razor or any other electric razor because the eplilator style is not acceptable in removing hair..</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a very minor downside, compared with everything else it does well.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that the most painful time is the fist time that you use it.  </li>
            <li> I was as happy as could be until about 4 months later when I started to get terrible itching on my legs.  </li>
            <li> - Dry thoroughly and NO lotion.  </li>
            <li> - Apply princereigns and allow to dry.  </li>
            <li> the first use was pretty painful...</li>
            <li> Maybe you think I have a very delicate or sensitive skin, or I have no idea how to epilate correctly, but as I&#x27;ve mentioned above, this is not the first time I use an epilator in this delicate areas of my body.</li>
            <li> The only negative my legs get lobster red from using this the day of and the following day so two days out of a month</li>
            <li> After you  have used it a few times, it barely hurts at all.  </li>
            <li> I figured I had nothing to loose</li>
            <li> and from second use onwards it was not as painful as it was the first time...and the bonus is with the new pulsating head...</li>
            <li> - certainly nothing like the painful first time.</li>
            <li> I decided to get a newer unit in hopes  that they had improved on comfort and also because my previous Braun is corded only.     </li>
            <li> Both settings work well and works well dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned so shaving left the black roots in my legs.</li>
            <li> That irritation last less than 12 hours and was relieved by Gold Bond Medicated Powder.    </li>
            <li> So I bit the bullet &amp; paid a little extra for this model</li>
            <li> I, too, got little red bumps at every hair follicle site.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate the narrowed field for underarm and bikini--now that I&#x27;m almost 40, my skin isn&#x27;t as taut or tough and that was worrying me some re: epilating there.</li>
            <li> the more painful the zap is</li>
            <li> Removing hair by the roots is never painless, but the various heads and options on the epilator make it very manageable and let you get even curved, complicated areas.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;ve spent money on laser hair removal, you know the coarser the hair</li>
            <li> The wax and the yanking of the skin caused me to break out a lot, and get red bumps for a few days.  </li>
            <li> picking up all the hair-I&#x27;d pass over the same area several times and there&#x27;d still be some hair left behind.</li>
            <li> So is this product painless, absolutely not.  </li>
            <li> I found that there really is no need for all the caps aside from the precision and massaging caps.</li>
            <li> and it is not much anyway.</li>
            <li> I was going to complain but after reviewing the difference from official Braun website, I figured there is not much difference ....</li>
            <li> I try to be extremely careful.    </li>
            <li> Also, because the hairs did not have a regular schedule of popping out, I was required to epilate every few days.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews religiously before any long-term purchase and this was what I decided to go with after a few nights of research.    </li>
            <li> It does not shave close; it leaves black carbon-like streak marks on your skin with each pass and does not hold a charge for long.  </li>
            <li> I had shaved about a week ago -- which is just as time-consuming, leads to prickly stubble, and is a lot more dangerous in such a delicate area!</li>
            <li> When I did my lip, which I also usually get waxed, it was the same thing.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several kinds in the past.</li>
            <li> (although I don&#x27;t think I would try a Brazilian, like other reviewers have).  </li>
            <li> I just used it on a small patch then took a break &amp; came back to it.</li>
            <li> &amp; i no longer have to shave every other day.</li>
            <li> Other notes:  </li>
            <li> If you find yourself needing a numbing lotion/cooling cream to help with sensitivity, you can usually find some to purchase at a local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> This resulted in my thinking I was well groomed, only to be shocked when I wore shorts and the sun hit my legs at just the right angle.  </li>
            <li> I started out epilating every other day, then i went down to once and week</li>
            <li> As I have researched hair removal in the past, I knew that it&#x27;s impossible to stay hair free for long as the cycle of air regrowth has it&#x27;s three stages.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I still have hair, since that won&#x27;t get rid of everything either (blonde &amp; fine hair is difficult to target).  </li>
            <li> As far as the brazillian part,  the attachments are not helpful at all in getting those small, hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I got all the hairs, but mine isn&#x27;t dark to begin with.</li>
            <li> 5-to get rid of th dark spots</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it does not include a super-narrow attachment like the description said.  </li>
            <li> but I was skeptical, fearing too much discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Rating is based on the average rating submitted by others.    </li>
            <li> As far as the pain goes - if you&#x27;ve ever tweezed stubborn hairs before, the pain isn&#x27;t much worse.  </li>
            <li> I bought it  about one year ago, It worked well only for 10 month, after that it didn t charge and moves slowly.</li>
            <li> the system starts to slow down on low charge.</li>
            <li> When I get waxed it takes at least a week and a half to start growing back.</li>
            <li> has not broke down</li>
            <li> So I looked up other option to shaving and watched a few tutorials on epilating on  YouTube and one that stood out was the Emjoi</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s user friendly, compact and lot less painful to use.</li>
            <li> I have to use it once a week but have noticed less hair growth.</li>
            <li> I only bought this after reading MANY reviews online, because of the awful predecessor.  </li>
            <li> , now I&#x27;ll start saving after less then 8 months.</li>
            <li> Trims, shaves, pulls hairs less painfull and in less passes.</li>
            <li> That means less stress and irritation for the skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any less pain with this product than my previous epilator.</li>
            <li> this model does not come with the face attachment, to epil my face, &amp; i didn&#x27;t feel any less pain than my previous epilator.</li>
            <li> my previous epilator was the 5681 model by Braun.</li>
            <li> the less hair you have.  </li>
            <li> I felt slight pain when doing my legs</li>
            <li> I did not do anything fancy to numb my legs first.</li>
            <li> But now, as the little hairs come in, I can go over those areas with much less pain.  </li>
            <li> The bumps calmed down a lot a few hours afterward, I also used the Prince&#x27;s ingrown hair gel.</li>
            <li> I kept a towel in one hand to wipe off the pulled hairs and to help pull skin tight while epilating.  </li>
            <li> so they have a little time to grow out.  </li>
            <li> Although the Braun is a little pricey, I trust Braun&#x27;s reputation and quality.</li>
            <li> For Underarms, it hurts a little in the beginning</li>
            <li> There was a little tingling at the start</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little but so does waxing.  </li>
            <li> and I had to let the hair on my legs grow so long before I could get it removed (I have thin but dark hair).  </li>
            <li> I wasted a lot of money.</li>
            <li> If you are scared go get waxed a few times to get used to the feeling and then switch to this.  </li>
            <li> My puppy chewed up a piece of one of the attachments and since I had it for a few years, I decided to purchase a newer model.</li>
            <li> After my initial hair removal, I use it as hairs start coming in, so I remove less, and never have the annoying phase where the hair is visible but not quite long enough to wax.</li>
            <li> The first few times were incredibly painful.</li>
            <li> First time it hurts but after you use it a few time it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad.</li>
            <li> 2-  to be hairless all the time and get every little small hair esp.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I ever will because I imagine that it is pretty darn painful.  </li>
            <li> It worked pretty well but was rather painful.</li>
            <li> This was a most expensive, bad choice on my part.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing my legs for several years, but it&#x27;s too expensive to get done at a salon, and so messy to do at home.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Taiwanese, light-skinned with thick, black (of course) hair.</li>
            <li> I had very little discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I really cannot recommend it since it is painful even though one gets used to the pain after a while.  </li>
            <li> For several months I blamed the itching on winter dryness, but expensive moisturizers did nothing.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why that is.</li>
            <li> I usually wax my armpits and armpits and legs but thought I&#x27;d try this out to see if it was easier:    </li>
            <li> no more shaving nicks) and convenient</li>
            <li> Likewise, my skin has become accustomed to the abuses of having its hair pulled out by the roots, and no longer rises up in angry red bumps, but submissively releases the hairs without a struggle.    </li>
            <li> in fact, Beware of a heavy hand!  </li>
            <li> Worst part was that I didn&#x27;t have my technique down and got a little skin irritation from pushing down too hard on the first swipe.  </li>
            <li> Before ordering this product i read the reviews about it but found those reviews very disappointing as I was using a similar product from Braun also for last 11 years and never had any problem.</li>
            <li> It took a lot longer because I went very slowly, giving myself a few breaks, and even spread it out over a few days.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I have thick dark hair, and was tired of getting my arms waxed every month.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dark and not too thin, but once I&#x27;ve been waxing since ever, they are not too thick eather.</li>
            <li> The battery is getting weak, but it&#x27;s been a few years since I bought it...</li>
            <li> so I do reckon anyone who uses this to read it, however the way they laid it out, JUST PURELY SUCKS.</li>
            <li> I find that I need to use it at least once a week because the hair grows uneavenly</li>
            <li> But at least, I did not bleed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, it was not nice.</li>
            <li> (yes even the underarms bit - at least I managed to do them with this one</li>
            <li> Seriously, get an editor, Braun.</li>
            <li> but that is next to impossible.</li>
            <li> The first time was by far the worst session, and even then the pain wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Oh man did I have really bad ingrowns and red bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting a brazillian wax for a few years now, but it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs, toes (which are really hard to wax!), underarms, bikini line, and lip/eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very confusing for the reader.</li>
            <li> I brought a razor (just in case), but found that it was completely unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> If you cry and wince from the pain of waxing, this is MUCH WORSE.</li>
            <li> Sorry, for me it was a big waste of money, I&#x27;ve owned 4 or 5 epilators before, but this one is the worst.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s less painful after showering.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the massaging cap and the underarm/bikini cap, but I found the precision cap to be slightly less painful.    </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m hoping that as the reviews seem to say, it gets less painful each time</li>
            <li> less painful perhaps.  </li>
            <li> the addition of tweezers make the epilation process less painful.</li>
            <li> Part of that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s less painful</li>
            <li> this newer model is quicker and the rotating massaging head does make it less painful on the skin.    </li>
            <li> not a good choice if you want to use it for legs!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that my braun epilator was previously used.</li>
            <li> Stick with the Emjoi which is less complicated,less expensive and gets the job done!!</li>
            <li> You have to be tough to get through this!  </li>
            <li> You have to be tough to get through this!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed from that epilator - you have to go over and over again to remove the same piece of hair and at the end it cuts the hair instead of removing it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Shaving remains the least painful way to go for me.</li>
            <li> It gets really technical and worst of all</li>
            <li> To sum it up, I&#x27;m sorry I bought this</li>
            <li> and I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Getting areas like your knees is incredibly difficult</li>
            <li> Even with the precision cap, this area was difficult to epilate.</li>
            <li> Back in the &#x27;80&#x27;s, I had the Epilady (with those coils) and it was awful.  </li>
            <li> But I was sooooooo wrong.</li>
            <li> Even not a perfect item</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> - maybe I got that wrong and should have had the wine first!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was getting too expensive</li>
            <li> Wrong, it came without that item.</li>
            <li> This product did remove hair like described, but it was a very slow and painful process.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it terribly painful on my legs, although it is worse on the underarms.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it is just cutting the hair off instead of pulling it.  </li>
            <li> Though I like it but please DONOT buy this expensive product!  </li>
            <li> If i wanted to shave I will just shave, and it won&#x27;t be that expensive!</li>
            <li> Since I am a chronic waxer, I thought everyone who said this was painful were just a bunch of babies (sorry ladies), but the pain is nothing!</li>
            <li> Plus, if your skin is moist because you just showered, the pivoting attachments stick to your skin making it impossible to glide across your skin.</li>
            <li> And it won&#x27;t hurt nearly as badly as you think.</li>
            <li> so bad with massaging roller.</li>
            <li> It is painful to use</li>
            <li> though it was painful...</li>
            <li> I have to change my rating because this thing is just ridiculously painful.  </li>
            <li> It was painful but no longer.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with the Braun Epilator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed</li>
            <li> I miss the epilator, but hate what it did to my legs.  </li>
            <li> so this is nothing, compared to those painful processes!</li>
            <li> , it is very painful, but I get no bumps or ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and I wish I could return the item.</li>
            <li> I decided once that I could skip that part and got these horrible abscess like pimples.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice product to use in your legs, but extremely painfull for bikini area and underarms. Too many attachments it&#x27;s not really necessary. I end up using only 2 of then. I think a simple model would do the same job.</li>
            <li> This was a most expensive, bad choice on my part.  The razor does not deliver what it promises.  It does not shave close; it leaves black carbon-like streak marks on your skin with each pass and does not hold a charge for long.  Absolute garbage!  I wish I could return it!</li>
            <li> Though I like it but please DONOT buy this expensive product!  Neither does it have a &#x27;precession head&#x27; or it can be used under water.  Yes I said Under Water or in Shower!  The new &#x27;wet &amp; dry&#x27; model from braun can be used under shower and is substantially chearper than 7781.</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday.  It charges completely in 1 hour, which lets you get right in there and start.  I strongly suggest reading the instructions first, as there are so many different heads with different purposes.  There are also suggestions to make the experience more comfortable.  The enclosed wipes are helpful in that if you wipe in the direction you&#x27;re going to epilate then the hairs stand up a little better.  Time will tell whether I decide to buy more, though, based on cost as well as if they are still useful as the hair thins out.      As far as the pain goes - if you&#x27;ve ever tweezed stubborn hairs before, the pain isn&#x27;t much worse.  Also, if you&#x27;ve spent money on laser hair removal, you know the coarser the hair the more painful the zap is when it \\&quot;kills\\&quot; the follicle.  If you can put up with that, you can do this.  It just takes getting used to.      Finally, the results were amazing.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong - the first session seems time consuming (30 minutes for both legs) compared to a quick shave in the shower, but I think it will be better next time as there will be less hair and I&#x27;ll be better at using it.  I did it over a towel and it was SO rewarding to see all the hair piled up on it, as well as under the caps when I cleaned the devise!  I used some aloe gel on my legs to soothe them after the first session, and the pain and redness were reduced almost immediately!</li>
            <li> I have never owned/used an epliator before. I&#x27;ve tried shaving and waxing, but shaving never lasted long, and all the at home waxes I tried didn&#x27;t work. I think this is great product. I thought that I was getting the dry epilator (which was fine), but they sent me the upgraded wet/dry version! What a pleasant surprise!  I will caution you that the epilator doesn&#x27;t get EVERY SINGLE HAIR, but the long lasting effects are still 10 times better than shaving. The light on the epilator is great because it enables you to see the hair as you are trying to remove it. I think setting aside time every week to use the epilator is a good schedule to go over areas that might not be as smooth as you want them so they have a little time to grow out.  As far as the pain goes, the sections that proved to be pretty intense were the underarm and the bikini area. If you can withstand the pain in the underarms, the results are well worth it! I didn&#x27;t have to worry about my underarms for over a week.  I personally used this product before going on a week-long vacation. I brought a razor (just in case), but found that it was completely unnecessary.  I just love this product. The price might seem a little steep, but the utility of this product will far surpass the price of razors and waxings that you will have to buy in the time you will have, use, and keep the epilator.</li>
            <li> This a great product. I have been a long time user of home waxing systems and there is no comparison. It&#x27;s easier to use, no mess and it really works great! I am ready to trash all my sticky, messy wax, for this no nonsense hair removal product. The up front cost may seem a bit much, but after just the first couple uses I don&#x27;t know how I put up with all the trouble of waxing. I highly recommend this product. Oh, and the discomfort is really nothing if you are used to waxing.</li>
            <li> I got my knee caps done and it worked pretty well on them.  The rest of my legs didn&#x27;t approve of the pain.  I can&#x27;t imagine getting used to it over time, but that is what they say.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> The Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive is a great epilator. I had to replace an older model that I lost, but this model is the best I&#x27;d ever had. I&#x27;d been using the Braun epilators for over 15 years and they are reliable and do a wonderful job (this is my third one, I still keep the first one I bought about 15 years ago as a back-up). My favorite feature is the battery, this model lets you plug it and charge it, and use it anywhere. It&#x27;s great not having to be close to an outlet. Another great feature is the light. I didn&#x27;t think that was very important, but even with all my bathroom lights on, the incorporated light helps you find those hidden hairs you missed.    This is a wonderfull product and I recommended to everyone. If you can&#x27;t tolerate pain, I recommend you shave first and start using you epilator every two-three days as the hairs start growing back. You won&#x27;t have to go back to shaving again, your hairs regrow weaker every time and fewer. After using this product for a while you won&#x27;t notice pain anymore, it becomes just a tingling.    One suggestion, don&#x27;t go back to shaving, hairs will get thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, worth the money. All the functions are very good, and keeps my legs smooth for quite a long time. The best epilator.  My boy friend loves to use it to shave his mustache than his own because it shaves more smoothly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to remove hair and eventually make it thinner and thinner so one day, it would be gone.  You must use this frequently (short hair) and practice exfoliation however, being a fair skinned person no amount of exfoliation relieves me of bumps.  I continue to use it as directed still hoping that one day the hair will be gone.  I really cannot recommend it since it is painful even though one gets used to the pain after a while.  I also think there has to be a better way to remove hair.  The dermatologist told me I wouldn&#x27;t be a good candidate for laser hair removal since I don&#x27;t have thick, dark coarse hair.  Bummer.  I am hoping laser hair removal will improve.  Waxing left my fair skin with redness for several days.  Shaving remains the least painful way to go for me.</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;d like to say this is an OKAY epilator. It doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair, but it does work. So 3/5 for that. Next up, I cannot stress enough about the instructions. It&#x27;s useful to know about some information so I do reckon anyone who uses this to read it, however the way they laid it out, JUST PURELY SUCKS. I am usually pretty good at understanding instructions because most of the time it is self-explanatory. But no, if you&#x27;re the type of person who likes to quickly skim through manual books, you&#x27;re going to be up for some serious hair pulling. Whoever put together this instruction booklet obviously did not care too much and just decided to throw it together less than 2 minutes. It gets really technical and worst of all it&#x27;s very confusing for the reader. The diagrams are labeled with numbers, HOWEVER, the numbers are also scattered all over the instructions. Seriously, get an editor, Braun. But overall, this is quite useful and I wouldn&#x27;t mind continuing to use it, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone, because it was after all a costy price tag for a not so great epilator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting a brazillian wax for a few years now, but it&#x27;s expensive and I thought this would be a good option to save money.  First of all, when you use it on your legs, don&#x27;t expect a smooth feel like you get with a shaver.  Your legs will never feel that smooth with this no matter how often you use it.  As far as the brazillian part,  the attachments are not helpful at all in getting those small, hard to reach places.  Plus, if your skin is moist because you just showered, the pivoting attachments stick to your skin making it impossible to glide across your skin. I find that I need to use it at least once a week because the hair grows uneavenly and there&#x27;s always going to be some hair growth.  To sum it up, I&#x27;m sorry I bought this and I&#x27;ll probably return it and go back to getting waxed every 6 weeks.   It&#x27;s just easier.</li>
            <li> Very good product but had to order the part I really wanted from someone else</li>
            <li> This product is great - I can&#x27;t believe that I went this long without knowing about it.  The only downside is that the most painful time is the fist time that you use it.  If you have had a wax before, it is similar to that.  After you  have used it a few times, it barely hurts at all.  I have not touched my razor since receiving this.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my sister got one and loved it.  Make no mistake, this will hurt.  Especially if you&#x27;ve only ever shaved before.  I read a lot of reviews from people saying they didn&#x27;t get a facial attachment, which confuses me because I did.  I got every attachment they show in the product picture.      I bought this because I have thick dark hair, and was tired of getting my arms waxed every month.  The wax and the yanking of the skin caused me to break out a lot, and get red bumps for a few days.  I had no problem using this on my arms.  It hurt a little bit more than waxing, only because I had to go slower - if you move the epil too fast, it won&#x27;t pick up all the hair.  But unlike waxing, the pain immediately went away, and I had no bumps and no breakouts.  When I did my lip, which I also usually get waxed, it was the same thing.      When I did my legs and my under arms, it was a whole different story because I&#x27;ve always shaved these.  It was much more painful (as I expected) and the pain lingered a bit more.  It took a lot longer because I went very slowly, giving myself a few breaks, and even spread it out over a few days.  But now, as the little hairs come in, I can go over those areas with much less pain.  I still haven&#x27;t made it to the bikini area yet, but I&#x27;m sure I will.      I really like this product because, unlike waxing, the hair does not have to be very long.  After my initial hair removal, I use it as hairs start coming in, so I remove less, and never have the annoying phase where the hair is visible but not quite long enough to wax.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my Remington Smooth &amp; Silky because I found it to be slow, noisy and broke off hairs instead of removing them.  Instantly I noticed a difference.  The Braun removed more hairs, faster.  The light can be difficult to work with, it can \\&quot;hide\\&quot; hairs as some have noted, it is very bright, but if you look at an angle across the light you can see the ultra fine hairs, as well as the ultra-smooth results!  I loathe and love epilating my bikini line, it is very painful, but I get no bumps or ingrown hairs.  I highly recommend the Olay pre-epilation wipes, they don&#x27;t seem to take away the pain, but they do help relieve some of the post-epilation stinging and sensitivity (use them as directed, my skin is really sensitive post epilation so I don&#x27;t put anything on them until the morning shower after, I&#x27;m still looking for a post-epil solution that doesn&#x27;t hurt like something else, but using these before seems to help prevent some of that sensitivity).  Although the Braun is a little pricey, I trust Braun&#x27;s reputation and quality.</li>
            <li> I bought it  about one year ago, It worked well only for 10 month, after that it didn t charge and moves slowly.</li>
            <li> This hair removal system is wonderful!  I have been using it all summer and am completely satisfied.  I would previously have extremely sensitive skin from waxing and now this product has replaced my need for waxing.  My skin is happier and so is my purse.</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator and loved it.  My legs wouldn&#x27;t get as smooth as they do with shaving, but I could go about a week without having to re-do them.  I was as happy as could be until about 4 months later when I started to get terrible itching on my legs.  For several months I blamed the itching on winter dryness, but expensive moisturizers did nothing.  I finally started to do some research and discovered that the epilator could cause itching.  I&#x27;ve since stopped using it and the itching went away, but now my legs have red spots from scratching and inflammation.  I&#x27;m now using moisturizers and antibiotic ointment to hopefully clear up the problem, but my doctor says it could take months.  I miss the epilator, but hate what it did to my legs.  So, beware.</li>
            <li> This purchase was replacing a 12+ year old Braun that I was very happy with, but finally died. When I went to shop online for a replacement I was overwhelmed by the choices, but finally went with another Braun. I am amazed at the improvement over the years. This is unbelievably faster than my old one! I use to spend 20 minutes plus doing my lower legs and barely spend 10 now!!! Love it. Even decided to do my underarms, which I have never even tried. It was nearly painless (I have very little underarm hair--and it is fine). I love all the different attachments and the fact that I can clean it with water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this epilator regularly for 6 weeks, and I absolutely love it! I waxed once maybe 12 years ago, but since then all I did was shave. So I was understandably nervous when trying it. However my fears were unfounded. It works very well, and it is not painful! The first time was by far the worst session, and even then the pain wasn&#x27;t bad at all. Nothing we ladies can&#x27;t handle after everything we go through on a monthly basis. And after the first time, it is a walk in the park. I now epilate all the way up my legs but haven&#x27;t tried the under arm area yet (never you mind the bikini zone!), but I think I&#x27;ll venture across that bridge sometime soon. Epilating is now not painful at all. You feel it a little at the very beginning of the session but 10 seconds or so in, your mind starts thinking about other things and I am not even aware of any discomfort!     Just so you are aware: when you change legs while epiating, you will feel it more. I am not sure why that is. So just be aware of it. But the discomfort will last a couple of seconds and then you are good to go. :-)     The epilator itself is adorable and sparkly (yes, appearances count! ;-)) and all the attachments work great! I absolutely love it. I was not eager to spend so much money on a device that would cause me pain, but I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my investment. The day I got it, I also purchased a loofa, just to prevent ingrown hairs, and so far I haven&#x27;t had one!     If you are on the fence about this product, be assured it is a very high quality and very well made device. And you will like it. And it won&#x27;t hurt nearly as badly as you think. Go on, give it a whirl. ;-)</li>
            <li> I usually wax my armpits and armpits and legs but thought I&#x27;d try this out to see if it was easier:    It does seem pretty well constructed and easy to use but it&#x27;s also very loud. The light is useful if you have really fine or light hair.     However I was having problems with it picking up all the hair-I&#x27;d pass over the same area several times and there&#x27;d still be some hair left behind. Also I think it was just ripping my leg hairs off rather than plucking. They were smooth immediately after but became prickly the next day which never happens when I wax.     Surprisingly i think it&#x27;s actually more painful than waxing or just plucking by hand. And since i have to make several passes it actually takes longer too  I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it actually plucked all the hair but it doesn&#x27;t so I&#x27;d rather just stick to waxing and plucking by hand.</li>
            <li> This handy little shaver/epilator is a must for every gal. 2 weeks after I did my legs and even my arms and still no hair. After 3 weeks just tiny fine hairs appeared and were even easier to remove. Yes the first time it did pinch, but no razor cuts or pulling of hairs in-mass out of my body!</li>
            <li> I like the braun epilator. It is painful to use but it does it&#x27;s job. I was disappointed that my braun epilator was previously used. There was a greasy stuff on it and all plastic bags were open. I think that for this price Amazon should make sure that the product is sealed and if returned should be properly cleansed.</li>
            <li> As a veteran epilator of many years, I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of my new Braun. I&#x27;ve had  my old one for over ten years and have really appreciated it. I decided to get a newer unit in hopes  that they had improved on comfort and also because my previous Braun is corded only.     The new one finally came today and I immediately took it out for a test drive. What a disappointment!  Contrary to the many reviews I read prior to purchase, this model did a very poor job on my upper  lip. Despite repeated tries, I still had hair that simply would not be pulled. I will add that I had  waited for well over a week without plucking or epilating and the hair was long enough to have been pulled  with my older unit. I definitely would not want to let it grow out any longer. I even tried the unit  without the shield but still, no go. Additionally, I found that this model is too large to get close  to the nose area. I did not attempt to try it on my legs.    As the upper lip was primarily the reason for purchasing the newer model, I finally gave up and  repackaged this Braun. Back to old faithful.</li>
            <li> Ok, so let me start out by saying that I have had my epilator for almost 4 months and I waited to review it till now because it took me a while to get the hang of it.  I bought it because it was suggested to me, by a friend, to try epilating instead of shaving.  I had never used an epilator before buying this one.      I&#x27;m pretty sure, due to the nature of what the machine is doing, there is no such thing as a painless epilator.  Think about it, it is ripping hair out of your skin.  That can&#x27;t be made painless unless the thing is actually numbing your skin before pulling.  So is this product painless, absolutely not.  However, that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a great product.    This epilator does a great job at ripping out hair.  It has a really cool light that helps you to see the hair and I know for a fact that if I didn&#x27;t have that, I would have many patches of hair left over.  This epilator has these rotating things on either side of the tweezer part and I think they help to raise the hair so that it doesn&#x27;t miss.  I was impressed with how short my hair could be and yet it would still work.  I was left with no redness and no itching and no issues!      The pain DOES decrease as you use it but only because you get used to the pain.  I suppose if you have a high pain tolerance you might think that its not painful at all but I think your pain tolerance has to be pretty darn high.  Note to anyone who might buy this, make sure that you are using an exfoliator on your legs each day once you start epilating or you WILL get ingrown hairs.  I thought I could escape this for some reason and I was wrong.  Which, of course, at first i wanted to blame the product on but its not the products fault if you get ingrown hairs.  its your own fault.  This product does what it says it will do and it does it well but if you are new to epilating there are somethings you have to learn about, like exfoliating...really well!    The nice thing about this epilator is that it comes with a shaving head.  Getting areas like your knees is incredibly difficult so its nice to be able to just shave those areas.  Be aware, you won&#x27;t get the perfectly smooth, just shaved with a razor, feel when epilating.  It just won&#x27;t happen because you cannot get every single hair that is above your skin every single time.  What you do get is longer lasting smoothness though.      I have not tried epilating my under arms and I don&#x27;t think I ever will because I imagine that it is pretty darn painful.  I have tried my bikini area but I couldn&#x27;t stand the pain.  My legs, however, will never see a normal razor again. I started out epilating every other day, then i went down to once and week and now its only once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> First of all, if you DO NOT have a high tolerance for pain, I strongly suggest that you not purchase this product, especially because this set it very expensive. If you cry and wince from the pain of waxing, this is MUCH WORSE. There, you have been forewarned.    Anyways, I&#x27;ve been testing the product on different parts of the body for over a month and I&#x27;ll rate the pain level on a scale of 1-10. Just a general note, trim your hairs if they are longer than 1/4\\&quot;, because the epilator will hurt more otherwise.    Lower arms: 3.5 - It hurts the first time, but it&#x27;s very tolerable and quick. I don&#x27;t get any ingrown hairs. Used on both settings. (Massaging cap)    Legs: 5.5 - Lower legs hurt more than the thighs, and I&#x27;ve had more ingrown hairs on my lower legs. It takes forever to get all the hairs and it&#x27;s less painful after showering.   Yes, the hairs are gone a little longer, but shaving is easier and much faster. Exfoliate often. Used on 2.(Massaging cap)    Underarms: 6 - The first few times were incredibly painful. If the hairs are kept sparse and short, the process hurts less, but you will have to remove hairs more often. This is definitely more preferable to waxing. Used on 2. DO NOT use products like Tend Skin immediately following hair removal because the skin WILL burn.(Massaging and underarm cap)    Stomach and lower back: 1-1.5 - Quick and easy. Almost painless. Both settings work well and works well dry or wet. Exfoliate. (Massaging cap)    Bikini: 11 - Honestly, I may just go back to waxing. It was so painful, but it&#x27;s great for touching up the bikini line. Be sure to exfoliate frequently as this area is highly prone to ingrown hairs. Used it on both settings. I&#x27;ve tried the massaging cap and the underarm/bikini cap, but I found the precision cap to be slightly less painful.    Upper lip: 3/4 - Even with the precision cap, this area was difficult to epilate. I don&#x27;t think I got all the hairs, but mine isn&#x27;t dark to begin with. Lots of redness. (Precisioncap only)    Hopefully, this review has been helpful to most. I found that there really is no need for all the caps aside from the precision and massaging caps. There is also a shaver/trimmer, which I used and it works as advertised. On a side note, this machine is loud so I wouldn&#x27;t use it while people are asleep.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my wife which died within an year. Although it worked well in the beginning, it was no longer effective after using it for couple of times and eventually died.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a waxer I can handle the pain and it is not much anyway. If you want the following;1- investing your money in  a long lasting method that you do not have to repurchase waxes , cleaning products, blades etc. 2-  to be hairless all the time and get every little small hair esp. The armpits. 3- to have more control and avoid all the mess that come with the other methods. 4- avoid the bruises injuries hurs that come either with the waxing or shaving. 5-to get rid of th dark spots I&#x27;m daaaaarn happy i got rid of them 6- here is somthing new with all the stretching &amp; bulling  of the skin that comes with the waxing your skin with time will look like if you were old belive me it is true so you will have to avoid all of this.  THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO GET THIS!!!!!! The best invention ever XD and the light makes it much more amazing. No matter how much you think that you have a good lighting, you will just appreciate the light in it. However, the towels and the massaging head didn&#x27;t really make any difference with the pain it is still the same. I was afarid at first of one of the reviewers who mentioned that the photo is not what you get and it is true at i got is more like Braun 7681 Silk-Epil 7 Xpressive Pro Epilator with the extra head so no complain XD</li>
            <li> I recently decided to purchase an epilator due to growing issues after shaving, my skin has become extremely sensitive. So I looked up other option to shaving and watched a few tutorials on epilating on  YouTube and one that stood out was the Emjoi so I purchased it and was sooo impressed and decided to give it to my daughter who has the same issues. I decided to try a higher rated and more expensive epilator by Braun due to all the reviews and mind you I did a lot of research on each product and the reviews were so convincing that I bought it. Needless to say even though it had many more gadgets it was not worth the price and having already tried the Emjoi epilator there is no comparison! The Braun epilator did not remove as many hairs as the Emjoi! Stick with the Emjoi which is less complicated,less expensive and gets the job done!! I ended up returning the Braun and purchased the Emjoi epilator and I&#x27;m as happy as can be!!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed from that epilator - you have to go over and over again to remove the same piece of hair and at the end it cuts the hair instead of removing it. If i wanted to shave I will just shave, and it won&#x27;t be that expensive! And also the epilator creates a lot of ingrown hair... Sorry, for me it was a big waste of money, I&#x27;ve owned 4 or 5 epilators before, but this one is the worst.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many epilators before I found this one. None of the others were as efficient as this one. It delivers exactly what it promises. No disappointments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several kinds in the past. Really like this one, it&#x27;s easy to use, painless, fast and clean! Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very good device, will get rid of the hair but you need to follow up every week, it does hurt the first few times.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It really minimizes hair growth if you use it all the time. I have to use it once a week but have noticed less hair growth. If I shave in between I notice a lot more hair growth then when I use this product. The only thing is you have to use it all the time or your hair will grow coarse. First time it hurts but after you use it a few time it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad.</li>
            <li> I have an older Braun epilator and was in need of an upgrade. I went to the Braun website and tried to order from there but that is next to impossible. I researched other epilators and went back to the Braun. Since I have been using an epilator for a while I didn&#x27;t have the pain that comes with being new epilating.  I love the fact that this is rechargeable and can use it without the cord getting in the way. Have yet to try it on my underarms as I would get a lot of ingrown hairs from using the older one.  Will update on that when I finally use it for under the arms.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  Back in the &#x27;80&#x27;s, I had the Epilady (with those coils) and it was awful.  (My husband nicknamed it the Nazi-Lady.)  I&#x27;ve been waxing my legs for several years, but it&#x27;s too expensive to get done at a salon, and so messy to do at home.  I only bought this after reading MANY reviews online, because of the awful predecessor.  This has worked GREAT for me.  I used it on my legs, toes (which are really hard to wax!), underarms, bikini line, and lip/eyebrows.  I don&#x27;t find it terribly painful on my legs, although it is worse on the underarms.  But after the first time, not all of the hair grows back at the same time, so there is always less to do than the initial time, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much.  Same for the bikini line (although I don&#x27;t think I would try a Brazilian, like other reviewers have).  Also, it is so much faster to do a touch-up whenever necessary than with wax or a razor.      The only complaint I have is that it does not include a super-narrow attachment like the description said.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s something you can get separately, but I haven&#x27;t found it anywhere yet.  That would really help with eyebrows; I have only used it for the few hairs in between my brows, not for shaping.  But that&#x27;s a very minor downside, compared with everything else it does well.  I am extremely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> My Braun is made in Germany and it is feels sturdy. I am not disappointed.    The first time I used it, it HURT. Had I not read these reviews that encourage you to keep on using it, I would have given up in the first minute. The truth is, you get used to it.    It takes some time upfront to epilate all the hairs but you end up have a smooth shave and you cant see the hairs under the skin. I love this thing!    OH! A warning!! BE SURE to follow the directions and clean your skin immediatly before using the epilator!! I decided once that I could skip that part and got these horrible abscess like pimples. Took them weeks to completely heal.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from amazon couple of days ago and they have mistakenly send me the BRAUN 7281 ....I was going to complain but after reviewing the difference from official Braun website, I figured there is not much difference .... so I gave it a try today &amp; I absolutely fell in love with......it charges pretty fast and NO! The charge does not go away on the middle of your usage! It does its job pretty quickly so it holds enough charge left over. Additional, I did not go through any crucial pain as I was expecting for! For the legs, it was a piece of cake for me! For Underarms, it hurts a little in the beginning but if you taunt your skin enough, the pain is bearable and go away after couple of minutes! I have not tried it on anywhere else yet...would update as soon as I do.....overall I strongly recommend everyone out there to have one! you guys would love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this product but I was skeptical, fearing too much discomfort.  I am 54 and have difficulty seeing the hair on my legs when trying to shave in the shower without my glasses.  This resulted in my thinking I was well groomed, only to be shocked when I wore shorts and the sun hit my legs at just the right angle.  I figured I had nothing to loose, if I didn&#x27;t like it my daughter could still use the product.  We both love it!!  There was a little tingling at the start but within seconds I realized the sensation (I would NOT call it pain) was not an issue.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and I wish I could return the item. I wasted a lot of money. I&#x27;ve used a Philips Satinelle Epilator, without any additional protecting caps for 15 years, for all parts of my body, even for my underarm and bikini line. I&#x27;ve never had any problems, even though I&#x27;ve had to epilate every week. But at least, I did not bleed. When I heard of this epilator of Braun, I thought it would be time for a change, for a new, more professionel model. But I was sooooooo wrong. Today I&#x27;ve epilated my body, using the underarm cap, and indeed, I don&#x27;t have any hair either under my arm or at my bikini line. Instead, I&#x27;ve lots of bruises and I am bleeding! And I have aches! I can only hope, that I will not get some infection or have damaged my skin forever. Maybe you think I have a very delicate or sensitive skin, or I have no idea how to epilate correctly, but as I&#x27;ve mentioned above, this is not the first time I use an epilator in this delicate areas of my body. And I also have let wax these areas regularly. However, I also must admit that I was able to epilate my legs without problems. In summary, I don&#x27;t recommend this product because you will not be able to use it for all parts of your body. (By the way, thank God, I didn&#x27;t try it on my face, even though there is a cap for that area too...) So, if you only would like to have an epilator for your legs, buy a cheaper and simpler model by Braun. Or even better, buy an epilator which works as described and claimed...</li>
            <li> I have only used this once to epilate, so I am still getting used to the pull in some areas.  Legs were a piece of cake, very little noticable hair pull, other, more tender areas, very noticable.  The shaver attachment works great.  It shaves much closer than a regular electric razor, lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Shaving lasts only a day for me.  When I use the epil, I get a full two weeks.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I took the advice of another reviewer and combined my purchase of the Silk-Epil with a stock of Princereigns - an ingrown hair preventative.  I also started by shaving, waiting five days, and then beginning the epilation process.  Also I should say that I have very fair and sensitive skin, dark hair and well-rooted but fine hair.  Waxing has always been spottily effective for me.    Also, I am one of those people who remember the \\&quot;epilators\\&quot; of the 80&#x27;s, with horror.  The Silk-Epil truly is a new generation.  I found the combination of the epilator and the princereigns to be very effective.  Removing hair by the roots is never painless, but the various heads and options on the epilator make it very manageable and let you get even curved, complicated areas.  Also, the shaver head is handy to trim bikini hair, and to shave areas you&#x27;re not quite ready to try the epilator on. The rechargeable unit is great, no bother with cords when trying to get those tricky areas.  So, my process:  - Shower with an exfoliator or scrub.  - Dry thoroughly and NO lotion.  - Use the pre-epilation wipes (anyone know where you can get more of those???).  - Epilate.  - Apply princereigns and allow to dry.  - Apply lotion.    Regrowth is sparser, and the pain is thus reduced.  It does take a while to epilate your entire leg and bikini region, so plan on setting aside some time.      Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> it works great on my underarms. not a good choice if you want to use it for legs!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always trusted Hotwax to remove body hair....for reasons like, smooth skin, getting rid of Dead skin and so on...though it was painful...I continued, and for emergencies resorted to shaving....but like most of us I&#x27;ve pretty sensitive skin, whick reacts to tiniest of irritation..leaving my skin bumped and red with rashes....I heard about epilating from a friend of mine...but was reluctant to experiment new thing!!....my hubby gifted Braun Silk epil on my birthday...and i tried it the same day.....OUCH....the first use was pretty painful...it left my skin with bruises, bumps and rashes....they lasted for 12hrs(I epilated in the night, before going to bed..) and in the morning TA DA......I love my skin....the pain was worth it:)....and from second use onwards it was not as painful as it was the first time...and the bonus is with the new pulsating head...I can get rid of deadskin and also Tan;)......on the whole I love my Silk epil....</li>
            <li> I like this epilator body system. It is much better than the previous one I had before.  Good thing is that you can both epilate and trim.  I like it very much and I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Brazil and always did brazilian waxing here. I&#x27;m not used to blazers at all. My hair is dark and not too thin, but once I&#x27;ve been waxing since ever, they are not too thick eather. First time I used, I was before my period, so much more sensible. The first minut is really a pain, but then you get used to it. It feels like little shocks, but after pulling out the first hairs, it get much better. This did not happen only in the first time, but everytime I feel the same. You have to keep redoing it for a couple times to pull out all the hair. It won&#x27;t pull out all of them at the first. The battery is great, so far I&#x27;ve epilated my under arm 3 times and my lower let 2 times and it still has battery. During epilation, you have to (or should) open the cap and pull out the hair that stays there. I&#x27;m also using only the regular cap to do all parts. I beleive I won&#x27;t have courage to do my bikini.... I think that for this part, I&#x27;ll keep going to the saloon, even because there are parts we can&#x27;t reach very well and I like the bikine region perfec! This is my first epilator and just bought it because my sister bought it too and loved it.   ** It really doesn&#x27;t come with the face cap. The under arm cap might be good to do it, but I haven&#x27;t tried.    Well, considering I used to pay $ 5,00 for under arm and $ 10,00 for lower leg everytime I went to the saloon, now I&#x27;ll start saving after less then 8 months. I don&#x27;t need to wait for hair grow so much eather, I can always do it whenever I want. Even not a perfect item, it&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend ton of money on waxing. It&#x27;s user friendly, compact and lot less painful to use. Love it...</li>
            <li> This being the third one in 20 years, she still likes the product based on the design and performance. Being cordless adds a lot of convenience and saves time, too.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this kit I was pleasantly surprised that everything listed and shown in the photo was included. The quality is very high and the variety of attachments makes epilating an easy, if not totally painless process. Clean up is easy and fast. My boyfriend has also used it and found the product to be a good buy. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Well offcourse it&#x27;s not for me, I ordered it from my account for someone. The person who wanted it had already used it in past &amp; liked it so much that wanted to go with same one, don&#x27;t know what happened to the last one that person had. I found the best price here so ordered it from here/amazon.  Amazon is always awesome with most of it&#x27;s products &amp; prices, sometimes deals you can find here cannot be found at other places.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator, I bought it after doing an extensive online search for the product, I found the best deal on amazon for it. I had tried the older model which was non-chargable. I was bummed when I opened the box &amp; found that out! So I bit the bullet &amp; paid a little extra for this model and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s easy and convenient to use, the first time I used it, it hurt a lot. I just used it on a small patch then took a break &amp; came back to it. Later on, using the epilator was a breeze! Now I use it for legs and arms. I use the razor head for underarms &#x27;cos when I tried the epilator head on underarms it hurt so much i had to stop. Regardless, I think this product is much safer (no more shaving nicks) and convenient (i can use it while i watch tv) and reliable (i use it about once a week..). Considering the money I was paying for the intuition shaver &amp; cartridge (that was the only razor i could use on my skin) this is a great investment! I would recommend it to all my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Great in any way for what was designed to do. I don&#x27;t know hands on but my wife, who had all kind of epilators, says there it&#x27;s no comparison. Trims, shaves, pulls hairs less painfull and in less passes. That means less stress and irritation for the skin and that&#x27;s priceless. It even has small LED light that will highlight the \\&quot;working field\\&quot;. Very versatile and practical.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing EVERYTHING for over a year (underarms, full brazilian, and legs; I get my eyebrows threaded because my skin is too sensitive) and it is a pain to get waxed because the lady I go to is really far away from my house and so that is what started me on this quest. A co-worker suggested the lower model and showed me all these great customer reviews, being how I am, I wanted all the bells and whistles so I went with the product. I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED!     Since I am a chronic waxer, I thought everyone who said this was painful were just a bunch of babies (sorry ladies), but the pain is nothing! I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m a masochist, but I like the way it feels on my legs, but when I moved to my upper arms, it was a bit of a shock, and I did feel more pain there, but again nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle. I just love the results. My underarms have been smooth and no bumps! Make sure you keep your skin taut to get the best results! My legs are a different story, the first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t heed the warnings of my co-worker and just went all out with a leg full of hair. Oh man did I have really bad ingrowns and red bumps. The bumps calmed down a lot a few hours afterward, I also used the Prince&#x27;s ingrown hair gel. That really helps with the itches and ingrowns. That was the very first time I ever used it. I used the pre-epilation wipes, epilated, showered, and then used the ingrown hair gel. The epilator has gotten SO MUCH BETTER EVERY TIME I USE IT AFTERWARD! I have used it three times since then and I still get the occasional ingrown, but I have been exfoliating a ton, which is what helps the best. EXFOLIATE! EXFOLIATE! EXFOLIATE! Or else...    The first time I used it I got really brave and decided to try my bikini area...MAN OH MAN DID IT KILL! I sucked it up and got the area done, but it is very scary to do that area because you have to stretch the skin and the angles make it more challenging. Luckily this comes with the shaver WHICH IS AWESOME! I now epilate only the bikini area (the leg and crease) and shave the remaining and I shave everything without the guard and I have yet to cut myself. I try to be extremely careful.    I did get red bumps, but I have very sensitive skin, so it is pretty normal for me regardless of shaving or waxing. Overall I think this is a great product, I love that it is cordless. And really if you can deal with the pain (which I think is nothing on my legs and underarms) then I would reccommend buying this product ASAP and start saving from not getting waxed! The hair stays away just as long as waxing and I am no longer ripping off layers of my skin! :-) :-)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while and I love it, but I noticed it cuts hair instead of pulling them.. I can&#x27;t tell if this is normal or not since I don&#x27;t have any other epilator to test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using it and only ordered one new head even though I have this for about 5 years</li>
            <li> I bought this product through amazon at a fantastic price, mainly because it is washable and also works with and without the cord, although I don&#x27;t recommend it with the cord while in the shower. I have tried Braun&#x27;s Soft perfection, silk x&#x27;elle, Pansonic&#x27;s wet and dry epilator and also Phillips satinelle and the Braun 7781 was the best, most superior epilator I have ever tried. This was the most painless epilation experience I had and I also managed to do my legs in 1/3rd the time it normally takes me with other epilators because this has a head that tilts at various angles to give u the closest epilation without having to go over the area over and over. It also seems to manage to grab the shortest hairs. The shaver head is absolutely amazing beacuse it gave a very close shave in sensitive areas but felt absolutely safe unlike a conventional razor. I would highly recommend this particular model. I didn&#x27;t go for the 7281 mainly because it supposedly does not turn on when in the charger mode for safety reasons and I usually don&#x27;t like to use it on a purely battery mode if I&#x27;m close to a power point since the battery can run out after sometime and the system starts to slow down on low charge. The 7781 seems to give u the best of both worlds as it can be used in any mode.</li>
            <li> I really like it, I can&#x27;t say if another one is better or not since this is my first one but it&#x27;s easy for a newbie to use. Pretty painful the first time you use it, I did my bikini line, legs and under arms and needed some wine to get me thru it, but after your first time it&#x27;s way easier! I just do my underarms and bikini line now and still shave in between once in a great while. A great tip I got was to put powder on the area your doing, it makes it easier and you won&#x27;t burn or hurt yourself which I have done a couple times on my underarms. Just go slow and pull the skin taut, it&#x27;s better than shaving or waxing and since I have light colored skin and dark hair it makes my bikini line and underarm look a lot better!!!</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned so shaving left the black roots in my legs. I tried the epilater &amp; love it!! There are no hair roots left &amp; i no longer have to shave every other day. My legs stay smooth for almost 2 weeks!     If you are new to epilators, i would also recommend the wet/dry panasonic epilator as you can use it in the shower, so your skin is less sensitive. I upgraded to this epilator because of the various heads &amp; faster charge time. I didn&#x27;t notice any less pain with this product than my previous epilator. I did not give it 5 stars b/c this model does not come with the face attachment, to epil my face, &amp; i didn&#x27;t feel any less pain than my previous epilator. Overall, this product is great &amp; worth the cost. I only wish it was a wet/dry epilator.     Epilating will hurt the first time (...Epilators are plucking a group of hairs at once). However, the results are worth the initial pain &amp; I definitely will not go back to shaving.</li>
            <li> Ok, really, I&#x27;m not ready to dump my shaver as I&#x27;m still scared of trying the underarms. :)    I bought the rechargeable Braun Epil system 2 weeks ago. It charged for a week as I tried to get my nerves up to try it. A week ago I took the plunge. I&#x27;m not going to lie, it was not nice. I&#x27;d say it felt like taking hot sandpaper to my lower legs. But it did get easier I I persevered. I did my lower legs and some of my upper legs. As I have researched hair removal in the past, I knew that it&#x27;s impossible to stay hair free for long as the cycle of air regrowth has it&#x27;s three stages. At best you&#x27;re removing 1/2 the hairs as the other half are in the resting stages. So I decided that I would do the epilation every Sunday. And every week I&#x27;d go a little further up my inner thigh (I&#x27;m a good 5 inches below the bikini area. I doubt I&#x27;ll make my easing into the most sensitive areas until after swimsuit season but I will get there. :)    Anyway, the product is great. After one week my legs felt still pretty smooth but I could start to see a couple hairs and it wasn&#x27;t as silky as the week before. So I think my plan of weekly until the hairs grow back slower is a good idea.    Like the other reviewers I have very sensitive skin. I can not shave without using a cortisone cream afterwards. That was the only way I found to stop the rash. Because of that, I chose to use the cortisone cream with aloe afterwards as my skin was really itchy (very dry skin as well). The first time the red bumps disappeared after about 3 hours. This time they left within 30 minutes. Very cool product.    Eventually I will toss my shaver out. I will get to the point of epilating the underarms as well as the bikini area but being that I don&#x27;t like pain, I need to work up to it.    Time it took to do the lower and most of the upper legs: the first time it took about 40 minutes. That was with me turning it off to convince myself this was a good thing. This week took only about 12-15 minutes and I only turned it off once between doing each leg so that I could tap out the pulled hairs.     So far I&#x27;m using the Olay wips as they cam with it. I&#x27;m not sure what difference they make bust since all is going smoothly (pun intended) I&#x27;ll keep using them. I believe I saw them sold separately here on amazon.    Before I bought the product, I did research it and appreciated EVERYONE&#x27;S reviews, here on Amazon and just googling the web. If you&#x27;re nervous or hesitant, I highly recommend going to YouTube and searching for Braun epil. There is a young lady that did a 10 minute video introducing you to the epilator. It was very good and pushed me towards the purchase. I really liked seeing a demonstration of how it worked.    Truly this is a great product and I will be recommending it to my daughter as shaving has been a source of literal irritation. :)</li>
            <li> OK so I&#x27;m no stranger to epilating and have done my legs for years with my trusty, old epilator but tried my underarms once and hardly even got going it was so painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided it was time to invest in a new one and particularly wanted one for doing under my arms. So after reading loads of reviews on here and elsewhere decided this was the model for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it on charge and had a browse through the instructions and looked at the various heads supplied - so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fully charged I was ready, gave my legs a quick wipe with the included Pre-epilation wipes and proceeded.&lt;br /&gt;Not having to be next to a power point (my old one was corded) is a great bonus and the smartlight really shows up the little hairs that you&#x27;d otherwise miss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing my legs was a easy, as I said I&#x27;ve done them before anyway but with this model it was quick, efficient and hardly felt a thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep breath, the moment I&#x27;d been waiting for and the reason I chose this model....underarms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hurt! Sorry but I can&#x27;t lie, it really hurt! But I persevered, gritted my teeth, did the breathing exercises they tell you to do for child birth and stuck with it (then treated myself to a large glass of wine afterwards which really helped - maybe I got that wrong and should have had the wine first!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to get the skin under your arms really taut and I found bending my arm across the top of my head was the best I could do - I&#x27;m hoping that as the reviews seem to say, it gets less painful each time and I will come back and update at a later date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoroughly recommend this model, compared to my older model it&#x27;s brilliant and does a much better job, much quicker and less painfully (yes even the underarms bit - at least I managed to do them with this one and hopefully it&#x27;ll be easier next time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Three weeks on and it&#x27;s been great not having to shave under my arms every couple of days. I&#x27;ve just zapped thefew really fine hairs that had started to appear under my arms. It took a couple of minutes and hardly felt anything (honestly!!) - certainly nothing like the painful first time. So if like me you&#x27;re scared of the pain - stick with it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> I love this hair remover.  I used to wax but it was getting too expensive and I had to let the hair on my legs grow so long before I could get it removed (I have thin but dark hair).  This allows me to remove when I want and I have saved over the long term vs. waxing.  It does hurt a little but so does waxing.  If you are scared go get waxed a few times to get used to the feeling and then switch to this.  The bag is great to keep everything together.  Charges quick and holds the charge a long time.  My skin is so dry shaving just causes too much irritation, I&#x27;m so happy I gave this a try!</li>
            <li> Having been a little skeptical about the ability of the Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator to effectively remove all hair, I must say I have been impressed with the closeness of the shave.  And while at first, the pain is similar to the first time waxing, or quickly removing a strong adhesive bandage, it does not take long to become accustomed to it.  Likewise, my skin has become accustomed to the abuses of having its hair pulled out by the roots, and no longer rises up in angry red bumps, but submissively releases the hairs without a struggle.    Also, because the hairs did not have a regular schedule of popping out, I was required to epilate every few days.  But now, three months later, the hairs have diminished in number and coarseness, and are more organized and disciplined, making their appearance as a group and much less frequently.  Other notes:  ~LOVE the cordless/rechargeable option!  ~no need to apply pressure while epilating...in fact, Beware of a heavy hand!  ~having to wait for significant regrowth between treatments is a MYTH.  The Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator can remove hair that is barely visible above the skin&#x27;s surface!</li>
            <li> Got this to replace a Braun Silk-Epil i&#x27;d had about 6 years.Great being rechargable now and heaps quieter.Also grabs hairs well- and ?less painful perhaps.  Overall, very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it. I don&#x27;t think you need a waterproof one- I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be standing in the shower wasting water whilst I used it!</li>
            <li> watch the tutorial on you tube before you use it. It is the best hair removal method I have ever had</li>
            <li> Before ordering this product i read the reviews about it but found those reviews very disappointing as I was using a similar product from Braun also for last 11 years and never had any problem. Trusting my own experience and ignoring the reviews I ordered the product and my decision didn&#x27;t let me down. we are happy with it so far and hope that it will go same long way as our older product. You know what! our older product from Braun was still good and we gifted it to someone!    Thnx.</li>
            <li> Rating is based on the average rating submitted by others.    However, note that the 3 customer images that have been uploaded are for the SE7681 model. As well, there is an image in the product description which refers to the \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot;. The head shown is the Precision Head, which does not come with this model. It comes with the SE7681 model.</li>
            <li> my previous epilator was the 5681 model by Braun. It worked pretty well but was rather painful. I saw this model and decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;Its smooth - the addition of tweezers make the epilation process less painful. It does included a number of heads for different body parts. I also love the fact that you can charge up the piece and the charge keeps for a fair long time [avg - 40 mins].</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  I have to change my rating because this thing is just ridiculously painful.  I use it only on the shaver setting.  Tried it a couple more times as an epilator and it&#x27;s just not worth the pain, especially since it takes many passes to get all the hair.  I also continued to get all sorts of ingrown hairs with it.  I went through a year&#x27;s worth of laser treatments (COMPLETELY PAINLESS, BTW) in my bikini area and I would recommend anyone try that rather than this.  Unfortunately, I still have hair, since that won&#x27;t get rid of everything either (blonde &amp; fine hair is difficult to target).  I bought a home laser removal system (HPL) but haven&#x27;t kept at it consistently so I can&#x27;t tell you if it works or not, but I plan to give it a go.  $500 for the machine whereas my office treatments cost almost $1000, and I can use this machine on any areas I want.  Check it out, and good luck!&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;4 stars instead of 5 because of the pain.  Yes, it hurts.  It hurts a lot.  And it takes a little time to get the hang of it, and it takes a lot of guts to keep going, but once you decide to do so, the results are great.  I just finished using my epilator for the first time tonight (full bikini area).  I used it until it needed to be recharged, so I was at it quite awhile.  It does take several passes to get all of the hairs, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be more efficient at it with time.  I tried different caps and found the normal massaging head was the best.  The beginner cap was OK, but removes so little hair at one time, it&#x27;s sort of like prolonging the torture.  I did switch to the beginner cap for awhile in the middle, though, when I needed a bit of a break!  Near the end, I was much more confident and had conquered the pain.  Part of that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s less painful the less hair you have.  I will definitely not let all my hair grow out again!  I had shaved about a week ago -- which is just as time-consuming, leads to prickly stubble, and is a lot more dangerous in such a delicate area! -- so the hair was all about the recommended length of 2-3 mm.  Luckily hair grows at different rates and I should be able to remove it in stages from now on, as it starts to grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the area is now smooth as silk, but it was a lot of work.  You have to be tough to get through this!  Unlike a salon wax, you aren&#x27;t going to get all the hair yanked out in a few quick motions.  It takes awhile.  But you also won&#x27;t have to allow the hair to grow out as much as you do in between waxes, and you won&#x27;t have to pay $48 for the service.  I also feel like I am more thorough.  I had my first bikini wax at a salon recently and loved the immediate result, but it didn&#x27;t last as my skin almost immediately became irritated and I was plagued with constant ingrown hairs as it grew back.  I am hoping to have better luck with the epilator and so far it feels better.  I also ordered Princereigns gel to counteract ingrown hairs, but I haven&#x27;t received it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note:  the first area I tried to epilate was my underarm.  I don&#x27;t know why, but the pain was excruciating and I couldn&#x27;t take it.  I gave up and moved on to the bikini area of all places.  Of course I was much more determined to complete the bikini area since it&#x27;s the reason I bought this product, and I don&#x27;t mind shaving my underarms every day.a! -- so the hair was all about the recommended length of 2-3 mm.

            <li> This product is great. It hurts a bit but the pain will decrease the more you use it. But overall, the product is good and very useful.</li>
            <li> This epilator is WONDERFUL!  I upgraded from a panasonic model, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  My old epilator missed lots of hairs and also ran on batteries.  The Braun rarely misses a hair, and the built in light allows you to catch those few easily.  The rechargeable battery is phenomenal!  It holds a charge for a very good amount of time and recharges rapidly.  So much more economical than burning through batteries left and right.  The trimming/shaving head also does a good job and switching between the two heads is effortless.  The massaging epilating head makes the pain just melt away.  My legs truly have never felt or looked better.  I was nervous about the investment as I was unable to see this model in person, but I can definitely say it was worth every penny, and with the current prices on razorblades, I will recoup my money in no time.</li>
            <li> I got this machine at bed bath and beyond over 3 years ago I now use it once a month on my legs upper legs and lower. It was painful but no longer. It still works great has not broke down and I have no ingrown hairs. If get up the nerve to do my bikini line I will b happy. The only negative my legs get lobster red from using this the day of and the following day so two days out of a month I can&#x27;t wear shorts or a skirt. I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
            <li> I am brand new to epilating and didn&#x27;t know if this was for me.  Hope this can help you if you find yourself in my situation.  I hate shaving and have dark hair and fair and SENSITIVE skin.    Definitely tolerable and so worth the results.  I have never waxed my legs or bikini line, butdo wax my underarms.  I epilated my underarms first because I heard it was easier if you were accustomed to waxing.  It works very well for the underarms.  I had very little discomfort.  Worst part was that I didn&#x27;t have my technique down and got a little skin irritation from pushing down too hard on the first swipe.  You need a very light touch to get a good contact.  That irritation last less than 12 hours and was relieved by Gold Bond Medicated Powder.    For my legs, I epilated with the hairs about 2mm in length.  I did not do anything fancy to numb my legs first. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the special Olay wipes, they have nothing in them to numb your leg, just to clean it.  (It&#x27;s the same stuff they put in waxing kits to prep the hairs).  The legs were more uncomfortable than my underarms, but definitely tolerable and did both legs with no problems.  I would recommend starting somewhere that is a less sensitive area to get a feel for how it will go.  I started just to the side of my shin, a couple of inches below the knee.  I would not recommend starting at your ankles, like when you shave.  I kept a towel in one hand to wipe off the pulled hairs and to help pull skin tight while epilating.  I, too, got little red bumps at every hair follicle site.  I did not treat them with any powders, lotion, or cream.  They went away overnight, so I would give yourself a day or two if you are planning on nice legs for an event.  I can&#x27;t speak yet for what it will do in the bikini area.  If you find yourself needing a numbing lotion/cooling cream to help with sensitivity, you can usually find some to purchase at a local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with the Braun Epilator. It is not pulling all of my leg hairs out at the root so three days after I use it, hair is already growing back.  When I get waxed it takes at least a week and a half to start growing back. I feel like it is just cutting the hair off instead of pulling it.  I&#x27;m disappointed because I thought I could save some money, do it myself, but I think I&#x27;m headed back to the salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last month and I am happy with it. I got rid of shaving. It is even not painful for me. With it I epilate my leg and hand once in 10 days. The only issue is that it may cause ingrown hair. And sometimes very tiny hair will be remained which may be removed by essential head. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the best product ever, totally worth the money. recommend to all my gfs . easy to use, recharge fast and smooth .</li>
            <li> I just fried my Braun 2370 epilator after about 5 yrs, not having appreciated that my overseas converter didn&#x27;t have a transformer also. I was content with it, but it was night compared to the day of this new model. My legs are SO much smoother, and for longer. I really appreciate the narrowed field for underarm and bikini--now that I&#x27;m almost 40, my skin isn&#x27;t as taut or tough and that was worrying me some re: epilating there. It did pinch a bit, but with practice, it should be ok. The light is very useful, and love that it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and value for money. Very easy to use and maintain. I recommend this over shaving as you have to use it only once in 3 weeks and it leaves the skin smooth with NO bumps.</li>
            <li> The epilator works ok and hair on my legs grew back slower and softer than that of a razor, but using it on my face was really tough.  I have more sensitive skin and the redness lasted two days. I bought it primarily for my face, but will resort to electrolysis which is more permanent.</li>
            <li> I used a lot of epilators till now and all of them were Panasonic, this time I decided to try braun. I am so happy I did. It&#x27;s fast and works very well, charging process takes around 40-45 min. but the best thing is that you can still use it during the charge. Yes it hurts, but you have smooth skin for over a week. It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but buy it without thinking this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> I have an earlier version of Braun&#x27;s Silk - Epil which although took some time to get used to, did an excellent job in getting a clean shave that last for weeks.  My puppy chewed up a piece of one of the attachments and since I had it for a few years, I decided to purchase a newer model. I&#x27;m glad I did!  this newer model is quicker and the rotating massaging head does make it less painful on the skin.    So far I have only used it on my underarms, but I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is very smooth on your skin, and have several accessories to adapt to different parts of your body.  The only reason why I gave this product 4 starts versus 5 is because the facial head is not included.  I have been using Braun Silk-Epil for over 10 years, and this model is by far the best!</li>
            <li> I am happier with a standard razor or any other electric razor because the eplilator style is not acceptable in removing hair..</li>
            <li> I was so scared I will end up not using it and now I can&#x27;t live without it ! I honestly think it doesn&#x27;t hur so bad with massaging roller.It is easy to clean and looks so cute with the gillter on it :) LOve it !</li>
            <li> I have never used anything like this before.  I am fair skin and would have to shave everyday not to see the dark stubble, so I was looking for something to solve my problems, This IS IT!!!  I felt slight pain when doing my legs but nothing unbearable, more like it was uncomfortable. Now, I did have irration (red spots at the site of the hairs), but it was all gone after 3-4 hours. I also used it on my bikini line and it&#x27;s wonderful(great for summer).  So far I have had it for 2 weeks and have yet to epilate for the second time. I tried to use it on my underarms, that I couldn&#x27;t do, too much pain.  I choose this model for the quick rechargable feature as I am a working mom and not extra time on my hands.  It&#x27;s worth the money not to shave everyday!</li>
            <li> I felt the advertising was misleading for this item. I ordered the 7781, thinking it came with the facial epilator, from the pictures of the product and the product description. Wrong, it came without that item. I returned it, and bought the 7681 from another company; and am delighted with it. I think the basic Epilator is the same, and it works very well. I also have fair, sensitive skin. Get red, bumps @ ankles and lower calves. My hair is pretty fine, and I have a lot of it, blonde peach fuzz and dark hairs. And yes, the facial epilator works very well, although, that is the most sensitive area I&#x27;ve done yet. I have however, had some laser hair removal and a couple of tattoos...so this is nothing, compared to those painful processes!</li>
            <li> I read reviews religiously before any long-term purchase and this was what I decided to go with after a few nights of research.    Hair type: I&#x27;m Taiwanese, light-skinned with thick, black (of course) hair. Shaving typically takes a good half hour in the shower for me. If I attempt to shave more frequently than once every 3 days, my skin gets irritated, itchy, and red.    First use: Took a shower, shaved everything as usual except one leg. About half an hour after my shower, I wiped my &#x27;experimental&#x27; leg with the Pre-Epilation Wipes and read the instructions while waiting for it to fully dry. I started near my ankle on the outer side of my leg...ouch! With every hair that&#x27;s pulled out, it feels like a tiny electric shock. It really wasn&#x27;t any more pleasant or painful than I had imagined. Took me about 20 minutes to do an entire lower leg. If you can make it through the first pass, I would think that maintenance going forward is much easier.    Day1 result: Comparing the shaved lower leg and the epilated lower leg, the shaved leg is definitely smoother. I tried to re-epilate areas where I could feel a baby hair or two but they still didn&#x27;t get picked up.    Day3 result: Shaved leg is finally starting to feel just barely stubbly, while epilated leg still feels 97% smooth like day1. Yes!    Day4: Took the epilator to both legs and it clearly found more hairs on the originally shaved leg. On the leg I epilated 3 days ago, it was almost completely pain free, like running a regular electric shaver down my leg...with minimal pain when occasional teeny hairs get pulled out.    Though I won&#x27;t be venturing to bikini or armpits anytime soon, this is definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> I suggest to spend few more dollars and buy this product than a Remington!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for several years and I must stay that this one is certainly the best I have ever had. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to wash and what could seem like a gadget the little light on it really allows you to see every single hairs you are trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Needed to replace an oldy but goody with a newer model. This is exactly what I needed! After shopping price found the best one right here on Amazon! Thanks!</li>
            <li> The battery is getting weak, but it&#x27;s been a few years since I bought it...</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was as described. The one complaint I have is I still feel it sometimes \\&quot;breaks\\&quot; hair instead of pulling it, and there is definitely more ingrown hair than with waxing, but this is expected for these things in general. Overall, it is worlds better than a Remington I owned which was really bad with \\&quot;breaking\\&quot; and caused more ingrown hair, among other complaints. I don&#x27;t use the shaving head, so going back in time I probably should have saved that money and invested it in a better quality epilator, but it is hard to know until you try these things which one is better quality.</li>
            <li> I have had it for years adn it is WONDERFUL. so easy to use, love the light feature and that you can use it cordless. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This product did remove hair like described, but it was a very slow and painful process.  When I finished I was left with welts that took 2 weeks to go away.  The hair started to grow back in 2 weeks and I had a lot of ingrown hairs.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> This is great. When you are so busy, you can&#x27;t go to a salon for waxing or you want to save money instead of going to the salon. It removes the hair from the root. It&#x27;s takes some time to get used to it, it&#x27;s best to use when the hair growth is tiny. The hair growth is normal.</li>
            <li> The product is great and in good condition. I&#x27;m charging it now actually while writing this review. I tried the epilator on my UA without applying heavy pressure, and it does indeed pull out the hairs right from the roots. This is my first ever epilator, I&#x27;m so happy on choosing Braun as they are long-time proven and tested on epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Although I&#x27;m not too affected by the cons, the wipes that came with it are already expired.. dated 3/11. I dont mind it though as I have my own wipes already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Braun for a wonderful product :)</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife, had same brand in the past, very happy with it, so far problem free, truly German engineering and made, she thinks to keep it as long as it is working or a new technology comes up, even the old Braun, she gave it away in a perfect condition, used it for over 10 years, hoping this one to last 20! removes the hair from the root and helps to reduce hair density, now she is using it only once a month!</li>
