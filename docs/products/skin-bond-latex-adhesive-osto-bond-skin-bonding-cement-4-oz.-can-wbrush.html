            <li>I use this to help with the posting of my dogs ears and it works great.</li>
            <li>It does about as good of a job as liquid skin.</li>
            <li>I had a helper but unless you have a pro on hand, good luck with that.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a good amount in the bottle at a good price.</li>
            <li>it is not any good does not  stick</li>
            <li>works good for taping dogs ears</li>
            <li>Great product for this use :)</li>
            <li>Great prodiuct, easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a great product!!</li>
            <li>Very a good product a quality exceptional has to recommend has all the easy world of employment and very correct use and a good redu on the skin</li>
            <li>this works best for me in the summer months when you sweat the most THANKS</li>
            <li>The product you bought OSTO-BOND is good, but I think the SKIN-BOND was better, was more adherent, I felt more secure.</li>
            <li>it keeps the brace on there ears, with out the discomfort of the bandages that most vets use after the surgery..</li>
            <li>Not recommending Hoyt as a breeder, but his braces sure work well.</li>
            <li>so glad i found this deal</li>
            <li>I needed it to be more tacky.</li>
            <li>I do know when getting it on my fingers, I can just rub my fingers together, it balls up and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>up going top revival animal health and buying the true product</li>
            <li>First try held for 9 days!!</li>
            <li>I bought this to attach breast forms which it seemed to do a pretty good job considering the large size of them.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I know.. not the original intent for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works super well with pipe insulation foam.  </li>
            <li>I use this product for the quick brace system, this is for any dog that has there ears cropped..</li>
            <li>It bonds quick and then wears off accordingly within about 7 days.</li>
            <li>Super for what we needed.</li>
            <li>I would guess that this glue is also great for human skin, since that is its main purpose.</li>
            <li>The product is definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li>Most web sites recommend a product called skin bond but Osto-bond seems to be the only material available for this purpose.</li>
            <li>This was recommended on various sites as a great adhesive, when combined with other aids, to be able to help a dog&#x27;s ears stand erect.</li>
            <li>Even better, dogs don&#x27;t seem to mind this nearly so much as other more intrusive methods like taping.  </li>
            <li>but its the only thing ive found that doesnt hurt my dogs ears its very easy to come off and actuay works...</li>
            <li>I used the wooden correctors as well as the foam correctors MANY times.</li>
            <li>Clean up is easy with some alcohol, and if you wish to clean your costume pieces in order to reuse them later, it comes off them fairly easy with a little bit of rubbing (with alcohol).</li>
            <li>What glue that was left worked fine.</li>
            <li>This product really helped with my dogs ear brace.</li>
            <li>Really fast shopping though.</li>
            <li>It does not leave marks, pull hair as many other methods do.</li>
            <li>I ordered it from the Amazon Prime option, which is apparently no longer available.  </li>
            <li>We do a very long ear on the show dogs so need a strong but flexible glue.</li>
            <li>It works great with no skin irritation, and comes loose by itself after a few days.  </li>
            <li>If you combine it with something along the lines of skin tac (a skin adhesive enhancer) it works a little better.  </li>
            <li>A bit more runny and messy to apply than thought.  </li>
            <li>Removes completely with Unisolve.</li>
            <li>By far the easiest method i have used.</li>
            <li>First of all, it takes 4 to 6 minutes (4 is a crock) to adhere-try and get a young  dog to be quiet that long.</li>
            <li>It holds up as well as liquid skin does (which can be bought at walmart @ $5, dollar tree @ $1, dollar general @</li>
            <li>This product is apparently a counterfeit -</li>
            <li>i reapply every few days but its def worth the ease...especially for my dobbie</li>
            <li>It is a pity there was no representative of this product in Brazil, because it is very large number of users of the same, is there no similar here in Brazil.    </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t able to wear for too long because of allergic reaction so not sure how long it lasts.</li>

            <li> Mine was not their first complaint.</li>
            <li> OIt does tend to dry up and get gummy if you let it sit too long.</li>
            <li> For my dobie, I am reapplying it every other day fully and on smaller areas every day.</li>
            <li> It has even been withstanding his playful activity with the other German Shepherd  </li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t hold up as well as I expected and it took too long to set.  </li>
            <li> it is too loose</li>
            <li> the veteran had charged me 40$ for half a can.</li>
            <li> It is latex based and as long as you follow the directions will hold ears, scars, and other lightweight items indefinitely.  </li>
            <li> If it get wet, it wears off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The lot number that should have been on the bottom of the jar was missing - confirming that it wasn&#x27;t made by the actual manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It holds the post in place but is not too rough on the dogs skin and hair</li>
            <li> and I  have stired and shook it  much too thin</li>
            <li> was using on my dog, so runny application made it harder to use.</li>
            <li> The cans were so damaged that the adhesive had leaked all over the envelope and each other.  </li>
            <li> I am using it along  with breathe strips glued to my German Shepherd puppy&#x27;s lazy ear.  </li>
            <li> ,I have  bought this product before and this is not right</li>
            <li> If you are using heavier latex items on skin that moves a lot, the adhesive will start to pull away after several hours, but will hold for at least 6 hours.  </li>
            <li> I got this to help my husband&#x27;s packer for ftm to adhesive to him and we&#x27;ll this product sucks and does not work</li>
            <li> The 3cans I ordered were all shoved into a very small padded envelope.  </li>
            <li> The skin bond holds the strip and it is non irritating to the puppy&#x27;s ear.  </li>
            <li> However, toward the bottom of the can the glue gets to thick to where it is very difficult to use</li>
            <li> i was watered down crap</li>
            <li> The product is useless.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this all the time to post my boxers ears after cropping</li>
            <li> Ladies And Gentlemen    I would like to report that the attendance and punctuality of the Amazon is excellent.    The product you bought OSTO-BOND is good, but I think the SKIN-BOND was better, was more adherent, I felt more secure. It is a pity there was no representative of this product in Brazil, because it is very large number of users of the same, is there no similar here in Brazil.    Best regards    Lourivaldo Ribeiro</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for attaching Halloween costume pieces to your body.  It is latex based and as long as you follow the directions will hold ears, scars, and other lightweight items indefinitely.  If you are using heavier latex items on skin that moves a lot, the adhesive will start to pull away after several hours, but will hold for at least 6 hours.  If you combine it with something along the lines of skin tac (a skin adhesive enhancer) it works a little better.  Clean up is easy with some alcohol, and if you wish to clean your costume pieces in order to reuse them later, it comes off them fairly easy with a little bit of rubbing (with alcohol).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using an Insulin Pump... Being that for some reason my skin does not let adhesive or a band-aid stick to me, I needed to buy a product that would allow the tape to stick to me, so that the tubing canula stayed in.. This works and I&#x27;m very happy with this...</li>
            <li> It does about as good of a job as liquid skin. If it get wet, it wears off.&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy this for human use. Quality on humans, I can not say how it does. I do know when getting it on my fingers, I can just rub my fingers together, it balls up and comes off easily. Again, my intentions were not for the use of humans.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item to help prop my dobie&#x27;s ears up. It does not leave marks, pull hair as many other methods do. It is easy to use. However it if get wets, it will not hold. For my dobie, I am reapplying it every other day fully and on smaller areas every day. It holds up as well as liquid skin does (which can be bought at walmart @ $5, dollar tree @ $1, dollar general @ $2.50).&lt;br /&gt;If you are planning on using this for propping up a dog&#x27;s ears, I would recommend buying the surgical glue that vet&#x27;s use. It does hold up longer.&lt;br /&gt;Again, I can not say how it works on humans.</li>
            <li> I got this to help my husband&#x27;s packer for ftm to adhesive to him and we&#x27;ll this product sucks and does not work, I am not at all happy with this product</li>
            <li> This was recommended on various sites as a great adhesive, when combined with other aids, to be able to help a dog&#x27;s ears stand erect. What a crock. I used the wooden correctors as well as the foam correctors MANY times. First of all, it takes 4 to 6 minutes (4 is a crock) to adhere-try and get a young  dog to be quiet that long. I had a helper but unless you have a pro on hand, good luck with that. Even when when I got the ear utensil in, and I used 3 different kinds, it was out by the morning. I will never use this stuff again for anything! I&#x27;m going to the vet for the second time tomorrow. SHE will get the job done with another product.</li>
            <li> This product really helped with my dogs ear brace. It also comes with a good amount in the bottle at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is the best adhesive I have ever found!  First try held for 9 days!! Others lasted 4-5 days at best.  Thanks for making a great product!!</li>
            <li> Works great. Use it for posting Dobermans ears. No irritation and holds well. Removes with Unisolve.</li>
            <li> The product is useless.  It does not bond. Too costly to return as postage is too costly. so disposed of it in the rubbish. Very disappointed with product.</li>
            <li> this skin bond works the best for&lt;br /&gt;show Dog ear crops. It stays put when they run around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the glue of choice for dosing Dog&#x27;s ears. We do a very long ear on the show dogs so need a strong but flexible glue.</li>
            <li> Works great! Removes completely with Unisolve.</li>
            <li> This is great glue.  However, toward the bottom of the can the glue gets to thick to where it is very difficult to use so you loose&lt;br /&gt;about 1/4 of a can</li>
            <li> Yes, I know.. not the original intent for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after looking for months for something that would work well enough to keep my dog&#x27;s ears up and hating the residue/pulled out hair that came from tape, I came across a recommendation for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works super well with pipe insulation foam.  Stays in her ear for a week plus.  Great product for this use :)</li>
            <li> I use this product for the quick brace system, this is for any dog that has there ears cropped.. it keeps the brace on there ears, with out the discomfort of the bandages that most vets use after the surgery.. and you cant beat the price on amazon..&lt;br /&gt;by the way I have Doberman pinschers</li>
            <li> Bought this product and some Hoyt braces to post my dobies ears. By far the easiest method i have used. Not recommending Hoyt as a breeder, but his braces sure work well.</li>
            <li> i use it for maintenance on my dobbies ear cropping and it works!!! the veteran had charged me 40$ for half a can. so glad i found this deal</li>
            <li> The 3cans I ordered were all shoved into a very small padded envelope.  The cans were so damaged that the adhesive had leaked all over the envelope and each other.  What glue that was left worked fine.</li>
            <li> Works great to stand my dobermans ears up...says water resistant yet after contact with water it comes off after a couple minutes...but its the only thing ive found that doesnt hurt my dogs ears its very easy to come off and actuay works...i reapply every few days but its def worth the ease...especially for my dobbie</li>
            <li> I bought this to attach breast forms which it seemed to do a pretty good job considering the large size of them.  Wasn&#x27;t able to wear for too long because of allergic reaction so not sure how long it lasts. Really fast shopping though.</li>
            <li> I threw this out before even opening it as it can be toxic. I wanted to use it on my dogs ears but will not. Should be warned that it can be toxic.</li>
            <li> This product is apparently a counterfeit - I ordered it from the Amazon Prime option, which is apparently no longer available.  The color and consistency were very different from the product I&#x27;ve used for years. I called the company that makes it. Mine was not their first complaint. The lot number that should have been on the bottom of the jar was missing - confirming that it wasn&#x27;t made by the actual manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This product worked perfectly. We used it with mole foam. It bonds quick and then wears off accordingly within about 7 days. Super for what we needed.</li>
            <li> i was watered down crap&lt;br /&gt;wasnt even the white color it was suppose to be&lt;br /&gt;ended up going top revival animal health and buying the true product</li>
            <li> Used to prop up dog&#x27;s ears.  Did not adhere well.</li>
            <li> The only thing that helped me post my doberman&#x27;s ears and keep them posted.</li>
            <li> Skin bond is great !  I am using it along  with breathe strips glued to my German Shepherd puppy&#x27;s lazy ear.  The skin bond holds the strip and it is non irritating to the puppy&#x27;s ear.  It has even been withstanding his playful activity with the other German Shepherd  The product is definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li> My doberman breeder/vet showed me how to post my dober&#x27;s ears and use this stuff to keep the posts in place. It works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this glue to apply breath-rite strips to the inside of the ears on my German Shepherd puppy to help train them to stand up.  It works great with no skin irritation, and comes loose by itself after a few days.  Even better, dogs don&#x27;t seem to mind this nearly so much as other more intrusive methods like taping.  I would guess that this glue is also great for human skin, since that is its main purpose.</li>
            <li> I use this to help with the posting of my dogs ears and it works great. It holds the post in place but is not too rough on the dogs skin and hair</li>
            <li> it is not any good does not  stick it is too loose and I  have stired and shook it  much too thin ,I have  bought this product before and this is not right</li>
            <li> Very a good product a quality exceptional has to recommend has all the easy world of employment and very correct use and a good redu on the skin</li>
            <li> Great prodiuct, easy to apply and remove. OIt does tend to dry up and get gummy if you let it sit too long.</li>
            <li> Too sticky and did not work out for me. I would not order again.</li>
            <li> works good for taping dogs ears</li>
            <li> I bought this glue to apply moleskin padding on the inside of the ears on my German Shepherd to help her ears stand up. There wasn&#x27;t any skin irritation. It stayed glued for about 5-7 days. It didn&#x27;t bother my dog either like the taping did.</li>
            <li> Was using the product to bond a shaped foam material (pipe insulation) into my German Shepherd&#x27;s ears in order to correct floppy ear.  Most web sites recommend a product called skin bond but Osto-bond seems to be the only material available for this purpose.</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t hold up as well as I expected and it took too long to set.  I needed it to be more tacky.</li>
            <li> this works best for me in the summer months when you sweat the most THANKS</li>
            <li> Works.great for.my puppy ears</li>
            <li> A bit more runny and messy to apply than thought.  but worked well. was using on my dog, so runny application made it harder to use.</li>
