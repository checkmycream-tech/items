            <li>I responded to Connie&#x27;s review but decided to do my own.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use a good, daytime sun screen when using any glycolic products.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found this product on line as I won&#x27;t have to make monthly visits to the post office to mail out to friends who now are hooked on this product.  </li>
            <li>so far) that have experienced their own stunning results.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a year and love my results.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s to better skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 3 month and my skin looks and feels so much better.  </li>
            <li>Stings face more than it should.</li>
            <li>Although if the products produced amazing results it would have been worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This product is a wonderful and all natural lotion containing 10% alpha hydroxy acid and is extremely effective for a vast majority of the population.</li>
            <li>I am just waiting to see if it will fade the fine lines</li>
            <li>My breakouts went away, my skin appeared firmer and my fine lines literally disappeared.  </li>
            <li>This face cream is simply amazing, i can not go with out it, i just love how it is 100% natural and affordable.</li>
            <li>She Looks great and younger than ever.</li>
            <li>Simply stated, this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>It is not greaasy and works great for dry  skin.</li>
            <li>Way too strong for my older skin.  </li>
            <li>My husband, who rarely notices a thing, even commented</li>
            <li>I originally found this product in a natural food store and thought for the price it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Your skin tingles at first application..</li>
            <li>I started to see results in the first week.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and coloring more even.  </li>
            <li>I will consistently buy this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok only.  </li>
            <li>At first, the glycolic acid pulls up black-heads</li>
            <li>I am now using it every other night and have seen a nice change in my skin texture and pore size.  </li>
            <li>My skin is glowing in the AM, and super soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my Daughter to try, who is very particular about what creams she puts on her face.</li>
            <li>Anti-wrinkle, skin repair, intense hydration, dramatically reduce large pores      </li>
            <li>This is great at taking off dead skin cells but it&#x27;s not such a large percentage of Glycolic Acid that it leaves the skin agitated.</li>
            <li>It has a pH of 3.5 and is therefore very therapeutic.</li>
            <li>but if you continue to use it every night and lightly exfoliate your skin regularly, you&#x27;ll notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Long term repeated use of Alpha Hydroxy acid has been clinically proven to reduce signs of aging, fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>As a 44 year old female with sun damage from my youth, I now have smooth, moisturized skin with an even tone as a result.</li>
            <li>It minimized my pores and gave me a more brighter appearance, it somehow sheds off layers of dead skin.</li>
            <li>I am a professional in the medical field, and prefer to use more natural personal products.</li>
            <li>I live part time in Reno &amp; purchased this for myself &amp; a friend in another state.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I do believe it helps to keep my skin clear, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>Try it for a week and you will notice the difference in your skin (soft).  </li>
            <li>I decided to try Alpha-Maximum since it is cheaper, also all natural, and comes in the 10% strength.</li>
            <li>I am so surprised there is not a product like this in the retail stores.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B003VKPZEM Alpha-Maximum, 100% Natural, Maximum Strength Glycolic (10% Glycolic Acid)</li>
            <li>It works and is all natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35 yrs old and just started noticing sunspots and a coarseness to my skin.</li>
            <li>I also had multiple brown skin tags on my neck and they are completely gone!  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use a lot, I put a thin  layer on my face,bottom of my feet &amp; top of hands before I go to Bed.  </li>
            <li>If I apply it immediately after I wash my face, I feel a little mild very short lasting sting.  </li>
            <li>For me, Alpha-Maximum provides a gentle, non abrasive, constant exfoliation which prepares your skin for other treatments such as serums you may use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen no difference, good or bad, since switching brands.</li>

            <li> My skins is so soft the dead skins</li>
            <li> In the last 2 years, due to the decline in the economy, I had to make lots of changes in my spending habits.  </li>
            <li> its no different then every other cream I had.</li>
            <li> I have had dry skin for years as well as blotchy redness.</li>
            <li> The quality and results of this product are hands down second to none.</li>
            <li> Be advised you will experience a slight burning sensation which lasts for a short time.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again to my friend that shared her secret</li>
            <li> The natural product base feels refreshing and the tingling diminishes after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Two of the major changes I made was cutting down on Spa visits (2 times a year if I am lucky) and buying just a few spa products.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel your brown spots get a little rough, but there&#x27;s no peeling or flaking at all.</li>
            <li> It does sting a little, but not untollerable.</li>
            <li> In fact I have a friend in Mexico that tells me she thinks of me each morning as she feels that little sting (another bonus from Alpha-Maximum).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a professional in the medical field, and prefer to use more natural personal products. So, I thought I would give this a try..I have been using it for about a week, and I have to say I love it! My skin is glowing in the AM, and super soft to the touch. I am just waiting to see if it will fade the fine lines..will update in a few weeks..</li>
            <li> read about the housewife who invented this product in the Reno, nevada paper as that is where she lives...so had to try it and it is wonderful and such a great price. Your skin tingles at first application..but boy does it hydrate and i have noticed a differance..buy it you will love it!!!</li>
            <li> I did notice my skin looking well hydrated after the initial couple weeks of stinging and peeling. HOWEVER - I immediately began having a series of cold sores on my lips - as one finished, another would begin. After several sores, I narrowed it down to the alpha hydrox, which I read can cause cold sores in those who have a tendency to get them. Didn&#x27;t matter that I tried not to use it around my mouth, it just gets in the system and stimulates the virus.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for over a year and it is wonderful. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot, I put a thin  layer on my face,bottom of my feet &amp; top of hands before I go to Bed.  It is not greaasy and works great for dry  skin. Try it for a week and you will notice the difference in your skin (soft).  I gave it to my Daughter to try, who is very particular about what creams she puts on her face. We have fair  skin so she felt the tingle sensation but noticed a diffenence in her skin within a week. She told me she wished  she would have had this cream 25 years ago. She has had trouble with her skin all her life and this cream  (alpha-Maximum) has made a world of diffenence. She Looks great and younger than ever. Thank again Alpha-Maximum</li>
            <li> I have been using Reviva brand glycolic cream for several years now. I do believe it helps to keep my skin clear, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker. I&#x27;ve always had awful skin texture, and I still do, but my beauty regime, which includes a glycolic cream, has significantly cleared up my skin, including acne, red marks and scars.   I decided to try Alpha-Maximum since it is cheaper, also all natural, and comes in the 10% strength. I have been unable to get the Reviva 10% shipped to my current APO address. I used to just pick it up at my local health food store.   Alpha-Maximum smells the same and feels the same. I&#x27;ve seen no difference, good or bad, since switching brands.</li>
            <li> This face cream is simply amazing, i can not go with out it, i just love how it is 100% natural and affordable. I noticed a difference in just 3 days after use. It minimized my pores and gave me a more brighter appearance, it somehow sheds off layers of dead skin. Love it..</li>
            <li> Way too strong for my older skin.  After a couple of uses, my skin started to itch.  I stopped using this product and my skin cleared up. I would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Simply stated, this product is amazing! I refuse to think back at all the money I have spent buying expensive products from upscale salons.   Although if the products produced amazing results it would have been worth the money.  In the last 2 years, due to the decline in the economy, I had to make lots of changes in my spending habits.  Two of the major changes I made was cutting down on Spa visits (2 times a year if I am lucky) and buying just a few spa products.  I originally found this product in a natural food store and thought for the price it was worth a try.  WOW!  After the 3rd day, I noticed immediate results.  My breakouts went away, my skin appeared firmer and my fine lines literally disappeared.  My husband, who rarely notices a thing, even commented thinking I had been to the Spa.  I have since shared my story with friends and family.  We are all believers in this product.  I am so glad to have found this product on line as I won&#x27;t have to make monthly visits to the post office to mail out to friends who now are hooked on this product.  They are hooked because of the immediate results and the price. I am also impressed the age group (15-81...so far) that have experienced their own stunning results. Results such as age spots reduced/removed and I have heard numerous comments that they are getting noticed by their friends and families. I am so surprised there is not a product like this in the retail stores.  I also read that one reviewer said she was not happy with this product and did not experience any tingle or results (shocking).  That is very surprising to me.  I tell all those who I suggest buy the product that they WILL experience their skin tingling but that is because this product is at maximum strength which will give immediate results.  All of my friends have said it is a small price to pay given their results.  This product is truly a miracle product!</li>
            <li> I responded to Connie&#x27;s review but decided to do my own.  I live part time in Reno &amp; purchased this for myself &amp; a friend in another state.  I use this as directed and have had amazing results.  I DON&#x27;T know the woman who created this (as suggested by CA DR who also commented on Connie&#x27;s review).  My sun/age spots disappeared when used it on my hands, my skin is firmer on my face and neck.  I also had multiple brown skin tags on my neck and they are completely gone!  My friend has deeply pitted skin from old acne problems and her face is looking softer and less pitted as she uses this cream.  I&#x27;m really happy to find this on Amazon, and my review is NOT biased because I&#x27;m a friend of the creator of this product.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! I have had dry skin for years as well as blotchy redness. I have been using this product for over a year and love my results. As a 44 year old female with sun damage from my youth, I now have smooth, moisturized skin with an even tone as a result. The natural product base feels refreshing and the tingling diminishes after a few minutes. Because I love everything about this product, I buy one for all my girlfriends and family every year! Now we all get compliments on our beautiful skin...[[ASIN:B003VKPZEM Alpha-Maximum, 100% Natural, Maximum Strength Glycolic (10% Glycolic Acid) AHA Moisturizer - 2oz.]]</li>
            <li> I have used Alpha Hydroxy face cream products for years. This is the best! The quality and results of this product are hands down second to none. I am so grateful to have found this massive value!</li>
            <li> Just like everyone else, I saw the story, bought the cream and guess what?.....its no different then every other cream I had. Wish I had my $20 back</li>
            <li> My friend referred this product to me and I LOVE IT !!. I am in the sun daily and I&#x27;m going through menopause. The brown spots/pigmentation and enlarged pores were out of control,causing acne and blackheads. I started to see results in the first week. It&#x27;s been almost a month The blackheads are gone and I haven&#x27;t seen one pimple. The brown spots have lightened by 80%, I&#x27;m so used to using concealer on them, but no longer need to. It does sting a little, but not untollerable. You&#x27;ll feel your brown spots get a little rough, but there&#x27;s no peeling or flaking at all. My skins is so soft the dead skins just washes away when you cleanse your face.      If any review says this product doesn&#x27;t work, they&#x27;re not using it correctly.    I&#x27;m using it on my chest and arms and the results are the same. Two girls I work with even noticed the difference in my chest alone, they&#x27;ve ordered the product.     I would recommend this product to anyone, try it, use it correctly you&#x27;ll see results. And for $ 20.00 you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> A friend had told me about Alpha-Maximum.  Containing 10% glycolic acid which is the maximum amount for use at home, I have found it very effective.  Be advised you will experience a slight burning sensation which lasts for a short time.  I am now using it every other night and have seen a nice change in my skin texture and pore size.  For me, Alpha-Maximum provides a gentle, non abrasive, constant exfoliation which prepares your skin for other treatments such as serums you may use.  Be sure to use a good, daytime sun screen when using any glycolic products.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that a friend shared her secret!  I have been using Alpha-Maximum for a couple of years now and share it with my friends and family all over the world.  In fact I have a friend in Mexico that tells me she thinks of me each morning as she feels that little sting (another bonus from Alpha-Maximum).  We all love it - the results, the price and the company&#x27;s great service. My skin is in great shape after years of dryness.  My pores are smaller and coloring more even.  Thanks again to my friend that shared her secret and I am doing my best to pay if forward to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> I will consistently buy this product. It works and is all natural. I really love it. Here&#x27;s to better skin.</li>
            <li> This product is a wonderful and all natural lotion containing 10% alpha hydroxy acid and is extremely effective for a vast majority of the population. It has a pH of 3.5 and is therefore very therapeutic. Those that complain they \\&quot;do not feel it working\\&quot; are showing their ignorance, since this is a subjective observation only and is not based on any scientific measurement of the actual effectiveness of the product. Long term repeated use of Alpha Hydroxy acid has been clinically proven to reduce signs of aging, fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok only.  If I apply it immediately after I wash my face, I feel a little mild very short lasting sting.  If I apply it 10 minutes after I wash my face, I feel no sting at all.  I see no difference in skin tone, pore size, etc:    Product Features        * Anti-wrinkle, skin repair, intense hydration, dramatically reduce large pores      * Diminish age/sun spots, diminish scars    I haven&#x27;t seen any of the changes the above description on the product page claims this cream can do for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 yrs old and just started noticing sunspots and a coarseness to my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 3 month and my skin looks and feels so much better.  At first, the glycolic acid pulls up black-heads you didn&#x27;t even know you had and it makes your skin a little oily but if you continue to use it every night and lightly exfoliate your skin regularly, you&#x27;ll notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Stings face more than it should. The sting last for about 10 to 30 minutes. It didnt do anything except irritate my face. It might have permanently damaged my skin too.</li>
            <li> This is great at taking off dead skin cells but it&#x27;s not such a large percentage of Glycolic Acid that it leaves the skin agitated.</li>
