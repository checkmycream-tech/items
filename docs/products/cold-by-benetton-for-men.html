            <li>It&#x27;s not to strong or over powering and has a very nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this smell.. :-)</li>
            <li>I will not recommend this cologne to anyone because it smells so good and fruity and fresh</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes of all time.    </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love it&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love it, will buy another one soon.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS ON MY HUSBAND</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposedly a \\&quot;unisex\\&quot; scent although it smells more like a men&#x27;s cologne to me.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the aroma it doesn&#x27;t fade away at all .</li>
            <li>I love this perfume &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>The cologne has a refreshing, laidback sort of smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34; or powerful, but it does smell good.</li>
            <li>I love colognes, I have a collection</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>, girs love it</li>
            <li>And super very cheap price!</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and it is original!</li>
            <li>this is far better than the price this could easily be a $65 value as it smells just as good as any designer fragrance out there !</li>
            <li>sure what to make of this scent, it has a great opening and is quite nice while it last, but re-applying every two hours does not seem to be practical at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Packaged nicely, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>&quot; is also great but is clearly feminine, I gave it to my sister and she loves</li>
            <li>This is such a great product my wife absolutely loves this and its a great deal</li>
            <li>What a great find, it&#x27;s been a while since I used this great and truly fab and hard to find cologne.</li>
            <li>Strong, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Is a good lotion as it lasts a long time and with a pleasant aroma and good price  in general the recommend</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s meant to turn at the handle to prevent accidental usage.</li>
            <li>its fresh nothing more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, I like the scent.</li>
            <li>It is very useful and practical.</li>
            <li>Although I bought this lotion from Amazon.com LLC, I&#x27;m pretty sure it is not the original product.</li>
            <li>u got the original u ll get a lot</li>
            <li>so, I want with an old favorite of mine!</li>
            <li>but then you are relieved as the fragrance becomes milder and milder, and as sweet as fruits</li>
            <li>Really neat, I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>FRESH AND COOL</li>
            <li>good all day long.</li>
            <li>welll the name say everything about this perfume, HOT!</li>
            <li>Thanks guys !!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just simple, very citrusy and light and doesn&#x27;t have any kind of stigma.</li>
            <li>Nice Fragrance i m using since last 10 years</li>
            <li>Now to the fun</li>
            <li>The price was worth it</li>
            <li>This scent is nice, it reminds me of Kenzo Power, and just like Power, the longevity of this is only about 30 mins to 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>say, do not waste you money here, just save up an get better quality stuff</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY AFFORDABLE AND UNIQUE FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li>the smell is just right for me...</li>
            <li>Bravo Benetton, you hid this one right on.....</li>
            <li>Love the scent, works great on me (each ph is different), and it&#x27;s a inexpensive perfume to use everyday.</li>
            <li>With that being said, however, I&#x27;ve actually received more compliments while wearing this than most of my other colognes which I think smell richer and better..</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Cold\\&quot; is actually one of my favorite scents right now.  </li>
            <li>ITS JUST RIGHT.I WILL BE ORDERING MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li>Such a fabulous sent!</li>
            <li>the smell of the fragrance is good, only for daily use.</li>
            <li>I usually wear it as a body splash after a shower, or if I&#x27;m going to the gym, or some place with friends where I just want to smell good.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the package, it scent smelled really strong but on a daily use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try this perfume, I really hope it&#x27;s just the way described in the positive comments I&#x27;ve heard of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Package came sooner than I thought and the packaging was fine, so was the product, Took a second for me to understand hwo to use it</li>
            <li>It is a good perfume for everyday use, gives a fresh, youthful but also goes well with contemporary adult,  and is a classic</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t scream \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; or \\&quot;business\\&quot; or anything really</li>
            <li>everyone loves the smell on me and wants to know what it is</li>
            <li>It has a youthful scent, and nothing that I have ever really smelled before in scents I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I received the package extremely fast</li>
            <li>Really upset at this.</li>
            <li>Smells somewhat like the real one, but it is not.</li>
            <li>i feel it is well suited for an older gentleman</li>
            <li>Not too bold but stays with you for the entire work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wearing it doesn&#x27;t say anything in particular.  </li>
            <li>Wear this on a causal date out with your lady on a decent, well lit day.</li>
            <li>Classic scent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I have in mind of a day that is cloudy, grey, cool, and laidback...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend to anyone looking for a new fragrance to try.</li>
            <li>It is a new perfume in my selection</li>
            <li>Bennetton has always been one of my personal favorites, french made scents at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>MY HUSBAND IS PLEASE WITH THIS PERFUME, LAST ALL DAY, THE SMELL IS NICE, NOT STRONG.</li>
            <li>The items seem to be old stocks..??!</li>
            <li>The top note seems to be too strong and may cause disappointment to you</li>
            <li>i love the way it smells, it comes unwrapped, so be careful to keep it wrap so it won&#x27;t loose the smell</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;ll be sending these items as gifts, they could say that these are imitations and/or old stocks already.</li>
            <li>Are these products really old stocks and/or original/brandnew?</li>
            <li>Placed low rating because the product does not meet my expectations, I&#x27;ve used over twenty years this colony, and the product purchased does not meet the quality since the olfactory trend seems to be an imitation of the original colony was so paid.</li>
            <li>all that you are left with is a slightly soapy slightly sweet hint of scent on your skin that is only detectable from about 2 inches away.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>Cold, and its&#x27; twin &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34; are unique, special, long - lasting scents.  </li>

            <li> I usually wear it as a body splash after a shower, or if I&#x27;m going to the gym, or some place with friends where I just want to smell good.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the package, it scent smelled really strong but on a daily use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try this perfume, I really hope it&#x27;s just the way described in the positive comments I&#x27;ve heard of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Package came sooner than I thought and the packaging was fine, so was the product, Took a second for me to understand hwo to use it</li>
            <li> It is a good perfume for everyday use, gives a fresh, youthful but also goes well with contemporary adult,  and is a classic</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t scream \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; or \\&quot;business\\&quot; or anything really</li>
            <li> everyone loves the smell on me and wants to know what it is</li>
            <li> It has a youthful scent, and nothing that I have ever really smelled before in scents I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I received the package extremely fast</li>
            <li> Really upset at this.</li>
            <li> Smells somewhat like the real one, but it is not.</li>
            <li> i feel it is well suited for an older gentleman</li>

            <li> Wearing it doesn&#x27;t say anything in particular.  </li>

            <li> Classic scent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have in mind of a day that is cloudy, grey, cool, and laidback...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend to anyone looking for a new fragrance to try.</li>
            <li> It is a new perfume in my selection</li>
            <li> Bennetton has always been one of my personal favorites, french made scents at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND IS PLEASE WITH THIS PERFUME, LAST ALL DAY, THE SMELL IS NICE, NOT STRONG.</li>
            <li> The items seem to be old stocks..??!</li>
            <li> The top note seems to be too strong and may cause disappointment to you</li>
            <li> i love the way it smells, it comes unwrapped, so be careful to keep it wrap so it won&#x27;t loose the smell</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;ll be sending these items as gifts, they could say that these are imitations and/or old stocks already.</li>
            <li> Are these products really old stocks and/or original/brandnew?</li>
            <li> Placed low rating because the product does not meet my expectations, I&#x27;ve used over twenty years this colony, and the product purchased does not meet the quality since the olfactory trend seems to be an imitation of the original colony was so paid.</li>
            <li> all that you are left with is a slightly soapy slightly sweet hint of scent on your skin that is only detectable from about 2 inches away.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> Cold, and its&#x27; twin &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34; are unique, special, long - lasting scents.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance fades away fast and it is not the same as the original Cold</li>
            <li> My 17 year old did not want to smell like all the other guys...</li>
            <li> the bottle wasn&#x27;t closed correctly, more than half of the perfume was spilled on its way and when I got it it was too late...</li>
            <li> LONG LASTING FOR OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT A LOUD SMELLING COLONGE.</li>
            <li> I received the item in days, I didnt have to wait that long.</li>
            <li> the smell not last for long  it takes only few hours and  not smell  like the real one the original one :(</li>
            <li> Benetton&#x27;s Cold is a very fresh fragance that could be used daily.</li>
            <li> what I expected.</li>
            <li> I recommend it widely.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A VERY LONG WAY</li>
            <li> MAL packed MY PACKAGE AND WINE DOWN MORE THAN HALF, WANT ME money back, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife loves this smell.. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for years for my husband but this doesn&#x27;t smell at all like it use to.  Must have changed the formular. This stuff smells awful.</li>
            <li> La fragancia es muy agradable, es un aroma juvenil, realmente me siento satisfecho por el perfume y por el precio, lo unico es que compre 2 y una trajo quebrado la perilla de plastico azul</li>
            <li> Proceed to transfer the call to the correct department. took the call</li>
            <li> Nice Fragrance i m using since last 10 years</li>
            <li> Although I bought this lotion from Amazon.com LLC, I&#x27;m pretty sure it is not the original product. Fragrance fades away fast and it is not the same as the original Cold I&#x27;ve been using for over 12 years</li>
            <li> I will not recommend this cologne to anyone because it smells so good and fruity and fresh and I do not want everyone and their mother wearing it. It is \\&quot;my\\&quot; fragrance, so stay away...LOL    One of my favorite colognes of all time.    Period.</li>
            <li> MAL packed MY PACKAGE AND WINE DOWN MORE THAN HALF, WANT ME money back, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> Horrible smelling fragrance i feel it is well suited for an older gentleman</li>
            <li> Placed low rating because the product does not meet my expectations, I&#x27;ve used over twenty years this colony, and the product purchased does not meet the quality since the olfactory trend seems to be an imitation of the original colony was so paid.</li>
            <li> Thank you. My order was received on time, in a perfect condition, and without any problem. I appreciate your good service.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of non flower fragrances. I came across this spray 3 years ago and absolutely loved it. Recently I found that 2 of my my perfumes were running low. Perfect opportunity to buy a new one. I found Cold on Amazon and instantly placed the order. The product arrived before the estimated day in perfect condition. I love the fragrance. Not too bold but stays with you for the entire work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone looking for a new fragrance to try.</li>
            <li> good product i like how smell it</li>
            <li> the smell of the fragrance is good, only for daily use.</li>
            <li> its fresh nothing more</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;I had this when i was a teenager and now it takes me back to it...love it, will buy another one soon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; service</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply great. Love the scent, works great on me (each ph is different), and it&#x27;s a inexpensive perfume to use everyday. If you know the scent and you think it works on you, buy it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS ON MY HUSBAND IT IS NOT A LOUD SMELLING COLONGE. ITS JUST RIGHT.I WILL BE ORDERING MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> Great Buy! What a great find, it&#x27;s been a while since I used this great and truly fab and hard to find cologne.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND IS PLEASE WITH THIS PERFUME, LAST ALL DAY, THE SMELL IS NICE, NOT STRONG. FRESH AND COOL TO USE ANY TIME DURING DAY OR NIGHT</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Cold\\&quot; is actually one of my favorite scents right now.  It&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s shockingly original or the most delicious smelling cologne ever.  It&#x27;s just simple, very citrusy and light and doesn&#x27;t have any kind of stigma. Wearing it doesn&#x27;t say anything in particular.  It doesn&#x27;t scream \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; or \\&quot;business\\&quot; or anything really, it&#x27;s just a nice fragrance.  I usually wear it as a body splash after a shower, or if I&#x27;m going to the gym, or some place with friends where I just want to smell good.  It&#x27;s supposedly a \\&quot;unisex\\&quot; scent although it smells more like a men&#x27;s cologne to me.  \\&quot;Cold\\&quot;&#x27;s counterpart \\&quot;Hot\\&quot; is also great but is clearly feminine, I gave it to my sister and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you&#x27;re looking for a good scent that&#x27;s cheap but doesn&#x27;t smell like it, this is for you.  I don&#x27;t think it says \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; or \\&quot;manly\\&quot; though, so if you&#x27;re looking for something like that I wouldn&#x27;t choose this.  With that being said, however, I&#x27;ve actually received more compliments while wearing this than most of my other colognes which I think smell richer and better.. so maybe wearing something that doesn&#x27;t smell like you&#x27;re trying is the best way to go!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved it . I enjoyed the aroma it doesn&#x27;t fade away at all . It has a perfect scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent, very good buy. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> This one is not original, smell like water, I mean odorless.  Its must writing cold very big , and a logo and come in a white box, from Italy .if u got the original u ll get a lot compliment.woman crazy about ii.smell good all day long.</li>
            <li> i love the way it smells, it comes unwrapped, so be careful to keep it wrap so it won&#x27;t loose the smell</li>
            <li> I bought this because I liked how the bottle looked, I had no idea if it would smell good or not. Good investment and full size bottle for a great price, it&#x27;s a nice smell to it. My husband and I are happy with this product.</li>
            <li> the smell not last for long  it takes only few hours and  not smell  like the real one the original one :(</li>
            <li> This is such a great product my wife absolutely loves this and its a great deal this is far better than the price this could easily be a $65 value as it smells just as good as any designer fragrance out there !</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s cold when you spray it on your skin. The top note seems to be too strong and may cause disappointment to you but then you are relieved as the fragrance becomes milder and milder, and as sweet as fruits (sometimes I smell it like the smell of... jack-fruit. I love this perfume &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> my all time favorite. great perfume.</li>
            <li> Just in time, very good congrats!!!</li>
            <li> smell last about one hour</li>
            <li> Really neat, I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Very good buy and excellent product of very good quality and excellent price very satisfied with my purchase thank you very much and very good buyed of good quality good</li>
            <li> Such a fabulous sent! My 17 year old did not want to smell like all the other guys...so, I want with an old favorite of mine! Citrus, verbena....yumm! Bennetton has always been one of my personal favorites, french made scents at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> The items seem to be old stocks..??! If I&#x27;ll be sending these items as gifts, they could say that these are imitations and/or old stocks already. How do we prevent these scenarios? Are these products really old stocks and/or original/brandnew?</li>
            <li> Perfect for me...everyone loves the smell on me and wants to know what it is</li>
            <li> excelent , autentic and good fragance. tx</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, it scent smelled really strong but on a daily use I&#x27;ve found the scent to be weak. It lasts for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and it is original! It is a good perfume for the daylight! I recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> this perfume&#x27;m a little empty&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not happy</li>
            <li> Is a good lotion as it lasts a long time and with a pleasant aroma and good price  in general the recommend</li>
            <li> Its a great relation between price and product.&lt;br /&gt;Really like the smell I have been using it for more than three years</li>
            <li> Todo perfecto, El Tiempo y La Entrega Pauto Cómo Sé, Lo recomiendo 100% A Toda La Comunidad, Saludos y MUCHOS EXITOS</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY AFFORDABLE AND UNIQUE FRAGRANCE. LONG LASTING FOR OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS. A LITTLE GOES A VERY LONG WAY</li>
            <li> me encanta el aroma de este perfume, tiene buen precio, fue entregado en el tiempo que fue dicho y todo al dia</li>
            <li> I am taken pleasure by the product acquired in his shop. Thank you for the sending until Friday it was that receipt the product in my hands and I am very satisfied thank you.</li>
            <li> Package came sooner than I thought and the packaging was fine, so was the product, Took a second for me to understand hwo to use it but it&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s meant to turn at the handle to prevent accidental usage. Now to the fun part!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell? It The cologne has a refreshing, laidback sort of smell. It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34; or powerful, but it does smell good. Gives me a feel of something my brothers wore in the 90&#x27;s or in school when they were teens. It has a youthful scent, and nothing that I have ever really smelled before in scents I have purchased. I love colognes, I have a collection and I will add this one to the colognes that I LIKE because the scent is not offensive nor is it bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a musk, but a beautiful musk. Wear this on a causal date out with your lady on a decent, well lit day. I have in mind of a day that is cloudy, grey, cool, and laidback...that is when I would wear this. A Polo shirt and some jeans, definitely meant for a relaxing day out!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with my purchase. This perfume smells disgusting.  I want to return it badly.  Can&#x27;t stand the smell.  The rate should be 0 star.</li>
            <li> I received the package extremely fast I received the item in days, I didnt have to wait that long. The price was worth it</li>
            <li> good product, fulfilled my expectations, thank the seller for me to get my time item. thank you</li>
            <li> It is a good perfume for everyday use, gives a fresh, youthful but also goes well with contemporary adult,  and is a classic</li>
            <li> This scent is nice, it reminds me of Kenzo Power, and just like Power, the longevity of this is only about 30 mins to 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;Then all that you are left with is a slightly soapy slightly sweet hint of scent on your skin that is only detectable from about 2 inches away.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what to make of this scent, it has a great opening and is quite nice while it last, but re-applying every two hours does not seem to be practical at all.&lt;br /&gt;I say, do not waste you money here, just save up an get better quality stuff, I know I am from now on.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Very good if youre lookint for a fresh scent. Lasts enough through out the day. And super very cheap price!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and I like it a lot, so does he. It&#x27;s not to strong or over powering and has a very nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> It is a 100ml lotion and by the time I got it it was about 75 as it spilled over the box. Really upset at this.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been using for the last 10 years. It&#x27;s cheap, I like the scent. Packaged nicely, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> welll the name say everything about this perfume, HOT!, strong smell on this fragance here! if you like those perfume has a strong smell this is for you !</li>

            <li> Great quality and fine aroma. I use it for everyday bases and I revived a lot of complements. I love it !!!</li>
            <li> Benetton&#x27;s Cold is a very fresh fragance that could be used daily. It has a nice scent that lasts for hours. I recommend it widely. The packaging was also awesome, they used air bubble plastic for protection which allowed the 2 glasses arrive unharmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cold de Benetton es una fragancia muy fresca que puede ser usada a diario. Posee un buen olor que dura por horas. La recomiendo ampliamente. El empaquetado fue espectacular, usaron plástico de burbujas de aire para proteger las colonias, lo que permitió que ambas botellas llegaran sin daño alguno.</li>
            <li> El producto llegó en perfectas condiciones y en el tiempo esperado....a pesar de ser un spray económico la relación calidad precio es muy buena.</li>
            <li> Excellent, i love this product. the smell is just right for me...Bravo Benetton, you hid this one right on.....</li>

            <li> the bottle wasn&#x27;t closed correctly, more than half of the perfume was spilled on its way and when I got it it was too late... poor packaging..</li>
            <li> Smells somewhat like the real one, but it is not. Never buying this product again online.</li>
