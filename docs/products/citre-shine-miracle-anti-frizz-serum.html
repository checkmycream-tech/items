            <li>Serum!lly don&#x27;t need to be saying all of this because, if you are searching for it in 2014, you already know and love this Shine Serum!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive and makes my hair look wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li>This works magic for me!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is just amazing.</li>
            <li>But used sparingly, this provides AMAZING results.</li>
            <li>It gives my color-treated hair shine, makes it easy to comb through, and best of all: makes it easy to style my wavy hair, stick straight!  </li>
            <li>I straighten my hair a lot because it is curly and my hair stayed healthy.</li>
            <li>This one was definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried so far...but still made my hair appear greasy.  </li>
            <li>So many people like this product, WHY would they dis-continue it?</li>
            <li>Love it .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this stuff on Amazon - it&#x27;s not on store shelves anymore.  </li>
            <li>none of them carry it any more.  </li>
            <li>It is simply the best!</li>
            <li>Like most Citre Shine reviewers here, I&#x27;ve been using this Shine Miracle for years and have been searching for it in every store I visit.  </li>
            <li>hope this helps others who have searching for their treasured, favorite product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff for my thick/coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for so many years and have never had a problem finding it.</li>
            <li>&amp; I get so many compliments on my hair because of this product.  </li>
            <li>I might even like this better.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years and could find it no where else this time around.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad I could find it.</li>
            <li>make it look nice and smooth</li>
            <li>Even better than Moroccan oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to many people over the years and every time they have thanked me after trying it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products and found Citre Shine to give me the best shine for my curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li>My best result is from using just a dot, or one drop from the bottle, for it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>The price is right, it smells nice, lasts all day, and is versatile for both our hair types.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other products, but this one worked the best.  </li>
            <li>EASY FIX.</li>
            <li>Good product and a decent price.</li>
            <li>I could put a generous amount of this in my hair and it would give me that perfect moisture and silky hair with out weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I always go to Amazon for things I cannot fine.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and wavy</li>
            <li>Any more than that will cause hair to look greasy, but using the right amount seems to nourish the hair just so.  </li>
            <li>It surely was not packaged right.  </li>
            <li>If you have frizzy hair of any kind I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>So I was so excited to use it again.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need to be saying all of this because, if you are searching for it in 2014, you already know and love this Shine</li>
            <li>but I love the product so much</li>
            <li>The right amount, however, makes my hair extremely shiny and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>but a bottle lasts long enough and my hair looks good!!!</li>
            <li>Good on dry, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>I use this for my hair (straight and fine)</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Great for old grey hair that gets frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to manage, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Here is my hot tip, just discovered this week: CitreShine is made by Schwarzkopf which also makes got2b</li>
            <li>Another favorite thing about it, is that when I go to the beach or out on a boat, it seems to block the humidity from getting absorbed; not completely</li>
            <li>Last place I was able to get it was at Rite Aid, but even they have stopped selling it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for more than ten or eleven years and have found it consistently reliable.  </li>
            <li>Put a few drops in the palms of my hands rub it through my hair, blow dry,&amp; my hair looks perfect all day.  </li>
            <li>bottle does not look anything like the old Citri Shine bottle, but the ingredients are the same and it feels the most like my old favorite than any of the products I&#x27;ve tried to replace it with.  </li>
            <li>I was a big fan of Citre Shine in high school, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find this laminating serum in stores for about four years.</li>
            <li>I like the way citre shine for lack of a better word \\&quot;POOFS\\&quot; when I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>This product is a outstanding for dry, chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, it does NOT make your face break out, unlike most other anti-frizz products out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that, unless you put a ton on, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look greasy.  </li>
            <li>You can imagine what too much looks like.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>keeps my hair in place, I have really frizzy hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what to say about this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Also, product much thinner</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need much and works well with my mousse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many serums, drugstore and professional, and I always go back to this.  </li>
            <li>Though it still performs well, creating extremely shiny hair that always prompts my friends to ask me what I did differently,the consistancy is a lot more sticky.</li>
            <li>many other brands when I run out of this every now and then, but have now given up and realized nothing will beat this for us and signed up for the subscribe and save</li>
            <li>I will continue to order this for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>I typically stray from products like this because I&#x27;ve never been able to find a smoothing serum that doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy.  </li>
            <li>I used the got2b Glossy for the first time yesterday, and my hair was shiny again for the first time in over a year (when I ran out of my last bottle of CitreShine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>When the package arrived, it was leaking because the top was not on tight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since high school (over a decade).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have used numerous products through the years for my very curly, very fine hair and this is the only product that works with any lasting effect.  </li>
            <li>I love this product to tame my curly hair</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find this in the stores where I live as that is why I purcharsed it online.</li>
            <li>There is a very fine line between nice non-frizzy hair and gross, greasy, dirty hair with this product.  </li>
            <li>For the past 6 months or so, I&#x27;ve been using Smooth N&#x27; Shine Hair Polisher, because it is packaged in a similar bottle (but with pink accents on the label, rather than the bright yellow), and it is also made by Schwarzkopf.  </li>
            <li>: The ingredients are exactly the same, and listed in the exact same order!  </li>
            <li>Also when I&#x27;ve had long hair I put it in right after the shower and used it as a detangler.</li>
            <li>For me, with long straight hair, it leaves my hair tangle-free, shiny, less prone to static, and overall in much nicer condition.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a little to give your hair a very nice shine without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>Shine Serum, in a clear 4 oz.</li>
            <li>I use it now on my 2yr old daughters hair and makes it easier to comb her hair.</li>
            <li>A fabulous product not available in Stuart, FL.  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, shiny and impervious to tangles.  </li>
            <li>I often get asked about what I put in my hair to make it so shiny and soft and when I say Citre Shine people are often surprised.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Citre Shine keeps it soft, silky and shiny, even humid or rainy days.</li>
            <li>It tames fly-aways better than anything I have ever used, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and it has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Tried other more expensive products when I was no longer able to find this in the local stores.</li>
            <li>I recomend this product to anyone who had hard to manage hair or hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>only keep my hair shiny and frizz free for a few hours</li>
            <li>More often than not, I end up with my hair pulled back in a pony tail because I crossed that fine line and ended up with the gross, greasy, dirty hair look.  </li>
            <li>Seriously nothing better for my coarse, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>But the ingredients and performance are not the same as my dear old Citre Shine Miracle Serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 20+ years I can&#x27;t bare going without it.  </li>
            <li>I have to use a tiny tiny amount, probably less than a full drop, or it will get greasy.  </li>
            <li>Too little gives my hair a nice shine, but is not effective in the anti-frizz area.  </li>
            <li>This product definitely adds shine, but it does not do much in the way of keeping down the stray frizzies.</li>

            <li> I have used numerous products through the years for my very curly, very fine hair and this is the only product that works with any lasting effect.  </li>
            <li> I love this product to tame my curly hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find this in the stores where I live as that is why I purcharsed it online.</li>
            <li> There is a very fine line between nice non-frizzy hair and gross, greasy, dirty hair with this product.  </li>
            <li> For the past 6 months or so, I&#x27;ve been using Smooth N&#x27; Shine Hair Polisher, because it is packaged in a similar bottle (but with pink accents on the label, rather than the bright yellow), and it is also made by Schwarzkopf.  </li>
            <li> : The ingredients are exactly the same, and listed in the exact same order!  </li>
            <li> Also when I&#x27;ve had long hair I put it in right after the shower and used it as a detangler.</li>
            <li> For me, with long straight hair, it leaves my hair tangle-free, shiny, less prone to static, and overall in much nicer condition.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a little to give your hair a very nice shine without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Shine Serum, in a clear 4 oz.</li>
            <li> I use it now on my 2yr old daughters hair and makes it easier to comb her hair.</li>
            <li> A fabulous product not available in Stuart, FL.  </li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, shiny and impervious to tangles.  </li>
            <li> I often get asked about what I put in my hair to make it so shiny and soft and when I say Citre Shine people are often surprised.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Citre Shine keeps it soft, silky and shiny, even humid or rainy days.</li>
            <li> It tames fly-aways better than anything I have ever used, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> Tried other more expensive products when I was no longer able to find this in the local stores.</li>
            <li> I recomend this product to anyone who had hard to manage hair or hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> only keep my hair shiny and frizz free for a few hours</li>
            <li> More often than not, I end up with my hair pulled back in a pony tail because I crossed that fine line and ended up with the gross, greasy, dirty hair look.  </li>
            <li> Seriously nothing better for my coarse, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> But the ingredients and performance are not the same as my dear old Citre Shine Miracle Serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 20+ years I can&#x27;t bare going without it.  </li>
            <li> I have to use a tiny tiny amount, probably less than a full drop, or it will get greasy.  </li>
            <li> Too little gives my hair a nice shine, but is not effective in the anti-frizz area.  </li>
            <li> This product definitely adds shine, but it does not do much in the way of keeping down the stray frizzies.</li>
            <li> I have try other anti frizz serum, but this is the only one that leave my hair soft and manageble</li>
            <li> I use it before using a curling iron or flat iron to keep from damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> I gave the product multiple tries, each time using a different amount.  </li>
            <li> After a long day at work etc.</li>
            <li> BRINGS YOUR HAIR FROM DEAD TO ALIVE.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for a long time to maintain my frizz all day</li>
            <li> And it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I put in my damp hair, rather than dry.  </li>
            <li> Let it air dry or blow dry.</li>
            <li> Other stuff leaves my hair laying flat.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way and one bottle will usually last me a year.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using only about half a pump of this product, or else your hair will look oily.</li>
            <li> I blow-dry my hair every time I wash it, and I have very dry, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> but my hair doesn&#x27;t turn back into a wavy frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> I could brush my hair wet and it would not break at all.</li>
            <li> bottle with silver and fuscia (pink) accents, and a silver squeeze-top cap.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s harder to wash out of your hair, too.  </li>
            <li> but it is getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> Halfway to that bottle I can tell that its not doing the job that I expected.</li>
            <li> I am Italian, Spanish, Native American and it is real hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> Also a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and it makes your hair shiny and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of other products including some pricey ones and none have lived up to my experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I have medium-thick hair, and anything bigger than a dime-sized amount of the serum turn my hair into a heavy, sticky mess.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I love the product but was disappointed with the packaging.  </li>
            <li> when my hair is looking dry using just a little of this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding it in the local stores...</li>
            <li> I have curly/wavy hair that is really thick and borders on coarse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like someone watered it down.  </li>
            <li> It does not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Usually I dont dare touch the curls after they dry</li>
            <li> Nearly half of the product had leaked out of the bottle</li>
            <li> but instead I use it as a detangler and to make her hair less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Without it my hair would be a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> when long and also on my daughter&#x27;s thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Have you ever put a product in your hair and it felt heavy and greasy?</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few yrs.</li>
            <li> Label was also missing from plastic package.  </li>
            <li> When it became hard to find in stores,  I tried other products but nothing else came close.  </li>
            <li> Nothing I found worked as well to define and tame my curls.</li>
            <li> OR at least make it so difficult to find, not only here in the East.</li>
            <li> NOW for some reason it is near impossible to find.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but it is increasingly hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I find this serum really hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> It performs well and holds my thick, curly hair in place.</li>
            <li> My daughter has the opposite problem, of thick curly hair which is impossible to comb through.  </li>
            <li> This is very thick but it does blend in if you rub it into your hair well.  </li>
            <li> I have alot of very thick hair</li>
            <li> and this is my secret weapon.  </li>
            <li> But with shipping charges it gets expensive .</li>
            <li> The shipping charge is crazy but it almost works out to what I was paying retail per bottle in Canada.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works greaT FOR preventing frizzies.</li>
            <li> Adds shine to my hair, helps keep frizzies in check.  Good product.</li>
            <li> My review title says it all.  I&#x27;ve been using this product since high school (over a decade).  I haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well for the price.  Great value!  It&#x27;s light enough that, unless you put a ton on, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look greasy.  This product definitely adds shine, but it does not do much in the way of keeping down the stray frizzies.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but it is increasingly hard to find.  As others have said, it must be used sparingly.  My best result is from using just a dot, or one drop from the bottle, for it goes a long way.  Any more than that will cause hair to look greasy, but using the right amount seems to nourish the hair just so.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Have used this for 5 years and now you can&#x27;t get it in Canada.....pity.  But I got some on amazon.  The shipping charge is crazy but it almost works out to what I was paying retail per bottle in Canada.  Great supplier.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just amazing. I was so happy to find it after not seeing it on store shelves for years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for years and have never had a problem with it. I straighten my hair a lot because it is curly and my hair stayed healthy. Keeps my hair soft and healthy looking. Also when I&#x27;ve had long hair I put it in right after the shower and used it as a detangler. I could brush my hair wet and it would not break at all. I use it now on my 2yr old daughters hair and makes it easier to comb her hair. Also a little goes a long way and I use no bigger than a dime size amount. This bottle will last me over three or four months. I recomend this product to anyone who had hard to manage hair or hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Conditions my hair and protects from sun for hatless golf days</li>
            <li> Can not find in the stores anymore. Seriously nothing better for my coarse, wavy hair. Makes it shine and behave without stiffness or stickiness.</li>
            <li> I typically stray from products like this because I&#x27;ve never been able to find a smoothing serum that doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy.  This one was definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried so far...but still made my hair appear greasy.  I gave the product multiple tries, each time using a different amount.  Too little gives my hair a nice shine, but is not effective in the anti-frizz area.  You can imagine what too much looks like.  I couldn&#x27;t find a balance of shine and non-grease.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. And it leaves my hair looking perfect. Put a few drops in the palms of my hands rub it through my hair, blow dry,&amp; my hair looks perfect all day.  There a lot of products that look like the same stuff but don&#x27;t come close to citre shine. I like the way citre shine for lack of a better word \\&quot;POOFS\\&quot; when I blow dry it. Other stuff leaves my hair laying flat. NOW for some reason it is near impossible to find. WHY would they just stop making it? OR at least make it so difficult to find, not only here in the East. But from what I can tell people all over the USA are having difficulty locating this product. And it&#x27;s disappeared in Canada as well.  The price is out of sight on eBay. Good thing amazon still carries it. But with shipping charges it gets expensive . So many people like this product, WHY would they dis-continue it? I called the company &amp; they were of no help. Maybe if enough people call &amp; complain they will start to distribute it again. Heres the phone # for Customer service  1-800-258-3425</li>
            <li> I always go to Amazon for things I cannot fine. This is the best hair shiner around!</li>
            <li> Love it .  Straightens my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly/frizzy hair. I am Italian, Spanish, Native American and it is real hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  A little bit goes a long way and it makes your hair shiny and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair in place, I have really frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this stuff on Amazon - it&#x27;s not on store shelves anymore.  It tames fly-aways better than anything I have ever used, and a little goes a long way.  I will continue to order this for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I have try other anti frizz serum, but this is the only one that leave my hair soft and manageble</li>
            <li> This is very thick but it does blend in if you rub it into your hair well.  It works best with some type of heat afterwards (either blow dryer or straightener) as I have used it alone and my hair was still frizzy.  Good product and a decent price.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and wavy but I want sleek and shiny.  Citre Shine does the trick but I can&#x27;t find it at any of the local stores.  Not Walmart, Target, CVS, etc. - none of them carry it any more.  So I go to Amazon and Yippee there it is!  More expensive this way but a bottle lasts long enough and my hair looks good!!!</li>
            <li> It only takes a little to give your hair a very nice shine without weighing it down.  Good on dry, color-treated hair. Will buy more!</li>
            <li> I have loved this laminator for 21 years and des test all others! It is simply the best! Thank u for existing</li>
            <li> I cant find this in the store anymore either. I have tried lots of other products including some pricey ones and none have lived up to my experience with this product. Have you ever put a product in your hair and it felt heavy and greasy? After a long day at work etc. I never had that problem with this product. I could put a generous amount of this in my hair and it would give me that perfect moisture and silky hair with out weighing it down. My face wouldn&#x27;t feel greasy from the oils rubbing of from my hair to my face. I wish I could purchase this in stores again. Until now I will purchase here.</li>
            <li> Like most Citre Shine reviewers here, I&#x27;ve been using this Shine Miracle for years and have been searching for it in every store I visit.  It&#x27;s nowhere to be found.  Here is my hot tip, just discovered this week: CitreShine is made by Schwarzkopf which also makes got2b Glossy Anti-frizz Shine Serum, in a clear 4 oz. bottle with silver and fuscia (pink) accents, and a silver squeeze-top cap.  I compared the ingredients of got2b Glossy to Citri Shine Serum: The ingredients are exactly the same, and listed in the exact same order!  I used the got2b Glossy for the first time yesterday, and my hair was shiny again for the first time in over a year (when I ran out of my last bottle of CitreShine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle does not look anything like the old Citri Shine bottle, but the ingredients are the same and it feels the most like my old favorite than any of the products I&#x27;ve tried to replace it with.  For the past 6 months or so, I&#x27;ve been using Smooth N&#x27; Shine Hair Polisher, because it is packaged in a similar bottle (but with pink accents on the label, rather than the bright yellow), and it is also made by Schwarzkopf.  But the ingredients and performance are not the same as my dear old Citre Shine Miracle Serum.  But.. the Got2b Glossy seems to be the same formulation as the Citre Shine Anti-Frizz Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps others who have searching for their treasured, favorite product.  Now, here is my actual review, even though you probably already know the stuff is awesome:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this stuff for my thick/coarse hair.  It gives my color-treated hair shine, makes it easy to comb through, and best of all: makes it easy to style my wavy hair, stick straight!  Another favorite thing about it, is that when I go to the beach or out on a boat, it seems to block the humidity from getting absorbed; not completely but my hair doesn&#x27;t turn back into a wavy frizzy mess.  It&#x27;s the only product that gives actual SHINE to my color-treated blonde hair.  I really don&#x27;t need to be saying all of this because, if you are searching for it in 2014, you already know and love this Shine Serum!lly don&#x27;t need to be saying all of this because, if you are searching for it in 2014, you already know and love this Shine Serum!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product numerous time.  It performs well and holds my thick, curly hair in place.</li>
            <li> searched for this product everywhere! Literally! Last place I was able to get it was at Rite Aid, but even they have stopped selling it. If your hair also looks damaged (split ends, dryness) this definitely helps!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what to say about this stuff.  I&#x27;ve used a ton of anti-frizz products in my lifetime, but none like this.  There is a very fine line between nice non-frizzy hair and gross, greasy, dirty hair with this product.  More often than not, I end up with my hair pulled back in a pony tail because I crossed that fine line and ended up with the gross, greasy, dirty hair look.  I find this serum really hard to work with.  And it&#x27;s harder to wash out of your hair, too.  On a positive note, it does NOT make your face break out, unlike most other anti-frizz products out there. For that alone, is why I have not given up on this stuff yet.</li>
            <li> A fabulous product not available in Stuart, FL.  I have been using it for so many years and have never had a problem finding it. I wonder what is going on.</li>
            <li> I was a big fan of Citre Shine in high school, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find this laminating serum in stores for about four years. However, after years of searching, I suddenly found it on the shelf at Wal-Mart one day a couple of months ago, and I began using it again. In my opinion, the formula is quite different from the serum that I used from 2005-2007. Though it still performs well, creating extremely shiny hair that always prompts my friends to ask me what I did differently,the consistancy is a lot more sticky. I have medium-thick hair, and anything bigger than a dime-sized amount of the serum turn my hair into a heavy, sticky mess. I thought that it might have just been the bottle that I purchased, but my second bottle did the same thing. I recommend using only about half a pump of this product, or else your hair will look oily. But used sparingly, this provides AMAZING results.</li>
            <li> I do like what it. Dose for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 20+ years I can&#x27;t bare going without it.  I have curly/wavy hair that is really thick and borders on coarse. I use this after I wash my hair and before I add any styling product. Without it my hair would be a frizzy mess. I know hairdressers that have used this on the ends of hair before coloring or perms to help prevent damage to hair. If you have frizzy hair of any kind I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love this product to tame my curly hair but it is getting harder and harder to find. So I buy it on Amazon now and the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few yrs. &amp; couldn&#x27;t find it in a store.  Was very happy to find it on Amazon &amp; at a good price.  I have it on subscription.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. Its the only product I have to have before drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and I add this to my mouse and it works great.  Can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Best for my hair. Curly and alitttle frizzy</li>
            <li> This product works for my hair that is why I purchased it.  I have tried other products, but this one worked the best.  I can&#x27;t seem to find this in the stores where I live as that is why I purcharsed it online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for year and years and years.  I&#x27;ve tried many serums, drugstore and professional, and I always go back to this.  It makes my hair soft, shiny and impervious to tangles.  I have alot of very thick hair and this is my secret weapon.  I often get asked about what I put in my hair to make it so shiny and soft and when I say Citre Shine people are often surprised.  A little does go a long way and one bottle will usually last me a year.  I put in my damp hair, rather than dry.  Never had this make my hair look greasy.  I use a quarter-sized amount for hair that hits below my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have curly hair &amp; I get so many compliments on my hair because of this product.  I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding it in the local stores...I hope it&#x27;s not being discontinued!</li>
            <li> Great shine.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> When the package arrived, it was leaking because the top was not on tight.  Label was also missing from plastic package.  I think someone else must have had this and returned it.  It surely was not packaged right.  Also, product much thinner then when I bought it from the store.  It&#x27;s almost like someone watered it down.  I am not using it.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for use after washing your hair as a straightening serum.  I have used numerous products through the years for my very curly, very fine hair and this is the only product that works with any lasting effect.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used the mist from this line already, so I tried this serum too.  I might even like this better.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years and could find it no where else this time around.  Thank goodness for Amazon</li>
            <li> Great product, but it&#x27;s getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shiny. I don&#x27;t need much and works well with my mousse.I was so glad I could find it.</li>
            <li> This product is a outstanding for dry, chemically treated hair. A little goes a long way, and it has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> when my hair is looking dry using just a little of this make it look nice and smooth</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve tried so many products and found Citre Shine to give me the best shine for my curly, dry hair. It&#x27;s not expensive and makes my hair look wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li> Smooths frizz and leaves hair shiny. I use it before using a curling iron or flat iron to keep from damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the product but was disappointed with the packaging.  Nearly half of the product had leaked out of the bottle but I love the product so much I just kept it.</li>
            <li> BRINGS YOUR HAIR FROM DEAD TO ALIVE. EASY FIX.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My hair is damaged from coloring and heat drying, plus course greys.  This works magic for me!  Even better than Moroccan oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now. I love the way it makes my hair feel. And it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I use this for my hair (straight and fine) when long and also on my daughter&#x27;s thick curly hair.  For me, with long straight hair, it leaves my hair tangle-free, shiny, less prone to static, and overall in much nicer condition.  I have to use a tiny tiny amount, probably less than a full drop, or it will get greasy.  The right amount, however, makes my hair extremely shiny and beautiful.  My daughter has the opposite problem, of thick curly hair which is impossible to comb through.  For her, shine isn&#x27;t the issue but instead I use it as a detangler and to make her hair less frizzy.  I&#x27;ve used this product for more than ten or eleven years and have found it consistently reliable.  The price is right, it smells nice, lasts all day, and is versatile for both our hair types.  I have tried (and tried and tried) many other brands when I run out of this every now and then, but have now given up and realized nothing will beat this for us and signed up for the subscribe and save so we don&#x27;t run out anymore.</li>
            <li> I have use it for about 10 yrs. Not sold in our stores anymore.Found on Amazon.  Great for old grey hair that gets frizzy.</li>
            <li> My local store stopped selling it. So I tried a different product that they recommend. Halfway to that bottle I can tell that its not doing the job that I expected. So I was so excited to use it again. I have medium curly hair. I apply them on my damp hair after washing. Let it air dry or blow dry. My hair is easy to manage, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 10+ years. Tried other more expensive products when I was no longer able to find this in the local stores. Nothing I found worked as well to define and tame my curls. One of my happiest days was finding it on-line. I have recommended it to many people over the years and every time they have thanked me after trying it. The spray mist laminator also works well as a mid-day touch up. Usually I dont dare touch the curls after they dry but with it I can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  When it became hard to find in stores,  I tried other products but nothing else came close.  I blow-dry my hair every time I wash it, and I have very dry, wavy hair.  Citre Shine keeps it soft, silky and shiny, even humid or rainy days.</li>
            <li> Excellent ,,,,,,Thank you</li>

            <li> This is a great product! It does not weigh your hair down. It makes my hair shiny and tames frizzy and flyaway hair. My friend gave me a sample of this as a gift. I am on my fourth bottle and will purchase again.</li>
