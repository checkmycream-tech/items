            <li>When I returned, my family immediately noticed how smooth and even-toned my skin had become.</li>
            <li>my skin was baby smooth.</li>
            <li>you feeling smooth and sublte.use it along with the lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for sensitive skin &amp; acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have what I believe is more than my fair share of grey hair, but no wrinkles and no blemishes!  </li>
            <li>Through amazon my S&amp;H was free &amp; it was delivered right to my door!</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s Skin Success Soap works wonders!</li>
            <li>,THIS IS A TRUE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>While she does get it, it clears quickly and without scarring.  </li>
            <li>I tried this brand when i got pregnant, i bought everything from the body lotion for stretch marks to this soap, i will continue using it, btw i have zero stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Plus it makes your skin very soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>This soap is the best, it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin after using it, I have 7 people in my family and everyone loves it.</li>
            <li>and it retains it fresh cocoa smell until the bar is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This soap is soothing to my sensitive skin and rinse smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>but it leaves a ring around the tub other than that soap is good.</li>
            <li>It has a mild cocoa or chocolate scent and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different types and brands and while I have many favorites, this is the ONLY one I&#x27;ve used that does not require lotion application after showering.</li>
            <li>This order really saved me a lot of time, gas &amp; money!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it was packaged well and each bar of soap was properly protected during delivery.</li>
            <li>This soap leaves her skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 62) and this is really the way to get relief!  </li>
            <li>Does not dry your skin, smell is subtle and awesome, not perfume-y.  </li>
            <li>I finally found it on Amazon, and hope to find more Palmer&#x27;s products available in the future.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t use this soap i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>VERY SILKY SOFT AND BEAUTIFUL.THE SOAP EVENS YOUR SKIN TONE</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t not get any new hideous purple stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I can attest to the fact that over the generations, Palmer&#x27;s Skin Success Soap has been the determining factor in both mine and my grandmother&#x27;s skin being clear and looking years younger.  </li>
            <li>The only soap that I can remotely compare it to is maybe Dove - but better.  </li>
            <li>This soap is gentle on my dry skin and left me feeling refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>Her face was clear without a blemish and without a wrinkle.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product faithfully as an all over body soap all my adult life.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and smoothe.</li>
            <li>My friends believe I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>People don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m 52 years old.  </li>
            <li>, she&#x27;s 13 years old</li>
            <li>And not too soft.</li>
            <li>AND SO DOES THE WALGREEN&#x27;S NATURAL BRAND WORKS....</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a difference in my skin complexion, but I&#x27;m sure in due time</li>
            <li>Feels smooth for my skin but 1 bar usually just last for 3 weeks even if there is no water in the soap dish.</li>
            <li>it is moisturizing, rinses away fresh with no residue &amp; it definitely helps reduce scars &amp; other unsightly scars or marks!  </li>
            <li>I used this product during my second pregnancy, and not only did help fade my old stretch marks, but it</li>
            <li>They love the lotion, too, but it&#x27;s hard to get little kids put on lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> It will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is the only soap she can use because she has extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has dry skin</li>
            <li> I was also skeptical because of the price, it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li> It is long</li>
            <li> I bought this to clear up some scars  on my back from a break out and this soap didnt work at all ther smell is annoying and it has way to many chemicals in it and dries my skin out</li>
            <li> I have had dry skin for about 4 years now</li>
            <li> I figured that it&#x27;s never too early to moisturize and eliminate small scars that they get from scratches and boo boos.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS WAY OVER PRICED DUE TO THE ORGANIC LABEL.</li>
            <li> Once I got out if the shower &amp; dried off (both towel &amp; air dry)</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I was a bit skeptical because after I rinsed the soap off of my body it felt like my skin was dried out.</li>
            <li> I USE ONLY TWO KINDS OF SOAP FOR AT LEAST 15 YRS.</li>
            <li> Started to see a difference within a week, dark spots started to lighten up a bit</li>
            <li> will never use any other soap again!</li>
            <li> that I bought the bar soap for my little girls to use in the tub.</li>
            <li> but I think the price is a little steep, still cheaper than the store though.</li>
            <li> Smooths out uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> I was away for two months and used cocoa butter soap everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is like a plain lump of clay, utilitarian, does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> I hate the lotion products this brand makes because it makes me feel sticky, but the soap is leaves me feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This soap is hard to find in stores and with Amazon Subscription I don&#x27;t have to worry not finding it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for over 20 years and they&#x27;ve really mad a difference in my skin texture and</li>

            <li> I used this product during my second pregnancy, and not only did help fade my old stretch marks, but it I didn&#x27;t not get any new hideous purple stretch marks. I hate the lotion products this brand makes because it makes me feel sticky, but the soap is leaves me feeling clean and refreshed. This product is great!</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter soap smells delicious, like chocolate, but not overly sweet or candy-like. The soap itself is creamy and luxurious, and softens skin quite nicely. It also feels like it rinses off well, which is kind of surprising for a cream soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this to clear up some scars  on my back from a break out and this soap didnt work at all ther smell is annoying and it has way to many chemicals in it and dries my skin out it made me break out more nubian heritage is better and its organic smeells real good and it works</li>
            <li> I love bar soap. I only use bar soap. I&#x27;ve tried many different types and brands and while I have many favorites, this is the ONLY one I&#x27;ve used that does not require lotion application after showering. It has a mild cocoa or chocolate scent and it is very moisturizing. Best price on amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for quite sometime and it&#x27;s really good. I had some scars it had made some leave and others fade! I love the smell it&#x27;s like a chocolate.  Overall 5 out 5. Plus it makes your skin very soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Smooths out uneven skin tone. I was away for two months and used cocoa butter soap everyday. When I returned, my family immediately noticed how smooth and even-toned my skin had become.</li>
            <li> These soaps are very nice.  Thats what i use all through, it evens out your skin tone, and fades the marks on the skin.  Just be committed to it and you will see results.</li>
            <li> I have used this product faithfully as an all over body soap all my adult life.  It keeps my skin soft and smoothe. My friends believe I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s.  I don&#x27;t dye my hair, and I never wear makeup. People don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m 52 years old.  I have what I believe is more than my fair share of grey hair, but no wrinkles and no blemishes!  My grandmother used this product as a face soap when I was growing up.  She passed away Jan 1, 2000 at the age of 88, looking like she was 68 instead of 88.  Her face was clear without a blemish and without a wrinkle.  I can attest to the fact that over the generations, Palmer&#x27;s Skin Success Soap has been the determining factor in both mine and my grandmother&#x27;s skin being clear and looking years younger.  My daughter now uses it as an all over body soap, she&#x27;s 13 years old and she&#x27;s gorgeous.  She hasn&#x27;t been plagued by the acne issues that many of her friends are bothered by.  While she does get it, it clears quickly and without scarring.  Palmer&#x27;s Skin Success Soap works wonders!</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome awesome please Palmer don&#x27;t stop making it so good this is the only thing that worked for my after threading and plucking marks on face</li>
            <li> This soap is the best, it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin after using it, I have 7 people in my family and everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle on my dry skin and left me feeling refreshed and clean.  My scars appeared lighterr after a bath.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Palmer&#x27;s products! I&#x27;ve been using them for over 20 years and they&#x27;ve really mad a difference in my skin texture and feel.&lt;br /&gt;This product comes wrapped as a pack of 12. Each soap is in a box and inside each box there is a yummy smelling soap that is sealed in plastic.&lt;br /&gt;The soap doesn&#x27;t dissolve away in the shower like some cocoa bars do and it retains it fresh cocoa smell until the bar is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough!</li>
            <li> Love this soap. I tried this brand when i got pregnant, i bought everything from the body lotion for stretch marks to this soap, i will continue using it, btw i have zero stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This soap is hard to find in stores and with Amazon Subscription I don&#x27;t have to worry not finding it.  This soap works miracles on my skin.  I use it as a facial cleanser and body soap.  It has a low grade chocolate scent, nothing overbearing.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing! I don&#x27;t even need lotion after a shower, it moisturizes my skin so well. The first time I used this I was a bit skeptical because after I rinsed the soap off of my body it felt like my skin was dried out. Once I got out if the shower &amp; dried off (both towel &amp; air dry) my skin was baby smooth. I use this soap for my face &amp; body. I was also skeptical because of the price, it&#x27;s so cheap. It&#x27;s good for sensitive skin &amp; acne prone skin. I have both &amp; it&#x27;s helped my breakouts. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a difference in my skin complexion, but I&#x27;m sure in due time my skin will be more even.</li>
            <li> This order really saved me a lot of time, gas &amp; money! Through amazon my S&amp;H was free &amp; it was delivered right to my door! if you don&#x27;t use this soap i highly recommend it! its the best on the market!! it is moisturizing, rinses away fresh with no residue &amp; it definitely helps reduce scars &amp; other unsightly scars or marks!  i will be buying more through amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I got a great value for this product when I bought it on Amazon because I bought it bulk. It is great for spots and blemishes and smells great. I love the fact that it was packaged well and each bar of soap was properly protected during delivery.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t dissolve in the soap tray,</li>
            <li> was so happy to find this soap at a great price, been using it for years and love when I find it on sale</li>
            <li> will never use any other soap again!</li>
            <li> My wife always uses palmer&#x27;s coco butter soap to wash her face. It is the only soap she can use because she has extremely dry skin. This soap leaves her skin soft and smooth. She pairs it with palmer&#x27;s coco butter with vitamin e. it also clears her face when she has occasional breakouts. Palmer&#x27;s does exactly what it promises. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has dry skin</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE the line of PALMERS COCOA BUTTER... is a great product that does exactly what it says it does. Have been using it for quite a while and it just keeps getting better and better.</li>
            <li> Shipping is lightening fast &amp; the soap is wonderful for the skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap!!! Just like mom used back in the day, so now my wife is using it and it&#x27;s working great for her complexion.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many months without issue.  I finally found it on Amazon, and hope to find more Palmer&#x27;s products available in the future. This soap is soothing to my sensitive skin and rinse smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> And not too soft. It is not mushy. It is long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is just cocoa butter, no fragrance, no dye, not trying at all to be pretty or nice smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is like a plain lump of clay, utilitarian, does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Feels smooth for my skin but 1 bar usually just last for 3 weeks even if there is no water in the soap dish.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001G7R3P6 Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Cream Soap with Vitamin E, 3.5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT IS WAY OVER PRICED DUE TO THE ORGANIC LABEL. THIS IS AT WALGREEN&#x27;S FOR 2.99. I PURCHASE THIS AND IT WORKS AND SO DOES THE WALGREEN&#x27;S NATURAL BRAND WORKS....OVER PRICE HERE FOR SURE...</li>
            <li> I loved the lotion so much..and the body wash...that I bought the bar soap for my little girls to use in the tub. I figured that it&#x27;s never too early to moisturize and eliminate small scars that they get from scratches and boo boos. They are 7 and 9 and they absolutely love the chocolate scent. They love the lotion, too, but it&#x27;s hard to get little kids put on lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy this on Amazon and purchase it by the case. It&#x27;s cheaper than buying it in the store and we never run out. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Its a great soap for you skin. My daughter loves it.  It has made a difference in her skin. Eliminated the dryness in just a fees applications</li>

            <li> I USE ONLY TWO KINDS OF SOAP FOR AT LEAST 15 YRS.

            <li> Nice soap but it leaves a ring around the tub other than that soap is good. It will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I like this soap a lot....it&#x27;s a good moisturizer and smells good.</li>

            <li> For my daughter who is having a baby.  She loves the scent, She loves how it works on her skin, I Think I&#x27;m getting some for myself.</li>
            <li> I love it I been using this for 3years now</li>
            <li> Best soap ever.  No glycerin goop that forms in the soap container.  Does not dry your skin, smell is subtle and awesome, not perfume-y.  The only soap that I can remotely compare it to is maybe Dove - but better.  I&#x27;d give this five stars but I think the price is a little steep, still cheaper than the store though.</li>
            <li> I have had dry skin for about 4 years now (I&#x27;m 62) and this is really the way to get relief!  I love it!</li>
