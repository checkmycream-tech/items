    <ol>
            <li>I loved and adored this serum!!!!</li>
            <li>love this product and have ordered it three times from this seller and have had wonderful service</li>
            <li>Product was good.</li>
            <li>After having tried it I loved the results and decided to continue using it.</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Expect ,at this price, not to have this kind of issues.  </li>
            <li>If you want your skin to look it&#x27;s best , but the whole line.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but the pump did not have a sraw in the bottom and didnt work this time</li>
            <li>with sunscreen for daytime use, I can&#x27;t order any more &amp;#34;Jeunesse</li>
            <li>The serum squirts out with great force and now tiny tip where the serum comes out</li>
            <li>It was originally given to me as a gift.  </li>
            <li>I expected better results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the real formula.</li>
            <li>The real formula does not do this.</li>
            <li>I will order directly from Jeunesse.</li>
            <li>I compare the original bottle directly from Jeunesse, the Luminesce  letters vary a little bit in size, the print of the  date on the bottom of the bottle is very different.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say if it has done anything yet , only nine days, but the bottle doesn&#x27;t function properly.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> But I only received half of my order.</li>

            <li> Product was good. But I only received half of my order. Would like the other part please</li>
            <li> It was originally given to me as a gift.  After having tried it I loved the results and decided to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I compare the original bottle directly from Jeunesse, the Luminesce  letters vary a little bit in size, the print of the  date on the bottom of the bottle is very different. Even though the price is cheaper, I save on tax and shipping. I will order directly from Jeunesse. You can&#x27;t tell the difference with the content. I feel suspicious!</li>
            <li> I love the product, but the pump did not have a sraw in the bottom and didnt work this time</li>
            <li> love this product and have ordered it three times from this seller and have had wonderful service</li>
            <li> Just started using. Will see how it works with the Instantly Ageless!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  My skin looks faboulus!</li>
            <li> Product never worked.reported it didn&#x27;t get any satisfaction</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say if it has done anything yet , only nine days, but the bottle doesn&#x27;t function properly.  The serum squirts out with great force and now tiny tip where the serum comes out actually popped out.  Expect ,at this price, not to have this kind of issues.  I hope this is a fluke because I have heard this is supposed to be the answer to my aging skin.</li>
            <li> If you want your skin to look it&#x27;s best , but the whole line. It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I loved and adored this serum!!!! After one use, I could tell the difference between my &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; skin!&lt;br /&gt;I had been experiencing a rash for the past year due to extreme stress in my life; I never, ever, thought a serum would help clear up my skin so fast! The only thing I need to do is order the night-time moisturizer, this serum doesn&#x27;t quite add enough moisture to my skin (which, of course, is why they have a night-time moisturizer!).&lt;br /&gt;I had just ordered a &amp;#34;BB Cream&amp;#34; with sunscreen for daytime use, I can&#x27;t order any more &amp;#34;Jeunesse Luminesce&amp;#34; until I use up my day cream. I DO plan to order the night cream, though....this stuff is amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Jeunesse!!!!</li>
            <li> Now on my third bottle and have seen no results. It appears to be making wrinkles deeper. Revitol which I used prior to this had my wrinkles disappearing. Will give it another month that the luminesce consultant suggested. Expensive. I expected better results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real formula. When I apply it, I have shiny silver flakes all over my face. It appears to have a contaminant.  The real formula does not do this.</li>
