            <li> Great massage oil, washes out of linens completely, so there is no rancid smell. Unscented, mostly jojoba oil with some plant esters for dissolving oil in water. Never had a reaction from a client in 14 years! Nice glide, warms nicely but with enough grab for petrissage and friction. LOVE IT.</li>

            <li> Just the right glide for therapeutic work. Doesn&#x27;t get &amp;quot;Tacky&amp;quot; like some oils. Washes out of linens well. I have been using this product, nearly exclusively, for almost 20 years.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite massage oil: light, non greasy and washes out easily from sheets and clothing. It&#x27;s the only oil I don&#x27;t feel compelled to wash off immediately when used on me.  For me it works equally well on long strokes and deep tissue.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that ghis product glides very well....and does not stain clothing and linens..The oil arrived a day earlier than projected. :)</li>
            <li> Best massage oil on the market! TOO PRICEY but you get what you pay for! Perfect amount of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34;. No buildup on skin like other oils and creams!. I&#x27;ve seen absolutley NO ALLERGIES EVER! Even on family who said they WERE allergic to some of the ingredients. Yes, I used my family instead of clients as guinea pigs! I&#x27;m spoiled forever!</li>
            <li> Reliable product used by me for many years. The only oil that is truly water soluble, extending the life of linens and client&#x27;s clothing. The hypoallergenic feature is appreciated by client base.Highly recommended for use by all professionals.</li>
            <li> The ONLY massage oil I use!  Nice feel to the hands and washes out of sheets effortlessly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and great seller!</li>
            <li> I have been a massage therapist for 20yrs. Clear results massage oil is by far the BEST product on the market! It has a water base so the oil doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets, towels or cloths &amp; there is absolutely no oil residue left on any of&lt;br /&gt;the linens so everthing smells fresh after every wash, saving me $$ not having to buy new sheets &amp; towels every six months. Every other oil i have ever used would leave a residue of oil in the sheets causing them to smell after many uses.</li>
            <li> Great product have used for years. Best buy was the free shipping</li>
            <li> Love it but too big to handle and I couldn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;faucet&amp;#34; I bought to work right - too messy - so gave it to my massage therapist!</li>
            <li> As far as massage oils go, this one perhaps should rate as the number one best oil in the industry. There are no downsides to this oil. It washes out of the sheets without a trace, no scent, perfect glide characteristics and my clients love it. There is no reason to not use this oil. I have been in the massage business for over thirty years, and have yet to find an oil the exceeds the quality of this one.</li>
            <li> This is the best oil. Leaves your client feeling clean instead of greasy. The best of both worlds aloe vera &amp; jojoba oil together.</li>
            <li> I bought $250 worth of new sheets.  Used this product, and ALL of my sheets were stained.  I have been in the massage business since 1998 and have used coconut oil in the past with no problems.  I thought with the new sheets, why not get this oil.  Nope, big mistake.  I contacted Biotone and they would not accept the return after 2 emails with them.  Trying to deal with the people that sold it was difficult.  I will NEVER buy biotone again.  Back to Best of Nature for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m particularly happy with this purchase.  The packaging was the right size and the gallon itself was wrapped up tightly in plastic to prevent oil from leaking all over the box it came in.  Along with the little pump piece I bought for this gallon, it makes dispencing oil into smaller containers a lot easier.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I&#x27;ve used clear results for over 5 years and I find that this oil works great for all body types.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, good price for the highest quality, washes clean out of linens, jojoba and aloe moisturize nicely and mix well with essentials. Glide is perfect for light to deep work.</li>
            <li> I could not find this product available on line before without a lbusiness license. I love the oil! Keep it as an item!</li>
            <li> my laundry guy says that my sheets come out cleaner than other massage sheets</li>
            <li> After 27 years of trying different lotions and oils, I find this to be the best one to work with. It&#x27;s nice and light and doesn&#x27;t stain. Glides easily and doesn&#x27;t leave the client feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing massage for about 20 years now and most of that time I&#x27;ve been using the Biotone dual purpose cream which I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with.  However I like to warm up the lubricant I&#x27;m using and with the cream it gets a bit messy so I decided to go back to the oil.  I have one client who developed an allergy to the cream and after switching him to the oil he&#x27;s now fine.  Biotone is a really good company and they use good ingredients. They are a bit pricey, but I found out that when I use the cheap stuff I end up using more of it which balances out in the end so why not just use the best?</li>
            <li> This is awesome for massage and its easier to get out of the sheet.  No greasy feeling after applied.</li>
