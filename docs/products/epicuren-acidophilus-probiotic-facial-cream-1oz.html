            <li>My sister is an esthetician and she suggested putting it in the fridge, VERY GOOD IDEA!   </li>
            <li>Excellent cream for clearing skin of blemishes and rashes.</li>
            <li>If you have a Clara sonic, perfect.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every product out there, but this stuff is the best.</li>
            <li>Even if you have perfect skin and just want your skin to glow and get the nutrients it needs</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that this product arrived promptly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great when you start</li>
            <li>Amazing progress!</li>
            <li>Amazing results for my acne!  </li>
            <li>Amazing product!  </li>
            <li>These two products make my combination/oily, acne prone skin look and feel so much better!  </li>
            <li>Love Epicuren, used them for years!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, non greasy and really a great moisturizer for any type of skin.</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>I did not see any improvement, but it is a nice cream and whatever probiotic face cream is supposed to improve I don&#x27;t know, but if you want a nice, light cream I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be happy with this.</li>
            <li>One consideration for anyone trying these treats for the first time:  Use a good sunscreen!</li>
            <li>This was a great price and the real deal!</li>
            <li>Good price and quick shipment.</li>
            <li>During the summer when it is warm where I live this is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Smelled nice and was fine as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I combine the two, seems a better benefit.  </li>
            <li>May not work for everyone, since most of us have differences in our skin.  </li>
            <li>I love Epicuren products.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i use to love this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive, congested oily skin.</li>
            <li>(I sound like I work for them...</li>
            <li>While it is paraben-free, it is not fragrance free.</li>
            <li>and it appears to be glowing and smooth already.</li>
            <li>good product; wish it was in a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>Try not to \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; your face if using a washcloth, more gentle circular motions.  </li>
            <li>I eat well and use all natural products, make some of my own, and my acne has cleared quite a bit...  </li>
            <li>I hope this lasts and isn&#x27;t just a lucky coincidence, but I recommend everyone give it a shot.</li>
            <li>After a few days of using the sample my face seemed to look great and decided to order some.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many, many other high-end products...</li>
            <li>it was recommended to me when i had my first facial, and i love it!</li>
            <li>Super Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li>They give my skin a nice, soft, healthy, pink and dewy glow.  </li>
            <li>This facial cream came with the Epicuran Acne kit that I got here on Amazon, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Try out the 1 oz first and see if you like it.  </li>
            <li>Be prepared that it doesn&#x27;t smell pretty...</li>
            <li>Nothing compares to this probiotic face cream except my other favorite product-- epicuren discovery glycolic 10% lotion!  </li>
            <li>then you really should try this!</li>
            <li>Maybe this will work for a few of you, good luck.</li>
            <li>If it helps, I have skin more on the oily side, olive complexion and of Italian decent.</li>
            <li>full add a little water and roll into a ball (best way I found at least).  </li>
            <li>The good news is that is wasn&#x27;t fake, familiar enough with it to know better.  </li>
            <li>I am acne prone and very cautious about what I put on my face.  </li>
            <li>I also wash my whole body with this.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>:)  I highly recommend this product for anyone with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>it helped w cystic acne quicker than many other products.  </li>
            <li>They are a bit pricey, but worth every penny, especially when compared to the cost of having a series of professional facials.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just enough to keep my skin from drying out and it&#x27;s light enough that is doesn&#x27;t get greasy.</li>
            <li>I apply a hot wash cloth to my face (as hot as you can stand) to open my pores prior.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps my moderate acne.</li>
            <li>but I am encouraged thus far.  </li>
            <li>but at first, I felt like it didn&#x27;t moisturize my face and my face felt dry.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Epicuren Clarify Cleanser and Epicuren Acidophilus Probiotic Facial Cream because I have congested, acne prone, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I developed a burning itching rash with white bumps everywhere.</li>
            <li>(IMO)-- Epicuren is a professional facial TREATMENT.  </li>
            <li>I used this for over a month and did not notice a change in my breakouts, for better or for worse.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My esthetician, whom I trust with..well, my face, gave me a sample of this after a facial. I believe in the benefits of probiotics for my health and figured that could include my face. After a few days of using the sample my face seemed to look great and decided to order some.  I am acne prone and very cautious about what I put on my face.  I actually read a review from product guru Paula Begoun warning those who are acne prone NOT to use this product. I dismissed her advice and continued to use it.  Big mistake.  It clogged all of my pores and have been paying for it for the past month.</li>
            <li> good product; wish it was in a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> This facial cream came with the Epicuran Acne kit that I got here on Amazon, and I love it. This product moisturizes my skin like nothing else, without clogging my pores or making me look greasy. It soothes and hydrates and lets my skin breathe. I know that everytime I am putting this on my skin, it&#x27;s helping it out, not making it worse. My sister is an esthetician and she suggested putting it in the fridge, VERY GOOD IDEA!   Anyone dealing with acne NEEDS to try this and check out the Epicuran Acne Kit that is also here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My face was so dry due to my acne cream I was using.  I used this and Dr. Ohirra&#x27;s probiotic soap and my face was smoothed overnight.  :)  I highly recommend this product for anyone with dry skin.  Try out the 1 oz first and see if you like it.  I just reordered and got the 4 oz.  This is a facial cream I know I will be using for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Epicuren Clarify Cleanser and Epicuren Acidophilus Probiotic Facial Cream because I have congested, acne prone, sensitive skin.  After 2 days of only using these two products on my face I developed a burning itching rash with white bumps everywhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to keep rosacea under control. I did not see any improvement, but it is a nice cream and whatever probiotic face cream is supposed to improve I don&#x27;t know, but if you want a nice, light cream I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be happy with this.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream for clearing skin of blemishes and rashes. This is an edit after a year or so. Took a break from this cream. Went back. It&#x27;s still amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Epicuren line with a spa I occasionally attend... because the spa is located in a place that caters to tourists, their pricing is ridiculous... was a little concerned with ordering through here, a couple of prior reviews mentioned a fake product (I am a Prime Member and tend to pay attention to what Amazon fulfills).  Anyway, because was about 1/2 the price of the spa I took a shot.  The good news is that is wasn&#x27;t fake, familiar enough with it to know better.  A little goes a very long way, so pay attention to old habits formed with the local drug store products. I appreciate waking up in the morning and my face doesn&#x27;t feel like an oil slick.  About 3 years ago hormonal acne decided to take up residence on my face and décolletage area... 2 weeks out of the month I lost my mind trying to head off the \\&quot;possession.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a small fortune of experimenting with every product you can imagine, what works for me:  Shea Terra African Black Soap in the morning and evening.  Try not to \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; your face if using a washcloth, more gentle circular motions.  If you have a Clara sonic, perfect.  Again, a little goes a long way.  I give my skin a minute to catch up, let it settle for a bit then I apply the Epicuren Probiotic cream.  A couple of times a week I use Origins 10 minute mask and Epicuren&#x27;s Volcanic Clay Mask.  I combine the two, seems a better benefit.  I apply a hot wash cloth to my face (as hot as you can stand) to open my pores prior.  Use the African Black soap to wash it off... if you use Shea Terra&#x27;s African Black Soap in it&#x27;s pure form, be ready for a mess but this is how I use it.  I keep a jar in the shower, take a spoon full add a little water and roll into a ball (best way I found at least).  I also keep a ball in the soap dish by the bathroom sink for the evening face ritual.  I also wash my whole body with this.  Be prepared that it doesn&#x27;t smell pretty... I use an exfoliating body brush with it.  The smell doesn&#x27;t last and use abetter smelling body wash for shaving, a trade off.  May not work for everyone, since most of us have differences in our skin.  If it helps, I have skin more on the oily side, olive complexion and of Italian decent. Maybe this will work for a few of you, good luck.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that this product arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I love Epicuren products.  They are a bit pricey, but worth every penny, especially when compared to the cost of having a series of professional facials.  Nothing compares to this probiotic face cream except my other favorite product-- epicuren discovery glycolic 10% lotion!  I have tried many, many other high-end products...the difference is this (IMO)-- Epicuren is a professional facial TREATMENT.  These two products make my combination/oily, acne prone skin look and feel so much better!  And for those of you with other complexion issues, epicuren has a complete line of products for all skin types. (I sound like I work for them...I wish!)  They give my skin a nice, soft, healthy, pink and dewy glow.  I wish I could also afford to try the mid-size facial kit... some day.  One consideration for anyone trying these treats for the first time:  Use a good sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Super Fast Delivery! Love Epicuren, used them for years!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product through my facialist. She gave me a sample and I ended up buying a larger bottle. During the summer when it is warm where I live this is a great moisturizer. It&#x27;s just enough to keep my skin from drying out and it&#x27;s light enough that is doesn&#x27;t get greasy. I use this in combination with the Acidophilus Probiotic mask once a month and it really helps my moderate acne. In the winter I have to switch to a different product as this is not enough to protect the skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> After about the third application my face broke out in hives.</li>
            <li> Amazing progress! it helped w cystic acne quicker than many other products.  I use it once a day and have seen improvement in one week.</li>
            <li> works wonders, and helps prevent breakouts. it was recommended to me when i had my first facial, and i love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! I typically buy this at the spa and they charge $22 for the small one. This was a great price and the real deal! It&#x27;s light weight, non greasy and really a great moisturizer for any type of skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this products for 2 months now. I really like it but at first, I felt like it didn&#x27;t moisturize my face and my face felt dry. My esthetician suggested I add the moisture surge product to this cream and it helped a lot. I will continue buying this product but will use it with the moisture surge cream.</li>
            <li> I used this for over a month and did not notice a change in my breakouts, for better or for worse.  While it is paraben-free, it is not fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with cystic acne under my jaw for almost a year. I was a little worried about some of the claims on here but I had nothing to lose and having tried everything else I decided to give it a shot. In under a week my cysts that hadn&#x27;t gone away for weeks were flattening out, it&#x27;s over a week now and it appears to be glowing and smooth already. I don&#x27;t even feel the need for makeup.  I hope this lasts and isn&#x27;t just a lucky coincidence, but I recommend everyone give it a shot. As for the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; claims I received mine sealed and in tact.</li>
            <li> Amazing results for my acne!  I eat well and use all natural products, make some of my own, and my acne has cleared quite a bit...  but with this added product it is GONE!  Amazing product!  Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only begun to use this so I do not know the final results but I am encouraged thus far.  Good price and quick shipment.</li>
            <li> i use to love this product but lately it&#x27;s too drying for my skin. i thought it helped with breakout but lately it isn&#x27;t helping me out with that. i find with epicuren, it&#x27;s great when you start but then it dies off &amp; i find the products just so so now. i am looking for other skincare now.</li>
            <li> This was overpriced and didn&#x27;t help my acne. Smelled nice and was fine as a moisturizer. But I would not purchasd again.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing. I&#x27;m 19 and have been fighting acne for about a year now. I have tried just about every product out there, but this stuff is the best. I work at a spa that sells Epicuren products so I decided to try a bunch of them. I use this cream at night and the Botanical Elixer in the morning, and my skin has visibly become less red and less irritated. My skin just feels healthier after I apply this stuff and I can even feel a difference throughout the day too. It&#x27;s great for sensitive, congested oily skin. Even if you have perfect skin and just want your skin to glow and get the nutrients it needs then you really should try this!</li>
