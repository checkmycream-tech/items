            <li> This is the only thermometer that I have used so I cannot compare it to any other</li>
            <li> Due to its extreme taper and weighty display/battery end, this thermometer tends to slip out of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> It read a little lower than expected.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s off a few degrees and so completely unusable to know if your sick or not.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have at least one in the house.  </li>
            <li> - Sometimes I look forward to getting sick just so I could use this my fancy digital thermometer!!</li>
            <li> The thermometer is not great quality.</li>
            <li> IT IS MUCH LESS THAN WORTHLESS.</li>
            <li> We tried this thermometer and it never worked (turned on, but always very wrong temp).  </li>
            <li> sick days.</li>
            <li> THIS AWFUL ITEM  HAS NEVER WORKED, NOT EVEN ONCE.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Has a hole where the switch is located.&lt;br /&gt;I measured a low temperature with it and compared it to a vicks thermometer with a color dial and it was off some. It read a little lower than expected. Should be 98.6 and it was lower than that like 98.3 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice case that it comes in but the top doesn&#x27;t really click or falls off. Is a cheaper thermometer. The item I see in the picture doesn&#x27;t have the switch near the display where as mine does. The switch can let water in if you go to rinse it after a use. That is one feature I did not like so much.</li>
            <li> THIS AWFUL ITEM  HAS NEVER WORKED, NOT EVEN ONCE. IT SHOWS MY TEMPERATURE AS 96 OR 97  AND NEVER CLOSE TO 98.6. MY TEMPERATURE IS NOT NORMALLY LOW.  I WISH I COULD RETURN IT WITHOUT SO MUCH TROUBLE. IT IS MUCH LESS THAN WORTHLESS.</li>
            <li> it gives a beep when it is ready to be used. then when it is finished reading your temperature (takes in about a minute or under) it beeps again telling you that it is finished. This is the only thermometer that I have used so I cannot compare it to any other but it is surprisingly easy to use. It has one button which turns it on as well as off. I think that it is pretty simple to use but then this is the only thermometer that I have experience with</li>
            <li> Thermometer great... the beeps are good, as sometimes you kinda fall asleep again with the thing in your mouth. Would have been better if the display glowed in the dark, but the memory works fine for this - if you want to roll over and go back to sleep the last reading is there when you turn it on again.    Working fine so far!</li>
            <li> We tried this thermometer and it never worked (turned on, but always very wrong temp).  Have not had time to ask for money back from company.</li>
            <li> Item is identical to $10+ models you can purchase at a drug store. Fantastic value. Only complaint is that it arrived 2 weeks late.</li>
            <li> The service from the seller was great. The thermometer is not great quality. It takes anywhere from 2 min to over 5 minutes to get a temperature reading.</li>
            <li> Used it about 7 times, after which it broke. No charge left I suppose.</li>
            <li> It worked for the first two uses when I had a temperature (or so I think).  Now shows my temp as 95 or 96 degrees.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the Product. It worked fast and was able to read the temp of me and my son. Handy to have and for a great value. I checked everywhere even walmart and found this the be the best price even with shipping and handling. I also like to keep one handy. My last one no longer worked and I needed one right away they shipped fast and I was ever so glad to get the one. I usually do not do reviews but I felt this one was worth it. Great value, Great price, Great product.</li>
            <li> This excellent product has impressed all who saw or Try it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; God willing, will be asking for more of it&lt;br /&gt; In the coming period</li>
            <li> I got this for a doctor kit I made for my 9 year old doctor to be. It was exactly as described an came quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s off a few degrees and so completely unusable to know if your sick or not. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> My daughter says it works, so I&#x27;ll just say as long as it&#x27;s accurate, I can&#x27;t complain and the price was okay</li>
            <li> I am happy to have this addition to my medicine chest.   Works great.  Does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Its a cheap thermometer and does what its supposed to, what else is there to say.</li>
            <li> Works fine and seems to be accurate. I compared it to a unit we use in the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;Good deal for the low price I paid.</li>
            <li> Always Need a new one handy</li>
            <li> Fun and easy - Sometimes I look forward to getting sick just so I could use this my fancy digital thermometer!!</li>
            <li> Reads lower temperature than actual.  In process of returning.</li>
            <li> i use it for my toddler..and its perfect.&lt;br /&gt;no issues till now..&lt;br /&gt;a must for your lill ones sick days.</li>
            <li> I just love it.  Everyone should have at least one in the house.  Easy to monitor one&#x27;s own temperature at any time.</li>
            <li> This item works well. I always check everyone in my house hold&#x27;s temperature under their arm. Then, I add a degree. This worked well for that :-)</li>
            <li> It does what a thermometer is suppose to do lol&lt;br /&gt;All though it looks antique in all reality but whatever it&#x27; gets the job done n good price</li>
            <li> Due to its extreme taper and weighty display/battery end, this thermometer tends to slip out of your mouth.  If you don&#x27;t want to hold it in place with your hand, it takes some gymnastics with your tongue to keep it properly positioned.  Harder to use than the old fashioned glass/mercury thermometers.</li>
