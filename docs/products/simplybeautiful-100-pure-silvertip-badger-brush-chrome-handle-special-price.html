    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>He states that this is the best shaving brush he has tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>Also a very good price for an entry-level, machine made silvertip badger brush.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is beautiful, but the bristles came out within three days of use.</li>
            <li>Great brush</li>
            <li>That said, the handle is attractive and feels great in the hand.  </li>
            <li>For the money this is great, lathers the soap and on the face</li>
            <li>Oh, and the price is great, too.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush at a great price.</li>
            <li>and this was very nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality</li>
            <li>It is the perfect weight and fits nicely in most razor/brush stands.  </li>
            <li>Feels good on my face.  </li>
            <li>I am proud to own it.</li>
            <li>produces a good lather with either cream or soap.</li>
            <li>would it be any good?  </li>
            <li>For the price, it is a great value and matches my chrome shave set nicely.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and always contributes, greatly, to a superior shave.</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied with this brush.  </li>
            <li>I waited for a couple of months before I gave a fair and honest review</li>
            <li>I think this is a good brush which has a nice size and weight.</li>
            <li>The bristles soften nicely in warm water to produce nice lather.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice looking shaving brush</li>
            <li>It retains water very well and is excellent at making lather.  </li>
            <li>Metal handle is nice and has some heft.</li>
            <li>Well, I am one happy guy with this sweet brush.  </li>
            <li>No hairs falling out, dries quickly and feels great.  </li>
            <li>The brush creates a strong lather and can hold a good amount.</li>
            <li>Let me first say that this is a beautiful looking brush.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what the world&#x27;s best brush would feel like, and I don&#x27;t have any good basis of comparison, but I know that you need a shaving brush to shave old school.</li>
            <li>However; I&#x27;m now noticing that with each shave, I&#x27;m losing about 10 bristles or more.  </li>
            <li>I had to use an epoxy to hold brush in handle before being able to use it.</li>
            <li>I received the brush on time and have been pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Pony up and go for a better one.</li>
            <li>Guess its time to go ahead and purchase better quality.</li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>but he won&#x27;t be able to use it after this one time.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had it for a month now and love it.</li>
            <li>This brush performs better than it looks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using mine for almost a year now and the knot has not come out, and at most it has lost maybe a dozen hairs, leaving ME extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>But it is softer, and it has become my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of it on my face.</li>
            <li>it holds a lot more water and lather.</li>
            <li>Fabricator, please use good glue or epoxy to set hair portion right into handle.</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s pretty, and the bristles feel good on my face.</li>
            <li>The first was a lower grade of badger and I loved it.</li>
            <li>but it retains water really well and is still a pleasant brush to use.  </li>
            <li>If the unit had better construction I would be able to give it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li>and though I am sure the manufacture had to clean the product before assembly.  </li>
            <li>While this brush is beautiful, I guess the old saying, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for,&amp;#34; rings true.</li>
            <li>This is my second Simply Beautiful badger brush.</li>
            <li>Also, while a chrome handle looks nice, it is not well suited to shaving with hot lather.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for your first brush because its not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; but it was a nice upgrade from my escali that I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Just a couple at first, but more and more each day.</li>
            <li>Based on my experience, if someone got a brush that was less than perfect, I would recommend they return for replacement rather than a refund.</li>
            <li>The chrome handle was well machined and has a comfortable weight</li>
            <li>- how can they sell a silvertip for this cheap?  </li>
            <li>The knot in this brush is not bad--soft and quite capable of whipping up a nice lather--but just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li>Cannot believe they were selling these that cheap.  </li>
            <li>Feels soft, works up a good lather.</li>
            <li>This is my original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing is plenty good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Was very excited to get this brush after reading about what good quality it was and especially at the low &amp;#34;special price.&amp;#34; The knot of bristles separated from the handle during the VERY FIRST USE!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to straight razor shaving, but overall i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>the first week I had it was fine</li>
            <li>i recieved the brush on time, looked beautiful and the bristels were inserte into the knot extremely well, but today is the first day i used it and the knot was not put into the handle</li>
            <li>I love the chrome handle and the brush feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>The price is tempting, but the hassle isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>This brush is as good as can be expected for under $40.00.</li>
            <li>There are much more expensive brushes out there, but I would highly recommend this one as an excellent balance of price &amp; quality.</li>
            <li>The Major Difference is how much water it holds and the feel is amazing.</li>
            <li>This brush is extremely affordable,does its&#x27; job well, and feels good on the face.</li>
            <li>However, right out of the box, the hairs all fell out of the brush in one superglued chunk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for a few weeks now and it has been very good so far.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice now, but had an animal smell to it when I got it washed it with shampoo and let it dry and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how a more expensive brush feels and performs, but I&#x27;m happy with this one.  </li>
            <li>It could be the cream as that was the first time I used it,but the brush really made the lather quick and slick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read about how fine the silvertip brushes are but couldn&#x27;t quite see my way clear to spend $100+ for one.  </li>
            <li>Once received and then held and eyeballed this is an exceptional buy, hands down.</li>
            <li>This is my first badger hair brush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to.  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying this brush every second day, but it needs additional work.&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell after the first</li>
            <li>It was soft and the handle holds a comfortable weight</li>
            <li>, My first badger brush</li>
            <li>Like all animal fur brushes it had a smell at first but was gone after about 2 or 3 uses, which it shouldn&#x27;t take longer than that.</li>
            <li>The bristles came out of the handle the first day of use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely a lot more dense than my faux badger brush, so</li>
            <li>so I would like to say that when I first received the brush I was very pleased with the appearance and visible quality of the product so now that I have used this brush for at least 2 months and clean after each use</li>
            <li>The downside is that since some of the hairs are clipped to give it its shape, they&#x27;re kind of sharp against the skin.</li>
            <li>- Positive feedback&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>- Positive feedback&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>- Positive feedback&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>The texture of the bristles were very nice, firm but soft to the face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first real badger brush</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a &#x27;get what you pay for&#x27; deal, which in this case I think is more than fair for the price, but if you want a real &#x27;Silvertip Badger Brush&#x27; experience like everyone talks about, I&#x27;m betting you&#x27;ll need to at least twice as much.</li>
            <li>Had a Van Der Hagen pure badger brush before ordering this.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t poke at your face like the pure hair does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am now in the process of glueing the bristles together, as it has shed a large number each time I shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Advertised as 100% pure silvertip brush, leaves me to wonder, is it pure grade or silvertip grade?</li>
            <li>It is soft yet durable, holds together well (very little shedding), and gives a good consistent lather.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed an odor with the brush as some others have said.  </li>
            <li>and it is so much softer on my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants a step up in performance</li>
            <li>Only lost 1 hair and the knot feels secure.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft when wet and produce abundant lather.</li>
            <li>While I originally wrote a glowing review of this item based on initial use, my review has gone from 5 stars to 4 (for losing some bristles) to 1 star</li>
            <li>He really enjoys using it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This brush is part of my first effort to learn the old way.</li>
            <li>My only other shave brush was a cheaper model Tweezerman and this Simply Beautiful brush so far feels as good and loses about the same or fewer bristles through the course of a week of shaving.</li>
            <li>Used it with Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado Shaving Cream and was the first shave that I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn or nicks.</li>
            <li>I should have saved the money and put a down payment on a better brush.  </li>
            <li>If you soak this brush in hot water prior to shaving the handle gets hot and separates the brush from the handle.</li>
            <li>My next brush will have a wooden handle, and hopefully I&#x27;ll actually be able to count the number of hairs that have fallen out.</li>
            <li>The handle is fairly heavy for its size and feels good in the hand, even with my hands being a little bigger than most.</li>
            <li>Finally decided to spend the money to buy a decent quality brush, and it has been worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The brush also creates a very thick lather which gives my face good protection for the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So with this being said it is a matter of time before the entire bundle will be so depleted it will no longer worth using.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li>No lengthy review just wanted to say this is the gold find on Amazon or anywhere else if you&#x27;re into old fashioned shaving and want to save money!</li>
            <li>The bristles look higher quality than other pure grade brushes I have seen.</li>
            <li>These are just my thoughts and opinions thus far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and plush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and started out with a Col. Conk pure badger brush.  </li>
            <li>Washed a few times with shampoo and shaving soap and the smell is going away pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Usually the alum block tells me that the shave was clean or ruff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the look and feel of the brush, I&#x27;m just not sure how long it will last with the increased pace of bristle loss.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the item about 8 times, because I have been piecing my shaving system together, and was really surprised when it fell apart.</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is that the entire brush head separated from handle on the first day while preparing the brush for first use.</li>
            <li>Too bad; it really is a very nice brush, otherwise.</li>
            <li>Some mentioned that it would have a strange smell which I wasn&#x27;t concerned with that since it does have hair/bristles from a wild animal</li>
            <li>for the bad...the first few shaves I would lose a couple bristles here and there.  </li>
            <li>I have bought other silver tip badger hair brushes from art of shaving and classic shaving in the  150 to 200 dollar price range thinking you get what you pay for</li>

            <li> I read about how fine the silvertip brushes are but couldn&#x27;t quite see my way clear to spend $100+ for one.  </li>
            <li> Once received and then held and eyeballed this is an exceptional buy, hands down.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger hair brush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to.  </li>
            <li> I am enjoying this brush every second day, but it needs additional work.&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell after the first</li>
            <li> It was soft and the handle holds a comfortable weight</li>
            <li> , My first badger brush</li>
            <li> Like all animal fur brushes it had a smell at first but was gone after about 2 or 3 uses, which it shouldn&#x27;t take longer than that.</li>
            <li> The bristles came out of the handle the first day of use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely a lot more dense than my faux badger brush, so</li>
            <li> so I would like to say that when I first received the brush I was very pleased with the appearance and visible quality of the product so now that I have used this brush for at least 2 months and clean after each use</li>
            <li> The downside is that since some of the hairs are clipped to give it its shape, they&#x27;re kind of sharp against the skin.</li>
            <li> - Positive feedback&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> - Positive feedback&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> - Positive feedback&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> The texture of the bristles were very nice, firm but soft to the face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first real badger brush</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a &#x27;get what you pay for&#x27; deal, which in this case I think is more than fair for the price, but if you want a real &#x27;Silvertip Badger Brush&#x27; experience like everyone talks about, I&#x27;m betting you&#x27;ll need to at least twice as much.</li>
            <li> Had a Van Der Hagen pure badger brush before ordering this.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t poke at your face like the pure hair does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am now in the process of glueing the bristles together, as it has shed a large number each time I shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Advertised as 100% pure silvertip brush, leaves me to wonder, is it pure grade or silvertip grade?</li>
            <li> It is soft yet durable, holds together well (very little shedding), and gives a good consistent lather.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed an odor with the brush as some others have said.  </li>
            <li> and it is so much softer on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants a step up in performance</li>
            <li> Only lost 1 hair and the knot feels secure.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft when wet and produce abundant lather.</li>
            <li> While I originally wrote a glowing review of this item based on initial use, my review has gone from 5 stars to 4 (for losing some bristles) to 1 star</li>
            <li> He really enjoys using it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This brush is part of my first effort to learn the old way.</li>
            <li> My only other shave brush was a cheaper model Tweezerman and this Simply Beautiful brush so far feels as good and loses about the same or fewer bristles through the course of a week of shaving.</li>
            <li> Used it with Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado Shaving Cream and was the first shave that I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn or nicks.</li>
            <li> I should have saved the money and put a down payment on a better brush.  </li>
            <li> If you soak this brush in hot water prior to shaving the handle gets hot and separates the brush from the handle.</li>
            <li> My next brush will have a wooden handle, and hopefully I&#x27;ll actually be able to count the number of hairs that have fallen out.</li>
            <li> The handle is fairly heavy for its size and feels good in the hand, even with my hands being a little bigger than most.</li>
            <li> Finally decided to spend the money to buy a decent quality brush, and it has been worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The brush also creates a very thick lather which gives my face good protection for the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So with this being said it is a matter of time before the entire bundle will be so depleted it will no longer worth using.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li> No lengthy review just wanted to say this is the gold find on Amazon or anywhere else if you&#x27;re into old fashioned shaving and want to save money!</li>
            <li> The bristles look higher quality than other pure grade brushes I have seen.</li>
            <li> These are just my thoughts and opinions thus far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and plush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and started out with a Col. Conk pure badger brush.  </li>
            <li> Washed a few times with shampoo and shaving soap and the smell is going away pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Usually the alum block tells me that the shave was clean or ruff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the look and feel of the brush, I&#x27;m just not sure how long it will last with the increased pace of bristle loss.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the item about 8 times, because I have been piecing my shaving system together, and was really surprised when it fell apart.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that the entire brush head separated from handle on the first day while preparing the brush for first use.</li>
            <li> Too bad; it really is a very nice brush, otherwise.</li>
            <li> Some mentioned that it would have a strange smell which I wasn&#x27;t concerned with that since it does have hair/bristles from a wild animal</li>
            <li> for the bad...the first few shaves I would lose a couple bristles here and there.  </li>
            <li> I have bought other silver tip badger hair brushes from art of shaving and classic shaving in the  150 to 200 dollar price range thinking you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Bristle loss has been minimal, only a few in the first shaves.</li>
            <li> I tend to use hard shaving soaps and this brush has too little backbone (very floppy) to really get the job done for me.  </li>
            <li> I have had this brush for less than a month and the brush piece has completely separated from the handle.</li>
            <li> I was able to glue back together and use, but quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> Bought several &amp;#34;cheapies&amp;#34; available in stores, and grew very tired of having the bristles start falling out after 3 or 4 shaves, then becoming completely useless within 5 or 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have lost very few bristles so far, much less than expected which indicates a higher quality.</li>
            <li> If so, it won&#x27;t be long before I have to replace the brush.  </li>
            <li> A bit smaller than expected, but it is silver tip badger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the knot of bristles separated from the handle while I was trying to dry it</li>
            <li> When dry, bristles flare and brush hangs at an angle in brush and razor stand.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spring back to shape after massaging the lather into the face, but it&#x27;s not super floppy.</li>
            <li> So I got less than 3 months use out of a product that should last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> It only shed a little at the beginning</li>
            <li> Bristle loss has been minimal.</li>
            <li> Since I had already thrown away the box, I reglued it and it appears to be holding, but this is not what I expected from a high-priced brush.</li>
            <li> It smaller so it does have a firm feel</li>
            <li> There appears to be a quality control issue with respect to consistency with this manufacturer, as evidenced by the widely differing ratings.  </li>
            <li> The hair binding has also become loose within the metal handle as well, and based on other reviews</li>
            <li> It was easy to fix with some apoxy &amp; resin (similar to how the other reviewer used superglue), but it was still annoying.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it now daily for a month with no more</li>
            <li> Also, like other reviewers the brush came off the handle.  </li>
            <li> Other commenters have compared this brush to $200.00 brushes sold elsewhere</li>
            <li> so cannot hand it down to my son.</li>
            <li> It has a black handle, not the chrome handle pictured.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: The brush separated in less than 3 months.  </li>
            <li> but a little glue solved that</li>
            <li> I loose at least 10-20 before, during, and after each use.  </li>
            <li> I waited few hours and&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> After a few days use the brush started shedding bristles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t fault the producer for this, but soaking the brush in hot water makes it nearly impossible to pick up afterwards, because the handle conducts heat so well.</li>
            <li> After only two uses, the brush segment detached completely from the base.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m reading other reviews of silvertip brushes, I notice that people comment on how their brush has &amp;#34;only lost 2 hairs to date.&amp;#34; Either those reviewers are unobservant, or this brush pales in comparison to a quality silvertip, because this brush loses at least 2 hairs PER SHAVE for me.</li>
            <li> no more smell.  </li>
            <li> Once I had a small bundle of 5 or so come out together with a bond still remaining at their common end.  </li>
            <li> The heat is transferred to the handle which makes it hard to pick up.  </li>
            <li> - Negative feedback</li>
            <li> No big deal but still disappointing.</li>
            <li> This means the individual fibers are releasing from the bond in the base of the handle.  </li>
            <li> Not a great sight.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in such a poorly crafted product.</li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve shaved with the expensive cartridge systems.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m skeptical.</li>
            <li> Bristles smelled bad out of the box.</li>
            <li> Completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> I had to glue the bristle section to the chrome base when I pulled it out of the box.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with this brush.  The bristles soften nicely in warm water to produce nice lather.  Feels good on my face.  Bristle loss has been minimal.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger hair brush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to.  These are just my thoughts and opinions thus far.  I have had this brush for over a month.  Let me first say that this is a beautiful looking brush.  I love the chrome handle and the brush feels very soft.  I have a chrome razor and a chrome stand and this brush looks like it&#x27;s part of a set.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed an odor with the brush as some others have said.  The brush also creates a very thick lather which gives my face good protection for the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad...the first few shaves I would lose a couple bristles here and there.  I was expecting after breaking it in that this would subside.  However; I&#x27;m now noticing that with each shave, I&#x27;m losing about 10 bristles or more.  Some when I&#x27;m creating the lather and some when I&#x27;m applying the lather end up stuck on my face.  I&#x27;m wondering if the bristle loss will continue to increase.  If so, it won&#x27;t be long before I have to replace the brush.  Again, this is my first badger brush, so I&#x27;m not sure if this happens on all brushes or if the more expensive brushes tend to hold the bristles better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the look and feel of the brush, I&#x27;m just not sure how long it will last with the increased pace of bristle loss.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for less than a month and the brush piece has completely separated from the handle. I have only used the item about 8 times, because I have been piecing my shaving system together, and was really surprised when it fell apart. If you soak this brush in hot water prior to shaving the handle gets hot and separates the brush from the handle. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It broke after 2 uses!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband has used this shaving brush daily for a couple of months. He states that this is the best shaving brush he has tried. It is soft yet durable, holds together well (very little shedding), and gives a good consistent lather. He really enjoys using it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve shaved with the expensive cartridge systems. This brush is part of my first effort to learn the old way. I don&#x27;t know exactly what the world&#x27;s best brush would feel like, and I don&#x27;t have any good basis of comparison, but I know that you need a shaving brush to shave old school. This one&#x27;s pretty, and the bristles feel good on my face. This thing is plenty good enough for me. I am proud to own it.</li>
            <li> I like the look a feel of this brush and overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it sheds a bit but it&#x27;s not a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the knot of bristles separated from the handle while I was trying to dry it [-1 start] but a little glue solved that and I&#x27;ve been using it now daily for a month with no more issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will get another one if/when I need to replace it.</li>
            <li> I waited for a couple of months before I gave a fair and honest review so I would like to say that when I first received the brush I was very pleased with the appearance and visible quality of the product so now that I have used this brush for at least 2 months and clean after each use the following is my review:&lt;br /&gt;1) Some mentioned that it would have a strange smell which I wasn&#x27;t concerned with that since it does have hair/bristles from a wild animal and though I am sure the manufacture had to clean the product before assembly.  After using it a couple of times the the smell went away so no worries here.  - Positive feedback&lt;br /&gt;2) The texture of the bristles were very nice, firm but soft to the face. - Positive feedback&lt;br /&gt;3) The chrome handle was well machined and has a comfortable weight and this was very nice. - Positive feedback&lt;br /&gt;4) Now the big problem I have is that during every use and cleaning after I have bristles that slide out beyond the head or yoke of the bristles.  This means the individual fibers are releasing from the bond in the base of the handle.  I loose at least 10-20 before, during, and after each use.  Once I had a small bundle of 5 or so come out together with a bond still remaining at their common end.  So with this being said it is a matter of time before the entire bundle will be so depleted it will no longer worth using.  My expectation for such a brush is to &#x27;outlive&#x27; the owner and I do not think this will happen for me so cannot hand it down to my son. - Negative feedback</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this brush every second day, but it needs additional work.&lt;br /&gt;on the second use brush separated from metal handle, so I used \\&quot;Gorilla\\&quot; epoxy, set in 5 minutes to fill bottom of the handle and put the brush back in. I waited few hours and&lt;br /&gt;From that time on have no problem, but pleasure using this brush. Fabricator, please use good glue or epoxy to set hair portion right into handle.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice now, but had an animal smell to it when I got it washed it with shampoo and let it dry and no more smell.  Also, like other reviewers the brush came off the handle.  I put a couple drops of epoxy in the handle and put the brush back together.  It&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li> i recieved the brush on time, looked beautiful and the bristels were inserte into the knot extremely well, but today is the first day i used it and the knot was not put into the handle well a all it is coming out... and want to know how to do i get another one that is made properly</li>
            <li> I think this is a good brush which has a nice size and weight. produces a good lather with either cream or soap. My biggest complaint is that the entire brush head separated from handle on the first day while preparing the brush for first use. I had to use an epoxy to hold brush in handle before being able to use it. If the unit had better construction I would be able to give it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Its a nice looking shaving brush but it sheds several bristles after every shave now.  I will have to replace it soon.  I will likely go back to an Omega brush which never had this problem.</li>
            <li> I received the brush on time and have been pleased with it. It has a black handle, not the chrome handle pictured. Bristle loss has been minimal, only a few in the first shaves. Bristles are soft when wet and produce abundant lather. When dry, bristles flare and brush hangs at an angle in brush and razor stand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to straight razor shaving, but overall i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. The brush lathers up the soap well and applies it evenly.</li>
            <li> Revised:  I &#x27;ve had this brush now for several months and it sheds every time I use it.  Profusely at that.  It clogs up my sink and leaves badger hair all over my face.  Not a great sight.  Would NOT recommend buying this.  The price is tempting, but the hassle isn&#x27;t worth it.  Pony up and go for a better one.</li>
            <li> While this brush is beautiful, I guess the old saying, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for,&amp;#34; rings true. After a few days use the brush started shedding bristles. Just a couple at first, but more and more each day. Then after two months use the entire brush plug came out of the handle. I can probably glue it back in but suspect that it will just come out again in a month or so. Guess its time to go ahead and purchase better quality. Too bad; it really is a very nice brush, otherwise.</li>
            <li> This brush is extremely affordable,does its&#x27; job well, and feels good on the face. My only other shave brush was a cheaper model Tweezerman and this Simply Beautiful brush so far feels as good and loses about the same or fewer bristles through the course of a week of shaving. The Tweezerman even when stored properly in a shaving stand had the bristles come unglued from the handle about a year in. If this one lasts longer only time will tell.</li>
            <li> This is my original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and started out with a Col. Conk pure badger brush.  It was okay but I kept up on my research and knew I needed a newer brush after two years.  I read about how fine the silvertip brushes are but couldn&#x27;t quite see my way clear to spend $100+ for one.  I kept looking at brushes (not only at Amazon) online.  Then one day this brush showed up in my search and I knew I could afford this one.  I had my trepidations - how can they sell a silvertip for this cheap?  would it be any good?  would it hold up?  Well, I am one happy guy with this sweet brush.  It makes lather well and it is so much softer on my face.  I don&#x27;t know how a more expensive brush feels and performs, but I&#x27;m happy with this one.  No hairs falling out, dries quickly and feels great.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants a step up in performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The brush separated in less than 3 months.  I should have saved the money and put a down payment on a better brush.  It&#x27;s a rip off.  Shame on this company for selling such a brush.</li>
            <li> This is advertised as the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; shaving brush from SimplyBeautiful.  After only two uses, the brush segment detached completely from the base.  The glue must have been ancient.  Since I had already thrown away the box, I reglued it and it appears to be holding, but this is not what I expected from a high-priced brush.</li>
            <li> Was very excited to get this brush after reading about what good quality it was and especially at the low &amp;#34;special price.&amp;#34; The knot of bristles separated from the handle during the VERY FIRST USE!! Very disappointed in such a poorly crafted product. Instantly returned it.</li>
            <li> Once received and then held and eyeballed this is an exceptional buy, hands down. This at Art of Shaving would run in the $200 price range! No lengthy review just wanted to say this is the gold find on Amazon or anywhere else if you&#x27;re into old fashioned shaving and want to save money!</li>
            <li> Great brush I use it every morning to shave.  If you&#x27;re going to buy a shaving brush there is NOTHING like Silver Tipped Badger!</li>
            <li> The brush itself is beautiful, but the bristles came out within three days of use. Absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> The knot in this brush is not bad--soft and quite capable of whipping up a nice lather--but just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  I tend to use hard shaving soaps and this brush has too little backbone (very floppy) to really get the job done for me.  That said, the handle is attractive and feels great in the hand.  It is the perfect weight and fits nicely in most razor/brush stands.  Also a very good price for an entry-level, machine made silvertip badger brush.</li>
            <li> Had a Van Der Hagen pure badger brush before ordering this. The Major Difference is how much water it holds and the feel is amazing. I was worried that this would be a fake.&lt;br /&gt;Below are my observations after using with a 2 day growth and only prepping with proraso preshave:&lt;br /&gt; 1. It didn&#x27;t smell after the first use.&lt;br /&gt; 2. It&#x27;s soft and plush. It doesn&#x27;t spring back to shape after massaging the lather into the face, but it&#x27;s not super floppy. Think memory foam with how it looks.&lt;br /&gt; 3. It smaller so it does have a firm feel but it doesn&#x27;t poke at your face like the pure hair does.&lt;br /&gt; 4. Used it with Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado Shaving Cream and was the first shave that I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn or nicks. Usually the alum block tells me that the shave was clean or ruff. I can say there was no sting when i ran it around my face. It could be the cream as that was the first time I used it,but the brush really made the lather quick and slick.&lt;br /&gt; 5. Only lost 1 hair and the knot feels secure.</li>
            <li> I had to glue the bristle section to the chrome base when I pulled it out of the box. I am now in the process of glueing the bristles together, as it has shed a large number each time I shave.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend another brand!,,</li>
            <li> The hair came out of the handle on 2nd use. I was able to glue back together and use, but quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> A bit smaller than expected, but it is silver tip badger.</li>
            <li> Got it for my bf and after one use the brush fell out. one.use. It was soft and the handle holds a comfortable weight but he won&#x27;t be able to use it after this one time. Completely disappointed. And now I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, My first badger brush so I can&#x27;t compare but I&#x27;ve had it for a month now and love it.</li>
            <li> Feels soft, works up a good lather. However, right out of the box, the hairs all fell out of the brush in one superglued chunk. It was easy to fix with some apoxy &amp; resin (similar to how the other reviewer used superglue), but it was still annoying. As I&#x27;m reading other reviews of silvertip brushes, I notice that people comment on how their brush has &amp;#34;only lost 2 hairs to date.&amp;#34; Either those reviewers are unobservant, or this brush pales in comparison to a quality silvertip, because this brush loses at least 2 hairs PER SHAVE for me. Additionally, the handle of this brush is made of metal, as advertised. I don&#x27;t fault the producer for this, but soaking the brush in hot water makes it nearly impossible to pick up afterwards, because the handle conducts heat so well. My next brush will have a wooden handle, and hopefully I&#x27;ll actually be able to count the number of hairs that have fallen out.</li>
            <li> Spend the money to buy silver tip badger hair shaving brush, you will feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a few weeks now and it has been very good so far. Like all animal fur brushes it had a smell at first but was gone after about 2 or 3 uses, which it shouldn&#x27;t take longer than that. The handle is fairly heavy for its size and feels good in the hand, even with my hands being a little bigger than most. I have lost very few bristles so far, much less than expected which indicates a higher quality. The brush creates a strong lather and can hold a good amount. This is a great product and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a brush.</li>
            <li> Bought several &amp;#34;cheapies&amp;#34; available in stores, and grew very tired of having the bristles start falling out after 3 or 4 shaves, then becoming completely useless within 5 or 6 weeks. Finally decided to spend the money to buy a decent quality brush, and it has been worth every penny. After 4 or 5 months of use, I have seen just one bristle come out. There are much more expensive brushes out there, but I would highly recommend this one as an excellent balance of price &amp; quality.</li>
            <li> This brush performs better than it looks.  It retains water very well and is excellent at making lather.  I have bought other silver tip badger hair brushes from art of shaving and classic shaving in the  150 to 200 dollar price range thinking you get what you pay for but this brush meets all quality brushes for a bargain!</li>
            <li> the first week I had it was fine then the next time I used the hair plug fell out I had to re glue it</li>
            <li> Cannot believe they were selling these that cheap.  On the \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; website you would have to cough up $100+ for a brush close to this quality.  I&#x27;ve been using a badger brush for 40+ years, but this &#x27;silver-tip&#x27; brush beats everything I&#x27;ve ever used.  Would I recommend this to a friend?  I bought a second to give to my son-in-law for his birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/26/13 There appears to be a quality control issue with respect to consistency with this manufacturer, as evidenced by the widely differing ratings.  I&#x27;ve been using mine for almost a year now and the knot has not come out, and at most it has lost maybe a dozen hairs, leaving ME extremely pleased.  Based on my experience, if someone got a brush that was less than perfect, I would recommend they return for replacement rather than a refund.</li>
            <li> For the money this is great, lathers the soap and on the face very well.&lt;br /&gt;The boar smell goes away after 4 or 5 uses.</li>
            <li> Not the softest silver tip badger brush but it retains water really well and is still a pleasant brush to use.  For the price, it is a great value and matches my chrome shave set nicely.</li>
            <li> This is my second Simply Beautiful badger brush. The first was a lower grade of badger and I loved it. This time I decided to go for the Silvetip version. This brush is smaller. But it is softer, and it has become my favorite. I love the feel of it on my face. It lathers well and always contributes, greatly, to a superior shave. It only shed a little at the beginning and I like the weight of the chrome handle. Oh, and the price is great, too.</li>
            <li> Shipping was on time. Metal handle is nice and has some heft. Bristles smelled bad out of the box. Washed a few times with shampoo and shaving soap and the smell is going away pretty fast. The bristles came out of the handle the first day of use. The bristles were still all glued together and I superglued them back into the handle. No big deal but still disappointing. Advertised as 100% pure silvertip brush, leaves me to wonder, is it pure grade or silvertip grade? The bristles look higher quality than other pure grade brushes I have seen. Other commenters have compared this brush to $200.00 brushes sold elsewhere but I&#x27;m skeptical. This brush is as good as can be expected for under $40.00.</li>
            <li> While I originally wrote a glowing review of this item based on initial use, my review has gone from 5 stars to 4 (for losing some bristles) to 1 star (it should be 0!).  The knot fell out of the brush this morning.  I received this item on May 30th 2013 and the knot fell out on August 20th 2012.  So I got less than 3 months use out of a product that should last a lifetime.  Also, while a chrome handle looks nice, it is not well suited to shaving with hot lather.  The heat is transferred to the handle which makes it hard to pick up.  This probably contributed to the knot falling out.  Do not buy!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush at a great price. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for your first brush because its not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; but it was a nice upgrade from my escali that I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Got this for Christmas. It&#x27;s my first real badger brush and it&#x27;s definitely a lot more dense than my faux badger brush, so it holds a lot more water and lather. The downside is that since some of the hairs are clipped to give it its shape, they&#x27;re kind of sharp against the skin. The hair binding has also become loose within the metal handle as well, and based on other reviews it sounds like I&#x27;ll have to re-glue it soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a &#x27;get what you pay for&#x27; deal, which in this case I think is more than fair for the price, but if you want a real &#x27;Silvertip Badger Brush&#x27; experience like everyone talks about, I&#x27;m betting you&#x27;ll need to at least twice as much.</li>
