            <li>Love it, I&#x27;d searched for this product for quite a while and was very happy to find it.</li>
            <li>very best, top of the line to just really good because of a scare of cocamide DEA, which by the way has not been proven to cause cancer.  </li>
            <li>I paid $20 for this set at Ulta and consider it a good purchase.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li>I love the way this stuff smells!  </li>

            <li>It makes my whole bathroom smell wonderful!  </li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and in good shape.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice set: a good sized bottle of both the bath gelee and the body lotion and a dainty little puffball for using in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>First of all, this smells great.</li>
            <li>and then I fell in love with it so</li>
            <li>when it went on sale, I bought two and gifted one to my mother.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&#x27;s gonna love it.</li>
            <li>Still love this product because of the smell, however I wish Californians would keep there nose out of everything.  </li>
            <li>most everything we come into contact these days might be a carcinogen.  </li>
            <li>I love taking a shower with it and use the lotion.  </li>
            <li>I had forgotten how much I love this stuff and will now make it a bath time staple.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than perfumed soap.  </li>

            <li>I had a sample bottle of this product and loved it so much, I ordered the gift set.  </li>
            <li>The scent in the gift set is so strong it is offensive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle to skin and leaves a nice moisturized sheen.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li>The lotion is a genuine bonus at this price.</li>
            <li>Very fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>It is not the clean, earthy, fresh scent that I experienced with the small travel size bottle.  </li>
            <li>So  fresh.</li>
            <li>None of their other fragrances smell as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>shower gel does lose the scent quickly and I can&#x27;t say it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I think the manufacturers of these so called healthy formula body washes were envious of manufacturers  products that people prefer and that sell really well and wanted to clear the playing field.  </li>
            <li>It always reminds me of the first time I used it;  my roommate had some, a gift from her mom, and I used to...</li>
            <li>My nanny gave me my first VitaBath - then called strictly &amp;#34;Badedas&amp;#34; when I was eleven ....</li>
            <li>My husband, my sister, &amp; several friends LOVE THIS PARTICULAR SCENT.</li>

            <li>That would complete the set!!!</li>

            <li>A lot of things break me out because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fresh and well, green.  </li>

            <li> Still the best with a wonderful fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff. Great for aches &amp; pains. Taking a bath in this stuff is so wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s Vitabath and it&#x27;s awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;My mom loves this stuff and then I fell in love with it so when it went on sale, I bought two and gifted one to my mother.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s gonna love it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this Spring Green Vitabath. It arrived very quickly and in good shape. No problems.&lt;br /&gt;The shower gel does lose the scent quickly and I can&#x27;t say it is very moisturizing. The lotion is a little thicker&lt;br /&gt;in consistency than I like, but it seems to hold the scent longer. Very fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;I would wish that Vitabath could somehow increase the moisturizing quality of both products, because they&lt;br /&gt;definitely have a wonderful scent. Would make a nice gift set for adding to a gift basket.</li>
            <li> I had a sample bottle of this product and loved it so much, I ordered the gift set.  The scent in the gift set is so strong it is offensive.  It is not the clean, earthy, fresh scent that I experienced with the small travel size bottle.  I can&#x27;t even use this stuff.  So disappointed</li>
            <li> Still love this product because of the smell, however I wish Californians would keep there nose out of everything.  This product went from&lt;br /&gt;the very best, top of the line to just really good because of a scare of cocamide DEA, which by the way has not been proven to cause cancer.  It states that it may be a carcinogen.....well, guess what.....most everything we come into contact these days might be a carcinogen.  The federal government has not agreed with the state of California test.  Bottom line, this product does not lather like it once did and the color and thickness is not the same.  Vitabath should listen to their customer base and go back to the old formula.  Just don&#x27;t sell it in California.  I think the manufacturers of these so called healthy formula body washes were envious of manufacturers  products that people prefer and that sell really well and wanted to clear the playing field.  Dirty rats.</li>
            <li> I used to use this years and years ago, and for some reason I started thinking about it.  So to Amazon I went, saw it and ordered.  It is just as I remember.  Deliciously delightful still.  I love taking a shower with it and use the lotion.  The fragrance lingers in my bathroom for a while afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.  Yummie!!!!!</li>
            <li> First of all, this smells great. Makes me think of Alpine forests. So  fresh. Lathers great and gives you a feeling of luxury. The lotion is a genuine bonus at this price.</li>
            <li> Great product..great gift&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this as a requested gift for my Sister..she loves the product! I will purchase again</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff smells!  It&#x27;s very fresh and well, green.  It&#x27;s very gentle to skin and leaves a nice moisturized sheen.  It makes my whole bathroom smell wonderful!  It always reminds me of the first time I used it;  my roommate had some, a gift from her mom, and I used to...ahem...help myself to it once in a while.  It takes me back to those heady days when I couldn&#x27;t afford perfume and this gelee was my only &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.  This is a very nice set: a good sized bottle of both the bath gelee and the body lotion and a dainty little puffball for using in the shower.  I paid $20 for this set at Ulta and consider it a good purchase.  I had forgotten how much I love this stuff and will now make it a bath time staple.  I like it better than perfumed soap.  It&#x27;s stronger and the fragrance lasts a long time, especially when layered with the matching lotion.  I definitely recommend this set and Vitabath&#x27;s spring green fragrance in particular.  None of their other fragrances smell as good as this one.  I&#x27;m so glad they&#x27;re still making it!</li>

            <li> Terrific set - great value - Have always loved Vitabath Original Spring Green - both my husband and I love it. Only wish they made an eau de toilette in that fragrance!  This is my 2nd time buying this set.</li>
            <li> Vitabath of any kind you cannot go wrong with. The smell is invigorating and your skin is so soft after your shower. Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  It has a very clean scent to it.  I had also bought the hand cream &amp; body scrub at a local Ulta.  I wish they made a spray scent.  That would complete the set!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, I&#x27;d searched for this product for quite a while and was very happy to find it.</li>
            <li> I love vitabath spring green.  I love the smell.  I love everything about it;</li>
            <li> A lot of things break me out because I have sensitive skin. Surprisingly this isn&#x27;t one of them. It smells great and the lotion is awesome.</li>
            <li> Very old friend !  My nanny gave me my first VitaBath - then called strictly &amp;#34;Badedas&amp;#34; when I was eleven ....uhhhhhh a few years ago.  :-)  The product has never failed to be nice to my skin in pink, blue, purple, lemon, orange and original green scents. Lovely product / lovely results / decent price.  Buy some :-)</li>
            <li> My husband, my sister, &amp; several friends LOVE THIS PARTICULAR SCENT. Will probably get more sets for Valentine&#x27;s Day!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance of Vitabath for myself months ago, so I bought this set of shower gel and lotion for my sisters for Christmas gifts.  After they first used them, they called and said how much they loved them.  Mission accomplished.</li>
