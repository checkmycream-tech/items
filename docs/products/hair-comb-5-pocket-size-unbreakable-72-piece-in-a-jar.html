            <li>Particularly love the quantity.  </li>
            <li>so many combs, i don&#x27;t worry about losing them.</li>

            <li>nice little container of combs perfect</li>
            <li>Over time I&#x27;ll have to balance not getting to use the fine pitch side with the convenience of being able to lose these things as often as I want and</li>
            <li>Certainly for the price, they are a good value.  </li>
            <li>I am using these for a humanitarian project and was concerned that they would break easily.  </li>
            <li>The are strong and unbreakable.</li>
            <li>A little flimsy, but a great deal for the number of combs you get!</li>
            <li>With those swipes the combs fit the bill, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>While they are flexible, they also are flimsy and cheap.  </li>
            <li>I received them yesterday and I am happy to say that they are better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Now he has a long time supply and they are great.</li>
            <li>In fact you might like these better ask they flex nicely in your back pocket</li>
            <li>Excellent, almost the original &amp;#34;Unbreakable&amp;#34;, teeth aren&#x27;t too sharp and they are made of rubber, or very flexible plastic.  </li>
            <li>Normally, the packaging wouldn&#x27;t matter that much, but you really need a good container to hold 72 combs!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell much difference between these and the combs I&#x27;ve paid $1 or more for.</li>
            <li>Some combs are not as good as others in the same pack.</li>
            <li>His other combs were continually breaking and these are great.  </li>
            <li>Excellent value for such a low price.</li>
            <li>It was nice to get so many for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m great at losing combs, and the regular retail on some is rather high, by comparisan.  </li>
            <li>I had to laugh however that the first day after getting them, I found myself without a comb even though I had 72 at home!  </li>
            <li>Was precisely what I was looking for (very flexible, helpful for sitting when carried in rear pants pocket).  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re light and some of them already had a couple teeth bent, but not broken.</li>
            <li>I honestly believed the combs would be longer and that they would have the same tooth grade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size and fits in  my pocket.</li>
            <li>most are a harder nylon, and the teeth break rather easily when carried in a pocket.</li>
            <li>A quick test of this comb leads me to believe that they really are &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>These are great, especially for me that is constantly losing my combs.</li>
            <li>The fine pitch side has excess flash between the teeth, so it tends to pull at my hair more than a better comb, and it is a bit difficult to pull the hair out to clean the comb.  </li>
            <li>These combs were exactly what I was looking for to help fill some health kits for children.</li>
            <li>These combs are exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I use the coarse side more because of this problem.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I would expect</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Love&#x27; em especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Great quality, unbelievable price!</li>
            <li>They are small combs that are a good quality.</li>
            <li>These combs will definitely keep his pocket full!</li>
            <li>It is a high quality but in looking at other combs advertized as &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34; the best deal I&#x27;ve seen is the same price but only for 2 or 3 combs.</li>
            <li>I lose combs at a high rate; here&#x27;s the solution!</li>
            <li>I have had problems with my combs disintegrating in my back pocket, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34; combs near me.</li>
            <li>They are a little scratchy on the ends but no worse then most combs.</li>
            <li>I lose or forget these about once a week, with this I am safe for about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li>Elegant black color goes with almost all outfits and is fashionable without regard to season.  </li>
            <li>Features both small and large spacing, superior to those that only offer one!  </li>
            <li>Clever design works both left and right handed.  </li>
            <li>They are cheap plastic combs as expected.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for anyone who wants a comb made for an adult.</li>
            <li>Success at last!!</li>
            <li>Nice and small,  nicer than anticipated!</li>
            <li>The price was right and the supply should last me forever!</li>
            <li>This large tub of hard rubber combs gives me a lifetime supply............ barring a Mack truck or such kind intrusion.</li>
            <li>so I primarily use the other half which is not always comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have ordered several times and these combs never fail.</li>
            <li>I sent the first order back because the packaging fell apart.</li>
            <li>They are far cheaper by the piece, and work just as well.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommned this product if you are looking for an unbreakable comb at an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li>These are not what I would consider professional quality as they advertised.  </li>
            <li>So far, my husband doesn&#x27;t have any complaints about the combs.  </li>
            <li>and they springs back ready to use.</li>
            <li>You need a comb they work not high quality as the fine end is fine and ends are a little sharp but $10</li>
            <li>The word &amp;#34;Unbreakable&amp;#34; adds a degree of panache normally associated  with more expensive combs.  </li>
            <li>The combs were a little thinner than expected, but they are fine nevertheless.  </li>
            <li>These however still won&#x27;t break, they bend in half and bend right back.</li>

            <li> when i comb with these, their teeth feel a little sharp on my scalp compared to a more expensive comb, but i don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li> These appear to be well-made combs and while I know that I will never use them all, my friends and family will also get new combs so they won&#x27;t be wasted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked a long time for an unbreakable comb.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that I have to file nearly every single one of them between the comb elements as there is usually some plastic between the pieces.</li>
            <li> It lost one star because the bombs are a little scratchy, but that&#x27;s not that big a deal for the quantity and the fact that they last.</li>
            <li> Check them all before you use them or just use the other end only.</li>
            <li> all the time, the kids always seem to loose theirs</li>
            <li> So I bought this jar of combs figuring that even if they broke at least I would have enough to last for a while.</li>
            <li> the combs were exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Other combs I&#x27;ve tried always break off teeth when carried in a pocket</li>
            <li> No more need for specific &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; combs.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer commented, the teeth are sharp on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> This should last him a few years!</li>
            <li> I purchased these because an aging Alzheimer relative constantly loses his hair comb that he likes to keep in his pocket.</li>
            <li> Finally a supply big enough for careless people like me!</li>
            <li> The finer half catches my hair quite often</li>
            <li> I am not sure I can recommend other than the fact that you get a ton of combs, but &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; combs at that.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for quality and comfort get something a little fancier.</li>
            <li> Combs are a bit smaller than I would like, a bit flimsy having broken two in one week, but for the price what can one expect.  </li>
            <li> They arrived in a few days after I ordered them.</li>
            <li> Found that a few swipes with an emery board can mitigate that.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be missing a combs for a while.</li>
            <li> Hubby keeps losing his, and it has become almost impossible to find these particular combs at any discount, department, or drug store...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ridiculous quantity of combs for very little money, but the combs leave something to be desired.  </li>
            <li> Combs worked fine, but the packaging is terrible!</li>
            <li> A little weak, but not too weak.</li>
            <li> They are very tough you can bend them end to touch other end</li>
            <li> The second one is equally bad, but I decided to keep, because I needed the combs.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;packed&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; teeth sometimes pull my hair annoyingly when I am just trying to use the other grade of teeth.</li>
            <li> Painful and annoying!</li>

            <li> Combs are a bit smaller than I would like, a bit flimsy having broken two in one week, but for the price what can one expect.  I will use them and not worry about losing them till they run out and then I will try a different product.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several times and these combs never fail. Customers take these like the wind comes and goes.</li>
            <li> Never knew we needed 72 combs! Hubby keeps losing his, and it has become almost impossible to find these particular combs at any discount, department, or drug store...most are a harder nylon, and the teeth break rather easily when carried in a pocket. So, now we have a lifetime supply of the best comb made! Did give the grandkids several for Easter, tho!!!</li>
            <li> These combs were exactly what I was looking for to help fill some health kits for children. They arrived in a few days after I ordered them.</li>
            <li> Although they say unbreakable on the comb they are not the Unbreakable brand you are thinking of. These however still won&#x27;t break, they bend in half and bend right back. In fact you might like these better ask they flex nicely in your back pocket and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> Excellent value for such a low price. I&#x27;m always losing, misplacing or breaking combs; now, I have plenty on hand.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy, but a great deal for the number of combs you get!</li>
            <li> We have been looking for this type of comb for so long nice quality just what We have been looking for and wonderful price.</li>
            <li> I keep one in my pocket all the time, the kids always seem to loose theirs so I get a this to hopefully keep them from taking my 7 combs. At this price it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> nice little container of combs perfect</li>
            <li> Happy with the quality for what I paid. Can&#x27;t tell much difference between these and the combs I&#x27;ve paid $1 or more for.</li>
            <li> These combs are exactly as described. They are small combs that are a good quality. I ordered these to use at a &amp;#34;Pin-Up&amp;#34; table at my sons 1950s theme wedding. They are perfect! The size is great and the container they come in is perfect to display them. The combs work good and the bristles are spaced perfectly. Couldn&#x27;t get a better quality comb at this price point. I would definitely order these again.</li>
            <li> Donated to Arms Outstretched Ministry for the wounded warriors.</li>
            <li> I am using these for a humanitarian project and was concerned that they would break easily.  I received them yesterday and I am happy to say that they are better than I expected.  The are strong and unbreakable. It was nice to get so many for such a reasonable price. They are going to be just great for our project.</li>
            <li> Nice and small,  nicer than anticipated! Great value!!!</li>
            <li> I have had problems with my combs disintegrating in my back pocket, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34; combs near me. So I bought this jar of combs figuring that even if they broke at least I would have enough to last for a while. I think though that this will be a lifetime supply. It lost one star because the bombs are a little scratchy, but that&#x27;s not that big a deal for the quantity and the fact that they last.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Service</li>
            <li> I purchased these because an aging Alzheimer relative constantly loses his hair comb that he likes to keep in his pocket. These combs will definitely keep his pocket full!</li>
            <li> Great quality, unbelievable price! I leave a box of these at my desk at the office for days when I forget my comb from home! Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  Combs!  Lot&#x27;s of them!  They do the job intended.  Husband keep losing the one he kept in his suit pocket.  Now he will have enough combs to last until retirement. Good price for what you get.</li>
            <li> Great price per comb. The finer half catches my hair quite often so I primarily use the other half which is not always comfortable. I&#x27;ll probably end up investing in a slightly better comb but these will work great for guests or travel purposes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ridiculous quantity of combs for very little money, but the combs leave something to be desired.  The fine pitch side has excess flash between the teeth, so it tends to pull at my hair more than a better comb, and it is a bit difficult to pull the hair out to clean the comb.  I use the coarse side more because of this problem.  Over time I&#x27;ll have to balance not getting to use the fine pitch side with the convenience of being able to lose these things as often as I want and having 71 of them to replace the lost ones.</li>
            <li> Combs worked fine, but the packaging is terrible! I sent the first order back because the packaging fell apart. The second one is equally bad, but I decided to keep, because I needed the combs. Normally, the packaging wouldn&#x27;t matter that much, but you really need a good container to hold 72 combs!</li>
            <li> Lots of combs at great price. Nuf said.</li>
            <li> The combs were a little thinner than expected, but they are fine nevertheless.  Certainly for the price, they are a good value.  I&#x27;m always loosing my combs so believe it or not, I&#x27;ve got them stashed in multiple places, cars, office, my work bag.  I had to laugh however that the first day after getting them, I found myself without a comb even though I had 72 at home!  My wife is still laughing...</li>
            <li> These appear to be well-made combs and while I know that I will never use them all, my friends and family will also get new combs so they won&#x27;t be wasted.</li>
            <li> I honestly believed the combs would be longer and that they would have the same tooth grade. Because of the short length and varying tooth grade it causes inconsistent hair combing. The &amp;#34;packed&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; teeth sometimes pull my hair annoyingly when I am just trying to use the other grade of teeth. I am not sure I can recommend other than the fact that you get a ton of combs, but &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; combs at that.</li>
            <li> I lose or forget these about once a week, with this I am safe for about a year and a half.  They are far cheaper by the piece, and work just as well.  An excellent buy for the money.</li>
            <li> A quick test of this comb leads me to believe that they really are &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34;. I bent the entire comb as well as just the teeth and nothing at all broke off. Other combs I&#x27;ve tried always break off teeth when carried in a pocket but these are not breaking. It is a high quality but in looking at other combs advertized as &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34; the best deal I&#x27;ve seen is the same price but only for 2 or 3 combs. I definitely recommned this product if you are looking for an unbreakable comb at an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li> perfect for our humanitarian project</li>
            <li> Excellent combs.  Features both small and large spacing, superior to those that only offer one!  The word &amp;#34;Unbreakable&amp;#34; adds a degree of panache normally associated  with more expensive combs.  Elegant black color goes with almost all outfits and is fashionable without regard to season.  Clever design works both left and right handed.  No more need for specific &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; combs.</li>
            <li> working well! great value for money!</li>
            <li> This is my husbands rating.  He has looked everywhere for nylon combs.  His other combs were continually breaking and these are great.  Success at last!!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  It&#x27;s just the right size and fits in  my pocket. I&#x27;ve looked a long time for an unbreakable comb. The price was right and the supply should last me forever!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my beard. They are cheap plastic combs as expected. My only issue is that I have to file nearly every single one of them between the comb elements as there is usually some plastic between the pieces.</li>
            <li> Was precisely what I was looking for (very flexible, helpful for sitting when carried in rear pants pocket).  As another reviewer commented, the teeth are sharp on the scalp.  Found that a few swipes with an emery board can mitigate that.  With those swipes the combs fit the bill, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> These are not what I would consider professional quality as they advertised.  While they are flexible, they also are flimsy and cheap.  They also are smaller than I envisioned.  They are ok for kids 8 through 12.  I would not recommend for anyone who wants a comb made for an adult.</li>
            <li> Combs! There good combs!</li>
            <li> I got these to put in sundry bags we plan on donating.  They feel sturdy and should last a while.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I would expect</li>
            <li> Particularly love the quantity.  I lose combs at a high rate; here&#x27;s the solution!</li>
            <li> The product is as advertised.  So far, my husband doesn&#x27;t have any complaints about the combs.  (He&#x27;s the one using them.)  Also, we ordered them around dinner time on a Saturday and they were here the next day--Sunday!  I was amazed!</li>
            <li> Now have enough combs</li>
            <li> Some combs are not as good as others in the same pack. The finer end will grab your hair if they are molded incorrectly. Painful and annoying! Check them all before you use them or just use the other end only. Good thing they give you 72!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be missing a combs for a while. A little weak, but not too weak.</li>
            <li> The container was all cracked when arrived, but needed for a homeless shelter so just gave to them...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Inexpensive but durable combs.</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction.  These are good quality combs.  We ordered them to include in gift bags that are assembled for a Eurasia ministry.</li>
            <li> Finally a supply big enough for careless people like me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m great at losing combs, and the regular retail on some is rather high, by comparisan.  This large tub of hard rubber combs gives me a lifetime supply............ barring a Mack truck or such kind intrusion.</li>
            <li> so many combs, i don&#x27;t worry about losing them. they&#x27;re light and some of them already had a couple teeth bent, but not broken. when i comb with these, their teeth feel a little sharp on my scalp compared to a more expensive comb, but i don&#x27;t really mind. all in all, a good value to always have a comb, but if you&#x27;re looking for quality and comfort get something a little fancier.</li>
            <li> My dad keeps breaking his combs when he sits on them. This should last him a few years!</li>
            <li> Excellent, almost the original &amp;#34;Unbreakable&amp;#34;, teeth aren&#x27;t too sharp and they are made of rubber, or very flexible plastic.  Love&#x27; em especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Good really good price product.</li>
            <li> These are great, especially for me that is constantly losing my combs. I&#x27;m a happy camper.  Great price, good product.</li>
            <li> My husband us always losing his pocket comb. Now he has a long time supply and they are great.</li>
            <li> They are a little scratchy on the ends but no worse then most combs. They are very tough you can bend them end to touch other end and they springs back ready to use. For $10 or so great buy. I probably will not buy them again unless I give some away, how can you lose 72 combs? Will update if I lose 72 combs LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December 2016 have lost around 20 combs one broke, if. You need a comb they work not high quality as the fine end is fine and ends are a little sharp but $10</li>
            <li> the combs were exactly as expected. good quality and very affordable!</li>
            <li> What can you say?  They are combs and they are plentiful and they are where you expect them to be.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, flexible unbreakable. This is a great deal.</li>
