    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was so happy that Amazon had this product!  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>your Oil of Olay products on time, boxed beautifully and at an unbeatable&lt;br /&gt;Price.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt great using the product.  </li>
            <li>The price online was great for what it did.  </li>
            <li>I am a great fan of the Olay Regenerist Eye Serum.</li>
            <li>I think that if you are over 25, this product would be great for you.</li>
            <li>Their products are very effective, but buyer beware.</li>
            <li>If it works on my skin in my lifestyle it is as good as the hype and it does.</li>
            <li>use the Regenerist line almost exclusively now and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>oh so nice to find it</li>
            <li>The product was shipped nicely packaged and in record time.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The cream is very rich, but after 14 days I didn&#x27;t see any kind of difference.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the huge savings!</li>
            <li>Glad that it wasn&#x27;t a lot of money to try it out.</li>
            <li>Make sure you&#x27;re paying for their product and not some tricky marketing scheme.</li>
            <li>I have just completed my 14-day program and am quite pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li>In this day and age most manufacturers have gotten a clue that this is just unacceptable.</li>
            <li>I think the Olay Definity line is much better than this.</li>
            <li>great service fast and correct.</li>
            <li>i will order more items.</li>
            <li>It worked better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>I love the results of this product</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love the regenerist serum</li>
            <li>14 Day Regenerist  is outstanding, truly comparable to any $200 treatment at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I love this product, put then I&#x27;m an Olay girl.</li>
            <li>I have used to product before and love it.  </li>
            <li>Olay has great products for a modest price.</li>
            <li>The process itself was easy, not unlike my already established evening routine of cleaning face and applying cream.</li>
            <li>This was so easy</li>
            <li>and I noticed a huge improvement in the texture and look of my skin.</li>
            <li>To date, it is the only eye cream I have found that does a great job moisturising the eye area without causing an allergic reaction and/or interference with my make</li>
            <li>Olay is a great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This is a great skin treatment,I can&#x27;t find it in the local stores anymore.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Ok, reasonably priced and better than nothing.</li>
            <li>You always are able to put on the right amount, and then toss the tube.</li>
            <li>I think this is an excellent little product!  </li>
            <li>i am very pleased so far .. tell you when 14 days are up</li>
            <li>Firstly, if you have arthritis (I do not), you may find it challenging to extract both the tubes from their holder as well as the cream from the tubes.</li>
            <li>has evened out significantly.  </li>
            <li>For about $20, I have seen a significant difference in skin evenness, firmness, and the softening of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I will deffinetly order it again,makes a hugh difference you will feel and see a difference for the better from the first use .great</li>
            <li>The first night, I used the first tube of Phase 1, really liked it and noticed it had a familiar feel.</li>
            <li>I tend to be kind of miserly with the cream when it&#x27;s in a regular container, but with these tubes I squeeze it all out and end up using more which feels decadent.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my Regenerist products and bought the 14 Day Skin Intervention on faith that it would be as good as the other products I&#x27;d tried.  </li>
            <li>the items were in good condition, and my wife uses this product and many other items from olay.thanks charles</li>
            <li>Having just completed the 14-day treatment, I have nothing to show for it but sticky cheeks and a trashcan full of fussy/gimmicky packaging.  </li>
            <li>Good product and does improve skin condition overall.  </li>
            <li>Commit yourself to the full program before judging as the product changes from one week to the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this product has really made me look SOOOO much better.  </li>
            <li>Loved the way my skin felt in only 3 day.    </li>
            <li>People at work and friends &amp; family asked me if I was in love, getting more sleep or had I been to get a facial.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have seen a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>I am in my 50&#x27;s and my skin looks refreshed and youthful, you will see the results after the first one!</li>
            <li>i have used retina a before and it does a better job exfoliating and clearing up old blemishes.</li>
            <li>A friend actually commented on how nice my skin looked.</li>
            <li>Very much worth the price.</li>
            <li>I am actually thrilled to find a product this nice for such a low cost.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I used it for the right amount of time and didn&#x27;t see any difference.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, the price at Amazon was not excessive.</li>
            <li>came in new packaging, i knew the product from the color and its unique smell.</li>
            <li>I will stick to the original Olay serum, the eye cream and the new OLayX.</li>
            <li>and i used it for the first time, I already see results on my face....</li>
            <li>I KNOW there are creams out there that can do a better job and am presently giving another Olay product a try.</li>
            <li>Awake&#x27;s ($200) 14-day skin renewal programs and Olay&#x27;s is pretty close.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll recycle extra as penance. :)</li>
            <li>This product worked exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>positively minded, I purchased the 14 Day Skin Intervention in hopes of evening out my skin tone and texture</li>
            <li>and I could definitely tell a huge difference after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>My face and neck seemed paler, especially directly after each application.</li>
            <li>After using it as directed for the 14 days, I have to say I really didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth right after applying it at night, but other than that nothing really happened.     </li>
            <li>I have had more immediate and drastic results with other Olay products, like the 7 Signs Serum.  </li>
            <li>So I looked up the ingredients of each on Olay&#x27;s website, and sure enough, THEY HAVE THE EXACT SAME INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, I have been using it every 3 months for the past year and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>but the individual tubes really helped me get the right amount and keep track of the system.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>This treatment was purchased at Amazon and with their outstanding service I received it in a little over 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>i love it so far if anything changes ill be sure to repost a review</li>
            <li>I just completed the second night of using this product, and I have already noticed a marked improvement in my skin tone and laugh lines.</li>
            <li>The product isn&#x27;t too greasy and my skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li>The second faze left my pores enlarged and, I suspect, contributed to a mild acne break out.</li>
            <li>Definitely helped put life back into my face and clear up the fine lines that were starting to form.</li>
            <li>I am a busy mom who often neglects her skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am really surprised nobody else has mentioned the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>While I observed SOME MINIMAL changes, they all took place during the first seven day faze.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s just different dosage than the normal serum???  </li>
            <li>Of course, I didn&#x27;t expect a dramatic transformation, but at least I would have liked to see some sort of improvement in discoloration or fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The second week is when I really started noticing a big difference.  </li>
            <li>However, the change was so minimal I may have been the only one actually aware of it.</li>
            <li>62yrs old, farmer, female, years of work in the Australian sun and yes have used spf etc and always moisturised....</li>
            <li>when going on holidays, takes up no room,the little tubes are nice and small.my cons are, its hard to squeeze the last of the cream out of the tube,and it can,t be found in local stores anymore&#x27;</li>

            <li> when going on holidays, takes up no room,the little tubes are nice and small.my cons are, its hard to squeeze the last of the cream out of the tube,and it can,t be found in local stores anymore&#x27;</li>
            <li> Long story short:  </li>
            <li> was having some problems with consistant dry patches on my cheeks which have cleared up and overall skin tone (color)</li>
            <li> so not sure how much can be done non surgically for middle aged women.</li>
            <li> I have used 4 days of this product so far -- and see a difference in my overall skin tone as well as no more eczema where my glasses hit my eyebrows and the dry skin</li>
            <li> It smells like really bad, stinky, cheap, old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> (I go from oily in the T-zone, to decidedly dry under the chin).</li>
            <li> my skin is no longer dry.</li>
            <li> This care skin line is owned by other very expensive cosmetic lines, and it appears that they have included advanced technology developed by their sister companies.</li>
            <li> I usually like Olay products, but this one was a complete bust.</li>
            <li> Between the sun and the chemicals, my skin got some dark coloration and rough patches, etc.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t looked up the Phase 2 ingredients yet, so I have no idea if it also is a copy of some other product, but I feel duped.</li>
            <li> I would most certainly be disappointed if I had to pay retail price.  </li>
            <li> I know other reviews thought it was over packaged</li>
            <li> I have dark patches on my face due to the hormones of pregnancy and have been trying a number of things to lighten them.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with a daily skin routine</li>
            <li> Softer and less noticeable wrinkles.   </li>
            <li> Pricey - hubby got it for me on Ebay for less -- but I would pay the price again -- and will in three months -- for the improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> also skin did seem firmer, a little lifted.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I put the lotions on everyday for nothing.</li>
            <li> Anyways... waste of money if you are already using the serum.</li>
            <li> I would have been very unhappy if I&#x27;d paid full price for it.</li>
            <li> So, am I not seeing results because the product is bad, or because it&#x27;s the same stuff I&#x27;ve been using but in different packaging??</li>
            <li> Totally recommend the function of the product, however dispensing from the small tubes is difficult to get all the product out.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it has diminished any lines &amp; wrinkles though.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I will purchase &amp; use it again in 3 months.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it made my skin clearer.</li>
            <li> would have given this five stars, but this product like most of Olay&#x27;s has just a shocking amount of packaging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting but nothing happened.</li>
            <li> I am an avid Olay user, but I have to say that this product disappointed me.  </li>
            <li> They are reminiscent of other VERY expensive lifting serums I have used in the past.</li>

            <li> I know, I&#x27;m a sucker.  </li>
            <li> It is bad enough to be trapped in an elevator with that smell but to have the smell on your face all night where you can&#x27;t get away from it is truly awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, I was amazed at the difference on my face.</li>
            <li> I HATE that manufacturers have us pay for product that is going to be wasted!</li>
            <li> The smell of this cream is so bad that I had to wash it off my face just 15 minutes after putting it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in their lack of respect for their customers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a horrible smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> but so far so good. came in new packaging, i knew the product from the color and its unique smell. i am very pleased so far .. tell you when 14 days are up</li>
            <li> I have just completed the 14 day regiment, but haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement with my skin. My skin feels smooth right after applying it at night, but other than that nothing really happened.     I guess it varies from person to person. Glad that it wasn&#x27;t a lot of money to try it out.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I have dark patches on my face due to the hormones of pregnancy and have been trying a number of things to lighten them. This is the first time I have seen a significant improvement. My mother even thought I was wearing foundation when she saw me after using the 14 day skin intervention.     I like the convenience of the 14 individual tubes. You always are able to put on the right amount, and then toss the tube. The product isn&#x27;t too greasy and my skin felt very soft. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I am a distance runner who had to do some rehab in the pool.  Between the sun and the chemicals, my skin got some dark coloration and rough patches, etc.  Having just completed the 14-day treatment, I have nothing to show for it but sticky cheeks and a trashcan full of fussy/gimmicky packaging.  I have had more immediate and drastic results with other Olay products, like the 7 Signs Serum.  I usually like Olay products, but this one was a complete bust.</li>
            <li> Good product and does improve skin condition overall.  Softer and less noticeable wrinkles.   Totally recommend the function of the product, however dispensing from the small tubes is difficult to get all the product out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Regenerist products and bought the 14 Day Skin Intervention on faith that it would be as good as the other products I&#x27;d tried.  The first night, I used the first tube of Phase 1, really liked it and noticed it had a familiar feel. Long story short:  By night 3, I decided that \\&quot;Phase 1\\&quot; felt and smelled suspiciously like the Regenerist Night Recovery Cream. So I looked up the ingredients of each on Olay&#x27;s website, and sure enough, THEY HAVE THE EXACT SAME INGREDIENTS. They&#x27;ve switched the order of a couple of them on the list, so I suppose that allows them to consider them different products.  I haven&#x27;t looked up the Phase 2 ingredients yet, so I have no idea if it also is a copy of some other product, but I feel duped. 7 tubes of \\&quot;Phase 1\\&quot; at .05 oz each &#x3D; .35 oz for about $12.50.  At that price, a 1.7 oz jar of the Night Recovery Cream would cost over $60!!! (listed on Amazon today for $17). Their products are very effective, but buyer beware. Make sure you&#x27;re paying for their product and not some tricky marketing scheme. I&#x27;m really disappointed in their lack of respect for their customers.</li>
            <li> My skin felt great using the product.  I am not sure if it has diminished any lines &amp; wrinkles though.  I am not sure if I will purchase &amp; use it again in 3 months.  I would most certainly be disappointed if I had to pay retail price.  The price online was great for what it did.  But, I am mid 40&#x27;s so not sure how much can be done non surgically for middle aged women.</li>
            <li> The cream in the tubes is the same as the cream in the regular Regenerist containers but more expensive.  Total marketing gimmick, HOWEVER I keep buying these things!  I know, I&#x27;m a sucker.  I tend to be kind of miserly with the cream when it&#x27;s in a regular container, but with these tubes I squeeze it all out and end up using more which feels decadent.</li>
            <li> I just got this last night and i used it for the first time, I already see results on my face....i love it so far if anything changes ill be sure to repost a review</li>
            <li> I am a great fan of the Olay Regenerist Eye Serum. To date, it is the only eye cream I have found that does a great job moisturising the eye area without causing an allergic reaction and/or interference with my make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus positively minded, I purchased the 14 Day Skin Intervention in hopes of evening out my skin tone and texture (I go from oily in the T-zone, to decidedly dry under the chin). The process itself was easy, not unlike my already established evening routine of cleaning face and applying cream. While I observed SOME MINIMAL changes, they all took place during the first seven day faze. My face and neck seemed paler, especially directly after each application. However, the change was so minimal I may have been the only one actually aware of it. The second faze left my pores enlarged and, I suspect, contributed to a mild acne break out. I KNOW there are creams out there that can do a better job and am presently giving another Olay product a try. The 14 Day Skin Intervention did not provide the noticeable level of change I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I did have two issues with the tubes themselves. Firstly, if you have arthritis (I do not), you may find it challenging to extract both the tubes from their holder as well as the cream from the tubes. Each tube is TINY! Secondly, after you squeeze each tube, you can tell there is still plenty of cream remaining on the inside. I used scizzors to get the last bit out and applied it to my hands. I HATE that manufacturers have us pay for product that is going to be wasted! It is my pet peeve!</li>
            <li> my skin is no longer dry. also skin did seem firmer, a little lifted. not sure if it made my skin clearer. my skin wasn&#x27;t exfoliated enough. i might use it again. i have used retina a before and it does a better job exfoliating and clearing up old blemishes. this didn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> The cream is very rich, but after 14 days I didn&#x27;t see any kind of difference. Fortunately, the price at Amazon was not excessive. I would have been very unhappy if I&#x27;d paid full price for it.</li>
            <li> I just completed the second night of using this product, and I have already noticed a marked improvement in my skin tone and laugh lines.</li>
            <li> I have just completed my 14-day program and am quite pleased with the result.  I have used Sisley&#x27;s ($350) and Awake&#x27;s ($200) 14-day skin renewal programs and Olay&#x27;s is pretty close.  At one tenth the price I would say this is definately a bargin.  Commit yourself to the full program before judging as the product changes from one week to the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was having some problems with consistant dry patches on my cheeks which have cleared up and overall skin tone (color) has evened out significantly.  Can&#x27;t say there was a substantial improvement on lines, but a difference none the less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this five stars, but this product like most of Olay&#x27;s has just a shocking amount of packaging.  In this day and age most manufacturers have gotten a clue that this is just unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I am a busy mom who often neglects her skin. This was so easy and I noticed a huge improvement in the texture and look of my skin. A friend actually commented on how nice my skin looked. I am also somewhat acne prone still and this did not break me out at all. I will definitely use this product again. I have a hard time with a daily skin routine but I can remember to do this for 14 days for results like these! I know other reviews thought it was over packaged but the individual tubes really helped me get the right amount and keep track of the system. I&#x27;ll recycle extra as penance. :)</li>
            <li> 62yrs old, farmer, female, years of work in the Australian sun and yes have used spf etc and always moisturised....the wrinkles were, shall I say, embedded.  This cream has worked wonders, the wrinkles are already plumped up and continuing to improve. If it works on my skin in my lifestyle it is as good as the hype and it does.</li>
            <li> Olay is a great product, especially for the price. This care skin line is owned by other very expensive cosmetic lines, and it appears that they have included advanced technology developed by their sister companies. I&#x27;ve only used a couple of them, and they are already firming. They are reminiscent of other VERY expensive lifting serums I have used in the past. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money. I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting but nothing happened. I put the lotions on everyday for nothing.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was underwhelmed by this product.  After using it as directed for the 14 days, I have to say I really didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference in my skin. Of course, I didn&#x27;t expect a dramatic transformation, but at least I would have liked to see some sort of improvement in discoloration or fine lines and wrinkles. I think the Olay Definity line is much better than this. Won&#x27;t be wasting my money on this again.</li>
            <li> I use the Regenerist night cream, which comes in a 1.7 ounce jar, and is a sort of greyish purple color.  Well, I bought this product and each tube appears to have the same greyish purple moisturizer in it.  So, am I not seeing results because the product is bad, or because it&#x27;s the same stuff I&#x27;ve been using but in different packaging??</li>
            <li> great service fast and correct. i will order more items. the items were in good condition, and my wife uses this product and many other items from olay.thanks charles</li>
            <li> I have used 4 days of this product so far -- and see a difference in my overall skin tone as well as no more eczema where my glasses hit my eyebrows and the dry skin I was struggling with by my nose HAS VANISHED!!  I am almost 54 and have always looked younger than my years but this product has really made me look SOOOO much better.  Pricey - hubby got it for me on Ebay for less -- but I would pay the price again -- and will in three months -- for the improvement in my skin.  I think that if you are over 25, this product would be great for you.</li>
            <li> It worked better than I thought it would.  People at work and friends &amp; family asked me if I was in love, getting more sleep or had I been to get a facial.  Very much worth the price.</li>
            <li> I think this is an excellent little product!  For about $20, I have seen a significant difference in skin evenness, firmness, and the softening of wrinkles. By the second day, I noticed my face looked softer with a bit of a glow.  The second week is when I really started noticing a big difference.  I pay a lot of attention to the aging signs, being in my fifties, but I don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars to look younger.  I definitely plan to spend the $20 every three months, again and again.  I am actually thrilled to find a product this nice for such a low cost.</li>
            <li> Ok, reasonably priced and better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I was so happy that Amazon had this product!  I love the results of this product and I bought 3.</li>
            <li> I am an avid Olay user, but I have to say that this product disappointed me.  I used it for the right amount of time and didn&#x27;t see any difference.  Won&#x27;t try it again.  I will stick to the original Olay serum, the eye cream and the new OLayX.</li>
            <li> Cannot get this product on a shelf anymore. When you can its too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Super price and oh so nice to find it here.&lt;br /&gt;Get your Oil of Olay products on time, boxed beautifully and at an unbeatable&lt;br /&gt;Price.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the huge savings!</li>
            <li> I love the regenerist serum and i have been using it forever!  Anyways, I thought this will be something even cooler but... after 14 days and $$ i paid... i don&#x27;t see ANY difference at all!!  I guess it&#x27;s just different dosage than the normal serum???  That&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t tell the diff?  Anyways... waste of money if you are already using the serum.</li>
            <li> The smell of this cream is so bad that I had to wash it off my face just 15 minutes after putting it on. I thought I could manage to soldier through and tolerate it for two weeks but there is no way. It was nauseating me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a horrible smell. It smells like really bad, stinky, cheap, old lady perfume. It is bad enough to be trapped in an elevator with that smell but to have the smell on your face all night where you can&#x27;t get away from it is truly awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really surprised nobody else has mentioned the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> I found the box damaged because one of the vials had leaked and caused the damage and loss of one of the vials.</li>
            <li> This treatment was purchased at Amazon and with their outstanding service I received it in a little over 24 hours.  Olay 14 Day Regenerist  is outstanding, truly comparable to any $200 treatment at a fraction of the cost. I highly recommend it, I have been using it every 3 months for the past year and the results are amazing. I am in my 50&#x27;s and my skin looks refreshed and youthful, you will see the results after the first one!</li>
            <li> Loved the way my skin felt in only 3 day.    The texture of my face was softer than without using the product.  The increased firmness of my skin made my pores look smaller.  I would recommend Olay 14 day Intervention over all of the mid range ($30-$60), non prescription facial treatments. It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as advertised and I could definitely tell a huge difference after 2 weeks. I will be repurchasing every 3 months as they advise because it worked so well.&lt;br /&gt;I use the Regenerist line almost exclusively now and am very pleased with it. Olay has great products for a modest price.</li>
            <li> My skin was looking a little tired from working 2 jobs during the holidays. I decided to try this system to bring some life to my face again. Very easy to use. Just put on every night for 14 days. Definitely helped put life back into my face and clear up the fine lines that were starting to form. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great skin treatment,I can&#x27;t find it in the local stores anymore.I was very happy to find it on amazon.I will deffinetly order it again,makes a hugh difference you will feel and see a difference for the better from the first use .great when going on holidays, takes up no room,the little tubes are nice and small.my cons are, its hard to squeeze the last of the cream out of the tube,and it can,t be found in local stores anymore&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love this product, put then I&#x27;m an Olay girl. Seriously, I was amazed at the difference on my face. I&#x27;ve decided to buy it again after the three months, and to pick one up for my mom too!</li>
            <li> I have used to product before and love it.  Makes my skin look younger in no time.  The product was shipped nicely packaged and in record time.</li>
