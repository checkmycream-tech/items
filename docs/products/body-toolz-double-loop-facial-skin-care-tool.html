            <li>great deal</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li>great tool.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a really great tool.</li>
            <li>This is really a great tool and prevents those nails marks (or cuts) on either side of a zit when you go to squeeze it.  </li>
            <li>Oh, BTW, I did not have to steam my face and have always been praised for my &#x27;great skin&#x27; and am told I look 35 rather than 50.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how great this works.</li>
            <li>and that is a great idea too since you skin will already be saturated.  </li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Great investment when used</li>
            <li>Works best when used after a warm shower when the pores are relaxed.  </li>

            <li>Great product, gets the job done and gets it done well.  </li>
            <li>Both look sides are great for removing blackheads and whiteheads.  </li>

            <li>It was a great deal and im happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am happy I got my order</li>
            <li>So happy to have stumbled across this.</li>
            <li>tool is great.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how amazing this tool was going to work!</li>
            <li>but it is nice to have around for when those days come up that you do!</li>
            <li>great product! :)</li>
            <li>THIS TOOL IS THE MOST AMAZING THING I HAVE COME ACROSS IN MY LIFE!!!!</li>
            <li>but it was perfect for gripping.</li>
            <li>Everyone always says not to use your hands because of bacteria and now that I own this tool, I never even think to use my fingers to pop anything again!</li>
            <li>but I can not seem to get this thing to be effective!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect and couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li>Now I am trying to buy 2 more for safe keeping and it is an add on!!!</li>
            <li>This is perfect and again easy to use.</li>
            <li>Good concept, over done.</li>
            <li>Good for getting the stubborn zits</li>
            <li>Good quality product, removes some of the surface whiteheads.</li>
            <li>This skin care tool was a good price and is a good product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do a good job at all.</li>
            <li>its also good for getting oil out of pores.</li>
            <li>But every time I do it on my nose, it doesn&#x27;t work good.</li>
            <li>Everytime I looked at it, it kinda laughed at me.</li>
            <li>But is good.</li>
            <li>Good pimple and blackhead extraction tool.  </li>
            <li>Good tool to use on face to get rid of blackheads and the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; pimples that occur from time to time.</li>
            <li>He laughed because he claims I don&#x27;t have blackheads/whiteheads</li>
            <li>This tool is definately really good quality</li>
            <li>I used it on my face...not so good.</li>
            <li>good material</li>
            <li>It works good</li>
            <li>Good quality item and</li>
            <li>that good extracting blackheads.</li>
            <li>Good tool for facials.</li>
            <li>Does a good job at what it was designed for.</li>
            <li>Price is good too.</li>
            <li>and I still find myself using this fairly often.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good item made of good materials...</li>
            <li>I do have a good bit of blackheads around my nose</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;m all good.</li>
            <li>quality is good and over all nice.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Which I think is a good thing, prevents scarring.</li>
            <li>This requires a bit more work, but still does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great price and removes blackheads safely</li>
            <li>it just hurts alittle more lol.</li>
            <li>I use it with a magnifying mirror for optimum viewing, and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>it works great, i don&#x27;t have to squeeze or pick at my face any more.</li>
            <li>VERY pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>LOL :)  </li>
            <li>I get them on my nose and was very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>This is a good tool for reaching those hard-to-reach imperfections and removing the ones that don&#x27;t want to cooperate on their own.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!!  </li>
            <li>make sure you steam your pores or soak face in very warm water to facilitate extraction.</li>
            <li>the Ace Fogless Shower Mirror is reaganesque innovative entrepreneur genius I must say!      </li>
            <li>I just got mine yesterday and my skin feels seriously so much better!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this!</li>
            <li>I love this tool!  </li>
            <li>But with this tool (while yes it is smarts) I can reach and get out pimples a lot more effectively than before!</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>This is 100 % better than my fingers!</li>
            <li>Seriously love this tool!</li>
            <li>I love this tool!</li>
            <li>Unexplainably better than using fingers!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to disinfect the loop!  </li>
            <li>I love this tool!</li>
            <li>It works best if you steam your face in the shower first.</li>
            <li>LOVE this tool!</li>
            <li>love this device!</li>
            <li>An amazing tool.</li>
            <li>For about $5, this body tool is an amazingly valuable addition to your health and beauty care.</li>
            <li>great product great price effective for removing extractions easy to clean</li>
            <li>If you have blackheads this tool is amazing.</li>
            <li>Who needs facials when you can have all the products at home and use this amazing tool to extract all the junk from your face?</li>
            <li>Although, if you use it in the shower with silicone on your hand the grips can be quite nice.  </li>
            <li>To be honest when I saw a review that said it didn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li>It is effective in cleaning out my pores.</li>
            <li>Even though I cleaned my skin, sterilzed the tool, etc I found it damaged my skin more than it did any good.</li>
            <li>The mechanics of this thing give it no use for removing any kind of pimple.</li>
            <li>It works really nice.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Seller ships fast, prices are excellent.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you just kind of have to figure it out on your own or research methods elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Effectively removes the gunk from my pores and leaves my skin smoother.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s SOO effective).</li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t come with directions, you must learn on your own.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive and effective</li>
            <li>Ordered this after seeing many good reviews.</li>
            <li>still, for the price its handy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li>It helps remove all kind of blemishes.</li>
            <li>you will get some kind of scarring etc..</li>
            <li>I found that if I use this too frequently, it effectively cleans out the &amp;#34;good oils&amp;#34; in my skin and can lead to dryness and peeling.</li>
            <li>I think it does more harm than good.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using the tool after a warm shower, makes getting rid of blackheads and whiteheads easier.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and handy tool to have</li>
            <li>But I must say this one is more convinient and works good.</li>
            <li>This too is easy to use, was a good price, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very easy tool to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your skin is loosened up from warm water so the tool can do the purging.  </li>
            <li>This worked okay, but it was a hassle and not as effective.</li>
            <li>It is okay, but not as effective as the one I had before.  </li>
            <li>Nice stocking stuffers too :)</li>
            <li>I would go with the Rosallini, which are cheaper and more effective.</li>
            <li>I was adamant about getting them out, but all I did was remove layers of skin (in a perfect circle I might add).</li>
            <li>but it may help you extract your pimples more effectively.</li>
            <li>I liked this better than some name brand products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I always lose these, but I&#x27;m glad to have one handy again for the every so often pesky problem area...</li>
            <li>I guess if I was officially trained in how to use it, but it doesn&#x27;t come with an instruction manual and what seems to be self explanatory doesn&#x27;t seem that much more effective than two index fingers pinching the skin.</li>
            <li>After I caught on to the right pressure, angle and so on, it worked great.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!  </li>
            <li>I use a 7x magnified wall mount mirror in good lighting, and I&#x27;m always amazed at how clean I can get my pores.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product, I received it very quickly and it was in perfect brand new condition.  </li>
            <li>It took me a little while to figure out the best way to use the tool, but when i did, it has been amazing!</li>
            <li>Makes my face very smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as strong as your own fingers.</li>
            <li>It works significantly better.</li>
            <li>Totally amazed at how good this works!!  </li>
            <li>It is OK.  </li>
            <li>love it .its</li>
            <li>I want to 2nd this excellent suggestion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would have prevented many scars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to get one of this tool.  </li>
            <li>Works about as well as using your fingernails, except it hurts more.  </li>
            <li>Better then my hands I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off steaming your face and doing it by hand.</li>
            <li>or you could end up hurting your skin more.</li>
            <li>and I would surely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with a facial hydration system (basically a steamer for your face) and it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li>(the description said nothing about this) but it is not something I&#x27;ll be able to use as a result.  </li>
            <li>Unless your blemishes are the size of a grain of sand, I&#x27;d look for something a bit more substantial.</li>
            <li>I was using those sticky strips but this works much better.</li>
            <li>Also seems more sanitary than using your nails/fingers to remove blackheads/zits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to find something that I don&#x27;t have to worry bout the side effects and long-term effects.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>however I was expecting with all of that some better results.</li>
            <li>We use the skinnier loop as we&#x27;ve found it tends to work better for us.</li>
            <li>It mostly just skims over the skin.</li>
            <li>Fantastic tool!</li>
            <li>Now I just have to buy two more- one for my mom and for another sister.</li>
            <li>I love this tool.</li>
            <li>I plan on using it more</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how many years I&#x27;ve been wrecking the skin on my face by failing to resist the urge to squeeze out pimples and blackheads with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is better than squeezing your face for stubborn blemishes.  </li>
            <li>It works ok, probably would work better if we had more training.</li>
            <li>It hurts and causes more is situation to the skin than just using you fingertips (don&#x27;t use your nails).</li>
            <li>Love this tool</li>
            <li>seeing most of them eliminated.</li>
            <li>maybe it would work better for a teen-ager.</li>
            <li>Tissue paper and your fingers works better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to keep my acne under more control and keep my face looking clearer.</li>
            <li>Even with a great deal of experimentation, this tool yields only a smattering of good results.</li>
            <li>This works OK.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I break out more after I use this</li>
            <li>glad I was able to get this. :)</li>
            <li>I think one would have to get a better tool through a physician in order to better extract blackheads.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>You have better luck getting them with your fingers or a nose strip.</li>
            <li>It definately works better than a bobby pin and much better than my fingernails.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this</li>
            <li>I think I like the circle ones better than the loop</li>
            <li>I might need a bit more practice</li>
            <li>the one I use most when needed.</li>
            <li>Better than digging into you skin with nails trying to remove the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>This comes in handy to help smooth out bumps that don&#x27;t belong, without tearing up my skin.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have a hold through the top not the wire loop.</li>
            <li>so cheap!</li>
            <li>Some needing a bid more pushing pressure than others, but nevertheless its gets them.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Its painless and way better than using you fingers&lt;</li>
            <li>Works much better than using my fingers to pop my zits and pimples.</li>
            <li>Hopefully she has better luck with it.</li>
            <li>Perfect for clearing up blackheads and acne without tearing open the skin or smashing the bacteria under the skin.</li>
            <li>I guess you can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>And it seems much more sanitary than your fingers.</li>
            <li>I think squeezing with the fingers is more damaging.</li>
            <li>Received promptly with Amazon Prime (Love it).</li>
            <li>Huh I love it.</li>
            <li>Find something better if you don&#x27;t want marks</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even describe how in love I am with this product.</li>
            <li>My nose area gets the most gunk to come out.</li>
            <li>But the price was better than anywhere else</li>
            <li>And it will help you feel more confident.</li>
            <li>My teenagers love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I think you may be better off with the circular loops in stead.</li>
            <li>Tool is okay.</li>
            <li>Face looks better and there&#x27;s no scarring.</li>
            <li>This product gets so many things that I don&#x27;t even know are on my face.  </li>
            <li>Since purchasing this tool, I have been using it more often than I thought I would.</li>
            <li>I have used a tool like this before and got better results with a thinner wire than this one.</li>
            <li>This thing does nothing, you are better off cleaning your pores and going that instead of using this mini shovel tonescavate your face.</li>
            <li>This tool really works great.</li>
            <li>My face feels more cleaner and never gets infections now.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I think the more I use it, the better I will be at extracting.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t pop most things, they have to be swollen for it to even work.</li>
            <li>BUT THIS ONE WORKS SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably better then squeezing</li>
            <li>I should have just bought a better face wash.</li>
            <li>It works best if you use it after your facial pores have been opened up...</li>
            <li>your better off with the rosallini eye hole design one( I bought both)</li>
            <li>Not the most glamorous thing to write a review on, but</li>
            <li>This is sturdier and better priced than the one I bought at Sephora (and the loop on that one eventually broke</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried steaming beforehand, but I have better luck getting them out with my fingers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get many zits</li>
            <li>This product does not work, I could use my fingers and get better results.</li>
            <li>and it is way better than using your fingers that have all these germs</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy a better one elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It gets easier the more</li>
            <li>My skin looks better though.  </li>
            <li>Also I would not recommend sliding it across your face because that may cause irritation to the skin and cause more acne or breakouts.</li>
            <li>How often you are able to use it will vary with your skin type.</li>
            <li>I love this tool.</li>
            <li>Im better off just using my aprricot scrub.</li>
            <li>I love this tool.</li>
            <li>o longer have scars and it doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than using my fingers to pop zits.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best for big ones on the surface</li>
            <li>It could be just my skin because I have seen many reviews saying that this product works for them.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t do it every day since I&#x27;m sure it would be damaging to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a better alternative than using your fingernails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work much better than fingers would work.</li>
            <li>If you have to pop or get out zits or blackheads this tool is much more sanitary than using your nails or fingers.</li>
            <li>It is a sturdy item and ok for the price.  </li>
            <li>If you want a more surgical quality item you will need to pay more.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, it works better if I turn the loop around</li>
            <li>; It works much better than having the loop flush with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this is a much better alternative to using my fingernails.</li>
            <li>Good product, easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t leave marks on your face, and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>It allows you to safely blemishes without damaging the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip, doesn&#x27;t puncture my skin, and cleans very easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had to use it once since I got it, but that experience was very successful.</li>
            <li>Anyway,  when after it was done, I used a cutip to clean and washed the tool with warm water.  </li>
            <li>This is nice to keep the item stored and clean.</li>
            <li>to clean with soap and warm water.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you&#x27;ve clean your tools with some rubbing alcohol!  </li>
            <li>They are cheap, easy to use, and effective.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is a nice strong, easy to use and easy to sterilize instrument.  </li>
            <li>but it does work pretty good but does hurt.</li>
            <li>If you use it then, it works pretty darn good.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good at getting the blackheads from the edge of your nose area.  </li>
            <li>Works great as long you know how to use it:)  Love this product!</li>
            <li>The item works great and arrived new as indicated.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s built well and strong but the design of the piece that is used on the pimple should have more of and arch</li>
            <li>I thought that it would easily push out most of my blackheads and pimples on my face, but it just doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>However, it is easy to misuse, and can lead to more problems than it fixes.</li>
            <li>It was priced low and with free shipping made this the best deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Its helping me clean my pores!</li>
            <li>sure to clean the tool before each use with rubbing alcohol or witch hazel also work a lot better if you wash and expoliate your face before use</li>
            <li>This is a very cool tool.</li>
            <li>Be careful and follow procedure and it will work perfectly for you.</li>
            <li>This tool will work better after a nice hot shower or after you steam your face because your pores will be opened up.  </li>
            <li>it works very well with out causing discomfort, its a good quality tool, my son teenager likes it too for acne.</li>
            <li>rarely get whiteheads, so I can&#x27;t write yet on how effective this tool is for removing them.</li>
            <li>It appears to be made of Stainless Steel and has a textured surface where you hold it, which is good for preventing slips.</li>
            <li>The product is very sturdy and priced fairly.</li>
            <li>Good stainless construction.</li>
            <li>Like other people suggest, it works best on skin that is steamed.  </li>
            <li>Before throwing it away I decided to try one more time: press against the skin and glide downward simultaneously and w/ significant pressure.</li>
            <li>What I like best about this tool is I can hold a magnifying mirror in one hand and use the tool in the other hand to remove zits.</li>
            <li>I would probably check out other tools, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to be that great!</li>
            <li>OK, OK, I know it is not supposed to be fun to use this item</li>
            <li>most of the review said that they cannot get the pore clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to grip it.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does not hurt your skin.</li>
            <li>Its sanitary and easy to use</li>
            <li>Then be sure to use some sort of astringent or cleansing pad afterward to clean any bacteria etc.</li>
            <li>I recommend this tool for easy removal of pimples.</li>
            <li>, I was told she found it really easy to extrude the gunk from them.</li>
            <li>Be sure to clean with alcohol after use.</li>
            <li>, pimpling ain&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li>The metal bends to easily.</li>
            <li>I thought with this tool the pimples will be easy to get out and they will not get infected.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to get carried away.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use</li>
            <li>, I was thinking that the wire would bend way to easily under pressure because It reminded me of a paperclip.  </li>
            <li>Cleans easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to cause bleeding, scabs, etc.</li>
            <li>It is strong and durable.</li>
            <li>Pretty hefty steel with a nice chrome finish.</li>
            <li>Good quality, stainless steal makes it easy to clean.</li>
            <li>But it does such a great job getting rid of acne and leaves my face feeling clean after I use it!</li>
            <li>I good inexpensive purchase if you are new to it like me and want to try it out.</li>
            <li>I think the best way is to steam your face with a hot rag and than do it, because your pores are open and you can get the stuff out a lot easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had great skin, not bad, but far from porcelin china.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle tool but it works fine.</li>
            <li>Work fine but hurt sometimes when you apply a lot of pressure</li>
            <li>it works very well, is sturdy and better than squeezing!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>otherwise the puchase was very cheap and worth it.</li>
            <li>I would order 2 of the Body Toolz (and with free shipping</li>
            <li>Worth twice the price for sure.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t worth more than $2, $8 is a scam.</li>
            <li>I would not even order this if it were free.</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight and made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li>But overall for the price it was great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for the price and its a lot better than using your fingers to get rid of blemishes.</li>
            <li>This skin care tool works well, but it seems to be made from a relatively cheap metal.  </li>
            <li>It is great for getting white heads popped without creating a cut/scar.</li>
            <li>-lol- just the same as I feel about my tweezers.</li>
            <li>Overall great product and</li>
            <li>It is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>bought 3 of these from the seller \\&quot;loveotc\\&quot; at $4.38 a piece with free shipping.</li>
            <li>It does not feel all that comfortable while trying to get it  perform.</li>
            <li>Yes, there will be pain depending on location but this tool is far more agile and gives you more attempts than your fingers will.</li>
            <li>Meh, it was cheap</li>
            <li>All in all this tool is great for home facial use.</li>
            <li>Steaming your face IS important, and it helps to have someone else do it.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>This is important.  </li>
            <li>Great tool to get blackheads and white heads out.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean with alcohol.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really cheap compared to some acne tools I have seen for 12 bucks</li>
            <li>I have great skin, and my husband even used it on a couple spots on my back and said he got tons of gook out of there.  </li>
            <li>and the whole thing, how satisfying. :)</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried to used it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t work that good...</li>
            <li>At first I was not getting good results, so I decided to use a hot compress.</li>
            <li>i would watch youtube videos as well to make sure you do it the right way</li>
            <li>AMAZON- sell it straight up.!!!</li>
            <li>This really works!!!</li>
            <li>Very effective in removing blackheads and whiteheads, especially if you jus got out of the shower.</li>
            <li>This is a very useful tool for getting out stubborn blackheads on your nose and anywhere else they might pop up.</li>
            <li>The Suvorna also has silicone shower friendly grips, yet they are expertly refined.</li>
            <li>for whiteheads make sure u exfoliate first.</li>
            <li>The first time you use this you will be amazed at how much better it works than trying to use your fingers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been to so many different dermatologists, paid for so many visits and prescriptions, and have had so many allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this tool.</li>
            <li>Overall, nice product!</li>
            <li>Love the tool and was exactly what I had ordered.</li>
            <li>I love how it removes so much grease/whiteheads/blackheads that you didn&#x27;t even know you had!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and it makes my pore areas a bit red, but it&#x27;s fine by morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be able to clean up blackheads pretty well like in the youtube videos.  </li>
            <li>Works good on large blackheads ready to come out already.</li>
            <li>My facialist showed me hers, which always leaves my face so clean,</li>
            <li>Gets my pores clean and helps me get areas I couldn&#x27;t get before.</li>
            <li>My nose have never looked so clean.</li>
            <li>- my pores stay so clean</li>
            <li>You can clean the tool in alcohol.</li>
            <li>Remember to clean the tool after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The smaller end is most effective.  </li>
            <li>Scraped surface skin a bit to clean pores</li>
            <li>But always remember to sanitize this tool (boil it in water or clean it with rubbing alcohol) and after squeezing the sebum out rub some rubbing alcohol on it to kill the bacteria then use an astringent or toner.</li>
            <li>There can&#x27;t be that many deviations on this kind of facial extractor, and I do like this one.</li>
            <li>this tool is best used when u are taking a shower, when your skin is soft and pores are open.</li>
            <li>and it helps clean and remove all kinds of oils under my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have a thing with keeping my pores clean.</li>
            <li>I have had many facials at spas and this tool is the almost same thing they use and just as effective.</li>
            <li>Especially when I step out of the shower, when my skin is soft from the steam, it works best.</li>
            <li>It is very important to rinse the tool with rubbing alcohol between every use (as in, every whitehead or blackhead) and you&#x27;ll really see that your acne is diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and although I don&#x27;t have many zits nowadays I do have blackheads and large pores around my nose</li>
            <li>It worked in places but for the most part it really didn&#x27;t clean out my poors too well.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to clean out your pores before scrubbing, but it can harm your skin if you dig too much, so be gentle!</li>
            <li>I bought one for my teenage doughter and saw how good it worked then got one for myself.</li>
            <li>Good overall experience. .</li>
            <li>If you really must get to hard-to-reach places like the crevice by the outer edge of your nostril or your ears or something, sure, use it.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks better than when I was 25 thanks in part to this tool</li>
            <li>After washing, when my face pores have opened up and the steam is in full effect, I coat my face with benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li>Blackhead remover doesn&#x27;t work all that well but works good enough.</li>
            <li>and it really got most of the black/whites heads out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this thing as much as I thought.</li>
            <li>I think it is more hygienic to use this tool than your fingers, but sometimes the tool can be quite ineffective and hurts too much...</li>
            <li>just make sure it is ready to come out before going to war with your face.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not out any considerable $, but after 3 honest attempts to use it, I&#x27;ll never use it again.</li>
            <li>Extremely cool.</li>
            <li>If you use it for blemishes make sure your pimples are ready to be popped, otherwise it will hurt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that if you spent more time working with it, you might get better results.</li>
            <li>A simple tool that everyone should have to keep their skin looking good</li>
            <li>but it was just because of the size of the object i guess, so not bad for others.</li>
            <li>It is pretty cool, i can just pop my pimples etc, easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;zit&amp;#34; tools that had a better handle and worked better, but this one works ok.  </li>
            <li>I really like this products, gets my pores very clean and unclogged.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use it before going out somewhere but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s too flat,  but still a good device.</li>
            <li>It left scars on my nose that are VERY visible lol.</li>
            <li>the small part that works the best broke on the first use.</li>
            <li>it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>it has a textured grip and is super durable.</li>
            <li>Cleanly and safely removing white and black heads, without the risk of introducing bacteria from finger nails into the pore is very important in maintaining clear skin, and this tool does a wonderful job of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly I haven&#x27;t had any success with the other end, but the other end has really impressed me.</li>
            <li>I use it periodically to clean up, but I think the first session alone just eliminated so much long-term blackhead accumulation more than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I had a pretty huge pimple.</li>
            <li>Cleaning and washing only goes so far, no one wants to stare at a pimple on their face and this is the best solution.</li>
            <li>If in doubt I say go for it because it&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>The boiling water on a pot is good too but takes too long.  </li>
            <li>Works great, it gets the stubborn pimples and black heads with ease.</li>
            <li>but with half the effort, 10% of the time and the irritation and recovery time greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>I get black heads in the creases on the sides of my nose and this is great to keep them in check.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a pretty good product</li>
            <li>If yours come out easily than it may not hurt so much</li>
            <li>technique is to take a nice, hot shower, complete with steam.  </li>
            <li>This tool helps so much in not spreading the bacteria from your hands to your face and its easy to disinfect.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done but isn&#x27;t exactly the most gentle thing ever (hence, my son hates it).</li>
            <li>Handle is easy to keep hold of thanks to the groves on it.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li>First off all three work!</li>
            <li>If you are trying to remove something and it does not come out after the first couple of tries-STOP!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stainless steel so easy to clean and disinfect, hot water and hydrogen peroxide for me.</li>
            <li>Much less painless than pinching and much more effective.</li>
            <li>The product is supposedly made of stainless steel, and it looks fine.</li>
            <li>The flat long surface on the blackhead end works the best.</li>
            <li>This little body tooz tool does the most amazing job I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li>This little tool will get rid of as many white/black heads as you could remove with your own hands (nails?)</li>
            <li>This neat little tool will do it for you safely and effectively.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a great tool for everyday usage.  </li>
            <li>It works amazingly well - especially for blackheads on one&#x27;s nose.  </li>
            <li>One end I use primarily, the longer end not so much.</li>
            <li>This was a good deal- the smaller side is a bit rough and puts too much pressure but the larger, flatter side is awesome!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it fresh out of the shower, after a work out, etc</li>
            <li>They are mainly more firm, and not the runny, puss-filled kind.</li>
            <li>So for those that have those deep, under skin postular acne, I don&#x27;t this will be effective for you.</li>
            <li>Definitely  worth the money.</li>
            <li>I think that is essential to use this tool effectively.</li>
            <li>I did not find this useful whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but someone said here it was a must have, and actually it leaves your skin kind of bruised.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re aiming for the blackheads, open your pores by steam or warm towelette.</li>
            <li>If you can stand the pain from a professional, then you&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li>this is the tool to use if you do your own facials and such.  </li>
            <li>my fiance even uses it!i rarely have break outs because i beat them to the punch.</li>
            <li>It is a great way to clear up acne on your face (or all over your body, actually) without using your hands and introducing dirt.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this unless your pores are open, like after a shower or wrap a warm towel around your face.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work on regular blackheads, it is nice for ones that have a whitehead, and you don&#x27;t get oil from your fingers on your face.  </li>
            <li>This tool is well built and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It hurt to use it, but I kept going because I figured it would be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>maybe this is useful.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>but thanks to this little thing, I say Good bye blackheads of death !</li>
            <li>Honestly, the product that came is the right shape, but too big.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Broke the first day I had it, luckily I know how to fix things</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the on all of them right now)</li>
            <li>So I USED THE TOOL RIGHT AFTER MY WORKOUT.</li>
            <li>wait for a week or 2 than do right side of the nose.</li>
            <li>so I may not have done it right</li>
            <li>they pop right out.  </li>
            <li>[...] I learned how to do it the right way.</li>
            <li>it leaves battle wounds right after you use it.</li>
            <li>and you can store it right in the case too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll wait around till I&#x27;ve got a pimple and update it then, but right off the bat</li>
            <li>This tool does not seem to be the right size or dimension to accomplish its supposed task.</li>
            <li>This product does what it is intended to do and the price is just right, cant complain about this item.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right.</li>
            <li>The pus and whatnot almost always comes right out.</li>
            <li>Cleaned my nose right up.</li>
            <li>I got this tool, used it 1 time, and it broke right when I was done.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it hurts though right after I do it</li>
            <li>I opened it right up and went to work.</li>
            <li>I tried using it right when I wake up, midway through the day, and right after a shower, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me whenever I use it.</li>
            <li>Great little tool!</li>
            <li>Great little tool!</li>
            <li>This tool is great for pimples but the holes are too large for black heads.</li>
            <li>my new one since stolen by latest ex Tweezerman 2.0 is much flatter (picture posted)    </li>
            <li>It does an EXCELLENT job of extracting white heads and black heads.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent tool for removing black and white heads.</li>
            <li>(Another reviewer&#x27;s advice to do cardio first was golden).  </li>
            <li>I did this after a nice hot shower and was amazed at how much gunk was in my pores :o</li>
            <li>Great for blackheads and small whiteheads too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use this on blackheads and pimples and it barely leaves a mark compared to when you squeeze your skin to pop a pimple.  </li>
            <li>It was good for the first use, but every other use after wards</li>
            <li>If you have a really huge blackhead it&#x27;ll get it nicely, but for the little ones on my nose</li>
            <li>great as i dont ve to spend for a facial too often to get my white heads removed.</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased a Body Toolz skin tool and loved it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and clean, just wish I have it earlier.</li>
            <li>For a few bucks, it&#x27;s definitely one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>I was really conscious of the blackheads on and around my nose and really felt so much better</li>
            <li>MY husband wanted this facial tool and said he  was very happy with it  along with a facial scrub he was able to remove all the black heads with out doing injury to his skin</li>
            <li>Not the best but not the worst but have a great price</li>
            <li>It does such a good job at keeping your pores clear.</li>
            <li>( A few days later ) I have used this for over a week now and I am very happy I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>Lost a star because not so good with regular old pimples.  </li>
            <li>It works best if you steam your face a little first to open up pores.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It pops white heads right out, blackheads are more difficult.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be VERY gentle with this product.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the smaller comedone extractors are more suitable for the cleaner half of the civilized population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  </li>
            <li>This is a good little tool to have.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice little plastic case and looks like a cool tool, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make it work for me.</li>
            <li>This thing is very usable and inexpensive!    </li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;ve gotten over most of my acne, I still find it a crucial tool for cleaning up the obscure blackhead here and there!</li>
            <li>First of all - this thing hurts.  </li>
            <li>This is ok for me to to use with visible and above the skin pimples, but I just can&#x27;t get out the deeper stuff with it.  </li>
            <li>Tried using it after a pretty rigorous workout, with my face all hot and sweaty.</li>
            <li>Even though sweat comes out of different pores than sebum, I think the moisture coming out of my skin is better than steam at wetting sebum in my clogged pores.</li>
            <li>I personally think my way of doing it works better</li>
            <li>This is my first time EVER doing this to my face or even purchasing something like this</li>
            <li>Came in on time and looks exactly like it&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m back to the low-tech technique of squeezing with my fingers :)</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>First off this is a quality tool.</li>
            <li>You can tell because they are white at the top and the skin has thinned.</li>
            <li>and thats exactly what I thought all this time.  </li>
            <li>So much!</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty congested, I&#x27;m a teenager.</li>
            <li>Or after steaming your face over hot water.</li>
            <li>A.&lt;br /&gt;I made a big mistake, more than once, and used Retin A.  </li>
            <li>I even wash my face with hot water to see if that will make a difference.</li>
            <li>If you apply to much strength it will hurt !</li>
            <li>This was my first pore extraction tool</li>
            <li>My husband gets pimples sometimes on his back and says this is much better (but not painless) than me trying to squeeze them.</li>
            <li>It really pops your pimples!</li>
            <li>Perhaps the first one was defective.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read up on proper use, I&#x27;ve seen some people with scars.</li>
            <li>If I had to replace it, I would try a different one, but it is ok.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this is not the best product for my skin</li>
            <li>I feel like this product is more for people with blackheads that protrude quiet a bit.  </li>
            <li>When I first bought this black/white head removal tool I thought it was a scam.</li>
            <li>First time using this</li>
            <li>I first sanitized it and washed my face</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Well, I have been experiencing acne for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as described and as in photo.</li>
            <li>but i guess each face is different and there are those who will love it.</li>
            <li>This is the first time purchasing or using a product like this</li>
            <li>AGAIN.WAS NOT EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li>But you HAVE to use it after washing with hot water or after getting out of a steamy shower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After exfoliating in a hot shower this thing is quite handy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Never through this tool would help as much as it did but it does!</li>
            <li>And most likely, the bugger will still be there when you come to your senses...</li>
            <li>This tool is pretty nifty.</li>
            <li>it does pretty close to nothing.  </li>
            <li>It is made very well!</li>
            <li>exactly how well it works on face, but hopping it reduces scaring</li>
            <li>would rather recommend to choose something of a higher quality...</li>
            <li>Operator error most likely</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works much better on larger blemishes.</li>
            <li>My first time and I was tearing up.  </li>
            <li>like after a hot shower.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I never knew I had white heads until I bought this love it.</li>
            <li>If you use it a lot in one go, it will leave your face red - but it is infinitely better than breaking pimples with your fingers.  </li>
            <li>Also, be gentle with this!  </li>
            <li>When I first got these (before use)</li>
            <li>so maybe someone would be able to use both ends equally.</li>
            <li>It is well constructed and works great, especially if you steam your face first or use it after a long shower.</li>
            <li>Overall a cheap and good tool for blackheads or closed comedones.</li>
            <li>and it was TAPED up top from where you would open it.</li>
            <li>It will not work unless you just came out of a hot shower.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Unsure if just the design makes it that way, maybe a different one would work better</li>
            <li>This works really well!  </li>
            <li>Not functioning effectively as I had expected.</li>
            <li>This works alright and is pretty addicting for pickers.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using it after a hot shower or after you&#x27;ve been sweating because the pores are more open.</li>
            <li>First of all, this product works.</li>
            <li>as it&#x27;s good at getting stubborn blackheads out, the other side is mainly for whiteheads but works well.</li>
            <li>at first I was nervous to put too much pressure, because I thought that I would snap the loop right off but</li>
            <li>Out of many products like this, I finally decided to buy this one because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>leaves little red indents after use but faded quickly(I have very fair skin).</li>
            <li>It came nice and clean and in a small pouch.</li>
            <li>I followed other reviewer recommendations including using this after a shower, trying to cover my face in a warm washcloth beforehand, etc...</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep the loop flat on your skin.  </li>
            <li>The flat end is ok</li>
            <li>And assuming you clean the tool after use, more hygenic (less chance of infection of the area) than using your finger nails.</li>
            <li>When using this remember ONLY to use it when your whitehead is showing, then you gently push on top of the whitehead to get the puss out.</li>
            <li>But the end with the wire hoop is very effective for getting hard to reach places like the nostrils---but you absolutely need to steam your face for about 10-minutes beforehand.</li>
            <li>Most of us know from anecdotal experience that whiteheads look much better once drained, and they usually fade faster that way too!</li>
            <li>That being said, the small side works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>does pop/extract pimples/blackheads near the surface of the skin cleanly and without much effort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that this brand works better than others that look just like it, but this one works very well and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried it with a clean face, I have tried it right after a shower, I have even tried it after being outside all day hiking and sweating in 90 degree heat</li>
            <li>Anyway, I scrubbed the rust with some jewelery cleaner and make sure to dry it thoroughly after every use, so that should fix the problem.</li>
            <li>Simply steam your face a bit and this tool will help you easy remove blackheads, whiteheads or pimples in a way that will prevent scarring.</li>
            <li>This tool makes it so quick to remove them and you will be surprised with the amount of gunk you will see coming out of our pores and sticking to the extracting tool.</li>
            <li>It makes something that should be simple (but often isn&#x27;t), really easy.</li>
            <li>Soon enough, you&#x27;ll have a strong pimple hand and people will call you a pimple</li>
            <li>The opening is to large.</li>
            <li>and she was squeezing my pores which are really large and my t-zone always oily</li>
            <li>Either end is entirely to large.</li>
            <li>The large end broke a week after having it</li>
            <li>It is most helpful with loose blackheads and large whiteheads.</li>
            <li>Great for white heads and &amp;#34;ripe&amp;#34; black heads.  </li>
            <li>Also, this tool is not overly easy to use on stubborn blackheads - just ready to go white head pimples.</li>
            <li>Its useful to clean the clogged pores, without using your nails, easy to hold, the handle is long enough.</li>
            <li>Awesome for black heads especially, but also some white heads.  </li>
            <li>This is a handy little tool that everyone in my home loves.</li>
            <li>This is a handy little tool for extracting blackheads, it makes it easier not to damage the tender skin on the face.</li>
            <li>Nice little tool to remove pimples and blackheads without damaging the skin.  </li>
            <li>I recommend showering first to open up your pores and clean off any additional oil or gunk on your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone interested.</li>
            <li>I honestly only use the looped end (never found much use for the flattened side), but I still enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It is so much gentler than trying to squeeze with your fingers.</li>
            <li>I wish Amazon would be more careful with their descriptions.</li>
            <li>I had an almost identical tool that I lost and it was much gentler.</li>
            <li>really?  </li>
            <li>I am very cautious if and when I will use it.  </li>
            <li>Its cheap enough to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It hurts so much when you go over a whitehead.</li>
            <li>The loop end works really well for pushing pores.</li>
            <li>It has made my life a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li>This is a very well constructed piece of \\&quot;equipment\\&quot; and serves its purpose admirably.</li>
            <li>I went to e bay and bought a real one for 2.95 with an needle end.</li>
            <li>My nose was swollen for the day because I put so much pressure on it.  </li>
            <li>But will I put so much pressure on my nose?</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>(I am sure dermatologists everywhere are repulsed), but this is more difficult to use than it is worth in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Especially on sensitive areas like the inside edge of the ear.</li>
            <li>, but this does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>The tool has both ends to use for extractions and is very inexpensive and beats using your fingers that can leave scars.</li>
            <li>Just made a loop impression in my skin and extracted absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li>but this tool cleaned my pores out really well.  </li>
            <li>so I can not complain much to pay for this</li>
            <li>It really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I scrape the whole face where I needed.</li>
            <li>This gently pushes around the zit and empties it.  </li>
            <li>but firmly haha)</li>
            <li>have not used yet, but looks like it is made very sturdy</li>
            <li>I just wish it didn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li>I try to only use it lightly after steaming</li>
            <li>I like to do gentle things on my face so this product just isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>You just have to gentle.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really seem to do what it should.</li>
            <li>but when my boyfriend tried to use it, he audibly yelled, &amp;#34;OUCH!&amp;#34; because of how much it hurts.</li>
            <li>I really hope it works for you as it did for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>gets the job done fast</li>
            <li>Use gently.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get blackheads</li>
            <li>absolute rubbish</li>
            <li>I would recommend using this on acne that is ready to pop.</li>
            <li>It is made of stainless steel so it won&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li>This also works real well after you steam your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just press and caress and poke gently.  </li>
            <li>This really helped me.</li>
            <li>and it was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Steam your face beforehand and gently press.</li>
            <li>If the sebum doesn&#x27;t come out, the pore isn&#x27;t ready.</li>
            <li>I expected more.</li>
            <li>I thought it would really help extractions</li>
            <li>I guess, I just don&#x27;t use it much.  </li>
            <li>This did not work very well for me.</li>
            <li>its very sturdy.</li>
            <li>but they dont came out, maybe because I dont really know how to use it.</li>
            <li>But this one really hurts.  </li>
            <li>This tool is very sturdy however, and will get the job done.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me though, getting rid of blackheads</li>
            <li>I never have to touch my face with my hands or nails ever thanks to this.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>this has been an absolute blessing.</li>
            <li>I thought about it for a couple of weeks if I should really get this.</li>
            <li>I understand that popping pimples hurts, but this thing was WAY too much.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work, but I don&#x27;t think the blemishes were ready.</li>
            <li>Got this to remove blackheads, but it doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t cut your skin, but in some areas it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>but it really hasn&#x27;t helped with my skin care.</li>
            <li>I get so much gunk off my nose</li>
            <li>~ thank you so much....</li>
            <li>I never knew my pores held so much gunk until I started using this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier than popping with your fingers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much acne</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from this comedone extractor because it was so affordable.</li>
            <li>so I expected better quality.</li>
            <li>It is much easier than squeezing, though.</li>
            <li>might as well just terminate your internet provider because if you can&#x27;t \\&quot;figure out\\&quot; how to use this, you shouldn&#x27;t even really be using your computer or Amazon.....</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I got much out with this tool.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not going to get everything unless you peel your skin off, which this tool is capable of doing.</li>
            <li>ingrown hairs (my nemesis), and blackheads without damaging skin as much as fingers or sharper tools</li>
            <li>and I got very spotty (three spots all in a line from cheek to chin).</li>
            <li>So if you are a picker you really ought to think twice.</li>
            <li>Good tool for blackheads in hard to reach places as long as they are easy to get out.</li>
            <li>If you want a clear face, buy this!!!</li>
            <li>If you have to clean one out, just use a pin to prick the surface open and use the large loop to gently push it out.</li>
            <li>I also find that it works fine if I place a hot (not TOO hot), damp cloth on the area for a few minutes first.</li>
            <li>So it seems to be serviceable tool that was not very expensive.  </li>
            <li>My skin is NOT sensitive and doesn&#x27;t get bruised easily.</li>
            <li>When a zit is fully ready to be popped, the hoop side is handy if the zit is small enough to fit in the hoop.</li>
            <li>Plain and simple, I just could not get my face as clean with this as with using my own two fingers.  </li>
            <li>but even after all that I had to mash at my face to get just a very small amount out causing alot of discomfort and bright lines that stayed for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>This tool is able to clear all my pores without leaving unsightly red marks, and it can get into areas that I normally couldn&#x27;t get to before.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure it would work for some other people</li>
            <li>Does help to get infection out of zits without the trauma of squeezing, but other tool I have used works much better.  </li>
            <li>When I got it first, I was excited and used it on dry skin.</li>
            <li>and I never wear make up , so my skin is always kept as clean as possible.</li>
            <li>I will certainly review plethora of such tools offered again via Amazon/Seller in future and to pick out one or more of this type of tool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, highly portable and really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is a handy way to pop out a potential zit but you really have to be careful.</li>
            <li>Firstly I am 22 years old and NEVER bothered cleaning my nose&#x27;s blackheads before.</li>
            <li>The first time it was used we were so surprised to how well it work.  </li>
            <li>hat i like about it the most this little curve at the end of each side it makes it really easier to work with it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more hygienic than using fingers to pop zits or remove black heads.</li>
            <li>For black heads, push gently on top until you get it out.</li>
            <li>Note that I have many tiny, pore sized whiteheads and blackheads on my face, chest and back.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting a different one at a local store and it&#x27;s held up much better.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of this tool, but it works great and is very functional.</li>
            <li>Just this evening I was able to rid my face of a most difficult to remove blackhead located on the crease that shapes my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older now</li>
            <li>, this particular product is the cheapest I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it on the sides of my nostrils.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews i knew to was my face with hot water first to help open the pores</li>
            <li>I guess I needed more time steaming my pores open over the pot of boiling water, just to have the steam open up my pores a little more.  </li>
            <li>but I use the small loop for big ones also (especially when I need them to pop ;) lol).</li>
            <li>highly recommend that (although some of the video&#x27;s were...</li>
            <li>I wish I had this in high school.</li>
            <li>I saw a tutorial of this type of tool on youtube, and had high hopes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend those that have acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Very rarely will you ever use the large end for anything other than cleaning out a whitehead.</li>
            <li>I always steam my face before or do it right after a hot shower when the Pores are open and soft.</li>
            <li>I own several extraction tools and this one works extremely well for my needs.  </li>
            <li>love this little gadget.  </li>
            <li>Love this little wand.</li>
            <li>I figured having this tool was better than picking at my acne with my crummy little fingers.</li>
            <li>it was a bit difficult to use, but nonetheless a great product</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t that expensive, so not that great of a loss.</li>
            <li>This tool can only do pretty much one thing</li>
            <li>and I did my normal face routine after.</li>
            <li>waste of my money for sure</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exciting aha and gross</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only recently started doing my own facial treatments.</li>
            <li>I would say only three blackheads came out with this product and it hurts if I use it on a fresh pimple.</li>
            <li>pretty much only use this tool after exfoliating my face because otherwise it takes too much pressure to extract anything.</li>
            <li>There may be a kind of tool that just has a circular opening that you push down with to get the deep ones out.</li>
            <li>The Body Toolz Double Loop Facial Skin Care Tool arrived quickly and is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Would not really recommend buying something like this unless you know exactly if its right for you.</li>
            <li>There is a slit on the back of the case, just under the white part, which permits easy removal and replacement.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Body Toolz Double Loop Facial Skin Care Tool and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>I was thinking it was an amazing easy zit popper black head remover, but it is quite hard to use and hurts a bit .</li>
            <li>Definitely do not use this product right before you go out-</li>
            <li>This is not made of cheap metal like other one.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>but it something I can live with.  </li>
            <li>It basically just gave me these huge red welts on my face without actually unclogging any pores.  </li>
            <li>Helps you get the blackheads out easily with less pain and damage to skin</li>
            <li>but I do not really have that many facial issues</li>
            <li>When I got it, I first took a hot shower and with not much luck continued to steam my face.</li>
            <li>This tool worked as anticipated, but one of the loops (the smaller one) broke off within 2 weeks with only light use.</li>
            <li>This might be for those facing the kind of acne that is serious but close to the surface.</li>
            <li>I looked into a 15x maginfied mirror and my skin was 1000% clean and clear of every single blackhead that lay beneath the surface.</li>
            <li>if used correctly though it heals very fast and actually helps your skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend going to a professional before trying anything like this.</li>
            <li>This is the only instrument that allowed me to remove an old, huge blackhead on my back.  </li>
            <li>The shipping to return will cost nearly the amount of the product, therefore I must warn you to stay away from this seller!</li>
            <li>That is what I remember a dermatologist using on me many years ago, but I&#x27;m not sure I remember correctly.</li>
            <li>Just saying, naturally it came from HongKong or China, but so did this one probably!</li>
            <li>I watched several YouTube videos before I purchased this tool and it performs exactly as what I&#x27;d hoped it would.</li>
            <li>a male, we tend to have bigger pores than females, so it&#x27;s more obvious to spot blackheads</li>
            <li>I just still have to figure it out completely !</li>
            <li>I love it, but if you have small pores leave it.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of an extractor before I got my first facial.  </li>
            <li>Exact opposite for this product!  </li>
            <li>Not only is this exactly what I wanted but it arrived quickly(2 days after order)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have anything else to say but apparently must write fifteen words.</li>
            <li>This is my second tool of this nature, the first being one I purchased at a drug store</li>
            <li>However I mainly use the small loop for most extractions since the big loop cant take care of the small pimples but its sometimes good for larger ones</li>
            <li>ive used ones that are a thinner wire loop, more control, but you can tear your skin up if you are not careful  this one is a little thicker  knurled grip works</li>
            <li>I only use the small loop, and it works great on my skin, dry or steamed.  </li>
            <li>I had black heads, puss filled pours I never knew were there.</li>
            <li>But I went on YouTube and after watching a few demonstrations, I easily got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have black/white heads, but I sometimes have a few pointy and bumpy grease deposits on my temples, chin and neck which can easily be removed by nails.</li>
            <li>Tried it on dry skin and fresh out of the shower as others suggested.</li>
            <li>The first time I got a professional facial</li>
            <li>Maybe there is some special technique to it that I am not aware of</li>
            <li>Bruises about the same as a bobby pin, requires a bit less pressure, and its slightly more effective.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>did work for my friend who had larger pores and more noticeably black heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The small loop broke off the first one I bought quite quickly, but Amazon replaced it, no problem.  </li>
            <li>but I find I have to press pretty hard to get it to clean.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve noticed that I do have some instances in which the pressure I applied with this tool led to a 24 hour development of a large mass composed of blackheads, possibly created from irritation resulting from using this tool.    </li>
            <li>This leaves a large red mark and hurts while I do it.</li>
            <li>Kind of difficult to remove pores as the width of the rings are quite large.</li>
            <li>Takes technique, little practice, but honestly, it&#x27;s not too great.</li>
            <li>Some people report that it hurts, but if a little discomfort for a short time is the price to remove persistent acne, I am OK with that.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help clear my pores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it is another quality tool to help you get and maintain clear skin.</li>
            <li>Clearly there is nothing scientific in my opinion though.</li>
            <li>Obviously it&#x27;s preferable to see a professional, so use caution and don&#x27;t put too much pressure on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can also use this to clear blocked pores that haven&#x27;t quite become a flared up pimple.  </li>
            <li>It really wouldn&#x27;t matter except I bought the tool for a completely different use than what it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
            <li>Maybe the loops are thicker than the old one I had</li>
            <li>I suspect that maybe a facial sauna would really help, but that is just not something I am trying to buy.  </li>
            <li>17 years old loves it.  </li>
            <li>He lost his old one, so I got this as a replacement and it works just as well on them pesky poors.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any problems so far</li>
            <li>I recommend you sanitize the tool before use just in case, but overall very satisified with this purchase.</li>
            <li>You should probably only be targeting those pimples that are ready to pop.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the scars turned into scabs and dried up and fell off within 4 days or so.</li>
            <li>It got out the ingrown hairs, but not without considerable pressure being applied.</li>
            <li>My skin appears much clearer now because I don&#x27;t have red marks from squeezing blemishes.</li>
            <li>I am far-sighted and can&#x27;t really see well close up in a regular mirror.</li>
            <li>This is a very well made model and will last for years</li>
            <li>My pores have been very clogged recently, so I wanted something that allowed me to get rid of excess sebum.</li>
            <li>But, again, go to a professional to see how it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li>Would recommend, ESPECIALLY for the price and no hassle fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and it is just like my old one I got from sephora.</li>
            <li>you have to use much pressure at all, the loops will bend and you&#x27;ll have to fix them back.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do the job as well as a professional would</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain especially for this price.</li>
            <li>maybe  put a topical antibiotic,  and you should be ready to try again in 24 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is so low that I don&#x27;t really mind, though.</li>
            <li>Surprised at the weight and finish of this comedone extractor.  </li>
            <li>what it is suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is really good.&lt;br /&gt;One is enuf for your basic pricking experiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If a gentle push does not get it out then do not proceed any further.</li>
            <li>Use only when skin is ready.</li>
            <li>The big side doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>this even after sanitizing seems to break me out considerably.</li>
            <li>Its looks are deceiving because it looks as though it would bend or break, but it is built well like a professional tool.</li>
            <li>I put it back in, but it popped right back out.</li>
            <li>The large, flat loop end of this tool does not seem to do anything.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to find a youtube video to find how to work this thing, but I&#x27;ve used blackhead removers in the past that worked easily.</li>
            <li>---the flat end doesn&#x27;t do anything and can leave marks if you apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I attempted to use this product right after a hot shower (letting the steam open my pores a little).  </li>
            <li>so I glide the smaller loop around the sides of my nose and get all the small blackhead which look more like clogged pores cleaned out.  </li>
            <li>Two finger method didn&#x27;t work because it only seemed to depress the center even more.</li>
            <li>Those Biore strips only cause a few second of pain and get far more out than I ever got with this tool.</li>
            <li>It keeps everything clean and pops pimples with alot less frustration!</li>
            <li>Like other people said do not push real hard that will make it hurt lol.</li>
            <li>ridiculous,,this tiny little thing came in this big padded envelope which cost more than the item</li>
            <li>It is durable, easy to clean, and works on random big pimples without having to try and get an angle on it with fingers.  </li>
            <li>its long and has a knurled grip and is stainless steel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very helpful in the fact that when your skin is sensitive or you are having pain due to the pimple, these will provide enough force without hurting you that much.  </li>
            <li>I was very skeptical, but I trusted the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had known about this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li>Not what I exactly needed, through absolutely no fault of the Seller.</li>
            <li>Used hot, wet towels to soak skin.</li>
            <li>The big end is good for larger spots and the small end for smaller spots or on the remnants of the larger spot.</li>
            <li>the large side is for white heads the smaller side is for blackheads.</li>
            <li>However the round end is much too large or fat to apply the type of pressure I need to apply to extract blackheads.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it is much more hygienic than using my hands and does less damage to the skin.</li>
            <li>From someone who has suffered from breakouts my entire adolescent and young adult life...</li>
            <li>A light amount of pressure (try a few different angles if you need to)  should bring the blockage to the surface.</li>
            <li>The larger side for white pimples, works very well, hurts a little if you have sensitive skin, but took it right out.</li>
            <li>This tool does what it says it does, but it works alot better and its less painful if you wet your skin with warm water first.</li>
            <li>With that being said, this tool does a pretty good jobs with squeezing out my whiteheads, however, it doesn&#x27;t get them all out, but only probably because it becomes too painful to use after a while.</li>
            <li>At times, after a shower with steam, it helped a bit, but never any major pimple popping or acne removal.</li>
            <li>Hurts a little but fun</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for clearing up painful acne,</li>
            <li>Works as advertised, doesn&#x27;t make the area inflammed and red like when you try and use your hands to clear blemishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to use this product several times and it never seems to fully remove a blackhead completely.</li>
            <li>It was as if I just spent 10 days on the beach in Puerto Rico, where your skin really clears out in that Caribbean air and sun.</li>
            <li>It was much sturdier than expected, works as advertised and it made of quality material.</li>
            <li>a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; but its worth the few bucks.</li>
            <li>Not horrible but not great.</li>
            <li>Pressing gently down on the target area and then more firmly, I saw the blackheads begin to come out.</li>
            <li>Ends are not very sharp but rounded like wire on one side.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken some really steamy long showers to open my pores with not much better of a result than from a quick shower.  </li>
            <li>I have used these for many years, this one is not different than most (with the exception of the flat white-hear loop, which I assume is to help prevent cutting but makes zits harder to pop), but these products in general must be used with caution.</li>
            <li>does nothing for me, invested in precision tweezers and magnifying mirror combined with old fashion squeezing you&#x27;ll get the job done much easier and with less pain</li>
            <li>but i should totally blame it on the product because it&#x27;s suppose to really work when i am sweating not when my face is dry.</li>
            <li>This tool is very helpful however, on certain parts of your face its hard to use like your brow bone, otherwise I would recommend it to anyone needing help with zits.</li>
            <li>It is a little painful since the best technique that works with my skin is to press it in near the handle part of the loop, circling the spot in the skin, and then slide the tool while adding a little more pressure as the inner round area of the loop gets to the spot.</li>
            <li>Looked closely for slight blockages,  and this tool brings everything right out,  before you get a bigger problem.</li>
            <li>The other end you really can&#x27;t  use.  </li>
            <li>The loop is too flat on one side, and too thick on the other to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Then one day it struck me that after my 30 minute cardio workouts, my body temperature stays higher than normal for at least another hour, and that the skin on my face gets moist from all the sweat coming out of my pores.</li>
            <li>The loop facial skin clear did not work on my blemishes at all, it only bruised the area I used it on.</li>
            <li>This tool works but you really have to be careful you&#x27;re not constantly spreading bacteria across your face.    </li>
            <li>I have to say, this tool seems very sturdy and well made, which makes it that much more of a disappointment.  </li>
            <li>had more of a down angle before the up angle on the small loop side like the picture they use for it...</li>
            <li>Handy little tool for black heads, but even after youtubing for videos on how to use the other end, nothing.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t a lot to say about this other than it works and it&#x27;s solid .  </li>
            <li>Since loosing this one I bought a kit with a few different types of heads and the ones on this tool are the only useful ones anyway.</li>
            <li>Push down gently.</li>
            <li>Not sure if they come in different sizes or if this one is just super tiny</li>
            <li>I pressed super hard and still no luck.</li>
            <li>The size of it, makes it too clumsy, rough and inaccurate, if you&#x27;re using on a specific blemish, it can actually weaken and damage the area more.  </li>
            <li>Not great, but good if you only want to target one tight area and shield the pores around that area with the flat spatula</li>
            <li>If your pores are not loose and open, this thing WILL damage skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend looking for the other model.</li>
            <li>it very bruised where I tried to remove an black head..</li>
            <li>You should use this if you have easy to get out white heads, because it doesnt work for tough ones.</li>
            <li>The only time anything came out was when I pressed super hard, leaving an indent in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Instead of pressing in, I firmly glide the big flat side of the tool over my pore areas with a cotton round (lightly soaked in rubbing alcohol) near by to wipe off what is extracted and the tool itself.</li>
            <li>So this tool works well for me to get crap out of my pores on my own especially after a shower or hot cloth compress on my face.</li>
            <li>This works very well at removing black and white heads.  </li>
            <li>Like a previous reviewer mentioned, this tool doesn&#x27;t seem to work on all of your black/white heads... for me, it generally only works on the medium-sized ones which can get kind of frustrating.  </li>
            <li>found it a little hard to use in the beginning then moved to a better type</li>
            <li>I had to apply so much pressure for it to pop, definitely not worth it!    </li>
            <li>I really like this little tool.</li>
            <li>This little beauty tool is very nifty.  </li>
            <li>It hurts a little bit, but not too much.</li>
            <li>Just steam your face a little and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>Plus it is really hard to get them on your cheeks because you need to put a fair amount of pressure and without anything sturdy behind your cheek</li>
            <li>Not great for blackheads unless they are huge, but works well on solid pimples.</li>

            <li> Oh, BTW, I did not have to steam my face and have always been praised for my &#x27;great skin&#x27; and am told I look 35 rather than 50.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how great this works.</li>
            <li> and that is a great idea too since you skin will already be saturated.  </li>

            <li> Great investment when used</li>
            <li> Works best when used after a warm shower when the pores are relaxed.  </li>

            <li> So happy to have stumbled across this.</li>
            <li> tool is great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how amazing this tool was going to work!</li>
            <li> but it is nice to have around for when those days come up that you do!</li>
            <li> great product! :)</li>
            <li> THIS TOOL IS THE MOST AMAZING THING I HAVE COME ACROSS IN MY LIFE!!!!</li>
            <li> but it was perfect for gripping.</li>
            <li> Everyone always says not to use your hands because of bacteria and now that I own this tool, I never even think to use my fingers to pop anything again!</li>
            <li> but I can not seem to get this thing to be effective!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> Now I am trying to buy 2 more for safe keeping and it is an add on!!!</li>
            <li> This is perfect and again easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good concept, over done.</li>
            <li> Good for getting the stubborn zits</li>
            <li> Good quality product, removes some of the surface whiteheads.</li>
            <li> This skin care tool was a good price and is a good product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do a good job at all.</li>
            <li> its also good for getting oil out of pores.</li>
            <li> But every time I do it on my nose, it doesn&#x27;t work good.</li>
            <li> Everytime I looked at it, it kinda laughed at me.</li>
            <li> But is good.</li>
            <li> Good pimple and blackhead extraction tool.  </li>
            <li> Good tool to use on face to get rid of blackheads and the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; pimples that occur from time to time.</li>
            <li> He laughed because he claims I don&#x27;t have blackheads/whiteheads</li>
            <li> This tool is definately really good quality</li>
            <li> I used it on my face...not so good.</li>
            <li> good material</li>
            <li> It works good</li>
            <li> Good quality item and</li>
            <li> that good extracting blackheads.</li>
            <li> Good tool for facials.</li>
            <li> Does a good job at what it was designed for.</li>
            <li> Price is good too.</li>
            <li> and I still find myself using this fairly often.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good item made of good materials...</li>
            <li> I do have a good bit of blackheads around my nose</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;m all good.</li>
            <li> quality is good and over all nice.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Which I think is a good thing, prevents scarring.</li>
            <li> This requires a bit more work, but still does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great price and removes blackheads safely</li>
            <li> it just hurts alittle more lol.</li>
            <li> I use it with a magnifying mirror for optimum viewing, and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> it works great, i don&#x27;t have to squeeze or pick at my face any more.</li>
            <li> VERY pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> LOL :)  </li>
            <li> I get them on my nose and was very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> This is a good tool for reaching those hard-to-reach imperfections and removing the ones that don&#x27;t want to cooperate on their own.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!!  </li>
            <li> make sure you steam your pores or soak face in very warm water to facilitate extraction.</li>
            <li> the Ace Fogless Shower Mirror is reaganesque innovative entrepreneur genius I must say!      </li>
            <li> I just got mine yesterday and my skin feels seriously so much better!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this!</li>
            <li> I love this tool!  </li>
            <li> But with this tool (while yes it is smarts) I can reach and get out pimples a lot more effectively than before!</li>

            <li> This is 100 % better than my fingers!</li>
            <li> Seriously love this tool!</li>
            <li> I love this tool!</li>
            <li> Unexplainably better than using fingers!</li>
            <li> Just make sure to disinfect the loop!  </li>
            <li> I love this tool!</li>
            <li> It works best if you steam your face in the shower first.</li>
            <li> LOVE this tool!</li>
            <li> love this device!</li>
            <li> An amazing tool.</li>
            <li> For about $5, this body tool is an amazingly valuable addition to your health and beauty care.</li>
            <li> great product great price effective for removing extractions easy to clean</li>
            <li> If you have blackheads this tool is amazing.</li>
            <li> Who needs facials when you can have all the products at home and use this amazing tool to extract all the junk from your face?</li>
            <li> Although, if you use it in the shower with silicone on your hand the grips can be quite nice.  </li>
            <li> To be honest when I saw a review that said it didn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> It is effective in cleaning out my pores.</li>
            <li> Even though I cleaned my skin, sterilzed the tool, etc I found it damaged my skin more than it did any good.</li>
            <li> The mechanics of this thing give it no use for removing any kind of pimple.</li>
            <li> It works really nice.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Seller ships fast, prices are excellent.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you just kind of have to figure it out on your own or research methods elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Effectively removes the gunk from my pores and leaves my skin smoother.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s SOO effective).</li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t come with directions, you must learn on your own.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive and effective</li>
            <li> Ordered this after seeing many good reviews.</li>
            <li> still, for the price its handy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li> It helps remove all kind of blemishes.</li>
            <li> you will get some kind of scarring etc..</li>
            <li> I found that if I use this too frequently, it effectively cleans out the &amp;#34;good oils&amp;#34; in my skin and can lead to dryness and peeling.</li>
            <li> I think it does more harm than good.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using the tool after a warm shower, makes getting rid of blackheads and whiteheads easier.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and handy tool to have</li>
            <li> But I must say this one is more convinient and works good.</li>
            <li> This too is easy to use, was a good price, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very easy tool to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just make sure your skin is loosened up from warm water so the tool can do the purging.  </li>
            <li> This worked okay, but it was a hassle and not as effective.</li>
            <li> It is okay, but not as effective as the one I had before.  </li>
            <li> Nice stocking stuffers too :)</li>
            <li> I would go with the Rosallini, which are cheaper and more effective.</li>
            <li> I was adamant about getting them out, but all I did was remove layers of skin (in a perfect circle I might add).</li>
            <li> but it may help you extract your pimples more effectively.</li>
            <li> I liked this better than some name brand products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I always lose these, but I&#x27;m glad to have one handy again for the every so often pesky problem area...</li>
            <li> I guess if I was officially trained in how to use it, but it doesn&#x27;t come with an instruction manual and what seems to be self explanatory doesn&#x27;t seem that much more effective than two index fingers pinching the skin.</li>
            <li> After I caught on to the right pressure, angle and so on, it worked great.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!  </li>
            <li> I use a 7x magnified wall mount mirror in good lighting, and I&#x27;m always amazed at how clean I can get my pores.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, I received it very quickly and it was in perfect brand new condition.  </li>
            <li> It took me a little while to figure out the best way to use the tool, but when i did, it has been amazing!</li>
            <li> Makes my face very smooth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as strong as your own fingers.</li>
            <li> It works significantly better.</li>
            <li> Totally amazed at how good this works!!  </li>
            <li> It is OK.  </li>
            <li> love it .its</li>
            <li> I want to 2nd this excellent suggestion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would have prevented many scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to get one of this tool.  </li>
            <li> Works about as well as using your fingernails, except it hurts more.  </li>
            <li> Better then my hands I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off steaming your face and doing it by hand.</li>
            <li> or you could end up hurting your skin more.</li>
            <li> and I would surely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with a facial hydration system (basically a steamer for your face) and it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> (the description said nothing about this) but it is not something I&#x27;ll be able to use as a result.  </li>
            <li> Unless your blemishes are the size of a grain of sand, I&#x27;d look for something a bit more substantial.</li>
            <li> I was using those sticky strips but this works much better.</li>
            <li> Also seems more sanitary than using your nails/fingers to remove blackheads/zits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to find something that I don&#x27;t have to worry bout the side effects and long-term effects.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> however I was expecting with all of that some better results.</li>
            <li> We use the skinnier loop as we&#x27;ve found it tends to work better for us.</li>
            <li> It mostly just skims over the skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic tool!</li>
            <li> Now I just have to buy two more- one for my mom and for another sister.</li>
            <li> I love this tool.</li>
            <li> I plan on using it more</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how many years I&#x27;ve been wrecking the skin on my face by failing to resist the urge to squeeze out pimples and blackheads with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is better than squeezing your face for stubborn blemishes.  </li>
            <li> It works ok, probably would work better if we had more training.</li>
            <li> It hurts and causes more is situation to the skin than just using you fingertips (don&#x27;t use your nails).</li>
            <li> Love this tool</li>
            <li> seeing most of them eliminated.</li>
            <li> maybe it would work better for a teen-ager.</li>
            <li> Tissue paper and your fingers works better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to keep my acne under more control and keep my face looking clearer.</li>
            <li> Even with a great deal of experimentation, this tool yields only a smattering of good results.</li>
            <li> This works OK.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I break out more after I use this</li>
            <li> glad I was able to get this. :)</li>
            <li> I think one would have to get a better tool through a physician in order to better extract blackheads.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> You have better luck getting them with your fingers or a nose strip.</li>
            <li> It definately works better than a bobby pin and much better than my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this</li>
            <li> I think I like the circle ones better than the loop</li>
            <li> I might need a bit more practice</li>
            <li> the one I use most when needed.</li>
            <li> Better than digging into you skin with nails trying to remove the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> This comes in handy to help smooth out bumps that don&#x27;t belong, without tearing up my skin.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have a hold through the top not the wire loop.</li>
            <li> so cheap!</li>
            <li> Some needing a bid more pushing pressure than others, but nevertheless its gets them.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Its painless and way better than using you fingers&lt;</li>
            <li> Works much better than using my fingers to pop my zits and pimples.</li>
            <li> Hopefully she has better luck with it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for clearing up blackheads and acne without tearing open the skin or smashing the bacteria under the skin.</li>
            <li> I guess you can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> And it seems much more sanitary than your fingers.</li>
            <li> I think squeezing with the fingers is more damaging.</li>
            <li> Received promptly with Amazon Prime (Love it).</li>
            <li> Huh I love it.</li>
            <li> Find something better if you don&#x27;t want marks</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe how in love I am with this product.</li>
            <li> My nose area gets the most gunk to come out.</li>
            <li> But the price was better than anywhere else</li>
            <li> And it will help you feel more confident.</li>
            <li> My teenagers love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I think you may be better off with the circular loops in stead.</li>
            <li> Tool is okay.</li>
            <li> Face looks better and there&#x27;s no scarring.</li>
            <li> This product gets so many things that I don&#x27;t even know are on my face.  </li>
            <li> Since purchasing this tool, I have been using it more often than I thought I would.</li>
            <li> I have used a tool like this before and got better results with a thinner wire than this one.</li>
            <li> This thing does nothing, you are better off cleaning your pores and going that instead of using this mini shovel tonescavate your face.</li>
            <li> This tool really works great.</li>
            <li> My face feels more cleaner and never gets infections now.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I think the more I use it, the better I will be at extracting.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t pop most things, they have to be swollen for it to even work.</li>
            <li> BUT THIS ONE WORKS SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably better then squeezing</li>
            <li> I should have just bought a better face wash.</li>
            <li> It works best if you use it after your facial pores have been opened up...</li>
            <li> your better off with the rosallini eye hole design one( I bought both)</li>
            <li> Not the most glamorous thing to write a review on, but</li>
            <li> This is sturdier and better priced than the one I bought at Sephora (and the loop on that one eventually broke</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried steaming beforehand, but I have better luck getting them out with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get many zits</li>
            <li> This product does not work, I could use my fingers and get better results.</li>
            <li> and it is way better than using your fingers that have all these germs</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a better one elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It gets easier the more</li>
            <li> My skin looks better though.  </li>
            <li> Also I would not recommend sliding it across your face because that may cause irritation to the skin and cause more acne or breakouts.</li>
            <li> How often you are able to use it will vary with your skin type.</li>
            <li> I love this tool.</li>
            <li> Im better off just using my aprricot scrub.</li>
            <li> I love this tool.</li>
            <li> o longer have scars and it doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than using my fingers to pop zits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best for big ones on the surface</li>
            <li> It could be just my skin because I have seen many reviews saying that this product works for them.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t do it every day since I&#x27;m sure it would be damaging to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a better alternative than using your fingernails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work much better than fingers would work.</li>
            <li> If you have to pop or get out zits or blackheads this tool is much more sanitary than using your nails or fingers.</li>
            <li> It is a sturdy item and ok for the price.  </li>
            <li> If you want a more surgical quality item you will need to pay more.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, it works better if I turn the loop around</li>
            <li> ; It works much better than having the loop flush with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this is a much better alternative to using my fingernails.</li>
            <li> Good product, easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t leave marks on your face, and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> It allows you to safely blemishes without damaging the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to grip, doesn&#x27;t puncture my skin, and cleans very easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had to use it once since I got it, but that experience was very successful.</li>
            <li> Anyway,  when after it was done, I used a cutip to clean and washed the tool with warm water.  </li>
            <li> This is nice to keep the item stored and clean.</li>
            <li> to clean with soap and warm water.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you&#x27;ve clean your tools with some rubbing alcohol!  </li>
            <li> They are cheap, easy to use, and effective.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is a nice strong, easy to use and easy to sterilize instrument.  </li>
            <li> but it does work pretty good but does hurt.</li>
            <li> If you use it then, it works pretty darn good.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty good at getting the blackheads from the edge of your nose area.  </li>
            <li> Works great as long you know how to use it:)  Love this product!</li>
            <li> The item works great and arrived new as indicated.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s built well and strong but the design of the piece that is used on the pimple should have more of and arch</li>
            <li> I thought that it would easily push out most of my blackheads and pimples on my face, but it just doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> However, it is easy to misuse, and can lead to more problems than it fixes.</li>
            <li> It was priced low and with free shipping made this the best deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Its helping me clean my pores!</li>
            <li> sure to clean the tool before each use with rubbing alcohol or witch hazel also work a lot better if you wash and expoliate your face before use</li>
            <li> This is a very cool tool.</li>
            <li> Be careful and follow procedure and it will work perfectly for you.</li>
            <li> This tool will work better after a nice hot shower or after you steam your face because your pores will be opened up.  </li>
            <li> it works very well with out causing discomfort, its a good quality tool, my son teenager likes it too for acne.</li>
            <li> rarely get whiteheads, so I can&#x27;t write yet on how effective this tool is for removing them.</li>
            <li> It appears to be made of Stainless Steel and has a textured surface where you hold it, which is good for preventing slips.</li>
            <li> The product is very sturdy and priced fairly.</li>
            <li> Good stainless construction.</li>
            <li> Like other people suggest, it works best on skin that is steamed.  </li>
            <li> Before throwing it away I decided to try one more time: press against the skin and glide downward simultaneously and w/ significant pressure.</li>
            <li> What I like best about this tool is I can hold a magnifying mirror in one hand and use the tool in the other hand to remove zits.</li>
            <li> I would probably check out other tools, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to be that great!</li>
            <li> OK, OK, I know it is not supposed to be fun to use this item</li>
            <li> most of the review said that they cannot get the pore clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to grip it.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does not hurt your skin.</li>
            <li> Its sanitary and easy to use</li>
            <li> Then be sure to use some sort of astringent or cleansing pad afterward to clean any bacteria etc.</li>
            <li> I recommend this tool for easy removal of pimples.</li>
            <li> , I was told she found it really easy to extrude the gunk from them.</li>
            <li> Be sure to clean with alcohol after use.</li>
            <li> , pimpling ain&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li> The metal bends to easily.</li>
            <li> I thought with this tool the pimples will be easy to get out and they will not get infected.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to get carried away.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use</li>
            <li> , I was thinking that the wire would bend way to easily under pressure because It reminded me of a paperclip.  </li>
            <li> Cleans easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to cause bleeding, scabs, etc.</li>
            <li> It is strong and durable.</li>
            <li> Pretty hefty steel with a nice chrome finish.</li>
            <li> Good quality, stainless steal makes it easy to clean.</li>
            <li> But it does such a great job getting rid of acne and leaves my face feeling clean after I use it!</li>
            <li> I good inexpensive purchase if you are new to it like me and want to try it out.</li>
            <li> I think the best way is to steam your face with a hot rag and than do it, because your pores are open and you can get the stuff out a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had great skin, not bad, but far from porcelin china.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle tool but it works fine.</li>
            <li> Work fine but hurt sometimes when you apply a lot of pressure</li>
            <li> it works very well, is sturdy and better than squeezing!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> otherwise the puchase was very cheap and worth it.</li>
            <li> I would order 2 of the Body Toolz (and with free shipping</li>
            <li> Worth twice the price for sure.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t worth more than $2, $8 is a scam.</li>
            <li> I would not even order this if it were free.</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight and made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li> But overall for the price it was great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it for the price and its a lot better than using your fingers to get rid of blemishes.</li>
            <li> This skin care tool works well, but it seems to be made from a relatively cheap metal.  </li>
            <li> It is great for getting white heads popped without creating a cut/scar.</li>
            <li> -lol- just the same as I feel about my tweezers.</li>
            <li> Overall great product and</li>
            <li> It is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> bought 3 of these from the seller \\&quot;loveotc\\&quot; at $4.38 a piece with free shipping.</li>
            <li> It does not feel all that comfortable while trying to get it  perform.</li>
            <li> Yes, there will be pain depending on location but this tool is far more agile and gives you more attempts than your fingers will.</li>
            <li> Meh, it was cheap</li>
            <li> All in all this tool is great for home facial use.</li>
            <li> Steaming your face IS important, and it helps to have someone else do it.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> This is important.  </li>
            <li> Great tool to get blackheads and white heads out.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with alcohol.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really cheap compared to some acne tools I have seen for 12 bucks</li>
            <li> I have great skin, and my husband even used it on a couple spots on my back and said he got tons of gook out of there.  </li>
            <li> and the whole thing, how satisfying. :)</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried to used it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t work that good...</li>
            <li> At first I was not getting good results, so I decided to use a hot compress.</li>
            <li> i would watch youtube videos as well to make sure you do it the right way</li>
            <li> AMAZON- sell it straight up.!!!</li>
            <li> This really works!!!</li>
            <li> Very effective in removing blackheads and whiteheads, especially if you jus got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This is a very useful tool for getting out stubborn blackheads on your nose and anywhere else they might pop up.</li>
            <li> The Suvorna also has silicone shower friendly grips, yet they are expertly refined.</li>
            <li> for whiteheads make sure u exfoliate first.</li>
            <li> The first time you use this you will be amazed at how much better it works than trying to use your fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to so many different dermatologists, paid for so many visits and prescriptions, and have had so many allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this tool.</li>
            <li> Overall, nice product!</li>
            <li> Love the tool and was exactly what I had ordered.</li>
            <li> I love how it removes so much grease/whiteheads/blackheads that you didn&#x27;t even know you had!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and it makes my pore areas a bit red, but it&#x27;s fine by morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be able to clean up blackheads pretty well like in the youtube videos.  </li>
            <li> Works good on large blackheads ready to come out already.</li>
            <li> My facialist showed me hers, which always leaves my face so clean,</li>
            <li> Gets my pores clean and helps me get areas I couldn&#x27;t get before.</li>
            <li> My nose have never looked so clean.</li>
            <li> - my pores stay so clean</li>
            <li> You can clean the tool in alcohol.</li>
            <li> Remember to clean the tool after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The smaller end is most effective.  </li>
            <li> Scraped surface skin a bit to clean pores</li>
            <li> But always remember to sanitize this tool (boil it in water or clean it with rubbing alcohol) and after squeezing the sebum out rub some rubbing alcohol on it to kill the bacteria then use an astringent or toner.</li>
            <li> There can&#x27;t be that many deviations on this kind of facial extractor, and I do like this one.</li>
            <li> this tool is best used when u are taking a shower, when your skin is soft and pores are open.</li>
            <li> and it helps clean and remove all kinds of oils under my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have a thing with keeping my pores clean.</li>
            <li> I have had many facials at spas and this tool is the almost same thing they use and just as effective.</li>
            <li> Especially when I step out of the shower, when my skin is soft from the steam, it works best.</li>
            <li> It is very important to rinse the tool with rubbing alcohol between every use (as in, every whitehead or blackhead) and you&#x27;ll really see that your acne is diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and although I don&#x27;t have many zits nowadays I do have blackheads and large pores around my nose</li>
            <li> It worked in places but for the most part it really didn&#x27;t clean out my poors too well.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to clean out your pores before scrubbing, but it can harm your skin if you dig too much, so be gentle!</li>
            <li> I bought one for my teenage doughter and saw how good it worked then got one for myself.</li>
            <li> Good overall experience. .</li>
            <li> If you really must get to hard-to-reach places like the crevice by the outer edge of your nostril or your ears or something, sure, use it.</li>
            <li> and my skin looks better than when I was 25 thanks in part to this tool</li>
            <li> After washing, when my face pores have opened up and the steam is in full effect, I coat my face with benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li> Blackhead remover doesn&#x27;t work all that well but works good enough.</li>
            <li> and it really got most of the black/whites heads out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this thing as much as I thought.</li>
            <li> I think it is more hygienic to use this tool than your fingers, but sometimes the tool can be quite ineffective and hurts too much...</li>
            <li> just make sure it is ready to come out before going to war with your face.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not out any considerable $, but after 3 honest attempts to use it, I&#x27;ll never use it again.</li>
            <li> Extremely cool.</li>
            <li> If you use it for blemishes make sure your pimples are ready to be popped, otherwise it will hurt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that if you spent more time working with it, you might get better results.</li>
            <li> A simple tool that everyone should have to keep their skin looking good</li>
            <li> but it was just because of the size of the object i guess, so not bad for others.</li>
            <li> It is pretty cool, i can just pop my pimples etc, easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;zit&amp;#34; tools that had a better handle and worked better, but this one works ok.  </li>
            <li> I really like this products, gets my pores very clean and unclogged.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it before going out somewhere but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too flat,  but still a good device.</li>
            <li> It left scars on my nose that are VERY visible lol.</li>
            <li> the small part that works the best broke on the first use.</li>
            <li> it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> it has a textured grip and is super durable.</li>
            <li> Cleanly and safely removing white and black heads, without the risk of introducing bacteria from finger nails into the pore is very important in maintaining clear skin, and this tool does a wonderful job of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly I haven&#x27;t had any success with the other end, but the other end has really impressed me.</li>
            <li> I use it periodically to clean up, but I think the first session alone just eliminated so much long-term blackhead accumulation more than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I had a pretty huge pimple.</li>
            <li> Cleaning and washing only goes so far, no one wants to stare at a pimple on their face and this is the best solution.</li>
            <li> If in doubt I say go for it because it&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> The boiling water on a pot is good too but takes too long.  </li>
            <li> Works great, it gets the stubborn pimples and black heads with ease.</li>
            <li> but with half the effort, 10% of the time and the irritation and recovery time greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> I get black heads in the creases on the sides of my nose and this is great to keep them in check.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a pretty good product</li>
            <li> If yours come out easily than it may not hurt so much</li>
            <li> technique is to take a nice, hot shower, complete with steam.  </li>
            <li> This tool helps so much in not spreading the bacteria from your hands to your face and its easy to disinfect.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done but isn&#x27;t exactly the most gentle thing ever (hence, my son hates it).</li>
            <li> Handle is easy to keep hold of thanks to the groves on it.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> First off all three work!</li>
            <li> If you are trying to remove something and it does not come out after the first couple of tries-STOP!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stainless steel so easy to clean and disinfect, hot water and hydrogen peroxide for me.</li>
            <li> Much less painless than pinching and much more effective.</li>
            <li> The product is supposedly made of stainless steel, and it looks fine.</li>
            <li> The flat long surface on the blackhead end works the best.</li>
            <li> This little body tooz tool does the most amazing job I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li> This little tool will get rid of as many white/black heads as you could remove with your own hands (nails?)</li>
            <li> This neat little tool will do it for you safely and effectively.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is a great tool for everyday usage.  </li>
            <li> It works amazingly well - especially for blackheads on one&#x27;s nose.  </li>
            <li> One end I use primarily, the longer end not so much.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal- the smaller side is a bit rough and puts too much pressure but the larger, flatter side is awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it fresh out of the shower, after a work out, etc</li>
            <li> They are mainly more firm, and not the runny, puss-filled kind.</li>
            <li> So for those that have those deep, under skin postular acne, I don&#x27;t this will be effective for you.</li>
            <li> Definitely  worth the money.</li>
            <li> I think that is essential to use this tool effectively.</li>
            <li> I did not find this useful whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but someone said here it was a must have, and actually it leaves your skin kind of bruised.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re aiming for the blackheads, open your pores by steam or warm towelette.</li>
            <li> If you can stand the pain from a professional, then you&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li> this is the tool to use if you do your own facials and such.  </li>
            <li> my fiance even uses it!i rarely have break outs because i beat them to the punch.</li>
            <li> It is a great way to clear up acne on your face (or all over your body, actually) without using your hands and introducing dirt.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this unless your pores are open, like after a shower or wrap a warm towel around your face.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work on regular blackheads, it is nice for ones that have a whitehead, and you don&#x27;t get oil from your fingers on your face.  </li>
            <li> This tool is well built and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It hurt to use it, but I kept going because I figured it would be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> maybe this is useful.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> but thanks to this little thing, I say Good bye blackheads of death !</li>
            <li> Honestly, the product that came is the right shape, but too big.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Broke the first day I had it, luckily I know how to fix things</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the on all of them right now)</li>
            <li> So I USED THE TOOL RIGHT AFTER MY WORKOUT.</li>
            <li> wait for a week or 2 than do right side of the nose.</li>
            <li> so I may not have done it right</li>
            <li> they pop right out.  </li>
            <li> [...] I learned how to do it the right way.</li>
            <li> it leaves battle wounds right after you use it.</li>
            <li> and you can store it right in the case too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wait around till I&#x27;ve got a pimple and update it then, but right off the bat</li>
            <li> This tool does not seem to be the right size or dimension to accomplish its supposed task.</li>
            <li> This product does what it is intended to do and the price is just right, cant complain about this item.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right.</li>
            <li> The pus and whatnot almost always comes right out.</li>
            <li> Cleaned my nose right up.</li>
            <li> I got this tool, used it 1 time, and it broke right when I was done.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it hurts though right after I do it</li>
            <li> I opened it right up and went to work.</li>
            <li> I tried using it right when I wake up, midway through the day, and right after a shower, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> Great little tool!</li>
            <li> Great little tool!</li>
            <li> This tool is great for pimples but the holes are too large for black heads.</li>
            <li> my new one since stolen by latest ex Tweezerman 2.0 is much flatter (picture posted)    </li>
            <li> It does an EXCELLENT job of extracting white heads and black heads.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent tool for removing black and white heads.</li>
            <li> (Another reviewer&#x27;s advice to do cardio first was golden).  </li>
            <li> I did this after a nice hot shower and was amazed at how much gunk was in my pores :o</li>
            <li> Great for blackheads and small whiteheads too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use this on blackheads and pimples and it barely leaves a mark compared to when you squeeze your skin to pop a pimple.  </li>
            <li> It was good for the first use, but every other use after wards</li>
            <li> If you have a really huge blackhead it&#x27;ll get it nicely, but for the little ones on my nose</li>
            <li> great as i dont ve to spend for a facial too often to get my white heads removed.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a Body Toolz skin tool and loved it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and clean, just wish I have it earlier.</li>
            <li> For a few bucks, it&#x27;s definitely one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> I was really conscious of the blackheads on and around my nose and really felt so much better</li>
            <li> MY husband wanted this facial tool and said he  was very happy with it  along with a facial scrub he was able to remove all the black heads with out doing injury to his skin</li>
            <li> Not the best but not the worst but have a great price</li>
            <li> It does such a good job at keeping your pores clear.</li>
            <li> ( A few days later ) I have used this for over a week now and I am very happy I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Lost a star because not so good with regular old pimples.  </li>
            <li> It works best if you steam your face a little first to open up pores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It pops white heads right out, blackheads are more difficult.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be VERY gentle with this product.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the smaller comedone extractors are more suitable for the cleaner half of the civilized population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  </li>
            <li> This is a good little tool to have.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice little plastic case and looks like a cool tool, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make it work for me.</li>
            <li> This thing is very usable and inexpensive!    </li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve gotten over most of my acne, I still find it a crucial tool for cleaning up the obscure blackhead here and there!</li>
            <li> First of all - this thing hurts.  </li>
            <li> This is ok for me to to use with visible and above the skin pimples, but I just can&#x27;t get out the deeper stuff with it.  </li>
            <li> Tried using it after a pretty rigorous workout, with my face all hot and sweaty.</li>
            <li> Even though sweat comes out of different pores than sebum, I think the moisture coming out of my skin is better than steam at wetting sebum in my clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I personally think my way of doing it works better</li>
            <li> This is my first time EVER doing this to my face or even purchasing something like this</li>
            <li> Came in on time and looks exactly like it&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m back to the low-tech technique of squeezing with my fingers :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> First off this is a quality tool.</li>
            <li> You can tell because they are white at the top and the skin has thinned.</li>
            <li> and thats exactly what I thought all this time.  </li>
            <li> So much!</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty congested, I&#x27;m a teenager.</li>
            <li> Or after steaming your face over hot water.</li>
            <li> A.&lt;br /&gt;I made a big mistake, more than once, and used Retin A.  </li>
            <li> I even wash my face with hot water to see if that will make a difference.</li>
            <li> If you apply to much strength it will hurt !</li>
            <li> This was my first pore extraction tool</li>
            <li> My husband gets pimples sometimes on his back and says this is much better (but not painless) than me trying to squeeze them.</li>
            <li> It really pops your pimples!</li>
            <li> Perhaps the first one was defective.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read up on proper use, I&#x27;ve seen some people with scars.</li>
            <li> If I had to replace it, I would try a different one, but it is ok.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is not the best product for my skin</li>
            <li> I feel like this product is more for people with blackheads that protrude quiet a bit.  </li>
            <li> When I first bought this black/white head removal tool I thought it was a scam.</li>
            <li> First time using this</li>
            <li> I first sanitized it and washed my face</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Well, I have been experiencing acne for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly as described and as in photo.</li>
            <li> but i guess each face is different and there are those who will love it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time purchasing or using a product like this</li>
            <li> AGAIN.WAS NOT EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> But you HAVE to use it after washing with hot water or after getting out of a steamy shower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After exfoliating in a hot shower this thing is quite handy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Never through this tool would help as much as it did but it does!</li>
            <li> And most likely, the bugger will still be there when you come to your senses...</li>
            <li> This tool is pretty nifty.</li>
            <li> it does pretty close to nothing.  </li>
            <li> It is made very well!</li>
            <li> exactly how well it works on face, but hopping it reduces scaring</li>
            <li> would rather recommend to choose something of a higher quality...</li>
            <li> Operator error most likely</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works much better on larger blemishes.</li>
            <li> My first time and I was tearing up.  </li>
            <li> like after a hot shower.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I never knew I had white heads until I bought this love it.</li>
            <li> If you use it a lot in one go, it will leave your face red - but it is infinitely better than breaking pimples with your fingers.  </li>
            <li> Also, be gentle with this!  </li>
            <li> When I first got these (before use)</li>
            <li> so maybe someone would be able to use both ends equally.</li>
            <li> It is well constructed and works great, especially if you steam your face first or use it after a long shower.</li>
            <li> Overall a cheap and good tool for blackheads or closed comedones.</li>
            <li> and it was TAPED up top from where you would open it.</li>
            <li> It will not work unless you just came out of a hot shower.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Unsure if just the design makes it that way, maybe a different one would work better</li>
            <li> This works really well!  </li>
            <li> Not functioning effectively as I had expected.</li>
            <li> This works alright and is pretty addicting for pickers.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using it after a hot shower or after you&#x27;ve been sweating because the pores are more open.</li>
            <li> First of all, this product works.</li>
            <li> as it&#x27;s good at getting stubborn blackheads out, the other side is mainly for whiteheads but works well.</li>
            <li> at first I was nervous to put too much pressure, because I thought that I would snap the loop right off but</li>
            <li> Out of many products like this, I finally decided to buy this one because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> leaves little red indents after use but faded quickly(I have very fair skin).</li>
            <li> It came nice and clean and in a small pouch.</li>
            <li> I followed other reviewer recommendations including using this after a shower, trying to cover my face in a warm washcloth beforehand, etc...</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep the loop flat on your skin.  </li>
            <li> The flat end is ok</li>
            <li> And assuming you clean the tool after use, more hygenic (less chance of infection of the area) than using your finger nails.</li>
            <li> When using this remember ONLY to use it when your whitehead is showing, then you gently push on top of the whitehead to get the puss out.</li>
            <li> But the end with the wire hoop is very effective for getting hard to reach places like the nostrils---but you absolutely need to steam your face for about 10-minutes beforehand.</li>
            <li> Most of us know from anecdotal experience that whiteheads look much better once drained, and they usually fade faster that way too!</li>
            <li> That being said, the small side works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> does pop/extract pimples/blackheads near the surface of the skin cleanly and without much effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this brand works better than others that look just like it, but this one works very well and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried it with a clean face, I have tried it right after a shower, I have even tried it after being outside all day hiking and sweating in 90 degree heat</li>
            <li> Anyway, I scrubbed the rust with some jewelery cleaner and make sure to dry it thoroughly after every use, so that should fix the problem.</li>
            <li> Simply steam your face a bit and this tool will help you easy remove blackheads, whiteheads or pimples in a way that will prevent scarring.</li>
            <li> This tool makes it so quick to remove them and you will be surprised with the amount of gunk you will see coming out of our pores and sticking to the extracting tool.</li>
            <li> It makes something that should be simple (but often isn&#x27;t), really easy.</li>
            <li> Soon enough, you&#x27;ll have a strong pimple hand and people will call you a pimple</li>
            <li> The opening is to large.</li>
            <li> and she was squeezing my pores which are really large and my t-zone always oily</li>
            <li> Either end is entirely to large.</li>
            <li> The large end broke a week after having it</li>
            <li> It is most helpful with loose blackheads and large whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Great for white heads and &amp;#34;ripe&amp;#34; black heads.  </li>
            <li> Also, this tool is not overly easy to use on stubborn blackheads - just ready to go white head pimples.</li>
            <li> Its useful to clean the clogged pores, without using your nails, easy to hold, the handle is long enough.</li>
            <li> Awesome for black heads especially, but also some white heads.  </li>
            <li> This is a handy little tool that everyone in my home loves.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little tool for extracting blackheads, it makes it easier not to damage the tender skin on the face.</li>
            <li> Nice little tool to remove pimples and blackheads without damaging the skin.  </li>
            <li> I recommend showering first to open up your pores and clean off any additional oil or gunk on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> I honestly only use the looped end (never found much use for the flattened side), but I still enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It is so much gentler than trying to squeeze with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I wish Amazon would be more careful with their descriptions.</li>
            <li> I had an almost identical tool that I lost and it was much gentler.</li>
            <li> really?  </li>
            <li> I am very cautious if and when I will use it.  </li>
            <li> Its cheap enough to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It hurts so much when you go over a whitehead.</li>
            <li> The loop end works really well for pushing pores.</li>
            <li> It has made my life a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li> This is a very well constructed piece of \\&quot;equipment\\&quot; and serves its purpose admirably.</li>
            <li> I went to e bay and bought a real one for 2.95 with an needle end.</li>
            <li> My nose was swollen for the day because I put so much pressure on it.  </li>
            <li> But will I put so much pressure on my nose?</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> (I am sure dermatologists everywhere are repulsed), but this is more difficult to use than it is worth in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Especially on sensitive areas like the inside edge of the ear.</li>
            <li> , but this does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> The tool has both ends to use for extractions and is very inexpensive and beats using your fingers that can leave scars.</li>
            <li> Just made a loop impression in my skin and extracted absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> but this tool cleaned my pores out really well.  </li>
            <li> so I can not complain much to pay for this</li>
            <li> It really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I scrape the whole face where I needed.</li>
            <li> This gently pushes around the zit and empties it.  </li>
            <li> but firmly haha)</li>
            <li> have not used yet, but looks like it is made very sturdy</li>
            <li> I just wish it didn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li> I try to only use it lightly after steaming</li>
            <li> I like to do gentle things on my face so this product just isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> You just have to gentle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really seem to do what it should.</li>
            <li> but when my boyfriend tried to use it, he audibly yelled, &amp;#34;OUCH!&amp;#34; because of how much it hurts.</li>
            <li> I really hope it works for you as it did for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> gets the job done fast</li>
            <li> Use gently.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get blackheads</li>
            <li> absolute rubbish</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this on acne that is ready to pop.</li>
            <li> It is made of stainless steel so it won&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li> This also works real well after you steam your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just press and caress and poke gently.  </li>
            <li> This really helped me.</li>
            <li> and it was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Steam your face beforehand and gently press.</li>
            <li> If the sebum doesn&#x27;t come out, the pore isn&#x27;t ready.</li>
            <li> I expected more.</li>
            <li> I thought it would really help extractions</li>
            <li> I guess, I just don&#x27;t use it much.  </li>
            <li> This did not work very well for me.</li>
            <li> its very sturdy.</li>
            <li> but they dont came out, maybe because I dont really know how to use it.</li>
            <li> But this one really hurts.  </li>
            <li> This tool is very sturdy however, and will get the job done.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me though, getting rid of blackheads</li>
            <li> I never have to touch my face with my hands or nails ever thanks to this.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> this has been an absolute blessing.</li>
            <li> I thought about it for a couple of weeks if I should really get this.</li>
            <li> I understand that popping pimples hurts, but this thing was WAY too much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work, but I don&#x27;t think the blemishes were ready.</li>
            <li> Got this to remove blackheads, but it doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t cut your skin, but in some areas it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> but it really hasn&#x27;t helped with my skin care.</li>
            <li> I get so much gunk off my nose</li>
            <li> ~ thank you so much....</li>
            <li> I never knew my pores held so much gunk until I started using this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier than popping with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much acne</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this comedone extractor because it was so affordable.</li>
            <li> so I expected better quality.</li>
            <li> It is much easier than squeezing, though.</li>
            <li> might as well just terminate your internet provider because if you can&#x27;t \\&quot;figure out\\&quot; how to use this, you shouldn&#x27;t even really be using your computer or Amazon.....</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I got much out with this tool.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not going to get everything unless you peel your skin off, which this tool is capable of doing.</li>
            <li> ingrown hairs (my nemesis), and blackheads without damaging skin as much as fingers or sharper tools</li>
            <li> and I got very spotty (three spots all in a line from cheek to chin).</li>
            <li> So if you are a picker you really ought to think twice.</li>
            <li> Good tool for blackheads in hard to reach places as long as they are easy to get out.</li>
            <li> If you want a clear face, buy this!!!</li>
            <li> If you have to clean one out, just use a pin to prick the surface open and use the large loop to gently push it out.</li>
            <li> I also find that it works fine if I place a hot (not TOO hot), damp cloth on the area for a few minutes first.</li>
            <li> So it seems to be serviceable tool that was not very expensive.  </li>
            <li> My skin is NOT sensitive and doesn&#x27;t get bruised easily.</li>
            <li> When a zit is fully ready to be popped, the hoop side is handy if the zit is small enough to fit in the hoop.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, I just could not get my face as clean with this as with using my own two fingers.  </li>
            <li> but even after all that I had to mash at my face to get just a very small amount out causing alot of discomfort and bright lines that stayed for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> This tool is able to clear all my pores without leaving unsightly red marks, and it can get into areas that I normally couldn&#x27;t get to before.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure it would work for some other people</li>
            <li> Does help to get infection out of zits without the trauma of squeezing, but other tool I have used works much better.  </li>
            <li> When I got it first, I was excited and used it on dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I never wear make up , so my skin is always kept as clean as possible.</li>
            <li> I will certainly review plethora of such tools offered again via Amazon/Seller in future and to pick out one or more of this type of tool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, highly portable and really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a handy way to pop out a potential zit but you really have to be careful.</li>
            <li> Firstly I am 22 years old and NEVER bothered cleaning my nose&#x27;s blackheads before.</li>
            <li> The first time it was used we were so surprised to how well it work.  </li>
            <li> hat i like about it the most this little curve at the end of each side it makes it really easier to work with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot more hygienic than using fingers to pop zits or remove black heads.</li>
            <li> For black heads, push gently on top until you get it out.</li>
            <li> Note that I have many tiny, pore sized whiteheads and blackheads on my face, chest and back.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting a different one at a local store and it&#x27;s held up much better.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this tool, but it works great and is very functional.</li>
            <li> Just this evening I was able to rid my face of a most difficult to remove blackhead located on the crease that shapes my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older now</li>
            <li> , this particular product is the cheapest I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it on the sides of my nostrils.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews i knew to was my face with hot water first to help open the pores</li>
            <li> I guess I needed more time steaming my pores open over the pot of boiling water, just to have the steam open up my pores a little more.  </li>
            <li> but I use the small loop for big ones also (especially when I need them to pop ;) lol).</li>
            <li> highly recommend that (although some of the video&#x27;s were...</li>
            <li> I wish I had this in high school.</li>
            <li> I saw a tutorial of this type of tool on youtube, and had high hopes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend those that have acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Very rarely will you ever use the large end for anything other than cleaning out a whitehead.</li>
            <li> I always steam my face before or do it right after a hot shower when the Pores are open and soft.</li>
            <li> I own several extraction tools and this one works extremely well for my needs.  </li>
            <li> love this little gadget.  </li>
            <li> Love this little wand.</li>
            <li> I figured having this tool was better than picking at my acne with my crummy little fingers.</li>
            <li> it was a bit difficult to use, but nonetheless a great product</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that expensive, so not that great of a loss.</li>
            <li> This tool can only do pretty much one thing</li>
            <li> and I did my normal face routine after.</li>
            <li> waste of my money for sure</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exciting aha and gross</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently started doing my own facial treatments.</li>
            <li> I would say only three blackheads came out with this product and it hurts if I use it on a fresh pimple.</li>
            <li> pretty much only use this tool after exfoliating my face because otherwise it takes too much pressure to extract anything.</li>
            <li> There may be a kind of tool that just has a circular opening that you push down with to get the deep ones out.</li>
            <li> The Body Toolz Double Loop Facial Skin Care Tool arrived quickly and is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Would not really recommend buying something like this unless you know exactly if its right for you.</li>
            <li> There is a slit on the back of the case, just under the white part, which permits easy removal and replacement.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Body Toolz Double Loop Facial Skin Care Tool and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> I was thinking it was an amazing easy zit popper black head remover, but it is quite hard to use and hurts a bit .</li>
            <li> Definitely do not use this product right before you go out-</li>
            <li> This is not made of cheap metal like other one.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> but it something I can live with.  </li>
            <li> It basically just gave me these huge red welts on my face without actually unclogging any pores.  </li>
            <li> Helps you get the blackheads out easily with less pain and damage to skin</li>
            <li> but I do not really have that many facial issues</li>
            <li> When I got it, I first took a hot shower and with not much luck continued to steam my face.</li>
            <li> This tool worked as anticipated, but one of the loops (the smaller one) broke off within 2 weeks with only light use.</li>
            <li> This might be for those facing the kind of acne that is serious but close to the surface.</li>
            <li> I looked into a 15x maginfied mirror and my skin was 1000% clean and clear of every single blackhead that lay beneath the surface.</li>
            <li> if used correctly though it heals very fast and actually helps your skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend going to a professional before trying anything like this.</li>
            <li> This is the only instrument that allowed me to remove an old, huge blackhead on my back.  </li>
            <li> The shipping to return will cost nearly the amount of the product, therefore I must warn you to stay away from this seller!</li>
            <li> That is what I remember a dermatologist using on me many years ago, but I&#x27;m not sure I remember correctly.</li>
            <li> Just saying, naturally it came from HongKong or China, but so did this one probably!</li>
            <li> I watched several YouTube videos before I purchased this tool and it performs exactly as what I&#x27;d hoped it would.</li>
            <li> a male, we tend to have bigger pores than females, so it&#x27;s more obvious to spot blackheads</li>
            <li> I just still have to figure it out completely !</li>
            <li> I love it, but if you have small pores leave it.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of an extractor before I got my first facial.  </li>
            <li> Exact opposite for this product!  </li>
            <li> Not only is this exactly what I wanted but it arrived quickly(2 days after order)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything else to say but apparently must write fifteen words.</li>
            <li> This is my second tool of this nature, the first being one I purchased at a drug store</li>
            <li> However I mainly use the small loop for most extractions since the big loop cant take care of the small pimples but its sometimes good for larger ones</li>
            <li> ive used ones that are a thinner wire loop, more control, but you can tear your skin up if you are not careful  this one is a little thicker  knurled grip works</li>
            <li> I only use the small loop, and it works great on my skin, dry or steamed.  </li>
            <li> I had black heads, puss filled pours I never knew were there.</li>
            <li> But I went on YouTube and after watching a few demonstrations, I easily got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have black/white heads, but I sometimes have a few pointy and bumpy grease deposits on my temples, chin and neck which can easily be removed by nails.</li>
            <li> Tried it on dry skin and fresh out of the shower as others suggested.</li>
            <li> The first time I got a professional facial</li>
            <li> Maybe there is some special technique to it that I am not aware of</li>
            <li> Bruises about the same as a bobby pin, requires a bit less pressure, and its slightly more effective.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> did work for my friend who had larger pores and more noticeably black heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small loop broke off the first one I bought quite quickly, but Amazon replaced it, no problem.  </li>
            <li> but I find I have to press pretty hard to get it to clean.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve noticed that I do have some instances in which the pressure I applied with this tool led to a 24 hour development of a large mass composed of blackheads, possibly created from irritation resulting from using this tool.    </li>
            <li> This leaves a large red mark and hurts while I do it.</li>
            <li> Kind of difficult to remove pores as the width of the rings are quite large.</li>
            <li> Takes technique, little practice, but honestly, it&#x27;s not too great.</li>
            <li> Some people report that it hurts, but if a little discomfort for a short time is the price to remove persistent acne, I am OK with that.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help clear my pores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it is another quality tool to help you get and maintain clear skin.</li>
            <li> Clearly there is nothing scientific in my opinion though.</li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s preferable to see a professional, so use caution and don&#x27;t put too much pressure on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can also use this to clear blocked pores that haven&#x27;t quite become a flared up pimple.  </li>
            <li> It really wouldn&#x27;t matter except I bought the tool for a completely different use than what it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
            <li> Maybe the loops are thicker than the old one I had</li>
            <li> I suspect that maybe a facial sauna would really help, but that is just not something I am trying to buy.  </li>
            <li> 17 years old loves it.  </li>
            <li> He lost his old one, so I got this as a replacement and it works just as well on them pesky poors.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any problems so far</li>
            <li> I recommend you sanitize the tool before use just in case, but overall very satisified with this purchase.</li>
            <li> You should probably only be targeting those pimples that are ready to pop.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the scars turned into scabs and dried up and fell off within 4 days or so.</li>
            <li> It got out the ingrown hairs, but not without considerable pressure being applied.</li>
            <li> My skin appears much clearer now because I don&#x27;t have red marks from squeezing blemishes.</li>
            <li> I am far-sighted and can&#x27;t really see well close up in a regular mirror.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made model and will last for years</li>
            <li> My pores have been very clogged recently, so I wanted something that allowed me to get rid of excess sebum.</li>
            <li> But, again, go to a professional to see how it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> Would recommend, ESPECIALLY for the price and no hassle fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and it is just like my old one I got from sephora.</li>
            <li> you have to use much pressure at all, the loops will bend and you&#x27;ll have to fix them back.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do the job as well as a professional would</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain especially for this price.</li>
            <li> maybe  put a topical antibiotic,  and you should be ready to try again in 24 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is so low that I don&#x27;t really mind, though.</li>
            <li> Surprised at the weight and finish of this comedone extractor.  </li>
            <li> what it is suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is really good.&lt;br /&gt;One is enuf for your basic pricking experiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If a gentle push does not get it out then do not proceed any further.</li>
            <li> Use only when skin is ready.</li>
            <li> The big side doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> this even after sanitizing seems to break me out considerably.</li>
            <li> Its looks are deceiving because it looks as though it would bend or break, but it is built well like a professional tool.</li>
            <li> I put it back in, but it popped right back out.</li>
            <li> The large, flat loop end of this tool does not seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to find a youtube video to find how to work this thing, but I&#x27;ve used blackhead removers in the past that worked easily.</li>
            <li> ---the flat end doesn&#x27;t do anything and can leave marks if you apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I attempted to use this product right after a hot shower (letting the steam open my pores a little).  </li>
            <li> so I glide the smaller loop around the sides of my nose and get all the small blackhead which look more like clogged pores cleaned out.  </li>
            <li> Two finger method didn&#x27;t work because it only seemed to depress the center even more.</li>
            <li> Those Biore strips only cause a few second of pain and get far more out than I ever got with this tool.</li>
            <li> It keeps everything clean and pops pimples with alot less frustration!</li>
            <li> Like other people said do not push real hard that will make it hurt lol.</li>
            <li> ridiculous,,this tiny little thing came in this big padded envelope which cost more than the item</li>
            <li> It is durable, easy to clean, and works on random big pimples without having to try and get an angle on it with fingers.  </li>
            <li> its long and has a knurled grip and is stainless steel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very helpful in the fact that when your skin is sensitive or you are having pain due to the pimple, these will provide enough force without hurting you that much.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but I trusted the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had known about this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Not what I exactly needed, through absolutely no fault of the Seller.</li>
            <li> Used hot, wet towels to soak skin.</li>
            <li> The big end is good for larger spots and the small end for smaller spots or on the remnants of the larger spot.</li>
            <li> the large side is for white heads the smaller side is for blackheads.</li>
            <li> However the round end is much too large or fat to apply the type of pressure I need to apply to extract blackheads.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it is much more hygienic than using my hands and does less damage to the skin.</li>
            <li> From someone who has suffered from breakouts my entire adolescent and young adult life...</li>
            <li> A light amount of pressure (try a few different angles if you need to)  should bring the blockage to the surface.</li>
            <li> The larger side for white pimples, works very well, hurts a little if you have sensitive skin, but took it right out.</li>
            <li> This tool does what it says it does, but it works alot better and its less painful if you wet your skin with warm water first.</li>
            <li> With that being said, this tool does a pretty good jobs with squeezing out my whiteheads, however, it doesn&#x27;t get them all out, but only probably because it becomes too painful to use after a while.</li>
            <li> At times, after a shower with steam, it helped a bit, but never any major pimple popping or acne removal.</li>
            <li> Hurts a little but fun</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for clearing up painful acne,</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, doesn&#x27;t make the area inflammed and red like when you try and use your hands to clear blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use this product several times and it never seems to fully remove a blackhead completely.</li>
            <li> It was as if I just spent 10 days on the beach in Puerto Rico, where your skin really clears out in that Caribbean air and sun.</li>
            <li> It was much sturdier than expected, works as advertised and it made of quality material.</li>
            <li> a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; but its worth the few bucks.</li>
            <li> Not horrible but not great.</li>
            <li> Pressing gently down on the target area and then more firmly, I saw the blackheads begin to come out.</li>
            <li> Ends are not very sharp but rounded like wire on one side.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken some really steamy long showers to open my pores with not much better of a result than from a quick shower.  </li>
            <li> I have used these for many years, this one is not different than most (with the exception of the flat white-hear loop, which I assume is to help prevent cutting but makes zits harder to pop), but these products in general must be used with caution.</li>
            <li> does nothing for me, invested in precision tweezers and magnifying mirror combined with old fashion squeezing you&#x27;ll get the job done much easier and with less pain</li>
            <li> but i should totally blame it on the product because it&#x27;s suppose to really work when i am sweating not when my face is dry.</li>
            <li> This tool is very helpful however, on certain parts of your face its hard to use like your brow bone, otherwise I would recommend it to anyone needing help with zits.</li>
            <li> It is a little painful since the best technique that works with my skin is to press it in near the handle part of the loop, circling the spot in the skin, and then slide the tool while adding a little more pressure as the inner round area of the loop gets to the spot.</li>
            <li> Looked closely for slight blockages,  and this tool brings everything right out,  before you get a bigger problem.</li>
            <li> The other end you really can&#x27;t  use.  </li>
            <li> The loop is too flat on one side, and too thick on the other to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Then one day it struck me that after my 30 minute cardio workouts, my body temperature stays higher than normal for at least another hour, and that the skin on my face gets moist from all the sweat coming out of my pores.</li>
            <li> The loop facial skin clear did not work on my blemishes at all, it only bruised the area I used it on.</li>
            <li> This tool works but you really have to be careful you&#x27;re not constantly spreading bacteria across your face.    </li>
            <li> I have to say, this tool seems very sturdy and well made, which makes it that much more of a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> had more of a down angle before the up angle on the small loop side like the picture they use for it...</li>
            <li> Handy little tool for black heads, but even after youtubing for videos on how to use the other end, nothing.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t a lot to say about this other than it works and it&#x27;s solid .  </li>
            <li> Since loosing this one I bought a kit with a few different types of heads and the ones on this tool are the only useful ones anyway.</li>
            <li> Push down gently.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they come in different sizes or if this one is just super tiny</li>
            <li> I pressed super hard and still no luck.</li>
            <li> The size of it, makes it too clumsy, rough and inaccurate, if you&#x27;re using on a specific blemish, it can actually weaken and damage the area more.  </li>
            <li> Not great, but good if you only want to target one tight area and shield the pores around that area with the flat spatula</li>
            <li> If your pores are not loose and open, this thing WILL damage skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend looking for the other model.</li>
            <li> it very bruised where I tried to remove an black head..</li>
            <li> You should use this if you have easy to get out white heads, because it doesnt work for tough ones.</li>
            <li> The only time anything came out was when I pressed super hard, leaving an indent in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Instead of pressing in, I firmly glide the big flat side of the tool over my pore areas with a cotton round (lightly soaked in rubbing alcohol) near by to wipe off what is extracted and the tool itself.</li>
            <li> So this tool works well for me to get crap out of my pores on my own especially after a shower or hot cloth compress on my face.</li>
            <li> This works very well at removing black and white heads.  </li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer mentioned, this tool doesn&#x27;t seem to work on all of your black/white heads... for me, it generally only works on the medium-sized ones which can get kind of frustrating.  </li>
            <li> found it a little hard to use in the beginning then moved to a better type</li>
            <li> I had to apply so much pressure for it to pop, definitely not worth it!    </li>
            <li> I really like this little tool.</li>
            <li> This little beauty tool is very nifty.  </li>
            <li> It hurts a little bit, but not too much.</li>
            <li> Just steam your face a little and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> Plus it is really hard to get them on your cheeks because you need to put a fair amount of pressure and without anything sturdy behind your cheek</li>
            <li> Not great for blackheads unless they are huge, but works well on solid pimples.</li>
            <li> Very therapeutic; the little suckers come right out, at once</li>
            <li> If the tool doesn&#x27;t get them right away, it will get them on the surface the next day, just don&#x27;t push too hard on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen that others need to steam their face in order to get black heads and while this is true for the really deep ones, the tool can be used everyday.</li>
            <li> If it was flat it would be slighty more difficult to get your blackhead/whiteheads/pimples out.</li>
            <li> I find the ends to be either too large or too small for proper use.</li>
            <li> I really like this tool because I can use it to get rid of small white head pimples</li>
            <li> The hoops are either too wide or not wide enough.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s pretty hard to get it to work, but when it does,</li>
            <li> In any case this one works reasonably well on blackheads, and the fact that the body of the tool is sort of nubby makes it easier to hold (less slipping).</li>
            <li> It expelled some white heads inside sunken pores (sorry if that&#x27;s TMI), but those are easy to get out anyway.</li>
            <li> One end is used for white heads and really gets all the gunk out, the other is used for black heads/clogged pours.</li>
            <li> The small loop works very well at cleaning your pores, for me specifically blackheads.</li>
            <li> The tool itself is small, but very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to try it on these small blackheads on the side of my face (where sideburns would grow).</li>
            <li> The loop doesn&#x27;t really help with small blemishes.  </li>
            <li> It is way to small and doesn&#x27;t work that well, not that recommended unless very patient.</li>
            <li> This implement is only 4\\&quot; long instead of the 6\\&quot; stated in the description.</li>
            <li> &quot; my skin with the side of the flat loop, almost like I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> but the product does work when you scrape skin with the flat side.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use the flat end</li>
            <li> Sturdy design means it will last a long time, too.</li>
            <li> long story short</li>
            <li> /&gt;The flat loop, I use the edge like I used to use my fingernail.</li>
            <li> I have dry Indian skin that gets oily only in my t section of the face.</li>
            <li> it is kind of impossible.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care about that as long as there&#x27;s no more blackheads</li>
            <li> I expected to improve my skin with it, but I think I&#x27;ll only use it as a very last resort.</li>
            <li> I give just 4 stars because the blackheads acne side is really good.but for other side is a little hurt me.</li>
            <li> I only give it 4 stars because I&#x27;ve had a different extractor (but much more expensive) where the loops were a little &amp;#34;bendier&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> thing to note is that it hurts a lot more to push on your face with the loop compared to using your fingers, but the lasting results are much better without dirty nails cutting into skin.</li>
            <li> I used a hot towel for loosening the pores and pushed the area with small part of the tool then slide to other direction.</li>
            <li> what I gather and my experience, the smaller loop is geared towards removing white heads, while the larger, flatter loop is used in a scrapping motion for removing black heads (this works well on the nose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ones that are pretty much impossible to get with your fingers, this will wipe them right</li>
            <li> I leaves absoltely NO dark spot (I&#x27;m black).  </li>
            <li> And unless you have fat gaping pores, this is really hard to use without making you cry the whole time you are using it.</li>
            <li> Disappointingly it seems that you need to have some pretty gnarly dirt pockets on your face for this to really do anything.  </li>
            <li> I have long nails, so using my fingers damages both my nails and my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought a generic version of this tool at a military PX.</li>
            <li> my pores are wide open.</li>
            <li> I would treat the area and after a long while it would scar and cyst.</li>
            <li> The loop on the smaller end was a lot thicker than I had expected.</li>
            <li> It stings to use, and does not clear my skin</li>
            <li> The extractor ends in my opinion are to thick and sturdy to really conform to the face.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this tool unless you are a professional this material is very harsh on your skin and will likely leave scars.</li>
            <li> A sterilized bobby pin would work as well for that black or white head buried in  facial skin.</li>
            <li> I mean it does pop some but not as much as i was hoping</li>
            <li> I got this because I hoped it would help me to extract the white heads on my nose, and I think both loops might be a little too big for that.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still necessary to get rid of a conspicuous black/white head and this little tool definitely reduces the trauma and</li>
            <li> I recommend getting this now because it doesn&#x27;t leave marks like some of the other blackhead extractors with those different shaped tips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painless, and it leaves your face a little red, obviously, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Just drag it across your skin with the wide loop or push gently with the small loop to get the deepest of problems.</li>
            <li> pretty sturdy but did bend a teeny bit when pushed down on face extremely hard...</li>
            <li> Never use on dry skin.</li>
            <li> useful in removing those ugly spots thanks</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it on dry skin as well</li>
            <li> There is no argument that this thing does what it&#x27;s meant for, whether you&#x27;re using it after steaming your pores or even if your face is dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortable, requires way too much pressure, and it&#x27;s 10 times rougher on your face than doing this the old fashioned way.  </li>
            <li> This tool gently extracts the gunk and there are no marks left behind.</li>
            <li> sorry, it&#x27;s kind of mean, but</li>
            <li> When It arrived it was in a little blue bag,and it was smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> One side is too rounded to hold still the other side is too flat and</li>
            <li> my skin looked like a burn victim</li>
            <li> think I need to let it loose</li>
            <li> it loose, let it loooooose</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how deep down the nastiness was until I watched that video.</li>
            <li> I get much less redness using a quality conservative tool to remove a big liberal whitehead/ blackhead</li>
            <li> and this helps me to squeeze out the white and the black heads with ease.love it .</li>
            <li> Left less bruising.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be used for tiny black heads.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bruise or damage my skin at all, it just leaves it really red for half an hour afterwards.</li>
            <li> but I saw my black heads and white heads coming out one after another!  </li>
            <li> But the tiny black spots remained.</li>
            <li> I use it for clearing out giant black heads and removing pimples.</li>
            <li> Gets those deeply rooted black heads all the time.  </li>
            <li> you have black heads, white heads--</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like white heads or black heads.</li>
            <li> Works to remove white and black heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad it was only about four bucks because I&#x27;ll never use it again. :(</li>
            <li> You will never be in danger of it moving or slipping while you let loose your pimple juice.  </li>
            <li> It is harder to get at tiny and oddly placed blackheads</li>
            <li> The secret to using this tool without making your face all red and leaving marks or blotches is to stretch the skin taught using your non-dominant hand (one finger on either side of the area), and rather than just pushing down with the tool, actually start a little before the blocked pore or blemish and gently (</li>
            <li> It really left my face hurting a little.</li>
            <li> but I got carried away and left marks and sores on my face and had to throw it out because getting those blackheads out was a little too &amp;#34;addictive&amp;#34; for me</li>
            <li> I wish the heads were a little bit bigger</li>
            <li> Both sides really work well to get even tough acne spots.  </li>
            <li> I no longer go thought the embarrassment of walking around with a giant, ugly, pus filled pimple.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s just this one or this tool in general, but doesn&#x27;t work as well as i wanted it to.</li>
            <li> At least for someone like me who only gets the occasional zit.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  </li>
            <li> Um...Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that the solder they used there is not stainless</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work, big waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have spent thousands over the years trying to get cleared.</li>
            <li> This tool works, but not as well as expected.  </li>
            <li> the blackhead pops out with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> It was faster than expected and like that it came in a lil pact where I can storage it in.</li>
            <li> I just wet my face</li>
            <li> Not much is ever visible on the surface of my skin, but you can feel the impurities beneath.</li>
            <li> Tried to remove clogged pore material to absolutely no avail.</li>
            <li> Use a different method to move these stubborn blemishes to the surface, then try the tool again a few days</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can leave some red marks from the tool around the area, but this will go away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Do not try to use this and try to pop acne that is not ready, it can lead to scaring.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and does not seem to work.</li>
            <li> You need to wet your skin if you want to remove the whiteheads.</li>
            <li> The smaller loop broke off after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very helpful.</li>
            <li> My skin does turn red after using this tool but it dissipates within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Longer side of loop does nothing but shorter side works as expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite nasty and fascinating at the same time.</li>
            <li> I really had to press down hard just to get a little bit of sebum.</li>
            <li> If you press too hard it leaves a little red mark and doesnt get out the white head.</li>
            <li> the more you use it the less painful it gets.</li>
            <li> giving this tool 4 stars, because I&#x27;m not sure it works well on exceptionally deep blackheads.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to keep using this over the next few days to purge my skin!</li>
            <li> -- I usually use the bigger loop.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, blackheads are not pretty whatsoever</li>
            <li> While this is an extremely sturdy tool, I don&#x27;t know if the thickness of the wire looping has anything to do with the pain that comes with using this or not, but that&#x27;s my problem with this tool.</li>
            <li> Usually within a minute or two of moisturizing I no longer have any redness to my skin, even if I go over my entire face with the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesnt do as much as my other tools.</li>
            <li> We will probably purchase other.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well in getting rid of the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; in your pores.</li>
            <li> Figured with the other reviews that I&#x27;d give this a try.  </li>
            <li> It works well on most blackheads - gets em out when squeezing just isn&#x27;t cutting it!</li>
            <li> Be careful when using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of extractor tools and never had issues.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the design or if the metal is too sharp, but this tool constantly cuts the skin and removes layers of skin instead of extracting blemishes.  </li>
            <li> The other one didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> Use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I use the small side and not the big side, though, so that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well any other time.  </li>
            <li> I usually get blackheads, and it definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as other products.</li>
            <li> I followed other reviewer advice and waited until after a shower to use it.  </li>
            <li> but it did not work like the other one.</li>
            <li> Dissapointed, and the other tip is i never use that because i dont have hugo acne/ black/whiteheads to po out..</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having a particularly hard time getting a pesky bugger out of your skin, put down the tool, go do some other stuff for a few days, then come pick your tool back up and try again.&lt;br /&gt;However, if I were to rate this based on how it helped my skin personally, I would give it a 4, but we rate on performance here, don&#x27;t we</li>
            <li> Without getting into the disgusting details, this unit works great and there is little to no bruising.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful if you are using an acid or Retin</li>
            <li> Very rough on skin.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very careful about where and how often i use this on my face.</li>
            <li> basically everything except the black center you&#x27;re trying to remove.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s slightly away from my face, and then I drag it across the area I want to &amp;</li>
            <li> After a warm exfoliation, my son used the Body Toolz Loop and realized he actually had a nasty black-head on his cheep - he now has an indentation (pock-mark).  </li>
            <li> For the small loop, I use it so the loop doesn&#x27;t sit flat against my face.</li>
            <li> The flat side is near useless and the thing wire side bent when I tried to get blackheads out, thought it might break and stab myself or something.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really hard to put back in as well&lt;</li>
            <li> In addition, it always leaves a red mark around the area that looks pretty bad until it fades away.</li>
            <li> And when it does work, it requires so much pressure that it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> you could press the thing on your face with all the patience, skill and competence you think you&#x27;re capable of &#x27;til you faint.</li>
            <li> If you do want to slide it then do it gently or after a cold splash of water to close your pores because you do not want to slide it over your face while your pores are open because dead skin can go into your pores again.</li>
            <li> I don;t know if i was using this product wrong or the blemish wasn&#x27;t ready to be taken care of, But it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> By the way you want to slowly turn the device clockwise or anti clockwise like a ranch to drain the zit, again ONLY if it&#x27;s FULLY come to head and is begging to be popped.</li>
            <li> The smaller loop is too thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite irritating to sensitive skin, so I advise those of you with skin like mine to use with caution.</li>
            <li> The metal loops are also little thicker than I expected compared to a previous one I had.  </li>
            <li> There goes $5.54 down the drain.</li>
            <li> I thought that the redness would go down, but it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was once asked if I got in a fight due to the marks on my face!  </li>
            <li> The openings themselves are large but worse yet, the metal loops are too thick.  </li>
            <li> The metal on this seems very sharp and hurts my face to use it.</li>
            <li> In other words, when I squeeze them, a firm whitish matter comes out.</li>
            <li> I will be getting another one and a few other tools for the stubborn ones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 ad I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne over half of my life.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the gaps are too small (or big?)</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to get rid of all my black heads</li>
            <li> Oh and it does hurt to use by the way for removing black heads.</li>
            <li> Thinks the big loop is useless but the tiny loop is AH MAY ZING.  </li>
            <li> I give this four stars instead of five because I used to have a Tweezerman extractor tool, and for whatever reason I found that one slightly easier to use.</li>
            <li> maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly but trying to clear clogged pores with this tool is painful and stressful on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Stretch the skin, apply pressure and they come out with less irritation than your fingers cause.</li>
            <li> and he says it hurts less then manually doing it.</li>
            <li> it helps extract pretty nasty gunk from my pores, so does it&#x27;s job pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Maybe an easier way of getting acne out then with fingers, less abrasive also.  </li>
            <li> This is a must have if you have blemishes and black heads etc.</li>
            <li> I found that it helps to remove the larger blackheads, although I still found it difficult to remove the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> Much less scarring than using fingernails, and healing time seems to be quicker.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re not careful, you can make your acne much worse by using your fingers to drain whiteheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have decent skin but get some blackheads in the pores on my nose, especially when I&#x27;m sick.</li>
            <li> I tried it on black heads a few times but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Presses out blackheads with little pressure.  </li>
            <li> sturdy little tool.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a ton of blemishes, but when I do I can&#x27;t resist the urge to pop the little buggers.</li>
            <li> It has become an addicting little habit for me to use this on my face.</li>
            <li> This tool is a little funky and takes some practice getting used to it.</li>
            <li> I then take one end of this tool, isolate the blackhead, apply a little pressure and presto...</li>
            <li> Well, what little you pay on it.</li>
            <li> It came out with a little effort.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would help me to remove the little whiteheads and blackheads that I get from time to time.</li>
            <li> The tips may bend a little bit after some use, but this thing does what it is supposed to</li>
            <li> I also put a little bit of neosporin on the popped zit to help prevent spread of bacteria.</li>
            <li> Helped extract from face with just a little pressure.</li>
            <li> I love this tool, I get pretty bad white heads that eventually turn into awful pimples.</li>
            <li> For blackheads, it&#x27;s just very large, and really impossible.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to press too hard</li>
            <li> The next day I was shocked on how clear my face looked, (I have oily, senitive skin)it didnt leave any marks like my fingers would</li>
            <li> Instead of using my hands, or really inconvenient q-tips (which doesn&#x27;t surround the zit), the tool makes it just sooo much easier.</li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews I thought I would try this product out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is well made - not cheap or flexible like the plastic ones.</li>
            <li> This is gonna sound filthy</li>
            <li> These are soft areas that are difficult to grip with the fingers in order to apply sufficient pressure to remove the blackhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and my face has drastically improved since using it.</li>
            <li> After watching a few youtube videos about doing extractions (specifically this one)</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> tool is made of heavy duty steel that will not bend.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> the wire loop end of this tool broke off after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fantastic.</li>
            <li> I watched a few videos on youtube to see how to use this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use this thing on my face a few times a week</li>
            <li> This is somewhat harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I would even wash my face afterwards and still would be broken out the next day.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times without any trouble.</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> so I stopped using an exfoliating brush for a few weeks</li>
            <li> were too thick would not scrape across the skin to grab pimles or black heads thumbs down</li>
            <li> but this things rolls out the black heads like a dream!</li>
            <li> This is why I have to use a magnifying glass; mine are not easily seen.</li>
            <li> The picture of the product is a little misleading the small hoop is pointed up.</li>
            <li> It is a really painful tool to use first off.</li>
            <li> Just a little mark!</li>
            <li> Not so well for small ones</li>
            <li> I prefer the Suvorna and Tweezerman 1.0 and 2.0 small loop.  </li>
            <li> I tried it out without any instructions at first and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> To sterilize the product (which I would recommend doing between every pimple or blackhead), I just dip it into a small cup of rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Also, it was not able to get rid of ONE blackhead.</li>
            <li> I use my fingers to remove whiteheads after steaming my face by wrapping small pieces of paper towels around my fingers (to push out and absorb the gunk).</li>
            <li> I have small pores that you can&#x27;t see unless you stand 1 inch away from my face.</li>
            <li> the big part is useless.</li>
            <li> With this tool, I used the small end.</li>
            <li> No more squeezing pimples.  </li>
            <li> No more sores.</li>
            <li> but my pores are really small</li>
            <li> Extractions are difficult to achieve without a leaving a red ring imprint on the skin.</li>
            <li> The bigger loops seems useless.  </li>
            <li> I could use my fingers - pointless device</li>
            <li> and it started to remove my small black/white heads with a breeze</li>
            <li> Not sure of its the design or what</li>
            <li> small loop end of this tool is the side that I use.</li>
            <li> I use the tool when the pimple is small and it doesn&#x27;t scar my face.</li>
            <li> The small case is a bit muskey, so I tossed it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only sad that I didn&#x27;t order one of these sooner, it could have prevented some scars I got by using my fingers.</li>
            <li> I learned by trial and error and am not sure if I am using it correctly.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> In fact, when cleaning pores/ popping pimples before, I would often have to do the area twice in the past.</li>
            <li> If I suspect a pimple is about to show up, I just press the area and it usually pops out.</li>
            <li> I recommend using it no more than once per week and sanitizing it between uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Squeezing them with fingers usually ends up in a scabbed mess.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Not only do my pimples heal faster, but they don&#x27;t get that nasty red inflammation for nearly as long.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> but it will help you extract small hard to pop blemishes on your nose cheeks or anywhere for that sake.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat delicate skin and my pores are quite small.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not very good for self-use a lot of the time, because you have to press REALLY hard to get those f*ckers out.</li>
            <li> Plus, the package it came it was broken, and it was sliding half way through it when I got it.</li>
            <li> The Body Toolz is a touch less delicately crafted but not clintonesque crude enough to hurt your hand or face in its use.  </li>
            <li> but it hurts if you press too hard</li>
            <li> Was hard to get used to, but I think I am getting the hang of it.</li>
            <li> To the person that said using this tool hurt them: I don&#x27;t think you should press so hard that it hurts.</li>
            <li> It also helps to remove any boils/zits that are under my beard and hard to pinch with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I have read the directions, but can&#x27;t see how it can help the hard ingrown pimples on my face.  </li>
            <li> I do not know if that is from my pores or because the product is hard to use but it works for what you need it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get them out even after steaming my face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press so hard that you damage your skin.</li>
            <li> No digging, picking or pushing so hard that you injure the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> I still get scars or blood when using this, if I push too hard.</li>
            <li> You will damage your skin by forcing out through hard skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it was way to hard on my delicate skin.</li>
            <li> A little painful and make your nose red.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m going to use it at least.</li>
            <li> be careful, you may become addicted, too!</li>
            <li> it was not a nice.  </li>
            <li> educating myself a bit, I tried this sucker out - works as described.</li>
            <li> I popped those suckers with this tool and got all the gunk out using both ends.</li>
            <li> contacted the seller two days after, on July 19th, about the product being late.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well on my thick leathery man-skin.  </li>
            <li> wire loop end is too thick.</li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not well made.</li>
            <li> As you might know, it&#x27;s only gonna make it worst to try and squeeze your skin with your bare hands</li>
            <li> however I found it hard to use it correctly because the whitehead side was a little hard to maneuver around weird angles.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to get black heads out of hard to reach places and got this and its useless.</li>
            <li> Do NOT use the small end on a whitehead, you might just end up irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> it was very painful the first time using</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> and it left horrible red marks on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very sharp and painful, not worth it</li>
            <li> so well when I have a bad spot, especially deep ones.</li>
            <li> So I have to say, using this tool is painful, and makes my nose red.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not remove blackheads, it leaves nasty red marks from broken blood vessels.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#x27;s a tad painful to use.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I tend to get blackheads in hard-to-grasp spots on my face, usually around the creases of my nose/mouth.  </li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed especially if you breakout alot.</li>
            <li> so I have to press it very hard against my skin in order to get the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; out.</li>
            <li> You have to press very hard sometimes and use a dragging motion.  </li>
            <li> Use it to extract blackheads on skin that is very hard to manipulate without a tool.  </li>
            <li> Together, we are like Marvel&#x27;s Avengers in conquering the ever expanding black and white head armies of evil.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t push very hard at all and ended up with worse looking skin than when I started.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to tell when I push too hard, because I&#x27;m not squeezing with my fingers.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re incredibly bad gripped or find yourself in the predicament of having wet / silicone hands grips (for what ever reason you have silicone on your hand in the shower) that might be a feature to focus on.  </li>
            <li> My face looked worse from taking the blackheads out than leaving them in.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately i&#x27;m addicted to using this tool.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m exhausted after working on my homework all day.)</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t bent or broken so why not give it five stars ?</li>
            <li> Removes blemishes without causing unnecessary damage to skin.</li>
            <li> It was frustrating.</li>
            <li> and they get worse some times, so</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> But now my boyfriend and I are both ADDICTED.</li>
            <li> Well, my face is worse.</li>
            <li> It seems to be sturdy and well made, but there might be a problem with the idea behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will make your habit worse.</li>
            <li> but I think this makes it feel less painful.</li>
            <li> No more expensive facials for me!</li>
            <li> it was raw!!!  </li>
            <li> I was truly fascinated by it since I hated seeing those nasty little buggers around my nose and near my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I got it because my friend recommended it, but it was completely useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did NOT work</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nearly useless tool.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> WTF?</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> WTF is this thing supposed to do?</li>
            <li> not that expensive</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.  </li>
            <li> I just selected the wrong implement for my needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so weird seeing my skin and not debris.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> , I guess maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong?</li>
            <li> I might be doing it wrong, so who knows.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t use it anymore; compare to this tool the wash is useless).</li>
            <li> One side is useless, but the narrower side is as if I just came from a $1,000.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Sadly I got my hopes up.</li>
            <li> Ever since seeing a girl on YouTube use one of these to extract her pores, I&#x27;ve been obsessed with it.</li>
            <li> I never knew this type of tool existed until I randomly clicked on a youtube video that demonstrates how this works in removing blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Also for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong?</li>
            <li> Allows you to get in difficult spots like the bottom sides of your nose.</li>
            <li> I was wrong,</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I do not have terrible skin, but I do get the occasional pimple.</li>
            <li> but maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product itself.</li>
            <li> The base to hold is not very comfortable and is a bit awkward to hold.  </li>
            <li> I praticed manually removing these nasty little things with my fingers for years, even though it&#x27;s always cautioned not to do so by dermatologists.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (sorry for bad grammar &amp; typos.</li>
            <li> I washed my face with cold water to close the pores.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this over using your dirty ass fingernails.</li>
            <li> My tool has started to rust, which is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Thought I found THE way to get rid of those nasty black heads!</li>
            <li> Boy was it uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> Just need to steam face for about 5-10 minute, then go to town on those bad boys...</li>
            <li> and it is a bad way to pop zits.</li>
            <li> I know its a bad habit and that I should try not to pick at my face at all, but</li>
            <li> it hurts so bad</li>
            <li> I guess my black/whiteheads problem is not that bad after all.......</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was shocked to see that they had sent the Trim brand skin tool...</li>
            <li> Sometimes it was also painful to use.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit painful, but for the majority of the time it is fine.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Honestly, the product that came is the right shape, but too big.  My facialist showed me hers, which always leaves my face so clean, (she&#x27;s the reason I bought one), and hers is about 2/3 the size of this or smaller.  The size of it, makes it too clumsy, rough and inaccurate, if you&#x27;re using on a specific blemish, it can actually weaken and damage the area more.  Good concept, over done.</li>
            <li> it works very well with out causing discomfort, its a good quality tool, my son teenager likes it too for acne.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. It is so much gentler than trying to squeeze with your fingers.</li>
            <li> This implement is only 4\\&quot; long instead of the 6\\&quot; stated in the description. It really wouldn&#x27;t matter except I bought the tool for a completely different use than what it&#x27;s intended for. I want to use it for a clay craft project. I wish Amazon would be more careful with their descriptions.</li>
            <li> So I have to say, using this tool is painful, and makes my nose red. With that being said, this tool does a pretty good jobs with squeezing out my whiteheads, however, it doesn&#x27;t get them all out, but only probably because it becomes too painful to use after a while.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal- the smaller side is a bit rough and puts too much pressure but the larger, flatter side is awesome!</li>
            <li> Product was as i ordered but packaging was ridiculous,,this tiny little thing came in this big padded envelope which cost more than the item</li>
            <li> Works good on large blackheads ready to come out already. Not so well for small ones</li>
            <li> This thing is very usable and inexpensive!    I purchased the   1) Suvorna Whitehead / Acne Remover and Comedone Extractor   2) Tweezerman Skin Care Tool   3) Body Toolz Double Loop Facial Skin Care Tool    First off all three work! And they all work well.. I get much less redness using a quality conservative tool to remove a big liberal whitehead/ blackhead then fingers etc.  I think both the Tweezerman and the Suvorna are expertly crafted.  Note My 1st Tweezerman 1.0 (stolen by an ex who scoffed at the idea) had more of a down angle before the up angle on the small loop side like the picture they use for it... my new one since stolen by latest ex Tweezerman 2.0 is much flatter (picture posted)    The Body Toolz is a touch less delicately crafted but not clintonesque crude enough to hurt your hand or face in its use.  The handle is just not as expertly refined.  Although, if you use it in the shower with silicone on your hand the grips can be quite nice.  The Suvorna also has silicone shower friendly grips, yet they are expertly refined. If you&#x27;re incredibly bad gripped or find yourself in the predicament of having wet / silicone hands grips (for what ever reason you have silicone on your hand in the shower) that might be a feature to focus on.  I happen to like to shave and use it in the shower (sans silicone) with the Ace Fogless Shower Mirror is reaganesque innovative entrepreneur genius I must say!      Loops:  I prefer the Suvorna and Tweezerman 1.0 and 2.0 small loop.  I prefer the firmness of the Body Toolz big loop.     How would I rate them for myself considering my shower hands? 1) Suvorna 2) Body Toolz 3) Tweezerman.    How would I rate them according to the quality of craft? 1) Tweezerman 2) Suvorna 3) Body Toolz.    With all that said what would I buy? They all work and well, you can&#x27;t lose with them.  I would order 2 of the Body Toolz (and with free shipping it&#x27;s the on all of them right now) you can place one in the car (with a 10% benzoyl peroxide solution for after use) and one in your shower or make-up mirror for aprox the same as the others.  I order 3-4 at a time and just count on GFs stealing them.  In fact, I look at every girl I meet at the bar and say \\&quot;ya she is gonna cost me two drinks and $5.45 body toolz\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The metal on this seems very sharp and hurts my face to use it. I had an almost identical tool that I lost and it was much gentler.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well on my thick leathery man-skin.  But, my GF says it works great and I guess that&#x27;s what matters.  I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> very solid tool, not flimsy like others - definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I have never used a tool like this before.  I tried it out without any instructions at first and was disappointed. But I went on YouTube and after watching a few demonstrations, I easily got the hang of it.  Like other people suggest, it works best on skin that is steamed.  I also find that it works fine if I place a hot (not TOO hot), damp cloth on the area for a few minutes first.</li>
            <li> The small loop works very well at cleaning your pores, for me specifically blackheads. Just make sure your skin is loosened up from warm water so the tool can do the purging.  Very rarely will you ever use the large end for anything other than cleaning out a whitehead. Do NOT use the small end on a whitehead, you might just end up irritating the skin. If you have to clean one out, just use a pin to prick the surface open and use the large loop to gently push it out. Just make sure you&#x27;ve clean your tools with some rubbing alcohol!  Even though I&#x27;ve gotten over most of my acne, I still find it a crucial tool for cleaning up the obscure blackhead here and there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, this can hurt at times. On the other hand, it is much more hygienic than using my hands and does less damage to the skin. I would also say that it&#x27;s faster. I have long nails, so using my fingers damages both my nails and my skin. After using this tool, you will probably have redness so I recommend using it at night.  To sterilize the product (which I would recommend doing between every pimple or blackhead), I just dip it into a small cup of rubbing alcohol. I follow a session by washing my face and applying an overnight salicyclic acid cream ([[ASIN:B003690SF4 Clearasil Ultra Overnight Lotion, 1.3 Ounce]]).</li>
            <li> I have one of these already, but the design is different. On that product, one end looks like a circle with a hole in it.  This version does not work as well. I highly recommend looking for the other model. It works significantly better.</li>
            <li> Bruises about the same as a bobby pin, requires a bit less pressure, and its slightly more effective.&lt;br /&gt;Not a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; but its worth the few bucks.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for me. I got it because my friend recommended it, but it was completely useless. Plus, the package it came it was broken, and it was sliding half way through it when I got it.</li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews I thought I would try this product out.  Unfortunately it did NOT work has I had hoped! :-\  I would not recommend purchasing this device since it didn&#x27;t do what it was intended to do!</li>
            <li> Totally amazed at how good this works!!  Presses out blackheads with little pressure.  Does not leave a mark.  Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!!  Worth twice the price for sure.</li>
            <li> Great product works well!</li>
            <li> To be honest when I saw a review that said it didn&#x27;t work well I thought - really?  How can that be possible?  This tool can only do pretty much one thing and it looks exactly the same as another tool I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  Well, I was wrong.  First of all - this thing hurts.  OK, OK, I know it is not supposed to be fun to use this item but it hurts if you press too hard but I felt like I had to press harder than the old one I had for it to work.  Maybe the loops are thicker than the old one I had but it leaves big time marks and once it even cut the skin on the side of my nose.  I am very cautious if and when I will use it.  It is OK.  Not horrible but not great.</li>
            <li> love it .its great as i dont ve to spend for a facial too often to get my white heads removed. i do regular packs at home and this helps me to squeeze out the white and the black heads with ease.love it . its great.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, I just could not get my face as clean with this as with using my own two fingers.  This is ok for me to to use with visible and above the skin pimples, but I just can&#x27;t get out the deeper stuff with it.  I&#x27;ve taken some really steamy long showers to open my pores with not much better of a result than from a quick shower.  I suspect that maybe a facial sauna would really help, but that is just not something I am trying to buy.  This would be great if it worked for you, it just hasn&#x27;t worked too well for me.  Its cheap enough to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Does the job. sturdy little tool.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how people use this tool?    It hurts so much when you go over a whitehead. I had to apply so much pressure for it to pop, definitely not worth it!    Also, it was not able to get rid of ONE blackhead. I pressed super hard and still no luck.</li>
            <li> The loop end works really well for pushing pores. The other end seems pretty useless, but maybe it functions better on other peoples&#x27; pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well made - not cheap or flexible like the plastic ones.</li>
            <li> Does not do the job. It&#x27;s a nearly useless tool. A sterilized bobby pin would work as well for that black or white head buried in  facial skin.</li>
            <li> This tool works but you really have to be careful you&#x27;re not constantly spreading bacteria across your face.    When I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve noticed that I do have some instances in which the pressure I applied with this tool led to a 24 hour development of a large mass composed of blackheads, possibly created from irritation resulting from using this tool.    I&#x27;m just suggesting it&#x27;s used sparingly, that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m going to use it at least.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a Body Toolz skin tool and loved it. I wanted to get another for my teen, so I hopped online and purchased this one. When it arrived I was shocked to see that they had sent the Trim brand skin tool...I could have purchased that at my local Wal-Mart for $1.88. Entirely disappointed! The shipping to return will cost nearly the amount of the product, therefore I must warn you to stay away from this seller!</li>
            <li> I want to 2nd this excellent suggestion. I bought a generic version of this tool at a military PX. Tried using it after a pretty rigorous workout, with my face all hot and sweaty. After I caught on to the right pressure, angle and so on, it worked great. Blackheads came out and no damage to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this tool 4 stars, because I&#x27;m not sure it works well on exceptionally deep blackheads. Further testing may prove it does, but in my initial use I had difficulty with the deep ones. There may be a kind of tool that just has a circular opening that you push down with to get the deep ones out. That is what I remember a dermatologist using on me many years ago, but I&#x27;m not sure I remember correctly.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I only wish i would have found it years ago...I&#x27;m sure it would have prevented many scars.</li>
            <li> This tool does what it says it does, but it works alot better and its less painful if you wet your skin with warm water first. Other than that, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Good for getting the stubborn zits</li>
            <li> When I got it first, I was excited and used it on dry skin. It did not work!    Then, as per youtube instructions i \\&quot;steamed\\&quot; my face for 15 minutes over a pan of boiling water and a towel over my head. Then I used the tool. This worked okay, but it was a hassle and not as effective. I was like.... meh...    Then one day it struck me that after my 30 minute cardio workouts, my body temperature stays higher than normal for at least another hour, and that the skin on my face gets moist from all the sweat coming out of my pores. So I USED THE TOOL RIGHT AFTER MY WORKOUT. And it got rid of ALL my black/white heads. Even though sweat comes out of different pores than sebum, I think the moisture coming out of my skin is better than steam at wetting sebum in my clogged pores. Also, I continue to sweat for atleast another 15-20 minutes after I am done with my workout, so that gives me enough time to get rid of the gunk on my face.    I \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; my skin with the side of the flat loop, almost like I&#x27;m shaving. On my nose, chin, and sometimes cheeks, I use downward strokes. On my forehead, I go sideways, starting from the middle (the direction of my eyebrows). My skin will get red after use, but once I&#x27;m done showering, all the redness goes away, and then I moisturize my face.     I do this twice a week because that&#x27;s how often I do cardio. Some people might say \\&quot;this is too damaging for your skin\\&quot;. Well its not for my skin, and that is all I can say about that. This tool is cheaper than those strips, and it is to \\&quot;pore gunk\\&quot; what tweezers are to hair.</li>
            <li> I have a Conair steaming system as well as a cleansing brush system. I use these items as a mini spa at my home. It is effective in cleaning out my pores. I like it.</li>
            <li> 17 years old loves it.  He lost his old one, so I got this as a replacement and it works just as well on them pesky poors.</li>
            <li> If you have blackheads or even white heads that need to be popped, this tool is for you!  Get Poppin!</li>
            <li> I tried it and it was way to hard on my delicate skin. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> Was hard to get used to, but I think I am getting the hang of it. Like other people said do not push real hard that will make it hurt lol. I think the best way is to steam your face with a hot rag and than do it, because your pores are open and you can get the stuff out a lot easier.</li>
            <li> An amazing tool. hat i like about it the most this little curve at the end of each side it makes it really easier to work with it</li>
            <li> Just saying, naturally it came from HongKong or China, but so did this one probably! With the money you save you can buy a product to go along with it from here!</li>
            <li> Good quality product, removes some of the surface whiteheads. I use my fingers to remove whiteheads after steaming my face by wrapping small pieces of paper towels around my fingers (to push out and absorb the gunk). I personally think my way of doing it works better but the product does work when you scrape skin with the flat side. When a zit is fully ready to be popped, the hoop side is handy if the zit is small enough to fit in the hoop. By the way you want to slowly turn the device clockwise or anti clockwise like a ranch to drain the zit, again ONLY if it&#x27;s FULLY come to head and is begging to be popped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to get one of this tool.  I don&#x27;t run into problem like most of the review said that they cannot get the pore clean.  It is easy to use and clean, just wish I have it earlier.</li>
            <li> Works great, it gets the stubborn pimples and black heads with ease.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  Works about as well as using your fingernails, except it hurts more.  Don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m in the category of people this just doesn&#x27;t work on.  I&#x27;ve tried it fresh out of the shower, after a work out, etc and it just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I have to say, this tool seems very sturdy and well made, which makes it that much more of a disappointment.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> This little tool will get rid of as many white/black heads as you could remove with your own hands (nails?) but with half the effort, 10% of the time and the irritation and recovery time greatly reduced. Very therapeutic; the little suckers come right out, at once and the whole thing, how satisfying. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have black/white heads, but I sometimes have a few pointy and bumpy grease deposits on my temples, chin and neck which can easily be removed by nails. Since it is advised not to use hands, I thought this tool might be helpful. I did just as in the video, used it like an icecream scoop, with a curling move, but it did not work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. Better then my hands I&#x27;d say. Left less bruising. Can&#x27;t be used for tiny black heads. IT&#x27;s only for bigger ones.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work for you then you aren&#x27;t using it properly! This is my first time EVER doing this to my face or even purchasing something like this but OH BOY does it work! I am satisfied with it and I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there but this does it for me and the price...can&#x27;t beat that. I did a youtube search on how to use this and also google and that&#x27;s how I figured out how to use this gadget &#x3D;D hope this helps</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time.  Not only does it not remove blackheads, it leaves nasty red marks from broken blood vessels. I didn&#x27;t push very hard at all and ended up with worse looking skin than when I started.  You&#x27;re better off steaming your face and doing it by hand.</li>
            <li> i use this often. after taking a shower is the best time for me bc my pores are wide open. the large side is for white heads the smaller side is for blackheads. i would watch youtube videos as well to make sure you do it the right way or you could end up hurting your skin more. if used correctly though it heals very fast and actually helps your skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this little tool. It works well on me and I would surely recommend it. I have not had any problems so far but I do not really have that many facial issues so I do not use it that often at this point but it is nice to have around for when those days come up that you do! I have not had to steam my face or doing anything to get it to work. It just works whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> Came in on time and looks exactly like it&#x27;s pictured. I recommend you sanitize the tool before use just in case, but overall very satisified with this purchase. I bought this along with a facial hydration system (basically a steamer for your face) and it&#x27;s the best combo!~ It&#x27;s easier to remove blackheads and/or whiteheads when you&#x27;ve opened your pores so, removing all the gunk from your nose is way~~~ easier with this tool rather than squeezing your nose with something else.</li>
            <li> It  does everything I want it to! Gets my pores clean and helps me get areas I couldn&#x27;t get before.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;loops&#x27; on this thing are tiny!  Not sure if they come in different sizes or if this one is just super tiny (the description said nothing about this) but it is not something I&#x27;ll be able to use as a result.  Unless your blemishes are the size of a grain of sand, I&#x27;d look for something a bit more substantial.</li>
            <li> It took a couple mins of practice for me to figure it out. but this things rolls out the black heads like a dream! for whiteheads make sure u exfoliate first. leaves little red indents after use but faded quickly(I have very fair skin). It has made my life a whole lot easier. Note: do not force it! Push down gently.</li>
            <li> ive used ones that are a thinner wire loop, more control, but you can tear your skin up if you are not careful  this one is a little thicker  knurled grip works well too  great deal</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice little plastic case and looks like a cool tool, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make it work for me. Now I&#x27;m back to the low-tech technique of squeezing with my fingers :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a ton of blemishes, but when I do I can&#x27;t resist the urge to pop the little buggers. My girlfriend pointed out one of these types of tools in CVS one day, but being the Amazon-addict that I am, I waited until I got home to order one online.     This is a very well constructed piece of \\&quot;equipment\\&quot; and serves its purpose admirably. It does an EXCELLENT job of extracting white heads and black heads. One end is used for white heads and really gets all the gunk out, the other is used for black heads/clogged pours. This requires a bit more work, but still does a great job. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin agitated and puffy like my fingernails do.     If you get the occasional blemish, get one of these. They are cheap, easy to use, and effective.    Recommended: Absolutely!</li>
            <li> It hurts when my girlfriend does it to me. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> sorry but it did not work the ends were too thick would not scrape across the skin to grab pimles or black heads thumbs down</li>
            <li> Totally broke me out and caused deep, cystic pimples to appear! Even though I cleaned my skin, sterilzed the tool, etc I found it damaged my skin more than it did any good. This isn&#x27;t worth more than $2, $8 is a scam.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to clean out your pores before scrubbing, but it can harm your skin if you dig too much, so be gentle!</li>
            <li> The extractor ends in my opinion are to thick and sturdy to really conform to the face.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help clear my pores.  It basically just gave me these huge red welts on my face without actually unclogging any pores.  I followed other reviewer recommendations including using this after a shower, trying to cover my face in a warm washcloth beforehand, etc... Nothing seemed to help.  I&#x27;m planning on throwing this torture device away and going to see a dermatologist.  I would not even order this if it were free.</li>
            <li> Gets those nasty blemishes out of your pores with this loop. Two sizes on either end. Be careful not to press too hard or you will regret it.</li>
            <li> First off this is a quality tool.Were this tool shines is around the nose area. The first time you use this you will be amazed at how much better it works than trying to use your fingers. I bought one for my teenage doughter and saw how good it worked then got one for myself. I was using those sticky strips but this works much better. This is a no brainer!</li>
            <li> The flat side is near useless and the thing wire side bent when I tried to get blackheads out, thought it might break and stab myself or something. Good tool for blackheads in hard to reach places as long as they are easy to get out. Also seems more sanitary than using your nails/fingers to remove blackheads/zits.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and exactly as described.  It works well too.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I just got mine yesterday and my skin feels seriously so much better!  I&#x27;m 22 ad I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne over half of my life. I&#x27;ve been to so many different dermatologists, paid for so many visits and prescriptions, and have had so many allergic reactions. I&#x27;m so glad to find something that I don&#x27;t have to worry bout the side effects and long-term effects. Note that I have many tiny, pore sized whiteheads and blackheads on my face, chest and back. They are mainly more firm, and not the runny, puss-filled kind. In other words, when I squeeze them, a firm whitish matter comes out. While washing my face today with a benzoyl peroxide wash, I ran this across my face and it got about a third of the acne out and brought about another third closer to the surface. I can&#x27;t wait to keep using this over the next few days to purge my skin! I plan on using this along with my doctor prescribed Retin-A micro gel, clyndamycin gel, and benzoyl peroxide face wash. I also just bought a salicylic acid peel to add to my regimine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best $7 anyone with acne should invest in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. To the person that said using this tool hurt them: I don&#x27;t think you should press so hard that it hurts. You should probably only be targeting those pimples that are ready to pop. You can tell because they are white at the top and the skin has thinned. So for those that have those deep, under skin postular acne, I don&#x27;t this will be effective for you.</li>
            <li> Wish I had one of these during my teens.</li>
            <li> Useless. The mechanics of this thing give it no use for removing any kind of pimple. WTF? No matter how you try to use it, it&#x27;s just............. Useless. WTF is this thing supposed to do?</li>
            <li> Um...Works as expected.  Solid build quality.</li>
            <li> To quote a line from the Jim Carrey movie, Liar Liar, &amp;#34;Ehhh I&#x27;ve had better.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I used a hot towel for loosening the pores and pushed the area with small part of the tool then slide to other direction. It works really nice.</li>
            <li> This is a really great tool for removing blackheads and popping pimples (that have already come to a head). It doesn&#x27;t bruise or damage my skin at all, it just leaves it really red for half an hour afterwards. The reason I gave this 4/5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t work well for removing blackheads on my nose for some reason, so I&#x27;ll have to stick to using pore strips for that area. For the price and quality of this, it&#x27;s a must-have.</li>
            <li> This does not work. The opening is to large. I went to e bay and bought a real one for 2.95 with an needle end. I would save your money.</li>
            <li> I got this because I hoped it would help me to extract the white heads on my nose, and I think both loops might be a little too big for that. Works well on the occasional breakout though.</li>
            <li> This little beauty tool is very nifty.  Works well for removing blackheads -- I usually use the bigger loop. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it!  I honestly thought it wouldn&#x27;t work but it did! Except don&#x27;t try this before a date!  It left scars on my nose that are VERY visible lol. Read the end of my post. This is gonna sound filthy but I saw my black heads and white heads coming out one after another!  Firstly I am 22 years old and NEVER bothered cleaning my nose&#x27;s blackheads before. I have dry Indian skin that gets oily only in my t section of the face. My skin is NOT sensitive and doesn&#x27;t get bruised easily. I went for a facial but the lady couldn&#x27;t take my blackheads out probably because she was scared of bruising me. Than she said it&#x27;s just probably tiny hair and thats exactly what I thought all this time.  So I went ahead and waxed my nose lol. But the tiny black spots remained. So I was convinced I have blackheads. So I went to workout, came home, showered. Than I boiled some water and took a towel, covered my face and head to get the steam. Now I tried to use the face tool to push off and remove the blackheads. I went section by section so after every section I took steam. It hurt! So much! I was tearing up every time I used the tool on my face. I have small pores that you can&#x27;t see unless you stand 1 inch away from my face. Anyway,  when after it was done, I used a cutip to clean and washed the tool with warm water.  I washed my face with cold water to close the pores. My nose was swollen for the day because I put so much pressure on it.  It left scars that didnt start disappearing until 2 weeks later. So don&#x27;t try this an hour before a date or a party. Will I do this again? Yes! Its helping me clean my pores! But will I put so much pressure on my nose? Probably not. Next time I&#x27;ll just do the left side of my nose,  wait for a week or 2 than do right side of the nose. So yes its affective!  Buy it!</li>
            <li> This skin care tool was a good price and is a good product. It has become an addicting little habit for me to use this on my face.</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer mentioned, this tool doesn&#x27;t seem to work on all of your black/white heads... for me, it generally only works on the medium-sized ones which can get kind of frustrating.  Plus it is really hard to get them on your cheeks because you need to put a fair amount of pressure and without anything sturdy behind your cheek it is kind of impossible.</li>
            <li> Great price and removes blackheads safely</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty congested, I&#x27;m a teenager. When I got it, I first took a hot shower and with not much luck continued to steam my face. It worked okay however I was expecting with all of that some better results. I do like the smaller wire end as it&#x27;s good at getting stubborn blackheads out, the other side is mainly for whiteheads but works well. Overall it&#x27;s a pretty good product however I found it hard to use it correctly because the whitehead side was a little hard to maneuver around weird angles.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I use this product all the time and it works great! We use the skinnier loop as we&#x27;ve found it tends to work better for us. But it does such a great job getting rid of acne and leaves my face feeling clean after I use it!</li>
            <li> This is a good little tool to have. I have Hidradenitis suppurativa, so I am used to having cysts and boils on my body, but it also makes me susceptible to smaller boils and zits on my face. I like to use this after a shower, so my skin is softer and the affected area is easier to work with. It also helps to remove any boils/zits that are under my beard and hard to pinch with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I really like this products, gets my pores very clean and unclogged.</li>
            <li> This tool is a little funky and takes some practice getting used to it. Instead of pressing in, I firmly glide the big flat side of the tool over my pore areas with a cotton round (lightly soaked in rubbing alcohol) near by to wipe off what is extracted and the tool itself. Oil and dirt are pushed out and it&#x27;s something you may want to use at night. I am fair skinned and it makes my pore areas a bit red, but it&#x27;s fine by morning. I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> This tool is a must have for anyone who has acne. Cleaning and washing only goes so far, no one wants to stare at a pimple on their face and this is the best solution. It gets all of the gunk out without having to use your fingernails. It keeps everything clean and pops pimples with alot less frustration!</li>
            <li> great tool. not that expensive and it really works. it gets everything out when you use it.. great product! :)</li>
            <li> I could not get this to work. I even tried steaming my face before using it. All I ended up doing was making my face red.</li>
            <li> As you might know, it&#x27;s only gonna make it worst to try and squeeze your skin with your bare hands but thanks to this little thing, I say Good bye blackheads of death !</li>
            <li> Works well but I probably could have just stuck with using the end of a bobby pin.  I don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift a couple weeks ago. It&#x27;s been great to use, no complaints there. (Another reviewer&#x27;s advice to do cardio first was golden).  The product is supposedly made of stainless steel, and it looks fine. But spots of rust formed on the plug that the loops are anchored into after a couple uses, even though I&#x27;ve never used anything but alcohol. I&#x27;m guessing that the solder they used there is not stainless (my sister&#x27;s a welder and says it depends on the manufacturing technique, but it&#x27;s probably a lower grade metal, maybe nickel-based.)  Anyway, I scrubbed the rust with some jewelery cleaner and make sure to dry it thoroughly after every use, so that should fix the problem.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.  Got the Clarisonic and now I don&#x27;t need this anyway!</li>
            <li> Loops to big to be of any use.</li>
            <li> It is okay, but not as effective as the one I had before.  The hoops are either too wide or not wide enough.  Doesn&#x27;t break skin.</li>
            <li> I found my fingers to work just as well (I am sure dermatologists everywhere are repulsed), but this is more difficult to use than it is worth in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d like. It mostly just skims over the skin.</li>
            <li> the small part that works the best broke on the first use. the big part is useless.</li>
            <li> I have read the directions, but can&#x27;t see how it can help the hard ingrown pimples on my face.  Tried using, but it does nothing for my problem</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get blackheads out.  You should not be using this to pop pimples.  Popping pimples is how you get acne scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with the Biore Nose Strips to remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work, big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Fantastic tool! Bought one for me and one for my sister. Now I just have to buy two more- one for my mom and for another sister. Nice stocking stuffers too :)</li>
            <li> I love this tool.This is the thing that I try to find.I give just 4 stars because the blackheads acne side is really good.but for other side is a little hurt me.However I recommend this item,it can respond for all of you need.</li>
            <li> My nose have never looked so clean. Use this in the shower after the steam has opened your pores! Or after steaming your face over hot water. Never use on dry skin.</li>
            <li> This tool has helped me get rid of some of the acne that was on my face. I plan on using it more and I do recommend this!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice strong, easy to use and easy to sterilize instrument.  Especially on sensitive areas like the inside edge of the ear.</li>
            <li> I thought this would work.  It does not.  It hurts, and does squat.  Maybe I need to find a youtube video to find how to work this thing, but I&#x27;ve used blackhead removers in the past that worked easily.</li>
            <li> For a few bucks, it&#x27;s definitely one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. I can&#x27;t say how many years I&#x27;ve been wrecking the skin on my face by failing to resist the urge to squeeze out pimples and blackheads with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t recommend physical violence against your acne, once in a while it&#x27;s still necessary to get rid of a conspicuous black/white head and this little tool definitely reduces the trauma and subsequent scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that it hurts a lot more to push on your face with the loop compared to using your fingers, but the lasting results are much better without dirty nails cutting into skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the gaps are too small (or big?), but this does absolutely nothing. It&#x27;s made well though. Pretty hefty steel with a nice chrome finish.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to get rid of all my black heads but it barley works? I mean it does pop some but not as much as i was hoping</li>
            <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B7GJ2E/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this little gadget.  It does work great for blackheads.  You have to be very careful if you are using an acid or Retin A.&lt;br /&gt;I made a big mistake, more than once, and used Retin A.  All my blackheads came to the surface and looked like pimples sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;Well, used the tool and the next day my skin looked like a burn victim it was raw!!!  My face looked worse from taking the blackheads out than leaving them in.  Won&#x27;t be using Retin A anymore.  You don&#x27;t realize all the junk under your layers of skin.  Kinda gross, but want to warn people.  If the tool doesn&#x27;t get them right away, it will get them on the surface the next day, just don&#x27;t push too hard on it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me. Ended up not using at all. Would not really recommend buying something like this unless you know exactly if its right for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find myself getting the blackheads out. It doesn&#x27;t really do a good job at all. I even wash my face with hot water to see if that will make a difference. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> For about $5, this body tool is an amazingly valuable addition to your health and beauty care. Cleanly and safely removing white and black heads, without the risk of introducing bacteria from finger nails into the pore is very important in maintaining clear skin, and this tool does a wonderful job of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I gather and my experience, the smaller loop is geared towards removing white heads, while the larger, flatter loop is used in a scrapping motion for removing black heads (this works well on the nose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool itself is well built and feels sturdy. I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> I use it for clearing out giant black heads and removing pimples. I would recommend this over using your dirty ass fingernails.</li>
            <li> It works. A little painful and make your nose red. If you apply to much strength it will hurt !</li>
            <li> The tool has both ends to use for extractions and is very inexpensive and beats using your fingers that can leave scars.</li>
            <li> It is better than squeezing your face for stubborn blemishes.  The tool itself is small, but very sturdy.  It looks like the ends would bend, but they do not.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with the Rosallini Blackhead Extractor, and I never use this one.  It&#x27;s definitely the inferior product of the two.  The loop is too flat on one side, and too thick on the other to be effective.  I would go with the Rosallini, which are cheaper and more effective.</li>
            <li> I really like this tool because I can use it to get rid of small white head pimples&lt;br /&gt;and it doesnt hurt at all. its also good for getting oil out of pores.</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight and made of stainless steel. It&#x27;s easy to grip it.  It&#x27;s very good quality for the price and comes in a plastic pouch. Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> try pressing on my skin to extract whiteheads and blackheads. does nothing. both ends does nothing. it&#x27;s sturdy but does not work.</li>
            <li> It works ok, probably would work better if we had more training. But overall for the price it was great.</li>
            <li> Very rough on skin. Won&#x27;t pop skin</li>
            <li> This was my first pore extraction tool so I may not have done it right---the flat end doesn&#x27;t do anything and can leave marks if you apply too much pressure. But the end with the wire hoop is very effective for getting hard to reach places like the nostrils---but you absolutely need to steam your face for about 10-minutes beforehand. That is key to getting the gunk out.</li>
            <li> Not what I exactly needed, through absolutely no fault of the Seller. I just selected the wrong implement for my needs. I will not be returning it. Implement not faulty, just not what I require at this time. I will certainly review plethora of such tools offered again via Amazon/Seller in future and to pick out one or more of this type of tool. Seller ships fast, prices are excellent. Good overall experience. .</li>
            <li> These tools need to come with instructions on how to use them for best results.  Otherwise, you just kind of have to figure it out on your own or research methods elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s a sturdy tool and shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Great tool for a great price! Effectively removes the gunk from my pores and leaves my skin smoother.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The tool doesn&#x27;t work as well as just using your fingers for the blackheads on your nose. It hurts and causes more is situation to the skin than just using you fingertips (don&#x27;t use your nails).</li>
            <li> This tool is great for pimples but the holes are too large for black heads. It is strong and durable.</li>
            <li> This tool is perfect for getting rid of blackheads and whiteheads. It is easy to use and does not hurt your skin. The next day the pimple is gone and there is no scaring or purple discoloration.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly! I get black heads in the creases on the sides of my nose and this is great to keep them in check. My husband gets pimples sometimes on his back and says this is much better (but not painless) than me trying to squeeze them.</li>
            <li> It really pops your pimples! Love this tool and it does not leave your skin irritated.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for me.  Just made a loop impression in my skin and extracted absolutely nothing.  Maybe I have mutant pores, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> This tool worked as anticipated, but one of the loops (the smaller one) broke off within 2 weeks with only light use. I ended up getting a different one at a local store and it&#x27;s held up much better. Perhaps the first one was defective.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t use it yet. But it feels so durable, you can&#x27;t bend it because it&#x27;s solid metal. Im gonna use this definitely</li>
            <li> I love this tool, I get pretty bad white heads that eventually turn into awful pimples. This helps prevent that.</li>
            <li> It was good for the first use, but every other use after wards it was a bit difficult to use, but nonetheless a great product</li>
            <li> unfortunately i&#x27;m addicted to using this tool. it works very well, is sturdy and better than squeezing! be careful, you may become addicted, too!</li>
            <li> substantial. does not bend and does its job well. Be careful and follow procedure and it will work perfectly for you.</li>
            <li> there are no instructions on how to use it.  I had to go to you tube to try to figure it out and I just can&#x27;t watch someone else pop a zit</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, blackheads are not pretty whatsoever and I was suffering for a while from them on around my nose. Products like blackhead scrubs, acne medicines, my Clinique face brush and biore strips were doing nothing for me whatsoever on the blackhead front. With this tool, I used the small end. I recommend showering first to open up your pores and clean off any additional oil or gunk on your face. Pressing gently down on the target area and then more firmly, I saw the blackheads begin to come out. I was really conscious of the blackheads on and around my nose and really felt so much better seeing most of them eliminated. It is harder to get at tiny and oddly placed blackheads (let&#x27;s say on the rim of your nose), and yes, there is some PAIN involved because you are pressuring against your face. I use it periodically to clean up, but I think the first session alone just eliminated so much long-term blackhead accumulation more than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one of this type of tool I&#x27;ve ever used, but it gets the job done! Easy to grip, doesn&#x27;t puncture my skin, and cleans very easily.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done but I find I have to press pretty hard to get it to clean. I do not know if that is from my pores or because the product is hard to use but it works for what you need it.</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;ve seen these be used all over the internet. Not sure if it&#x27;s just this one or this tool in general, but doesn&#x27;t work as well as i wanted it to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s built well and strong but the design of the piece that is used on the pimple should have more of and arch, it&#x27;s too flat,  but still a good device.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for me. wire loop end is too thick. maybe it would work better for a teen-ager.</li>
            <li> I did not expect this tool to work so well!  I get the occasional pimple and clogged pore, especially when I am stressed.  Not only do my pimples heal faster, but they don&#x27;t get that nasty red inflammation for nearly as long.  Some pimples don&#x27;t turn red at all when I use this tool.  I did this after a nice hot shower and was amazed at how much gunk was in my pores :o but this tool cleaned my pores out really well.  This tool will work better after a nice hot shower or after you steam your face because your pores will be opened up.  Great little tool!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great tool. Since loosing this one I bought a kit with a few different types of heads and the ones on this tool are the only useful ones anyway.</li>
            <li> MY husband wanted this facial tool and said he  was very happy with it  along with a facial scrub he was able to remove all the black heads with out doing injury to his skin</li>
            <li> I added this product after reading multiple reviews and looking up the correct way to use it. I find the ends to be either too large or too small for proper use.</li>
            <li> Leaves marks on your face for about an hour after so don&#x27;t use it before going out somewhere but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> Tissue paper and your fingers works better. Kind of difficult to remove pores as the width of the rings are quite large.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use this product several times and it never seems to fully remove a blackhead completely. In addition, it always leaves a red mark around the area that looks pretty bad until it fades away.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Not the best but not the worst but have a great price so I can not complain much to pay for this</li>
            <li> It really gets the job done. I&#x27;ve been able to keep my acne under more control and keep my face looking clearer.</li>
            <li> Even with a great deal of experimentation, this tool yields only a smattering of good results. And when it does work, it requires so much pressure that it&#x27;s uncomfortable. If you really must get to hard-to-reach places like the crevice by the outer edge of your nostril or your ears or something, sure, use it. Otherwise, I would definitely not bother!</li>
            <li> I used this after years of have clogged pores on crease of my chin. I have spent thousands over the years trying to get cleared. Finally I purchased this, steamed my face and cleared it all. It&#x27;s so weird seeing my skin and not debris. I&#x27;m very happy with is purchase. Remember to always use alcohol before and after use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it for the price and its a lot better than using your fingers to get rid of blemishes.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does help and I no longer damage my face when I get a pimple or blackhead.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I use this after take shower every day. I scrape the whole face where I needed. But every time I do it on my nose, it doesn&#x27;t work good.</li>
            <li> It is pretty cool, i can just pop my pimples etc, easily. It hurts a little bit, but not too much.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will.  No more squeezing pimples.  No more sores. Its sanitary and easy to use</li>
            <li> Very effective in removing blackheads and whiteheads, especially if you jus got out of the shower. I&#x27;m glad I found this!</li>
            <li> While this is an extremely sturdy tool, I don&#x27;t know if the thickness of the wire looping has anything to do with the pain that comes with using this or not, but that&#x27;s my problem with this tool. I&#x27;ve used others and didn&#x27;t experience the pain. This is an individual experience, so mine might not be the same as yours. I do appreciate the fact that it is quite durable.</li>
            <li> This works OK. The larger end I have no idea how that&#x27;s supposed to work on a pimple, it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. I use the smaller end for everything and that works well. Sometimes I break out more after I use this so I&#x27;m very careful about where and how often i use this on my face. It&#x27;s a lot more hygienic than using fingers to pop zits or remove black heads. Just remember to sterilize it every time you use it. Oh and it does hurt to use by the way for removing black heads. If yours come out easily than it may not hurt so much but my pores are really small so it&#x27;s hard to get them out even after steaming my face. If in doubt I say go for it because it&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!  This is really a great tool and prevents those nails marks (or cuts) on either side of a zit when you go to squeeze it.  This gently pushes around the zit and empties it.  Watch a video on how to use it to remove blackheads, also.  Much less painless than pinching and much more effective.</li>
            <li> glad I was able to get this. :)</li>
            <li> The loops are way too big.  The openings themselves are large but worse yet, the metal loops are too thick.  Extractions are difficult to achieve without a leaving a red ring imprint on the skin.</li>
            <li> This tool works, but not as well as expected.  I think one would have to get a better tool through a physician in order to better extract blackheads.</li>
            <li> been popping pimples and blackheads galore since purchasing this. love it.</li>
            <li> This skin care tool works well, but it seems to be made from a relatively cheap metal.  The base to hold is not very comfortable and is a bit awkward to hold.  But it is holding together and has not started rusting despite the fact that I keep it in my humid bathroom.  So it seems to be serviceable tool that was not very expensive.  I would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had a pretty huge pimple. Everytime I looked at it, it kinda laughed at me. So I bought this and took care of it. Whos laughing now.</li>
            <li> Very good quality in comparison to others below $1. it will last forever and it does the job, just as when you watched on youtube...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this brand works better than others that look just like it, but this one works very well and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the flat end, just the loop end.  I have found that the trick to using it is to wash and exfoliate your skin, then do the extractions. The secret to using this tool without making your face all red and leaving marks or blotches is to stretch the skin taught using your non-dominant hand (one finger on either side of the area), and rather than just pushing down with the tool, actually start a little before the blocked pore or blemish and gently (but firmly haha) glide the tool across the skin.  Make sure to keep the loop flat on your skin.  I use a 7x magnified wall mount mirror in good lighting, and I&#x27;m always amazed at how clean I can get my pores. Then be sure to use some sort of astringent or cleansing pad afterward to clean any bacteria etc. of the skin, then moisturize.  Usually within a minute or two of moisturizing I no longer have any redness to my skin, even if I go over my entire face with the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 43 and my skin looks better than when I was 25 thanks in part to this tool - my pores stay so clean so I haven&#x27;t had a pimple at all since I started using this tool.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this tool, but it works great and is very functional. It gets those places your fingers cant reach, like the creases of your nose.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more disgustingly rewarding than pressing out a nasty blackhead!  Unfortunately I tend to get blackheads in hard-to-grasp spots on my face, usually around the creases of my nose/mouth.  These are soft areas that are difficult to grip with the fingers in order to apply sufficient pressure to remove the blackhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My technique is to take a nice, hot shower, complete with steam.  After washing, when my face pores have opened up and the steam is in full effect, I coat my face with benzoyl peroxide.  This kills the bacteria that could enter the pore when I press out the blackhead.  I then take one end of this tool, isolate the blackhead, apply a little pressure and presto...the blackhead pops out with minimal effort.  Just this evening I was able to rid my face of a most difficult to remove blackhead located on the crease that shapes my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely get whiteheads, so I can&#x27;t write yet on how effective this tool is for removing them.</li>
            <li> have not used yet, but looks like it is made very sturdy</li>
            <li> does nothing for me, invested in precision tweezers and magnifying mirror combined with old fashion squeezing you&#x27;ll get the job done much easier and with less pain</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads, pimples and etc. as it&#x27;s shown doing in ads. You have better luck getting them with your fingers or a nose strip.</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered on time! Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Good quality, stainless steal makes it easy to clean. Smaller than expected but not in a bad way. Make sure you read up on proper use, I&#x27;ve seen some people with scars.</li>
            <li> It works alright, helps me get my pimples easier, I hate the pain involved but I think this makes it feel less painful. Blackhead remover doesn&#x27;t work all that well but works good enough.</li>
            <li> I like this tool,  I just wish it didn&#x27;t hurt as much. But is good. It was faster than expected and like that it came in a lil pact where I can storage it in. Thank u</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for me, maybe will work for your skin ?</li>
            <li> useful in removing those ugly spots thanks</li>
            <li> I love this tool!  It helps with pimples so well!  I bite my nails so popping pesky pimples is a hassel.  But with this tool (while yes it is smarts) I can reach and get out pimples a lot more effectively than before!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;zit&amp;#34; tools that had a better handle and worked better, but this one works ok.  It definately works better than a bobby pin and much better than my fingernails.  If I had to replace it, I would try a different one, but it is ok.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this but it does the job, I guess maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong? I think I like the circle ones better than the loop</li>
            <li> I might need a bit more practice</li>
            <li> This might be for those facing the kind of acne that is serious but close to the surface. For blackheads, it&#x27;s just very large, and really impossible.</li>
            <li> Good pimple and blackhead extraction tool.  I own several extraction tools and this one works extremely well for my needs.  I recommend this tool for easy removal of pimples.</li>
            <li> Good tool to use on face to get rid of blackheads and the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; pimples that occur from time to time. The looped side it the one I use most when needed. Better than digging into you skin with nails trying to remove the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I was unsure about this tool, but because of the low price I decided to give it a try. It is great for getting white heads popped without creating a cut/scar. I tried it on black heads a few times but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. I might be doing it wrong, so who knows. Overall it serves its purpose and gets used.</li>
            <li> I use this tool often.  It doesn&#x27;t work for everything but the majority of gunk gets out.  I try to only use it lightly after steaming but sometimes I find it does leave a mark for a bit.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat delicate skin and my pores are quite small. Unfortunately this is not the best product for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did work for my friend who had larger pores and more noticeably black heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I washed the tool before I lent it to him.</li>
            <li> This tool is able to clear all my pores without leaving unsightly red marks, and it can get into areas that I normally couldn&#x27;t get to before. If you want a clear face, buy this!!!</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to figure out the best way to use the tool, but when i did, it has been amazing! i love it! Definitely  worth the money. Well, what little you pay on it. Its a GREAT buy!</li>
            <li> I feel like this product is more for people with blackheads that protrude quiet a bit.  I attempted to use this product right after a hot shower (letting the steam open my pores a little).  The only time anything came out was when I pressed super hard, leaving an indent in my skin.  I like to do gentle things on my face so this product just isn&#x27;t for me.  But I&#x27;m sure it would work for some other people (I&#x27;ve seen it work on youtube).</li>
            <li> Makes my face very smooth.</li>
            <li> This comes in handy to help smooth out bumps that don&#x27;t belong, without tearing up my skin. You just have to gentle.</li>
            <li> Hurts to use. Doesn&#x27;t really seem to do what it should. I&#x27;ll keep it just because, but when my boyfriend tried to use it, he audibly yelled, &amp;#34;OUCH!&amp;#34; because of how much it hurts. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be built properly for the job.</li>
            <li> This was not what I was expecting. It stings to use, and does not clear my skin like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> This was not what I thought it was going to be. I thought it would have a hold through the top not the wire loop.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this black/white head removal tool I thought it was a scam. The darn thing did not work! What a stupid tool - i thought to myself. Before throwing it away I decided to try one more time: press against the skin and glide downward simultaneously and w/ significant pressure. I was using my magnifying glass so I could appreciate any results. I could not believe the stuff that this tool was oozing out from my nose. Then, I tried it between my eyebrows just today just because. OMGosh! What I thought were unreachable hair stubs were blackheads! Yucky! My boyfriend is at the supermarket and he located this tool at the store. (saving on shipping and handling)I am buying 3 to give away and will personally explain how to use. I have no idea why they sell this marvelous tool so cheap! Oh, BTW, I did not have to steam my face and have always been praised for my &#x27;great skin&#x27; and am told I look 35 rather than 50. My boyfriend saw my bottle for scrubbing off white/black heads. (I don&#x27;t use it anymore; compare to this tool the wash is useless). He laughed because he claims I don&#x27;t have blackheads/whiteheads and why would I would the washing product. This is why I have to use a magnifying glass; mine are not easily seen. These nasty buggers hide but I know they are there! The tool works but you must learn to use it. (sorry for bad grammar &amp; typos. i&#x27;m exhausted after working on my homework all day.) I really hope it works for you as it did for me.</li>
            <li> Thinks the big loop is useless but the tiny loop is AH MAY ZING.  Gets those deeply rooted black heads all the time.  Just need to steam face for about 5-10 minute, then go to town on those bad boys...they pop right out.  Some needing a bid more pushing pressure than others, but nevertheless its gets them.  The best part...I leaves absoltely NO dark spot (I&#x27;m black).  Love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well. I would not buy it again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness...where was this tool when I was a teenager?  I watched several YouTube videos before I purchased this tool and it performs exactly as what I&#x27;d hoped it would. I&#x27;m older now and although I don&#x27;t have many zits nowadays I do have blackheads and large pores around my nose so I glide the smaller loop around the sides of my nose and get all the small blackhead which look more like clogged pores cleaned out.  This tool is definately really good quality and I know that when I get that mother of all zits I will have the tool to tackle the job.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and have already used it on my nose and my cheek area. I can&#x27;t believe how great this works. Prior to this, I used my fingers to create pressure points just to unclog my pores.  This is 100 % better than my fingers! I just use the smaller loop.  The bigger loops seems useless.  You do have to get your skin moist though before using it.  I just wet my face but another reviewer said to use after working out and that is a great idea too since you skin will already be saturated.  I&#x27;ll try that next time.  I must admit that I feel like this will create some damage to my skin because of how aggressive I get when I see it working.  Best to use it once in awhile (but it&#x27;s SOO effective).</li>
            <li> I could use my fingers - pointless device</li>
            <li> Well constructed tool haven&#x27;t had a problem with using it. The first time I got a professional facial and she was squeezing my pores which are really large and my t-zone always oily, I was told she found it really easy to extrude the gunk from them. So this tool works well for me to get crap out of my pores on my own especially after a shower or hot cloth compress on my face.</li>
            <li> very sharp and painful, not worth it</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t a lot to say about this other than it works and it&#x27;s solid .  It hasn&#x27;t bent or broken so why not give it five stars ?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had great skin, not bad, but far from porcelin china. My pores are large-ish and I never wear make up , so my skin is always kept as clean as possible. THIS TOOL IS THE MOST AMAZING THING I HAVE COME ACROSS IN MY LIFE!!!! One side is useless, but the narrower side is as if I just came from a $1,000. dermatologist facial. It was as if I just spent 10 days on the beach in Puerto Rico, where your skin really clears out in that Caribbean air and sun. I looked into a 15x maginfied mirror and my skin was 1000% clean and clear of every single blackhead that lay beneath the surface. Not much is ever visible on the surface of my skin, but you can feel the impurities beneath. This little body tooz tool does the most amazing job I have ever encountered. Now I am trying to buy 2 more for safe keeping and it is an add on!!! AMAZON- sell it straight up.!!! I would never leave home without it -lol- just the same as I feel about my tweezers. ZI&#x27;d pay 10x times the amount for this genius piece........don&#x27;t think twice. It&#x27;s a home run.</li>
            <li> found it a little hard to use in the beginning then moved to a better type but it was just because of the size of the object i guess, so not bad for others.</li>
            <li> First time using this and I Love this thing!!! When It arrived it was in a little blue bag,and it was smaller than I expected but it was perfect for gripping. It didnt come with directions but I knew how to use it by doing some research so not a big deal. I first sanitized it and washed my face and it started to remove my small black/white heads with a breeze, then I began to use it on bigger ones and man IT HURT!!! it was very painful the first time using but it got the job done, the more you use it the less painful it gets. After I washed and sanitized it and put it back in its case, and I rewashed my face because my face was irritated and I did my normal face routine after. The next day I was shocked on how clear my face looked, (I have oily, senitive skin)it didnt leave any marks like my fingers would and it really got most of the black/whites heads out. However I mainly use the small loop for most extractions since the big loop cant take care of the small pimples but its sometimes good for larger ones but I use the small loop for big ones also (especially when I need them to pop ;) lol). I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and my face has drastically improved since using it. I sometimes use it on dry skin as well and I still get the same results it just hurts alittle more lol. I highly recommend it!! you will not be disappointed especially if you breakout alot. I will be getting another one and a few other tools for the stubborn ones lol. Overall great product and it arrived on time which is also a plus.</li>
            <li> Its painless and way better than using you fingers&lt;br /&gt;It pops white heads right out, blackheads are more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;It gets the job done fast</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do fairly well! I give this four stars instead of five because I used to have a Tweezerman extractor tool, and for whatever reason I found that one slightly easier to use. The loops were at a slightly different angle I guess? In any case this one works reasonably well on blackheads, and the fact that the body of the tool is sort of nubby makes it easier to hold (less slipping).</li>
            <li> Well, I have been experiencing acne for the first time in my life.  I am an expert \\&quot;learn something and do it on my own\\&quot; type of person. After watching a few youtube videos about doing extractions (specifically this one) [...] I learned how to do it the right way. Since it doesn&#x27;t come with directions, you must learn on your own. I found that the video helped me to correct the way I was doing it. I didn&#x27;t realize how deep down the nastiness was until I watched that video. Great investment when used properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safe Extractions to you all!</li>
            <li> Works much better than using my fingers to pop my zits and pimples. It leaves a red mark but unlike fingers does not lead to inflammation.</li>
            <li> I had a blackhead or ingrown hair or something on my shoulder. Two finger method didn&#x27;t work because it only seemed to depress the center even more. So I decided to buy this blackhead remover. As soon as I received it, I sterilized it and went to work on the blackhead. It came out with a little effort. So far so good. I used it on my face...not so good. It expelled some white heads inside sunken pores (sorry if that&#x27;s TMI), but those are easy to get out anyway. I really wanted to try it on these small blackheads on the side of my face (where sideburns would grow). I ended up scarring myself. I was adamant about getting them out, but all I did was remove layers of skin (in a perfect circle I might add). Fortunately the scars turned into scabs and dried up and fell off within 4 days or so. Then I noticed some ingrown hairs on my legs, so I decided to give this tool one last try after coming out the shower. It got out the ingrown hairs, but not without considerable pressure being applied. I think it helps if you press deep and use a rocking motion to coax out whatever you&#x27;re trying to get out. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll end up extracting pus, blood, some skin...basically everything except the black center you&#x27;re trying to remove. Definitely do not use this product right before you go out- it leaves battle wounds right after you use it. I&#x27;m not really impressed with this product. I expected to improve my skin with it, but I think I&#x27;ll only use it as a very last resort.</li>
            <li> Love this little wand. Helps me keep my fingers off my face if I do have a breakout. Use gently.</li>
            <li> Works great! I read a bunch of reviews for this and similar products before purchasing and ultimately decided to give it a try. I think this is a must buy in my opinion. It&#x27;s inexpensive and it works. It was much sturdier than expected, works as advertised and it made of quality material. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it is another quality tool to help you get and maintain clear skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously love this tool! Everyone always says not to use your hands because of bacteria and now that I own this tool, I never even think to use my fingers to pop anything again! Can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li> Helps you get the blackheads out easily with less pain and damage to skin</li>
            <li> Works well to remove blackheads or whiteheads without damaging the surrounding tissue. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would help me to remove the little whiteheads and blackheads that I get from time to time. Sadly I got my hopes up. Although it is a well made tool. I believe it is surgical steel. I really had to press down hard just to get a little bit of sebum. It really left my face hurting a little. I have senstive skin so I believe it was from that and not the tool is totally at fault. I am going to pass this to my sister. Hopefully she has better luck with it.</li>
            <li> Goodbye blackheads. Easy to use, easy to clean. Perfect for clearing up blackheads and acne without tearing open the skin or smashing the bacteria under the skin.</li>
            <li> Removes blemishes without causing unnecessary damage to skin. My skin appears much clearer now because I don&#x27;t have red marks from squeezing blemishes. Great for blackheads and small whiteheads too.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described and as in photo. It appears to be made of Stainless Steel and has a textured surface where you hold it, which is good for preventing slips. There is a slit on the back of the case, just under the white part, which permits easy removal and replacement. This is nice to keep the item stored and clean. It works well and minimizes the bruising I&#x27;ve caused with using just my fingers. It is easy to keep clean. It was priced low and with free shipping made this the best deal on Amazon. I guess you can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> it doesnt do as much as my other tools. meaning it doesnt pick up a lot. but i guess each face is different and there are those who will love it. good material</li>
            <li> great product great price effective for removing extractions easy to clean</li>
            <li> This product did not do its job at all. it very bruised where I tried to remove an black head..</li>
            <li> Very painful to use. Not sure of its the design or what but it damages the skin and doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> This is the first time purchasing or using a product like this and I was very happy with it.  It does as promised removing blackheads.  I have even gotten my husband to start using it.</li>
            <li> Great for white heads and &amp;#34;ripe&amp;#34; black heads.  Works best when used after a warm shower when the pores are relaxed.  Blemishes heal faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean with soap and warm water.  I&#x27;ve had it for over two years and it hasn&#x27;t rusted or anything.</li>
            <li> What I like best about this tool is I can hold a magnifying mirror in one hand and use the tool in the other hand to remove zits. I am far-sighted and can&#x27;t really see well close up in a regular mirror. I don&#x27;t really get blackheads but I get zits about once a week. So this thing is great. And it seems much more sanitary than your fingers. You can clean the tool in alcohol. I think squeezing with the fingers is more damaging. Clearly there is nothing scientific in my opinion though. But I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this tool. You need to go to youtube and watch it being used. I think that is essential to use this tool effectively.</li>
            <li> Works great as long you know how to use it:)  Love this product! Use it everyday. It is a very good quality item</li>
            <li> Received promptly with Amazon Prime (Love it). Used hot, wet towels to soak skin. Tried to remove clogged pore material to absolutely no avail. Neither end work. Also the are no instructions on the use. I had to go to BodyToolz website.</li>
            <li> I love this tool! It is inexpensive and effective IF USED CORRECTLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will not extract deep set pimples or blackheads, you have to use another method (scrubs, face washes, etc.) to work them out to the surface before you can use this tool to extract them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does pop/extract pimples/blackheads near the surface of the skin cleanly and without much effort. If you are trying to remove something and it does not come out after the first couple of tries-STOP! this means the blemish is too deeply set in the skin, and all you are going to do with this tool is poke and irritate it. Use a different method to move these stubborn blemishes to the surface, then try the tool again a few days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can leave some red marks from the tool around the area, but this will go away in a few minutes. Remember to clean the tool after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small loop end of this tool is the side that I use. The large, flat loop end of this tool does not seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> Great tool for removing both blackheads and whiteheads. Sturdy design means it will last a long time, too. I am happy with my purcahse.</li>
            <li> absolute rubbish, i used it on my nose and sont even know what im dong with it.. waste of my money for sure</li>
            <li> I did not find this useful whatsoever. I would recommend using this on acne that is ready to pop. Do not try to use this and try to pop acne that is not ready, it can lead to scaring. I didn&#x27;t like it because when trying to use it on blackheads or whiteheads it wasn&#x27;t doing the job.</li>
            <li> This blackhead extractor does what it is supposed to do. It is made of stainless steel so it won&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li> Huh I love it. It&#x27;s easier to use then your fingers sometimes but it does leave marks for awhile.. Find something better if you don&#x27;t want marks but it does work pretty good but does hurt.</li>
            <li> AGAIN.WAS NOT EXPENSIVE BUT DID NOT WORK GOOD.VERY FLIMSY AS ALOT OF THE OTHERS WERE THE SAME QUALITY. IT DID NOT COST ALOT SO I THINK I WILL HAVE MY HUBBY GO TO THE DERMATOLOGIST .</li>
            <li> If you have blackheads this tool is amazing. Simply steam your face a bit and this tool will help you easy remove blackheads, whiteheads or pimples in a way that will prevent scarring. This is a very well made model and will last for years and you can store it right in the case too.  Be sure to clean with alcohol after use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe how in love I am with this product. Ever since seeing a girl on YouTube use one of these to extract her pores, I&#x27;ve been obsessed with it. It does such a good job at keeping your pores clear. Just steam your face a little and you&#x27;re ready to go. It&#x27;s small, highly portable and really easy to clean. I honestly only use the looped end (never found much use for the flattened side), but I still enjoy it. I use it with a magnifying mirror for optimum viewing, and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I never knew this type of tool existed until I randomly clicked on a youtube video that demonstrates how this works in removing blackheads and whiteheads. I was truly fascinated by it since I hated seeing those nasty little buggers around my nose and near my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;As a male, we tend to have bigger pores than females, so it&#x27;s more obvious to spot blackheads/whiteheads on men. I praticed manually removing these nasty little things with my fingers for years, even though it&#x27;s always cautioned not to do so by dermatologists.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 of these from the seller \\&quot;loveotc\\&quot; at $4.38 a piece with free shipping. They are a US based seller, so shipping will be quick.&lt;br /&gt;I usually extract my blackheads/whiteheads once a week, after a hot shower, when you&#x27;re pores are open. This tool makes it so quick to remove them and you will be surprised with the amount of gunk you will see coming out of our pores and sticking to the extracting tool. My nose area gets the most gunk to come out. It&#x27;s quite nasty and fascinating at the same time. This also works real well after you steam your face.&lt;br /&gt;Never will I try to remive whiteheads/blackheads with my fingers. This neat little tool will do it for you safely and effectively.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do what it claims it does . Maybe there is some special technique to it that I am not aware of but in this case it should come with instructions.</li>
            <li> It works good I just still have to figure it out completely ! But the price was better than anywhere else and I looked everywhere ! I definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and does not seem to work.</li>
            <li> If you want to make your pimples hustle and flow out of your pores without damaging skin, this is your tool.  But you HAVE to use it after washing with hot water or after getting out of a steamy shower.  If your pores are not loose and open, this thing WILL damage skin.  Especially if you press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, pimpling ain&#x27;t easy.  Sometimes this thing hurts quite a bit.  But it gets the pimple juice out.  The smaller end is most effective.  The bigger end is sort of like a spatula with a hole in its middle.  Not great, but good if you only want to target one tight area and shield the pores around that area with the flat spatula part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool is made of heavy duty steel that will not bend.  You will never be in danger of it moving or slipping while you let loose your pimple juice.  No need to pimple smack your pores.  Just press and caress and poke gently.  (That&#x27;s what SHE said.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have black heads, white heads--no matter the color--you need this tool.  Soon enough, you&#x27;ll have a strong pimple hand and people will call you a pimple daddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After exfoliating in a hot shower this thing is quite handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Nelly said it best when he wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Pimple juice - oooooooooh-ooooooooh-hoooooooo&lt;br /&gt;I think I need to let it loose (might think I need to let it loose)&lt;br /&gt;Let it loose, let it loooooose&lt;br /&gt;She only want me for my pimple juice (that&#x27;s all she want me for f&#x27;real)&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, BUY THIS TOOL.  It works well.  And it will help you feel more confident.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but someone said here it was a must have, and actually it leaves your skin kind of bruised. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d rather to have it bruised or with blackheads.</li>
            <li> Good quality item and it arrived quickly. Is exactly as pictured. Would buy again.  It is most helpful with loose blackheads and large whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin. I even use a prescribed acne wash but pimples still form. I never use to pop my pimples. It&#x27;s what everyone used to tell me. When one would form I would never pop it; regardless how big and embarrassing it would be.  I would treat the area and after a long while it would scar and cyst. It was frustrating. I happen to come across a video of a dermatologist using this tool to treat a patient on youtube. I thought I would give it a try. This really helped me. I love this tool !!!! I no longer go thought the embarrassment of walking around with a giant, ugly, pus filled pimple. I use the tool when the pimple is small and it doesn&#x27;t scar my face. I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this tool unless you are a professional this material is very harsh on your skin and will likely leave scars.</li>
            <li> My pores have been very clogged recently, so I wanted something that allowed me to get rid of excess sebum. This works great and it was very inexpensive. However, please use it correctly. Steam your face beforehand and gently press. If the sebum doesn&#x27;t come out, the pore isn&#x27;t ready. Don&#x27;t press so hard that you damage your skin.</li>
            <li> The metal bends to easily.</li>
            <li> Ordered this after seeing many good reviews. It did not work well at all. At times, after a shower with steam, it helped a bit, but never any major pimple popping or acne removal. Scraped surface skin a bit to clean pores but that&#x27;s all. I expected more. I thought it would really help extractions and it did not. Sometimes it was also painful to use. Do not buy this. Did nothing for my skin. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> pretty sturdy but did bend a teeny bit when pushed down on face extremely hard...otherwise the puchase was very cheap and worth it.</li>
            <li> Never through this tool would help as much as it did but it does! Also for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. The small case is a bit muskey, so I tossed it out.</li>
            <li> Handy little tool for black heads, but even after youtubing for videos on how to use the other end, nothing. have no idea how to use it. still, for the price its handy.</li>
            <li> I would probably check out other tools, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to be that great! It wasn&#x27;t that expensive, so not that great of a loss. Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong?</li>
            <li> This is the only instrument that allowed me to remove an old, huge blackhead on my back.  Some people report that it hurts, but if a little discomfort for a short time is the price to remove persistent acne, I am OK with that.</li>
            <li> The flat end is ok I guess, I just don&#x27;t use it much.  However the round end is much too large or fat to apply the type of pressure I need to apply to extract blackheads.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pop anything or help with whiteheads/blackheads. I say leave it!  I&#x27;d Rather use my fingers to purge my pores</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like white heads or black heads. This tool doesn&#x27;t like them either. Together, we are like Marvel&#x27;s Avengers in conquering the ever expanding black and white head armies of evil.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use this item because its difficult to use. Either end is entirely to large.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it did not work. It does not feel all that comfortable while trying to get it  perform.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and works! My teenagers love it. Gets their pimples and doesn&#x27;t make skin all swollen and red. Just a little mark! It is great</li>
            <li> This did not work very well for me. Tried it on dry skin and fresh out of the shower as others suggested. Even had difficulty removing pimples that were already on the surface of the skin. I think this is just too big for smaller whiteheads and blackheads and does not apply enough pressure to remove them.</li>
            <li> This tool is great for blackheads, whiteheads and pimples. But always remember to sanitize this tool (boil it in water or clean it with rubbing alcohol) and after squeezing the sebum out rub some rubbing alcohol on it to kill the bacteria then use an astringent or toner. It&#x27;s a very easy tool to use. For best results take a shower or cleanse your face or steam it before using this tool. It&#x27;s ALOT easier to get rid of your blackhead/whiteheads/pimples when your pores have opened up. The picture of the product is a little misleading the small hoop is pointed up. Which is a good thing! If it was flat it would be slighty more difficult to get your blackhead/whiteheads/pimples out.</li>
            <li> Thought I found THE way to get rid of those nasty black heads! Bummer... you could press the thing on your face with all the patience, skill and competence you think you&#x27;re capable of &#x27;til you faint. And most likely, the bugger will still be there when you come to your senses...</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product because my husband convinced me that it&#x27;s about time to buy a blackhead/whitehead remover. Out of many products like this, I finally decided to buy this one because of the positive reviews. I immediately tried it and it works wonders! I love it. You need to wet your skin if you want to remove the whiteheads. If you&#x27;re aiming for the blackheads, open your pores by steam or warm towelette.</li>
            <li> maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly but trying to clear clogged pores with this tool is painful and stressful on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The loop doesn&#x27;t really help with small blemishes.  I think you may be better off with the circular loops in stead.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little tool that everyone in my home loves. The first time it was used we were so surprised to how well it work.  We needed to buy another so I purchased one from chain store it was not a nice.  This is not made of cheap metal like other one.  We will probably purchase other. Great for adults and teenagers.</li>
            <li> The smaller loop is too thick so I have to press it very hard against my skin in order to get the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; out.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent tool for removing black and white heads. Stretch the skin, apply pressure and they come out with less irritation than your fingers cause. Yes, there will be pain depending on location but this tool is far more agile and gives you more attempts than your fingers will.</li>
            <li> Tool is okay. But does not work that good extracting blackheads.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend going to a professional before trying anything like this. If you can stand the pain from a professional, then you&#x27;ll be ok. But, again, go to a professional to see how it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> The tips may bend a little bit after some use, but this thing does what it is supposed to and it does this well.</li>
            <li> There can&#x27;t be that many deviations on this kind of facial extractor, and I do like this one. I only give it 4 stars because I&#x27;ve had a different extractor (but much more expensive) where the loops were a little &amp;#34;bendier&amp;#34;.  That extra &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; made it easier to extract stubborn pores.  Otherwise, this is a great tool for everyday usage.  It works best if you steam your face a little first to open up pores.  Would recommend, ESPECIALLY for the price and no hassle fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This tool is pretty nifty. Sometimes it&#x27;s pretty hard to get it to work, but when it does, oh man it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Good tool for facials.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this thinking I&#x27;d be able to clean up blackheads pretty well like in the youtube videos.  Disappointingly it seems that you need to have some pretty gnarly dirt pockets on your face for this to really do anything.  I&#x27;ll wait around till I&#x27;ve got a pimple and update it then, but right off the bat it does pretty close to nothing.  And here I thought I had sufficient blackheads to put this thing to use.  Perhaps the smaller comedone extractors are more suitable for the cleaner half of the civilized population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  After using this for a while I decided to change my review.  It is durable, easy to clean, and works on random big pimples without having to try and get an angle on it with fingers.  Not great for blackheads unless they are huge, but works well on solid pimples.</li>
            <li> Nifty tool. Broke the first day I had it, luckily I know how to fix things and now it works great meow.  Face looks better and there&#x27;s no scarring.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Body Toolz Double Loop Facial Skin Care Tool and it arrived very quickly. ( A few days later ) I have used this for over a week now and I am very happy I made the purchase. I&#x27;m only sad that I didn&#x27;t order one of these sooner, it could have prevented some scars I got by using my fingers. T_T It is made very well! at first I was nervous to put too much pressure, because I thought that I would snap the loop right off but nope! its very sturdy.</li>
            <li> its long and has a knurled grip and is stainless steel. this tool is best used when u are taking a shower, when your skin is soft and pores are open.</li>
            <li> This product gets so many things that I don&#x27;t even know are on my face.  I run it over my skin and tons of white stuff comes out and they weren&#x27;t even in visible pimples!!!  Great product.</li>
            <li> I like this product, however,  it needs instructions on how to use it.  I learned by trial and error and am not sure if I am using it correctly.</li>
            <li> This is the best face tool I&#x27;ve ever bought.  It&#x27;s absolutely the best.  Anyone with any type of acne (face or otherwise) should buy it!</li>
            <li> I got this after the woman who does my facials told me I should get one and it works great.</li>
            <li> Well I bought this because I get some ocasional acne and I cannot stand it I have to press them and they get worse some times, so I thought with this tool the pimples will be easy to get out and they will not get infected. I have try to use it after I take a shower but they dont came out, maybe because I dont really know how to use it.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing this tool, I have been using it more often than I thought I would. It works extremely well in getting rid of the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; in your pores.</li>
            <li> It is what it is supposed to be. I like the weight of it and it is just like my old one I got from sephora.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a tool like this before and it worked great.  But this one really hurts.  Poor quality.</li>
            <li> This works well but I got carried away and left marks and sores on my face and had to throw it out because getting those blackheads out was a little too &amp;#34;addictive&amp;#34; for me and it&#x27;s easy to get carried away.  You have to press very hard sometimes and use a dragging motion.  I was once asked if I got in a fight due to the marks on my face!  That&#x27;s when I decided to toss it, but I miss it at times.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this thing as much as I thought. Lol my boyfriend hates it. I thought it was going to be like the one I used in Cosmetology School but , idk, something was just different....</li>
            <li> The loop on the smaller end was a lot thicker than I had expected. I have used a tool like this before and got better results with a thinner wire than this one. This tool is very sturdy however, and will get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have decent skin but get some blackheads in the pores on my nose, especially when I&#x27;m sick. This thing does nothing, you are better off cleaning your pores and going that instead of using this mini shovel tonescavate your face.</li>
            <li> Well made. Works to remove white and black heads. We&#x27;ve only used it on body acne, not face so I&#x27;m not sure exactly how well it works on face, but hopping it reduces scaring and he says it hurts less then manually doing it.</li>
            <li> the wire loop end of this tool broke off after a few uses. I&#x27;ve had a similar tool from another manufacture that lasted forever.</li>
            <li> It works. Simple as that. And assuming you clean the tool after use, more hygenic (less chance of infection of the area) than using your finger nails. In fact, when cleaning pores/ popping pimples before, I would often have to do the area twice in the past. Now with this tool, once and the pimple is gone.</li>
            <li> It can hurt, A LOT! It works very well for me though, getting rid of blackheads but it didn&#x27;t for my sister. It just hurt her and did nothing. It helps if you just got out of the shower because the steam opens up your pores and makes it easier to remove the stuff. I guess it depends on the person. I love it, but if you have small pores leave it.</li>
            <li> I think it is more hygienic to use this tool than your fingers, but sometimes the tool can be quite ineffective and hurts too much... It also leaves marks on my skin which don&#x27;t go away easily.&lt;br /&gt;I would rather recommend to choose something of a higher quality...</li>
            <li> Does a good job at what it was designed for. The product is very sturdy and priced fairly. Recommended purchase.</li>
            <li> This tool really works great. It helps remove all kind of blemishes. Price is good too. I recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> I never have to touch my face with my hands or nails ever thanks to this. My face feels more cleaner and never gets infections now.</li>
            <li> it works great, i don&#x27;t have to squeeze or pick at my face any more. that alone should help! thanks</li>
            <li> This tool does not seem to be the right size or dimension to accomplish its supposed task. I am dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve used the same one for years!!!!</li>
            <li> Son uses it and says it works great!</li>
            <li> From someone who has suffered from breakouts my entire adolescent and young adult life... this has been an absolute blessing. I thought about it for a couple of weeks if I should really get this. I went for it, and I don&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s like not to have one. There&#x27;s a reason this thing exists. Unexplainably better than using fingers! ICK! It removes all from the area in one go. I also heal immediately and have found it doesn&#x27;t come back or become irritated with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*WARNING*- just make sure it is ready to come out before going to war with your face.</li>
            <li> If you press too hard it leaves a little red mark and doesnt get out the white head. You should use this if you have easy to get out white heads, because it doesnt work for tough ones.</li>
            <li> I understand that popping pimples hurts, but this thing was WAY too much. I couldn&#x27;t bear the pain of popping any of my pimples, so I don&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The loops at the ends are not actually welded on or anything and can slip out.  They&#x27;re really hard to put back in as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have to use much pressure at all, the loops will bend and you&#x27;ll have to fix them back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few days and I have tried it once. Didn&#x27;t really work, but I don&#x27;t think the blemishes were ready. Obviously it&#x27;s preferable to see a professional, so use caution and don&#x27;t put too much pressure on the skin. They have step by steps you can google and I think the more I use it, the better I will be at extracting.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t pop most things, they have to be swollen for it to even work. I bought it for blackheads but it doesn&#x27;t even budge those.</li>
            <li> Got this to remove blackheads, but it doesn&#x27;t really work.  Does help to get infection out of zits without the trauma of squeezing, but other tool I have used works much better.  Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> The metal loops are also little thicker than I expected compared to a previous one I had.  I guess it&#x27;s so you don&#x27;t cut your skin, but in some areas it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  I&#x27;m searching for a finer gauge metal on the loops.</li>
            <li> Figured with the other reviews that I&#x27;d give this a try.  It&#x27;s uncomfortable, requires way too much pressure, and it&#x27;s 10 times rougher on your face than doing this the old fashioned way.  It&#x27;ll probably just sit in the drawer until I remember it&#x27;s still there and throw it away.  Meh, it was cheap so I&#x27;m not out any considerable $, but after 3 honest attempts to use it, I&#x27;ll never use it again.</li>
            <li> Great buy!! I loved the product! It was exactly what I was looking for! I can&#x27;t wait to start using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried watching the videos and following along but I can not seem to get this thing to be effective!</li>
            <li> This product does what it is intended to do and the price is just right, cant complain about this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fantastic. Leaves a lot of marks on the skin, so DONT use it before going out. And it&#x27;s not very good for self-use a lot of the time, because you have to press REALLY hard to get those f*ckers out.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, doesn&#x27;t make the area inflammed and red like when you try and use your hands to clear blemishes.</li>
            <li> This tool is actually called a comodone you can look it up on YouTube and see a dermatologist extract pimples it&#x27;s exciting aha and gross but it may help you extract your pimples more effectively. If you know anything about bumps you probably already know that your not supposed to pop them with this tool it extracts the pimple so all of the puss gets out. It hurts a tid BUT if you have BLACKHEADS, WHITEHEADS of just bumps and you want to get rid of them BUY THIS. THIS TOOL WILL NOT BE A CURE TO YOUR ACNE! but it will help you extract small hard to pop blemishes on your nose cheeks or anywhere for that sake. I bought one a t Mijers and it was like 2 dollars or so BUT THIS ONE WORKS SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> I looked up how to use this tool online, but I can never quite get it to work. Operator error most likely</li>
            <li> Tiny and portable and does its job. I recommend getting this now because it doesn&#x27;t leave marks like some of the other blackhead extractors with those different shaped tips.</li>
            <li> This leaves a large red mark and hurts while I do it. It&#x27;s probably better then squeezing but I don&#x27;t use it anymore because of the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works much better on larger blemishes. Doesn&#x27;t work at all on the smallest ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well built and holds up but it really hasn&#x27;t helped with my skin care. Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right. I should have just bought a better face wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently started doing my own facial treatments. The next on my list to purchase is a facial steamer.  The boiling water on a pot is good too but takes too long.  I&#x27;ve only figured out how to use the smaller loop and it does the job well of taking out nasty gunk from my pores.  It doesn&#x27;t do the job as well as a professional would but it something I can live with.  One thing about any facial gunk removal loop is that IT HURTS. lol! My first time and I was tearing up.  I guess I needed more time steaming my pores open over the pot of boiling water, just to have the steam open up my pores a little more.  All in all this tool is great for home facial use.</li>
            <li> It works best if you use it after your facial pores have been opened up...like after a hot shower.  I get so much gunk off my nose it&#x27;s ridiculous.  I prefer this tool over those nose tape peel things.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This tool is great.  It works well on most blackheads - gets em out when squeezing just isn&#x27;t cutting it! ;)</li>
            <li> Awesome for black heads especially, but also some white heads.  Allows you to get in difficult spots like the bottom sides of your nose.</li>
            <li> excellent ~ thank you so much....</li>
            <li> your better off with the rosallini eye hole design one( I bought both) If you think you need one of these.</li>
            <li> The thinner tip works so well when I have a bad spot, especially deep ones. It is a little painful since the best technique that works with my skin is to press it in near the handle part of the loop, circling the spot in the skin, and then slide the tool while adding a little more pressure as the inner round area of the loop gets to the spot. The pus and whatnot almost always comes right out. Just make sure to disinfect the loop!  Honestly I haven&#x27;t had any success with the other end, but the other end has really impressed me.</li>
            <li> The smaller loop broke off after just a few uses. Be careful when using it! Can&#x27;t really complain especially for this price.</li>
            <li> I wish the heads were a little bit bigger but it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Not the most glamorous thing to write a review on, but it does what it was made to do.</li>
            <li> Cleaned my nose right up. I had black heads, puss filled pours I never knew were there. Hurts a little but fun seeing strings of puss come out .... Ewwwwe</li>
            <li> It works just as it says it should and for a great price. My skin looks great the day after I use it.</li>
            <li> This is sturdier and better priced than the one I bought at Sephora (and the loop on that one eventually broke off!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use this to fight with your breakouts,  cuz it will hurt. No digging, picking or pushing so hard that you injure the surrounding skin. A light amount of pressure (try a few different angles if you need to)  should bring the blockage to the surface. If not,  just wait another day... maybe  put a topical antibiotic,  and you should be ready to try again in 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this to clear blocked pores that haven&#x27;t quite become a flared up pimple.  Looked closely for slight blockages,  and this tool brings everything right out,  before you get a bigger problem. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I watched a few videos on youtube to see how to use this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend that (although some of the video&#x27;s were...gross).&lt;br /&gt;After educating myself a bit, I tried this sucker out - works as described.</li>
            <li> This product is alright. If you have a really huge blackhead it&#x27;ll get it nicely, but for the little ones on my nose it&#x27;s not very helpful. I&#x27;ve tried steaming beforehand, but I have better luck getting them out with my fingers. The price is so low that I don&#x27;t really mind, though.</li>
            <li> This is a good tool for reaching those hard-to-reach imperfections and removing the ones that don&#x27;t want to cooperate on their own. Follow up use with some germ killer medicine.</li>
            <li> Takes technique, little practice, but honestly, it&#x27;s not too great. At least for someone like me who only gets the occasional zit.</li>
            <li> Works great! I&#x27;m glad I bought this. I don&#x27;t get many zits and I still find myself using this fairly often. Great Tool! I don&#x27;t know how I managed without it.</li>
            <li> The tool is flimsy and immediately rusts in the slightest tinge of humid weather.</li>
            <li> This product does not work, I could use my fingers and get better results. There goes $5.54 down the drain.</li>
            <li> it helps extract pretty nasty gunk from my pores, so does it&#x27;s job pretty well.  this is the tool to use if you do your own facials and such.  make sure you steam your pores or soak face in very warm water to facilitate extraction.</li>
            <li> Its useful to clean the clogged pores, without using your nails, easy to hold, the handle is long enough. Overall, nice product!</li>
            <li> this gets everything out of your skin! my fiance even uses it!i rarely have break outs because i beat them to the punch. this thing is heaven sent!</li>
            <li> I use this thing on my face a few times a week and it helps clean and remove all kinds of oils under my skin.  I never knew I had white heads until I bought this love it. You should try it it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of an extractor before I got my first facial.  Boy was it uncomfortable! But now my boyfriend and I are both ADDICTED. It is a great way to clear up acne on your face (or all over your body, actually) without using your hands and introducing dirt.  I never knew my pores held so much gunk until I started using this.  My face has been the clearest I&#x27;ve seen it in a decade.  Buy!!!</li>
            <li> I feel that it doesn&#x27;t get it out a lot but i should totally blame it on the product because it&#x27;s suppose to really work when i am sweating not when my face is dry.</li>
            <li> Every kid going through puberty should be given one of these.  I didn&#x27;t even know such a thing existed.&lt;br /&gt;Other people said they watched youtube videos, etc. to figure out how to use it - I just dove in.&lt;br /&gt;+ It works amazingly well - especially for blackheads on one&#x27;s nose.  The ones that are pretty much impossible to get with your fingers, this will wipe them right out.&lt;br /&gt;- It can be a bit painful, but for the majority of the time it is fine.&lt;br /&gt;+ If you use it a lot in one go, it will leave your face red - but it is infinitely better than breaking pimples with your fingers.  I wish I had this in high school.</li>
            <li> I love this tool! It is so easy to use and it is way better than using your fingers that have all these germs and it is a bad way to pop zits. This is perfect and again easy to use. I received it in great time as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of extractor tools and never had issues.  Not sure if it&#x27;s the design or if the metal is too sharp, but this tool constantly cuts the skin and removes layers of skin instead of extracting blemishes.  Do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried it with a clean face, I have tried it right after a shower, I have even tried it after being outside all day hiking and sweating in 90 degree heat and it still didn&#x27;t work. It just dug into the skin leaving a red mark.</li>
            <li> All of the lettering came off of mine and the thing doesn&#x27;t even work. Save your money and buy a better one elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Really good tool for acne!  Both sides really work well to get even tough acne spots.  This tool helps so much in not spreading the bacteria from your hands to your face and its easy to disinfect.  Love it.</li>
            <li> VERY pleased with the product. Extremely cool. Love the tool and was exactly what I had ordered. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> This definitely does the trick. I don&#x27;t use my fingers anymore to pick at acne. I know its a bad habit and that I should try not to pick at my face at all, but I figured having this tool was better than picking at my acne with my crummy little fingers.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as an extraction tool after I had ordered one from another company.  The other one didn&#x27;t work at all.  Exact opposite for this product!  Works the way it is supposed to and arrived without a hitch.  Great packaging and storage too!</li>
            <li> It does work, but its painful. Steaming your face IS important, and it helps to have someone else do it. It gets easier the more you do it too. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Use it every other day. If I suspect a pimple is about to show up, I just press the area and it usually pops out. It&#x27;s not painless, and it leaves your face a little red, obviously, but it does the job. It&#x27;s much easier than popping with your fingers. White and blackheads begone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these for a while and this one works well.  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#x27;s a tad painful to use.  My skin looks better though.  Also, be gentle with this!  It is metal after all and will damage your skin if you use it like a drill.</li>
            <li> I still get scars or blood when using this, if I push too hard. It is difficult to tell when I push too hard, because I&#x27;m not squeezing with my fingers. It works really great with blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> When I first got these (before use) I was disappointed, I was thinking that the wire would bend way to easily under pressure because It reminded me of a paperclip.  I was wrong, in fact you would probably cut into yourself before these would actually bend.  That aside, these are great for those pimples, blackheads, etc that don&#x27;t seem to pop.  It&#x27;s also very helpful in the fact that when your skin is sensitive or you are having pain due to the pimple, these will provide enough force without hurting you that much.  All in all I would buy these again if I had to or if for some reason the one I have happens to break.</li>
            <li> Most of us know from anecdotal experience that whiteheads look much better once drained, and they usually fade faster that way too! However, if you&#x27;re not careful, you can make your acne much worse by using your fingers to drain whiteheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product solves that problem. Use the looped ends to extract blackheads and whiteheads in a cleaner environment and they won&#x27;t spread. It is very important to rinse the tool with rubbing alcohol between every use (as in, every whitehead or blackhead) and you&#x27;ll really see that your acne is diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this particular product is the cheapest I&#x27;ve seen. Similar products sell for 16 dollars at Sephora. Buy here and save big!</li>
            <li> This facial tool helps a lot when trying to get rid of my blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Beauty is pain.  So while it hurts to use this tool, it definitely does the job!</li>
            <li> Surprised at the weight and finish of this comedone extractor.  Maybe an easier way of getting acne out then with fingers, less abrasive also.  the two ends are different. One end I use primarily, the longer end not so much. I don&#x27;t have much acne so maybe someone would be able to use both ends equally.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this comedone extractor because it was so affordable. I was wrong. It is well constructed and works great, especially if you steam your face first or use it after a long shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle tool but it works fine. It works best if you steam your face in the shower first. Arrived promptly. Sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> This is a must have if you have blemishes and black heads etc. It works great to squeeze out every bit of dirt and grime. Don&#x27;t use this unless your pores are open, like after a shower or wrap a warm towel around your face. If you use it for blemishes make sure your pimples are ready to be popped, otherwise it will hurt.</li>
            <li> Never had heard of these.. I didn&#x27;t realize how amazing this tool was going to work! especially on pimples in your ears that u cant get with your fingers.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good item made of good materials... however there is NO proper technique to use this... long story short no matter how you use this you will get some kind of scarring etc..</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Does what it is suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is really good.&lt;br /&gt;One is enuf for your basic pricking experiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I think it is pricey.</li>
            <li> Not the one I ordered and it only gets blemishes that are above or at surface of skin not below the surface.</li>
            <li> When using this remember ONLY to use it when your whitehead is showing, then you gently push on top of the whitehead to get the puss out. If a gentle push does not get it out then do not proceed any further. For black heads, push gently on top until you get it out. Also I would not recommend sliding it across your face because that may cause irritation to the skin and cause more acne or breakouts. If you do want to slide it then do it gently or after a cold splash of water to close your pores because you do not want to slide it over your face while your pores are open because dead skin can go into your pores again. Overall a cheap and good tool for blackheads or closed comedones.</li>
            <li> This tool is very helpful however, on certain parts of your face its hard to use like your brow bone, otherwise I would recommend it to anyone needing help with zits.</li>
            <li> This item was perfect. Instead of using my nails, I used this, and I took out my blackheads without hurting my skin.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried to used it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t work that good... don&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is somewhat harsh on the skin. Use only when skin is ready. Do not force anything or it will leave marks.</li>
            <li> I received my Facial Skin care tool today and guess what??? IT WAS USED! Only one side had a protective cover slip on it and it was TAPED up top from where you would open it. Disgusting!</li>
            <li> It works great for clearing out those hard-to-get-to blackheads and pimples. I mainly use it on the sides of my nostrils. I found that if I use this too frequently, it effectively cleans out the &amp;#34;good oils&amp;#34; in my skin and can lead to dryness and peeling. I recommend using it no more than once per week and sanitizing it between uses. How often you are able to use it will vary with your skin type.</li>
            <li> I love this tool. It gets even the smallest pimples.  Hurts with pressure but I don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> I was thinking it was an amazing easy zit popper black head remover, but it is quite hard to use and hurts a bit . wont recommend. won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I got this tool, used it 1 time, and it broke right when I was done. Cheaply made. This was a re-purchase after a year or two so I expected better quality. It looks like it was manufactured differently, because the metal loop portion of the tool popped out of the metal tubing. I put it back in, but it popped right back out.</li>
            <li> I do not have terrible skin, but I do get the occasional pimple. I do have a good bit of blackheads around my nose and I&#x27;ve tried to remove them but ended up just making my face red. I got this in hopes that it would help. At first I was not getting good results, so I decided to use a hot compress. I found that it helps to remove the larger blackheads, although I still found it difficult to remove the smaller ones. I&#x27;m sure that if you spent more time working with it, you might get better results. The larger side for white pimples, works very well, hurts a little if you have sensitive skin, but took it right out.</li>
            <li> Use it to extract blackheads on skin that is very hard to manipulate without a tool.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. I use the small side and not the big side, though, so that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars. The big side doesn&#x27;t really do much. That being said, the small side works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done but isn&#x27;t exactly the most gentle thing ever (hence, my son hates it). It is much easier than squeezing, though. I like it b/c it has a textured grip and is super durable.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work on regular blackheads, it is nice for ones that have a whitehead, and you don&#x27;t get oil from your fingers on your face.  It does hurt too.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews i knew to was my face with hot water first to help open the pores nd loosen the blackheads but even after all that I had to mash at my face to get just a very small amount out causing alot of discomfort and bright lines that stayed for quite awhile. Im better off just using my aprricot scrub.</li>
            <li> I have trieed this facial skin care tool several times on me and on my husband, and it did not work on either one of us.</li>
            <li> There is no argument that this thing does what it&#x27;s meant for, whether you&#x27;re using it after steaming your pores or even if your face is dry. Those of you who are saying it doesn&#x27;t work might as well just terminate your internet provider because if you can&#x27;t \\&quot;figure out\\&quot; how to use this, you shouldn&#x27;t even really be using your computer or Amazon..... sorry, it&#x27;s kind of mean, but c&#x27;mon on people. It&#x27;s getting 5 stars because there is no doubt that this thing can get the job done. If you&#x27;re having a particularly hard time getting a pesky bugger out of your skin, put down the tool, go do some other stuff for a few days, then come pick your tool back up and try again.&lt;br /&gt;However, if I were to rate this based on how it helped my skin personally, I would give it a 4, but we rate on performance here, don&#x27;t we guys?&lt;br /&gt;Using this even after sanitizing seems to break me out considerably. I would even wash my face afterwards and still would be broken out the next day. It&#x27;s quite irritating to sensitive skin, so I advise those of you with skin like mine to use with caution. It&#x27;s a great product though, can&#x27;t be the price.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This tool is well built and worth the money.  This is important.  It will not work unless you just came out of a hot shower.  If you use it then, it works pretty darn good.  It doesn&#x27;t work well any other time.  This has been my experience.</li>
            <li> This too is easy to use, was a good price, I am very satisfied. No more expensive facials for me!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Does not work for me.</li>
            <li> Great tool to get blackheads and white heads out. very good quality.</li>
            <li> Great tool, removes whiteheads</li>
            <li> I liked this better than some name brand products. The flat long surface on the blackhead end works the best.</li>
            <li> Got this tool and it works great. Does not leave all the red marks all over your face when removing blackheads. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t make it work for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, I received it very quickly and it was in perfect brand new condition.  It works very well and I&#x27;m happy I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I love this tool. I n o longer have scars and it doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than using my fingers to pop zits. I also put a little bit of neosporin on the popped zit to help prevent spread of bacteria.</li>
            <li> I am so upset! I saw a tutorial of this type of tool on youtube, and had high hopes. It hurt to use it, but I kept going because I figured it would be worth it in the end. Well, my face is worse. It&#x27;s all bruised-looking. I thought that the redness would go down, but it hasn&#x27;t. I could just cry. I&#x27;m just glad it was only about four bucks because I&#x27;ll never use it again. :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I always lose these, but I&#x27;m glad to have one handy again for the every so often pesky problem area... It seems to be up to the job.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Good stainless construction.</li>
            <li> LOVE this tool! Takes care of the pimples without making you pick at your face and make it all red</li>
            <li> Good product. Does exactly what I needed. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I use this on my nose and cheeks, that&#x27;s were I usually get blackheads, and it definitely does the job. Sometimes it hurts though right after I do it maybe that&#x27;s just because I use a lot of pressure but I don&#x27;t really care about that as long as there&#x27;s no more blackheads then I&#x27;m all good. my makeup goes on smoother around my nose. So this is really a great product.</li>
            <li> I have a thing with keeping my pores clean. And this tool sort of did the job. It is a really painful tool to use first off. And unless you have fat gaping pores, this is really hard to use without making you cry the whole time you are using it. I don&#x27;t think I got much out with this tool. It worked in places but for the most part it really didn&#x27;t clean out my poors too well. Unsure if just the design makes it that way, maybe a different one would work better I&#x27;m not sure. Those Biore strips only cause a few second of pain and get far more out than I ever got with this tool.</li>
            <li> works great- never knew I needed one until I bought one</li>
            <li> Handle is easy to keep hold of thanks to the groves on it.  Ends are not very sharp but rounded like wire on one side.  I didn&#x27;t find it to helpful but maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong.  It just sits in my drawer now.  I&#x27;d rather of bought something else.</li>
            <li> love this device! so helpful!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like it or use it but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not well made.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t makes omelletes without breaking some eggs, eh?  Well, this thing works and will dig out some skin blemishes easier than others.  It&#x27;s best for big ones on the surface but it&#x27;s not going to get everything unless you peel your skin off, which this tool is capable of doing.</li>
            <li> It works just like it should. It came nice and clean and in a small pouch. It&#x27;s sturdy. I have used it a few times without any trouble. I good inexpensive purchase if you are new to it like me and want to try it out.</li>
            <li> Who needs facials when you can have all the products at home and use this amazing tool to extract all the junk from your face? I love how it removes so much grease/whiteheads/blackheads that you didn&#x27;t even know you had! Slide it over your pores with some pressure and you&#x27;ll see it (I have oily skin and lots of visible pores!).</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do. However, I wish it was a tad bit longer. It is a bit short. But definitely accomplishes what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The Body Toolz Double Loop Facial Skin Care Tool arrived quickly and is exactly as described.  I&#x27;ve only had to use it once since I got it, but that experience was very successful.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little tool for extracting blackheads, it makes it easier not to damage the tender skin on the face. I have a 10 x magnifing mirror that I use. When my daughter comes and visits, shes always in my batroom using this tool and my mirror! Easy to clean with alcohol.</li>
            <li> I only use the small loop, and it works great on my skin, dry or steamed.  It&#x27;s great for clearing up painful acne, ingrown hairs (my nemesis), and blackheads without damaging skin as much as fingers or sharper tools might.  The small loop broke off the first one I bought quite quickly, but Amazon replaced it, no problem.  The &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; one has held up for well over a year since.</li>
            <li> Work fine but hurt sometimes when you apply a lot of pressure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really cheap compared to some acne tools I have seen for 12 bucks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to clean the tool before each use with rubbing alcohol or witch hazel also work a lot better if you wash and expoliate your face before use</li>
            <li> Item just as described.  Helped extract from face with just a little pressure.</li>
            <li> I think every one should have one of these, along with a magnifying mirror. Do not use this unless you have just got from the shower or washed your face. You will damage your skin by forcing out through hard skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist used this on me once and I looked for it here.  This works really well!  I&#x27;m able to use this on blackheads and pimples and it barely leaves a mark compared to when you squeeze your skin to pop a pimple.  The only mark left is from the pimple bursting, especially if it was a big one.  My skin does turn red after using this tool but it dissipates within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. MY PRODUCT BROKE THE SECOND TIME I USED IT. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I would give it zero stars if I could...</li>
            <li> Use this to get rid of blackheads and pimps without hurting or damaging your skin. Just drag it across your skin with the wide loop or push gently with the small loop to get the deepest of problems. I always steam my face before or do it right after a hot shower when the Pores are open and soft. follow up with Vitamin E oil</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to get black heads out of hard to reach places and got this and its useless. One side is too rounded to hold still the other side is too flat and wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have giant pimples or cysts or something already sticking out of your skin maybe this is useful. But if you have an ingrown hair or blackhead this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Simple product.  Does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> so I stopped using an exfoliating brush for a few weeks and I got very spotty (three spots all in a line from cheek to chin). I popped those suckers with this tool and got all the gunk out using both ends. The big end is good for larger spots and the small end for smaller spots or on the remnants of the larger spot. It&#x27;s stainless steel so easy to clean and disinfect, hot water and hydrogen peroxide for me.</li>
            <li> Great item! Great Price. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Not only is this exactly what I wanted but it arrived quickly(2 days after order)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got it I opened it right up and went to work. It&#x27;s perfect and couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> Works great. I don&#x27;t really have anything else to say but apparently must write fifteen words. one two three four</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as other products.</li>
            <li> Great product, gets the job done and gets it done well.  Both look sides are great for removing blackheads and whiteheads.  I will be buying another should anything ever happen to the one I have.</li>
            <li> This tool is great! I&#x27;ve seen that others need to steam their face in order to get black heads and while this is true for the really deep ones, the tool can be used everyday. I found this especially helpful for white heads. Instead of using my hands, or really inconvenient q-tips (which doesn&#x27;t surround the zit), the tool makes it just sooo much easier. Highly recommend those that have acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on my nose to get the yucky stuff out of my pores.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I followed other reviewer advice and waited until after a shower to use it.  I had no idea my face was so gross.  LOL :)  I have great skin, and my husband even used it on a couple spots on my back and said he got tons of gook out of there.  I didn&#x27;t even know the pores were clogged!  Great little tool!</li>
            <li> A simple tool that everyone should have to keep their skin looking good</li>
            <li> This is a handy way to pop out a potential zit but you really have to be careful. I used it on my chin and now have 3 big holes where I was pressing. This baby hurts but does the job. Would recommend as its sturdy!</li>
            <li> It is way to small and doesn&#x27;t work that well, not that recommended unless very patient.</li>
            <li> I thought that it would easily push out most of my blackheads and pimples on my face, but it just doesn&#x27;t do the job. I tried using it right when I wake up, midway through the day, and right after a shower, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me whenever I use it. I would say only three blackheads came out with this product and it hurts if I use it on a fresh pimple. It could be just my skin because I have seen many reviews saying that this product works for them.</li>
            <li> Works very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This works very well at removing black and white heads.  Just don&#x27;t do it every day since I&#x27;m sure it would be damaging to the skin.  Definitely a better alternative than using your fingernails.</li>
            <li> this is the same tool that skin care shop uses.&lt;br /&gt;so quality is good and over all nice.&lt;br /&gt;but it hurts so bad so i dont use it....</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product itself. It seems to be sturdy and well made, but there might be a problem with the idea behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work much better than fingers would work. I guess if I was officially trained in how to use it, but it doesn&#x27;t come with an instruction manual and what seems to be self explanatory doesn&#x27;t seem that much more effective than two index fingers pinching the skin.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good at getting the blackheads from the edge of your nose area.  Lost a star because not so good with regular old pimples.  This thing is built solid though and should last me forever.  My wife found it and now she loves it too.  Cleans easy.</li>
            <li> The large end broke a week after having it</li>
            <li> Not functioning effectively as I had expected. I guess my black/whiteheads problem is not that bad after all.......</li>
            <li> This works alright and is pretty addicting for pickers. So if you are a picker you really ought to think twice. It will make your habit worse. I think it does more harm than good.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product. One end broke off after a week.  The other end you really can&#x27;t  use.  Don&#x27;t purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a very useful tool for getting out stubborn blackheads on your nose and anywhere else they might pop up. I get them on my nose and was very satisfied with the results. I have had many facials at spas and this tool is the almost same thing they use and just as effective. If you have to pop or get out zits or blackheads this tool is much more sanitary than using your nails or fingers.</li>
            <li> It is a sturdy item and ok for the price.  If you want a more surgical quality item you will need to pay more.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to going to get facials once a year if I can afford it.</li>
            <li> This tool is great, but it took me some time to figure out the best way to use it for my face. For the small loop, I use it so the loop doesn&#x27;t sit flat against my face. For whatever reason, it works better if I turn the loop around so it&#x27;s slightly away from my face, and then I drag it across the area I want to &amp;#34;de-gunk.&amp;#34; It works much better than having the loop flush with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat loop, I use the edge like I used to use my fingernail. This works well on the surface of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pretty much only use this tool after exfoliating my face because otherwise it takes too much pressure to extract anything. But this is a much better alternative to using my fingernails.</li>
            <li> Does its intended job.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t figure out how to use this properly..</li>
            <li> Before I begin this review I would like to state that the actual item I purchased I give a 5 star rating. The item works great and arrived new as indicated.  It was a great deal and im happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the customer service of this seller I rate it a 0.  The product was supposed to arrive on the 17th of July. I received it on the 22nd of July. So don&#x27;t expect to receive the package on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller two days after, on July 19th, about the product being late. I never received an email back. I then contacted them again on the 21st about the same issue. They have to this day not responded. I am happy I got my order but if I had not received it, I can see that they would not be offering to do anything about this situation. I would be disputing the charges at this point. They don&#x27;t email back so don&#x27;t expect anything from the emails you send to them.</li>
            <li> Works well enough and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase. I would recommend using the tool after a warm shower, makes getting rid of blackheads and whiteheads easier.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but I trusted the great reviews. This really works!!! So happy to have stumbled across this.</li>
            <li> Much less scarring than using fingernails, and healing time seems to be quicker. Definitely worth the price. And it&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li> This device is very good for blemishes and I use it all the time. That being said...it&#x27;s not as strong as your own fingers. Which I think is a good thing, prevents scarring. I would def. recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have used one before that looked just like but it did not work like the other one. The loop facial skin clear did not work on my blemishes at all, it only bruised the area I used it on.</li>
            <li> This tool works perfectly for what it&#x27;s intended for.  Without getting into the disgusting details, this unit works great and there is little to no bruising.</li>
            <li> Nice little tool to remove pimples and blackheads without damaging the skin.  It was inexpensive and every girl, person needs to have one of these in their bathroom.</li>
            <li> No, this tool not working for my skin, the hole tip very tiny..  I couldnt even see my black/ white head trough it.. Dissapointed, and the other tip is i never use that because i dont have hugo acne/ black/whiteheads to po out..</li>
            <li> This is a very cool tool. It makes something that should be simple (but often isn&#x27;t), really easy. Its looks are deceiving because it looks as though it would bend or break, but it is built well like a professional tool. Should have bought one years ago.</li>
            <li> Longer side of loop does nothing but shorter side works as expected</li>
            <li> Good product, easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t leave marks on your face, and does it&#x27;s job. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Sturdy and handy tool to have</li>
            <li> This is my second tool of this nature, the first being one I purchased at a drug store and it just didn&#x27;t meet expectations and it left horrible red marks on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always  had to deal with blackheads no matter how often I wash my face. Squeezing them with fingers usually ends up in a scabbed mess.&lt;br /&gt;This tool is great. I would recommend using it after a hot shower or after you&#x27;ve been sweating because the pores are more open. This tool gently extracts the gunk and there are no marks left behind.</li>
            <li> Learned about this tool at a spa when getting a facial. It allows you to safely blemishes without damaging the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> I used a different tool before. But I must say this one is more convinient and works good. Especially when I step out of the shower, when my skin is soft from the steam, it works best.</li>
            <li> First of all, this product works. However, it is easy to misuse, and can lead to more problems than it fixes. Easy to cause bleeding, scabs, etc. Be VERY gentle with this product. I have used these for many years, this one is not different than most (with the exception of the flat white-hear loop, which I assume is to help prevent cutting but makes zits harder to pop), but these products in general must be used with caution.</li>
            <li> Does not work at ALL.</li>
            <li> I don;t know if i was using this product wrong or the blemish wasn&#x27;t ready to be taken care of, But it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> ATTENTION MOMS - GET THIS FOR YOUR TEEN!  About 3 years ago we noticed a black-spot on my son&#x27;s cheek. We thought it was a mole or an ingrown hair, until today. After a warm exfoliation, my son used the Body Toolz Loop and realized he actually had a nasty black-head on his cheep - he now has an indentation (pock-mark).  I really wish I had known about this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> My tool has started to rust, which is disappointing.  Also, this tool is not overly easy to use on stubborn blackheads - just ready to go white head pimples.</li>
