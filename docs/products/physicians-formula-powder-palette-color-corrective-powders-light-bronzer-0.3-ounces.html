            <li>I love this bronzer!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>i love this powder!</li>
            <li>I use it along with the Rose Blush palette.</li>
            <li>it gives me a nice tan look, but it doesnt make me look like im covered in it.</li>
            <li>A light bronzer with no sparkle just all over warm color!</li>
            <li>Didnt care for this, wanted more contrast color</li>
            <li>I was glad to have found it on line.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t use as a bronzer as I already have another brand I like better for that.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many brands, shades, and types of blush, but always return to Physicians Formula Bronzer.</li>
            <li>Love all the products they make.</li>
            <li>I am brunette with a fair complexion and this is just right.  </li>
            <li>It is light and blends many shades, not just one.</li>
            <li>No awful sparkles, easy to shade and accentuate, and color true to palette.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really good for sensitive skin and contouring as well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product as it is fairly light bronzer and is not glittery</li>
            <li>Product is OK however, package clearly states it contains a mirror and brush.  </li>
            <li>This gives your skin just the right amount of color to satisfy a glow during the season.  </li>
            <li>I read some reviews on this product and it was supposed to be good for pale girls.</li>
            <li>Just about the time you really use a product and it works, POOF,</li>
            <li>but they were very &amp;#34;coppery&amp;#34; and shiny.</li>
            <li>Have always found these products to be of high quality, as I&#x27;ve had them before.</li>
            <li>Love it but getting hard to find.</li>
            <li>I tried a few others that said they we light</li>
            <li>Gives a nice overall &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; without the fake look.</li>

            <li> To dark for me.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight when applied and I like the color, but had a heavy powdery look that hasn&#x27;t blended in no matter how I&#x27;ve tried to apply it.</li>
            <li> I consider this false advertising and would never buy another of their products again due to this deception.</li>
            <li> I am very pale, as in close to albino looking.</li>
            <li> other bronzers make me look awful, this is the only one I will use.  </li>
            <li> It was a fail for me, it just makes my cheeks look \\&quot;dirty.\\&quot;</li>

            <li> Made my face break out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 2005 and it has never been changed.  I have always received compliments on how glowy my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Didnt care for this, wanted more contrast color</li>

            <li> I love this bronzer! It gives me a nice glow without making me look dirty or orange. I have been using this for several years and have no desire to change!</li>
            <li> Lightweight when applied and I like the color, but had a heavy powdery look that hasn&#x27;t blended in no matter how I&#x27;ve tried to apply it.</li>
            <li> This was a product I had been using that disappeared from my local shelves.  Just about the time you really use a product and it works, POOF, it&#x27;s no longer around.  I was glad to have found it on line.  No more waste in spent money trying to find that just right product all over again.  This gives your skin just the right amount of color to satisfy a glow during the season.  It is light and blends many shades, not just one.</li>

            <li> This is the only bronzer I will use.  I am fair skinned and other bronzers make me look awful, this is the only one I will use.  I like the multi-colors in it and they always blend well.</li>
            <li> To dark for me.  can&#x27;t use as a bronzer as I already have another brand I like better for that.  Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>

            <li> I really like this product as it is fairly light bronzer and is not glittery/shimmery.  Gives me just a bit of extra color.  I am brunette with a fair complexion and this is just right.  I tried a few others that said they we light but they were very &amp;#34;coppery&amp;#34; and shiny.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Product is OK however, package clearly states it contains a mirror and brush.  I have neither a mirror nor brush.  I consider this false advertising and would never buy another of their products again due to this deception.</li>
            <li> Have tried many brands, shades, and types of blush, but always return to Physicians Formula Bronzer. No awful sparkles, easy to shade and accentuate, and color true to palette.</li>
