            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised at how great these lights look on our tree!</li>

            <li>very colorful light with great lighting effects.</li>
            <li>I love that the bulbs are round and perfect size, also great colors.</li>
            <li>works great, pretty colors</li>
            <li>They do change colors rather quickly so they may not be good for a tree unless you like a strobing tree, but your guests won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Love these guys.</li>
            <li>I love it  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Also, not as many colors as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them for sure but buyer beware...</li>
            <li>That said, enjoy!</li>
            <li>the plastic part is somewhat cheap looking.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s def a buy!</li>
            <li>They look more like the size of marbles than lights.  </li>
            <li>And for the price, I was expecting more.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;d buy 5 more if I needed them.</li>
            <li>Nice light.  </li>
            <li>They give off a nice light.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely love these lights...</li>
            <li>many lights were burned out or blinked erratically</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Stunning colors and wonderfully cheerful!</li>
            <li>But they are so cute.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting lighting string.  </li>
            <li>Get two, or more, and they go end to end.</li>
            <li>love these lights and so does everyone who has seen them...</li>
            <li>would like more of them</li>
            <li>so hope I will be able to find them again</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>and they all love how it looks and</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>my use them but saving for an occasion when obnoxious blinking lights would be appropriate.</li>
            <li>Also they use more power than an equivalent string of LED lights.</li>
            <li>This meant that I wasn&#x27;t able to use them on my boat as I had planned.  </li>
            <li>(Imagine how many adapters you would need if it was though).</li>
            <li>They are my favorite of all my Christmas lights.</li>
            <li>I bought 4 more.  </li>

            <li>Pretty cool lights!!!</li>
            <li>Bright and colorful LED color changing light string added to my Christmas decoration.  </li>
            <li>So far they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>These lights are incredibly well made and will definitely stand to the test of time.</li>
            <li>These soft multi color changing light bulbs look beautiful on my x-mas tree.</li>
            <li>these  are cool !</li>
            <li>These work just great, but the colors appear more subdued in the picture than on the actual strand.  </li>
            <li>They do change colors very fast, but they still look nice.  </li>
            <li>A sincere apology to all of those people who went on and on about these lights and how cool they are.......</li>
            <li>I bought some for family after we liked them so much!</li>
            <li>I wish I could manage the stations some times they get to fast, but in general it works perfect</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this was just around a room that we didn&#x27;t use super often.</li>
            <li>lederTEK&#x27;s picture is fairly accurate regarding color saturation of lit bulbs.</li>
            <li>Really eye catching and colors</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although there is no controller to change the light sequence.</li>
            <li>The plug is cheaply made, but works.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;d transition between colors smoothly, but they blink rapidly like a strobe light.</li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>The colors are not pastel, they are primary.  </li>
            <li>Each light globe has a color changing RGB LED in it.  </li>
            <li>Superficially, the light string looks well</li>
            <li>I will be happy if it still works next year.</li>
            <li>PLUS I laid one light strand across living room floor to watch the color change.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 strings of these and liked them so much</li>
            <li>Gorgeous &amp; gentle colorful changing lights.</li>
            <li>colors are soft and gorgeous...</li>
            <li>Unique light show and color.</li>
            <li>These lights look like new age christmas lights, but better!</li>
            <li>There are so many colors, the colors are bright and fun (not as pastel as pictured), and they blink and alternate colors.</li>
            <li>So these were really cute when I first put them up.</li>
            <li>While very pretty, the wire snapped as soon as I hung them up on my RV awning, so I never got to enjoy them.</li>
            <li>Love them and recommend them highly!</li>
            <li>These things are sweet.</li>
            <li>Other than that shipped fast and great light for any type of decor!</li>
            <li>Christmas present sure she will be quite pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Super blinky, lots of changing colors.</li>
            <li>This light string really surprised me, especially considering the great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty and the construction of the product is sturdy, however, the blinking is, in my opinion, mind numbing.</li>
            <li>These lights are actually smaller than they appear on-line, but they are beautiful and have a soft glow.</li>
            <li>Pretty good lights, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>These colorful and active lights worked great right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Really nice - we put the lights inside a large terra-cotta turtle and the colorful glow at night is a nice way to accent a dark porch.</li>
            <li>These are sooo pretty!</li>
            <li>Great little lights for what i will use them for.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty but one of the wires came exposed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>If the lights are kept in a bundle, it provides a very trippy/raver light</li>
            <li>Pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Nice coolers outdid not last a week.</li>
            <li>Then the fun waned a lite but.</li>
            <li>Thrilled with the effect these present.</li>
            <li>Oh wow, are these ever cute.</li>
            <li>Terrific colors and nice shape.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice, but I&#x27;d only buy them for parties or Christmas.</li>
            <li>A generous number of really fun lights for the price</li>
            <li>It is an ever changing display of colorful lights.</li>
            <li>these are pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>Fun lights but</li>
            <li>Nice set of low energy LED Christmas lights.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>These are colorful and balls which have a matte finish.</li>
            <li>So, they don&#x27;t look weirdly colorful and garish.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what it describes, very satisfied with it, only thing is I wished I could make it not blink</li>
            <li>Thats really about the only good thing I can say about them.</li>
            <li>These were bought for under a canopy for a 4th of July party, these were kind of nice to watch when sitting and provided just enough light to see who was sitting on the other side of the canopy without being blinding.</li>
            <li>I had to throw them right into the trash.</li>
            <li>Great for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas Parade costume</li>
            <li>Either way the colors are very vibrant!</li>
            <li>These are very cool and colorful, the only nit I&#x27;d pick is that they don&#x27;t do anything in concert.</li>
            <li>, you can&#x27;t judge a book by it&#x27;s cover or a product by first impressions.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Very cosy!</li>
            <li>Most lights like this have an outlet on the back of the plug, this does not, but it does have a connector, an outlet at the end of it.</li>
            <li>and my son thinks they&#x27;re pretty neat</li>
            <li>they are pretty much exactly as shown in the image.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking</li>
            <li>These were exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>they are colorful, bright, and the different settings allow for different levels of display.</li>
            <li>they are energy efficient and do not get hot, so they are not a fire hazard.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors but no controls for the erratic/spastic blinking pattern...</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li>This is the first product review I&#x27;ve ever written in the almost 70 amazon orders I have placed this year.</li>
            <li>After this Xmas I&#x27;m giving away my old standard led&#x27;s and buying more of these to decorate the tree and the house!</li>
            <li>Vibrant and colorful.</li>
            <li>Comes with it&#x27;s own built in controller and has various settings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful of the strong chemical smell that comes from the lights and the packaging.</li>
            <li>so  much, went back and order 3 more strings.</li>
            <li>The speed of the color changing is very fast - much faster than I&#x27;d prefer (it seems like they&#x27;d go well with techno music - nothing against techno music -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at the number of positive reviews on these</li>
            <li>very nice colors and fun, but poor quality</li>
            <li>I bought them to decorate my dorm room because I thought that the soft changing colors would look cool, but they make me feel like I&#x27;m about to host a rave.</li>
            <li>they have a totally random blink and color change, each light does its own thing, 2 blinking speeds and color change , they are like no other light i have ever seen, i bought a set for my mom and 3 sets for me, they are cool</li>
            <li>Each light is an individual color changing LED, which individually cycles between a fast and slow color changing mode - it is color chaos at its best!</li>
            <li>The bulbs aren&#x27;t as large as I thought they looked in the photo</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also fairly confident they would have sparked and melted through the other soldered places if I didn&#x27;t discover the workmanship after the first string burned out.  </li>
            <li>very festive</li>
            <li>I really like these lights.  </li>
            <li>and I just wish I had two of them to put around the whole bedroom.</li>
            <li>The flashing pattern is too fast for us though.</li>
            <li>She and her room mate really like them</li>
            <li>There was so much excess glue all over these lights</li>
            <li>The lights I received have no options to change the way the lights change/blink, and they blink and change really fast.</li>
            <li>These appear to be incredibly cheaply produced, no function to keep them from constantly blinking.</li>
            <li>there is no way to control the fast change of color.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy them and use them for low lighting effects where we watch tv and entertain.  </li>
            <li>We really like them</li>
            <li>One of my kids wants a set just for her room.</li>
            <li>They ARE EXTREMELY FAST BLINKING....</li>
            <li>that every third light was out.....</li>
            <li>Super bright at not too big or small.</li>
            <li>fabulous little string of lights.. the color change is so cool..</li>
            <li>The lights are such a rich saturated color.</li>
            <li>Kind of strange, they flash all different speeds and</li>
            <li>They do change colors a little fast, and would be better if they came with different light changing settings.</li>
            <li>The other lights were absolutely beautiful with a green cord.  </li>
            <li>2 work fine, but one partially works.</li>
            <li>It feels like a party and also it makes it easy to see at night when all other lights are off</li>
            <li>Every third or fourth bulb flashes at varying frequencies which is very festive, but I would like to also enjoy them when they&#x27;re not flashing.</li>
            <li>the bright side we just ended up wrapping them around a column for decoration they havent broken yet.</li>
            <li>NO SLOW FADE like they describe.</li>
            <li>meaning that they will NOT plug into a normal plug that we use in the United States.  </li>
            <li>But ultimately, the price is pretty much unbeatable...</li>
            <li>A mixture of colors producing yellow cyana and light blue again repeated 4 times.  </li>
            <li>They change colors individually in a pattern with multiple light changing speeds.</li>
            <li>I love how they are fast and then slow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very busy and distracting for indoor use.</li>
            <li>After looking at the strands I bought in retrospect, I&#x27;m very surprised they didn&#x27;t cause a fire.  </li>
            <li>Would be helpful if there was a 15 to 30 second video of each product to show buys what it exactly does.</li>
            <li>not exactly sure if I&#x27;ll be able to use these as I had intended.</li>
            <li>Hey, if you like busy (psychedelic twinkling) lights, these are for you!</li>
            <li>but I usually prefer a more mellow pace).  </li>
            <li>The superglue holding them together is very evident in several places and they&#x27;re just generally not as expected.</li>
            <li>The lights are big enough to actually create a little bit of light in a room, which I love.</li>
            <li>The strand is very long which is nice, twice as long as our other light strands for half the price and very high quality to boot.</li>
            <li>Changing lights were fine on slow fade, frenetically fast otherwise and not relaxing.</li>
            <li>The colors of the lights were amazing on the OTHER brand, they started all one color and slowly began to change, some bulbs changing slightly faster  than others until it was a lovely artful blend.  </li>
            <li>Now all I want is electronic versions of the old Christmas bubble lights.</li>
            <li>just about anything that&#x27;s being shipped directly from China takes a bit of time.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you can&#x27;t control the speed or anything really...</li>
            <li>They are like an old phone charger where you have to hold it a certian way or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>as far as the lights themselves.</li>
            <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s never any interesting multi-bulb/system pattern that could otherwise emerge as a result of these lights working in concert (at least optionally).</li>
            <li>The colors are Candyland colors, the the lights twinkle off and on in a soft and natural way, like twinkling stars.</li>
            <li>Spend a few extra bucks and get something a bit more substantial.</li>
            <li>I bought a string of similar lights through amazon two years ago, and have had trouble finding more.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve honestly never bought and received something with this kind of electrical hazard in my entire life.  </li>
            <li>The light is evenly distributed and these are definitely a step up from other store bought lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i figured that out by plugging new lights into them, and watching the new lights immediately short out.  </li>
            <li>LEDs only change quickly between red and blue, like store signage.  </li>
            <li>It is such a refreshing change from the pointed led lamps we usually have.</li>
            <li>They are not what I thought they were, there really should be a video of these lights in action, they don&#x27;t simply change colors they totally flash.</li>
            <li>looks nice, but one of them worked only for 2 days, have to return it and reorder one, not sure how long it keep working.</li>
            <li>Each light goes through a repeating cycle of first slowly fading between several colors, and then rapid fading between several colors.  </li>
            <li>They blink very fast and the only colors that are on the strand are red and blue.</li>
            <li>Have since had a couple inches of rain, with no other failures.</li>
            <li>Yeah right, there is not that much red or pink in there.....</li>
            <li>super annoying, but my kids love them!</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for general lighting.</li>
            <li>You can barely tell the are lighting up and flashing..  Will be returning.</li>
            <li>Having purchased some of this style of lights last fall, we really enjoyed the slow constant changing of the colors.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother to return because I figured it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li>Cheap slow delivery and not what was described by the seller.</li>
            <li>The primary color is Blue with flashes of red, yellow, green.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting brighter more dramatic lights and not small low key lights.  </li>
            <li>They were too much like any other multi-colored lights that change colors rapidly that you can buy at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>The materials are really weak and the strands break easily.</li>
            <li>Not sure how 50 LED color changing lights can be totally mesmerizing, but they are.</li>
            <li>I live in an area that gets winter weather, I don&#x27;t believe they are made to be used outdoors in wet weather.</li>
            <li>These lights not only sparked and melted through the wire within within 2 hours of use - when they did, I found there were multiple places where bare wires were soldered and left uninsulated to form the strand.  </li>
            <li>They looked cool in the photos but SERIOUSLY the coolest lights I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>They do blink a little fast</li>
            <li>That evening I turned the lights on and came to really like the little things.  </li>

            <li> works great, pretty colors</li>
            <li> They do change colors rather quickly so they may not be good for a tree unless you like a strobing tree, but your guests won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Love these guys.</li>
            <li> I love it  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Also, not as many colors as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them for sure but buyer beware...</li>
            <li> That said, enjoy!</li>
            <li> the plastic part is somewhat cheap looking.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s def a buy!</li>
            <li> They look more like the size of marbles than lights.  </li>
            <li> And for the price, I was expecting more.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;d buy 5 more if I needed them.</li>
            <li> Nice light.  </li>
            <li> They give off a nice light.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely love these lights...</li>
            <li> many lights were burned out or blinked erratically</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Stunning colors and wonderfully cheerful!</li>
            <li> But they are so cute.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting lighting string.  </li>
            <li> Get two, or more, and they go end to end.</li>
            <li> love these lights and so does everyone who has seen them...</li>
            <li> would like more of them</li>
            <li> so hope I will be able to find them again</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> and they all love how it looks and</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> my use them but saving for an occasion when obnoxious blinking lights would be appropriate.</li>
            <li> Also they use more power than an equivalent string of LED lights.</li>
            <li> This meant that I wasn&#x27;t able to use them on my boat as I had planned.  </li>
            <li> (Imagine how many adapters you would need if it was though).</li>
            <li> They are my favorite of all my Christmas lights.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 more.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:6581f166ea999efa5061b606d9eb1f03]] Check out the video to see the full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool lights!!!</li>
            <li> Bright and colorful LED color changing light string added to my Christmas decoration.  </li>
            <li> So far they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> These lights are incredibly well made and will definitely stand to the test of time.</li>
            <li> These soft multi color changing light bulbs look beautiful on my x-mas tree.</li>
            <li> these  are cool !</li>
            <li> These work just great, but the colors appear more subdued in the picture than on the actual strand.  </li>
            <li> They do change colors very fast, but they still look nice.  </li>
            <li> A sincere apology to all of those people who went on and on about these lights and how cool they are.......</li>
            <li> I bought some for family after we liked them so much!</li>
            <li> I wish I could manage the stations some times they get to fast, but in general it works perfect</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this was just around a room that we didn&#x27;t use super often.</li>
            <li> lederTEK&#x27;s picture is fairly accurate regarding color saturation of lit bulbs.</li>
            <li> Really eye catching and colors</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although there is no controller to change the light sequence.</li>
            <li> The plug is cheaply made, but works.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;d transition between colors smoothly, but they blink rapidly like a strobe light.</li>
            <li> Cheap.  </li>
            <li> The colors are not pastel, they are primary.  </li>
            <li> Each light globe has a color changing RGB LED in it.  </li>
            <li> Superficially, the light string looks well</li>
            <li> I will be happy if it still works next year.</li>
            <li> PLUS I laid one light strand across living room floor to watch the color change.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 strings of these and liked them so much</li>
            <li> Gorgeous &amp; gentle colorful changing lights.</li>
            <li> colors are soft and gorgeous...</li>
            <li> Unique light show and color.</li>
            <li> These lights look like new age christmas lights, but better!</li>
            <li> There are so many colors, the colors are bright and fun (not as pastel as pictured), and they blink and alternate colors.</li>
            <li> So these were really cute when I first put them up.</li>
            <li> While very pretty, the wire snapped as soon as I hung them up on my RV awning, so I never got to enjoy them.</li>
            <li> Love them and recommend them highly!</li>
            <li> These things are sweet.</li>
            <li> Other than that shipped fast and great light for any type of decor!</li>
            <li> Christmas present sure she will be quite pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Super blinky, lots of changing colors.</li>
            <li> This light string really surprised me, especially considering the great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty and the construction of the product is sturdy, however, the blinking is, in my opinion, mind numbing.</li>
            <li> These lights are actually smaller than they appear on-line, but they are beautiful and have a soft glow.</li>
            <li> Pretty good lights, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> These colorful and active lights worked great right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Really nice - we put the lights inside a large terra-cotta turtle and the colorful glow at night is a nice way to accent a dark porch.</li>
            <li> These are sooo pretty!</li>
            <li> Great little lights for what i will use them for.</li>
            <li> They are very pretty but one of the wires came exposed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> If the lights are kept in a bundle, it provides a very trippy/raver light</li>
            <li> Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Nice coolers outdid not last a week.</li>
            <li> Then the fun waned a lite but.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with the effect these present.</li>
            <li> Oh wow, are these ever cute.</li>
            <li> Terrific colors and nice shape.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice, but I&#x27;d only buy them for parties or Christmas.</li>
            <li> A generous number of really fun lights for the price</li>
            <li> It is an ever changing display of colorful lights.</li>
            <li> these are pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> Fun lights but</li>
            <li> Nice set of low energy LED Christmas lights.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> These are colorful and balls which have a matte finish.</li>
            <li> So, they don&#x27;t look weirdly colorful and garish.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what it describes, very satisfied with it, only thing is I wished I could make it not blink</li>
            <li> Thats really about the only good thing I can say about them.</li>
            <li> These were bought for under a canopy for a 4th of July party, these were kind of nice to watch when sitting and provided just enough light to see who was sitting on the other side of the canopy without being blinding.</li>
            <li> I had to throw them right into the trash.</li>
            <li> Great for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas Parade costume</li>
            <li> Either way the colors are very vibrant!</li>
            <li> These are very cool and colorful, the only nit I&#x27;d pick is that they don&#x27;t do anything in concert.</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t judge a book by it&#x27;s cover or a product by first impressions.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Very cosy!</li>
            <li> Most lights like this have an outlet on the back of the plug, this does not, but it does have a connector, an outlet at the end of it.</li>
            <li> and my son thinks they&#x27;re pretty neat</li>
            <li> they are pretty much exactly as shown in the image.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking</li>
            <li> These were exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> they are colorful, bright, and the different settings allow for different levels of display.</li>
            <li> they are energy efficient and do not get hot, so they are not a fire hazard.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but no controls for the erratic/spastic blinking pattern...</li>
            <li> Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li> This is the first product review I&#x27;ve ever written in the almost 70 amazon orders I have placed this year.</li>
            <li> After this Xmas I&#x27;m giving away my old standard led&#x27;s and buying more of these to decorate the tree and the house!</li>
            <li> Vibrant and colorful.</li>
            <li> Comes with it&#x27;s own built in controller and has various settings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful of the strong chemical smell that comes from the lights and the packaging.</li>
            <li> so  much, went back and order 3 more strings.</li>
            <li> The speed of the color changing is very fast - much faster than I&#x27;d prefer (it seems like they&#x27;d go well with techno music - nothing against techno music -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at the number of positive reviews on these</li>
            <li> very nice colors and fun, but poor quality</li>
            <li> I bought them to decorate my dorm room because I thought that the soft changing colors would look cool, but they make me feel like I&#x27;m about to host a rave.</li>
            <li> they have a totally random blink and color change, each light does its own thing, 2 blinking speeds and color change , they are like no other light i have ever seen, i bought a set for my mom and 3 sets for me, they are cool</li>
            <li> Each light is an individual color changing LED, which individually cycles between a fast and slow color changing mode - it is color chaos at its best!</li>
            <li> The bulbs aren&#x27;t as large as I thought they looked in the photo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also fairly confident they would have sparked and melted through the other soldered places if I didn&#x27;t discover the workmanship after the first string burned out.  </li>
            <li> very festive</li>
            <li> I really like these lights.  </li>
            <li> and I just wish I had two of them to put around the whole bedroom.</li>
            <li> The flashing pattern is too fast for us though.</li>
            <li> She and her room mate really like them</li>
            <li> There was so much excess glue all over these lights</li>
            <li> The lights I received have no options to change the way the lights change/blink, and they blink and change really fast.</li>
            <li> These appear to be incredibly cheaply produced, no function to keep them from constantly blinking.</li>
            <li> there is no way to control the fast change of color.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy them and use them for low lighting effects where we watch tv and entertain.  </li>
            <li> We really like them</li>
            <li> One of my kids wants a set just for her room.</li>
            <li> They ARE EXTREMELY FAST BLINKING....</li>
            <li> that every third light was out.....</li>
            <li> Super bright at not too big or small.</li>
            <li> fabulous little string of lights.. the color change is so cool..</li>
            <li> The lights are such a rich saturated color.</li>
            <li> Kind of strange, they flash all different speeds and</li>
            <li> They do change colors a little fast, and would be better if they came with different light changing settings.</li>
            <li> The other lights were absolutely beautiful with a green cord.  </li>
            <li> 2 work fine, but one partially works.</li>
            <li> It feels like a party and also it makes it easy to see at night when all other lights are off</li>
            <li> Every third or fourth bulb flashes at varying frequencies which is very festive, but I would like to also enjoy them when they&#x27;re not flashing.</li>
            <li> the bright side we just ended up wrapping them around a column for decoration they havent broken yet.</li>
            <li> NO SLOW FADE like they describe.</li>
            <li> meaning that they will NOT plug into a normal plug that we use in the United States.  </li>
            <li> But ultimately, the price is pretty much unbeatable...</li>
            <li> A mixture of colors producing yellow cyana and light blue again repeated 4 times.  </li>
            <li> They change colors individually in a pattern with multiple light changing speeds.</li>
            <li> I love how they are fast and then slow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very busy and distracting for indoor use.</li>
            <li> After looking at the strands I bought in retrospect, I&#x27;m very surprised they didn&#x27;t cause a fire.  </li>
            <li> Would be helpful if there was a 15 to 30 second video of each product to show buys what it exactly does.</li>
            <li> not exactly sure if I&#x27;ll be able to use these as I had intended.</li>
            <li> Hey, if you like busy (psychedelic twinkling) lights, these are for you!</li>
            <li> but I usually prefer a more mellow pace).  </li>
            <li> The superglue holding them together is very evident in several places and they&#x27;re just generally not as expected.</li>
            <li> The lights are big enough to actually create a little bit of light in a room, which I love.</li>
            <li> The strand is very long which is nice, twice as long as our other light strands for half the price and very high quality to boot.</li>
            <li> Changing lights were fine on slow fade, frenetically fast otherwise and not relaxing.</li>
            <li> The colors of the lights were amazing on the OTHER brand, they started all one color and slowly began to change, some bulbs changing slightly faster  than others until it was a lovely artful blend.  </li>
            <li> Now all I want is electronic versions of the old Christmas bubble lights.</li>
            <li> just about anything that&#x27;s being shipped directly from China takes a bit of time.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you can&#x27;t control the speed or anything really...</li>
            <li> They are like an old phone charger where you have to hold it a certian way or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> as far as the lights themselves.</li>
            <li> I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s never any interesting multi-bulb/system pattern that could otherwise emerge as a result of these lights working in concert (at least optionally).</li>
            <li> The colors are Candyland colors, the the lights twinkle off and on in a soft and natural way, like twinkling stars.</li>
            <li> Spend a few extra bucks and get something a bit more substantial.</li>
            <li> I bought a string of similar lights through amazon two years ago, and have had trouble finding more.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve honestly never bought and received something with this kind of electrical hazard in my entire life.  </li>
            <li> The light is evenly distributed and these are definitely a step up from other store bought lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i figured that out by plugging new lights into them, and watching the new lights immediately short out.  </li>
            <li> LEDs only change quickly between red and blue, like store signage.  </li>
            <li> It is such a refreshing change from the pointed led lamps we usually have.</li>
            <li> They are not what I thought they were, there really should be a video of these lights in action, they don&#x27;t simply change colors they totally flash.</li>
            <li> looks nice, but one of them worked only for 2 days, have to return it and reorder one, not sure how long it keep working.</li>
            <li> Each light goes through a repeating cycle of first slowly fading between several colors, and then rapid fading between several colors.  </li>
            <li> They blink very fast and the only colors that are on the strand are red and blue.</li>
            <li> Have since had a couple inches of rain, with no other failures.</li>
            <li> Yeah right, there is not that much red or pink in there.....</li>
            <li> super annoying, but my kids love them!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for general lighting.</li>
            <li> You can barely tell the are lighting up and flashing..  Will be returning.</li>
            <li> Having purchased some of this style of lights last fall, we really enjoyed the slow constant changing of the colors.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother to return because I figured it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> Cheap slow delivery and not what was described by the seller.</li>
            <li> The primary color is Blue with flashes of red, yellow, green.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting brighter more dramatic lights and not small low key lights.  </li>
            <li> They were too much like any other multi-colored lights that change colors rapidly that you can buy at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> The materials are really weak and the strands break easily.</li>
            <li> Not sure how 50 LED color changing lights can be totally mesmerizing, but they are.</li>
            <li> I live in an area that gets winter weather, I don&#x27;t believe they are made to be used outdoors in wet weather.</li>
            <li> These lights not only sparked and melted through the wire within within 2 hours of use - when they did, I found there were multiple places where bare wires were soldered and left uninsulated to form the strand.  </li>
            <li> They looked cool in the photos but SERIOUSLY the coolest lights I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> They do blink a little fast</li>
            <li> That evening I turned the lights on and came to really like the little things.  </li>
            <li> The lights are really very pretty, but they are only blue, green and red (red to blue, and red to green), not all the colors in picture (no yellow).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Truth in advertising is important to me and these folks failed the test.</li>
            <li> them all year long.</li>
            <li> Technology has come a long way.</li>
            <li> Only red, blue, and green.</li>
            <li> They took so long to come, I wanted to return them.</li>
            <li> never pure green 2 A fast gycle through red blue and green four times.  </li>
            <li> this purchase actually burned $100 of other lights i bought this season.  </li>
            <li> ,one already died after a week so I am expecting the other 3 to do the same.</li>
            <li> Upon inspection after failure of the lights I found that moisture had gotten into the small black box at the end of the light string and shorted out the tiny circuit board inside.</li>
            <li> Red, Blue, and Green.</li>
            <li> and we put then around our house outside with icicle lights hanging down  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t enable to survive taking it back down.</li>
            <li> They faded slowly and brightened with a new color every 7 or 8 seconds.</li>
            <li> The three only shows as black 4 times each cycle of the display.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the colors change waaay too quickly.</li>
            <li> I realized that some of the wire had come completely undone on at least three lights.</li>
            <li> The cycle seems to go like this 1 slow gycle of the 3 leds showing the red and blue with a bit of green mixed in but</li>
            <li> bulbs change between red and green and some bulbs have a non functioning alt LED</li>
            <li> so they turn red or green and off.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, I had to return it.</li>
            <li> These lights work as expected.  </li>
            <li> the way the colors changing so soft and slowly faded out.</li>
            <li> you want only slow color fades, Amazon has another string of lights which does that, and it generally looks very similar except the wires are green instead of black:  </li>
            <li> I ordered three strands; one strange is half red and green and the other is purple and</li>
            <li> A little worried about long term as they are made in china.</li>
            <li> After they arrived we found the &amp;#34;slow&amp;#34; change described in the product information was actually an abrupt change every second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also...the strands do not connect to each other.  </li>
            <li> I wanted colors that faded into each other, not faded and blinked.</li>
            <li> That is it, no where to plug another strand in on the other end of the lights.</li>
            <li> The item was as described, but I had a pre-thought that the lighting would slowly change from one color to another - but the lights changed very quickly in different patterns - would have distracted from the tree.</li>
            <li> I am going to research and see if I can rig the lights to not blink so quickly or not blink at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wires of the lights are black.  </li>
            <li> If you want rapidly changing multi-colored bulbs on a black cord you will like these.</li>
            <li> The little black box is not sealed in any way against weather or wetness.</li>
            <li> Being unwilling to wait for another order I just put them on the little four foot tree I have and finished decorating.  </li>
            <li> I thought you were a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Each little globe changes colors with each pulsation.</li>
            <li> These lights last for hundreds of hours at least!</li>
            <li> A little bit pricy</li>
            <li> Theres a little box on the end, but no buttons or anything to use.</li>
            <li> Just a little boxx thats glued shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My strand of lights are blinking (seriously, there should be a warning for people who are prone to epileptic seizures).</li>
            <li> Somewhat irritating, but not enough for me to pan the review.</li>
            <li> There are three bulbs that have a dead green led (over two strings).  </li>
            <li> We use them all year round.</li>
            <li> yes, sorry, I&#x27;ve got it up already) come alive.  </li>
            <li> They were taken out of their box and the wire was split and were dead on arrival.</li>
            <li> ar, so we will need a few hundred feet.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal for my use, just an observation.</li>
            <li> I bought these to decorate my wedding, but I&#x27;m afraid I might induce half of my guests in to seizures with the constantly blinking lights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These bulbs do color-change softly, but they are very poorly constructed.</li>
            <li> this picture provides a false representation of the product and I am more disappointed than a child who was just told Santa</li>
            <li> In all honesty they weren&#x27;t like anything I was expecting was a disappointed when I first took them out of the box.  </li>
            <li> small balls and no setting....</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the lights to be so small, there was nothing in the picture to provide perspective</li>
            <li> Not very bright at all, and the random pattern that they change is from color to color with just looks terrible, and about a fourth of the lights will flicker most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I plugged them in for one brief second they were the coolest lights Iv&#x27;e ever seen, then they blinked and changed colors so violently with no option to stop the seizure inducing flashing</li>
            <li> Lights failed in dry weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchase again, but wary of partially working ones.</li>
            <li> Blinking is quite fast to the point of being annoyingly distractive.</li>
            <li> They slowly change colors.</li>
            <li> The lights are not synchronized, so at any given time, some lights are in the rapid color changing mode, and some are in the slowly color changing mode.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a slow fade set</li>
            <li> All in all for my purposes, they are a failure.</li>
            <li> The cord is black which makes it difficult to use at Christmas.  </li>
            <li> One string out of 8 failed after a few days of outdoor use.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just had bad luck with a few strands that were early engineering prototypes, but even in a shop they would have been dangerous.</li>
            <li> but the word slow led me to believe that indicated the speed of something...and unfortunately nothing about these is slow.  </li>
            <li> They are very delicate.</li>
            <li> We hid the non-flashing part behind a curtain.</li>
            <li> They either blink or slowly shift between colors randomly.</li>
            <li> They came broken.</li>
            <li> While my girlfriend really likes these I have to take a star for a horrible product description.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m effing pissed and never buying anything else from these crooks.  </li>
            <li> story short, do not buy, terrible product, etc, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they blink like crazy.</li>
            <li> Holy crap do these things never stop...</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!</li>
            <li> but THESE ARE CRAP!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pretty cool lights!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty cool. I wish they were longer though. they blink like crazy.</li>
            <li> Great for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas Parade costume</li>
            <li> So far they&#x27;re great. A little worried about long term as they are made in china.</li>
            <li> love it they are perfect they are bright and we put then around our house outside with icicle lights hanging down  very festive</li>
            <li> I love these lights! They stah cool and look great on the tree.</li>
            <li> These are gorgeous lights. Really eye catching and colors you dont often see.</li>
            <li> I really like these lights.  They do change colors very fast, but they still look nice.  The are the perfect length to hang on my mantle.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and worked perfectly for Christmas!</li>
            <li> wire quality is great, great bulbs too&lt;br /&gt;Although there is no controller to change the light sequence.</li>
            <li> Love these guys. Lots of different colors changing all the time...lovely.</li>
            <li> Christmas present sure she will be quite pleased with them. It&#x27;s nice that they are linkable</li>
            <li> Having purchased some of this style of lights last fall, we really enjoyed the slow constant changing of the colors. They faded slowly and brightened with a new color every 7 or 8 seconds. While searching for another set we found these. They had an overall rating of 4 stars. After they arrived we found the &amp;#34;slow&amp;#34; change described in the product information was actually an abrupt change every second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth in advertising is important to me and these folks failed the test.</li>
            <li> This light string really surprised me, especially considering the great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balls randonly twinkle and are quite bright. The light is evenly distributed and these are definitely a step up from other store bought lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to &amp;#34;modernize&amp;#34; your tree with color changing, these lights will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Website description doesn&#x27;t match product.  LEDs only change quickly between red and blue, like store signage.  No switch to change settings.  Returned product.</li>
            <li> lederTEK&#x27;s picture is fairly accurate regarding color saturation of lit bulbs. Lights offer pastel color blend. One string out of 8 failed after a few days of outdoor use. Lights failed in dry weather. Have since had a couple inches of rain, with no other failures. &amp;#34;Failed&amp;#34; meaning: lights turn on, but all white, non-blinking, no color cycle. Somewhat irritating, but not enough for me to pan the review. We used the failing string as background lighting in some of our landscaping.</li>
            <li> I love it  I have them on my walls in the bedroom and I just wish I had two of them to put around the whole bedroom. It feels like a party and also it makes it easy to see at night when all other lights are off</li>
            <li> These work great for ambient light systems.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these lights and love the colors!  They do blink a little fast but I think they&#x27;re great.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> We are getting lots of compliments on our lights on our shed!</li>
            <li> Beautiful product. Colors look perfect tones..</li>
            <li> The item was as described, but I had a pre-thought that the lighting would slowly change from one color to another - but the lights changed very quickly in different patterns - would have distracted from the tree. Would be helpful if there was a 15 to 30 second video of each product to show buys what it exactly does.</li>
            <li> In all honesty they weren&#x27;t like anything I was expecting was a disappointed when I first took them out of the box.  The bulbs aren&#x27;t as large as I thought they looked in the photo and there was no controller for the sequencing or blinking of the lights.  I didn&#x27;t pay a lot and I needed lights for my tree.  Being unwilling to wait for another order I just put them on the little four foot tree I have and finished decorating.  That evening I turned the lights on and came to really like the little things.  By Christmas time I couldn&#x27;t see my tree without having them on in future.&lt;br /&gt;Just goes to show, you can&#x27;t judge a book by it&#x27;s cover or a product by first impressions.  ;-)</li>
            <li> fabulous little string of lights.. the color change is so cool..</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 strands. 2 work fine, but one partially works. About 1/3 does not flash. Also, not as many colors as shown in the photo. The plug is cheaply made, but works. I&#x27;d purchase again, but wary of partially working ones. We hid the non-flashing part behind a curtain.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Very cosy!</li>
            <li> Lights shorted out.  Nice coolers outdid not last a week.</li>
            <li> For those of you that are like me and weren&#x27;t even thinking about it.  These are 110V...meaning that they will NOT plug into a normal plug that we use in the United States.  Also...the strands do not connect to each other.  Poor.&lt;br /&gt;I would have assumed that something sold on Amazon would be listed in a way that people would get that.</li>
            <li> They twinkle and sparkle and everyone who visits my apartment loves them.</li>
            <li> Great colors. The flashing pattern is too fast for us though.</li>
            <li> So these were really cute when I first put them up. Super blinky, lots of changing colors. Then the fun waned a lite but. Holy crap do these things never stop... I&#x27;m glad this was just around a room that we didn&#x27;t use super often. If they were on the tree I would have had to throw it out the window... I gave it four stars though because the kids loved them! They&#x27;ll probably bed to have them on the tree next year....</li>
            <li> Great little lights for what i will use them for. But i will they had a color controller or something like that.</li>
            <li> They looked great for 1 week.  Then all the bulbs dimmed  You can barely tell the are lighting up and flashing..  Will be returning.</li>
            <li> These lights were so awesome.  I gave a set to my brother&#x27;s family, and the kids fought&lt;br /&gt;over them.  They are really cheery, we had them in the fireplace for a while.  I would&lt;br /&gt;use them all year long.</li>
            <li> I like the lights.  There are three bulbs that have a dead green led (over two strings).  The three only shows as black 4 times each cycle of the display.  The cycle seems to go like this 1 slow gycle of the 3 leds showing the red and blue with a bit of green mixed in but never pure green 2 A fast gycle through red blue and green four times.  3 A mixture of colors producing yellow cyana and light blue again repeated 4 times.  A great light show. Good for Christmas or parties. I would not recommend for general lighting.</li>
            <li> These are sooo pretty! I ordered them to use in a trade show booth. I would recommend them for sure but buyer beware... They are very delicate. The materials are really weak and the strands break easily. That said, enjoy!</li>
            <li> Most lights like this have an outlet on the back of the plug, this does not, but it does have a connector, an outlet at the end of it. They change colors individually in a pattern with multiple light changing speeds. They seem cheaply/simply made, but they work.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Many comments from neighbors of how great the affect was.  We will be ordering again for next Xmas.</li>
            <li> was awesome...my house was the brightest of them all on my block!!!!!</li>
            <li> very bright and colorful&lt;br /&gt;but the plastic part is somewhat cheap looking.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s def a buy! but it&#x27;s def not the best LED lights</li>
            <li> Yeah right, there is not that much red or pink in there.....small balls and no setting....it has only a flash setting that makes me nervous!</li>
            <li> These were great on our tree this year.  Thrilled with the effect these present.</li>
            <li> Very happy with delivery, price and product. These lights are actually smaller than they appear on-line, but they are beautiful and have a soft glow. Would be nice to be able to set the flash frequency. Every third or fourth bulb flashes at varying frequencies which is very festive, but I would like to also enjoy them when they&#x27;re not flashing. Not enough to be dissatisfied my purchase, though.</li>
            <li> Oh wow, are these ever cute. You can use them for anything. Terrific colors and nice shape.</li>
            <li> The lights are such a rich saturated color. They each flash multiple colors.  Got this to hang in my daughters dorm room. She and her room mate really like them</li>
            <li> While very pretty, the wire snapped as soon as I hung them up on my RV awning, so I never got to enjoy them.</li>
            <li> Great, colorful lights! Love them and recommend them highly!</li>
            <li> These were much smaller than I anticipated.  They look more like the size of marbles than lights.  And for the price, I was expecting more.  Maybe good to decorate a dollhouse at Christmas..</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they&#x27;d transition between colors smoothly, but they blink rapidly like a strobe light. The kids like them, but I can&#x27;t handle them.</li>
            <li> Cooler than I ever could have imagined. Vibrant and colorful. They looked cool in the photos but SERIOUSLY the coolest lights I have ever purchased. Not sure how 50 LED color changing lights can be totally mesmerizing, but they are. A sincere apology to all of those people who went on and on about these lights and how cool they are.......I thought you were a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. I get it now.</li>
            <li> If you could control these lights with a switch, i&#x27;d give them 5 stars. These lights look like new age christmas lights, but better! The color changing is really nice and i&#x27;d buy 5 more if I needed them.</li>
            <li> Great product - exceeded my expectation. Each light is an individual color changing LED, which individually cycles between a fast and slow color changing mode - it is color chaos at its best! The product arrived quickly and was in perfect condition. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous &amp; gentle colorful changing lights. We use them all year round.</li>
            <li> Nice light.  I wanted these for yard decoration, not holiday however.  These are perfect.  They give off a nice light.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> beautiful !!! My girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> There great lights...</li>
            <li> I would absolutely love these lights... if they didn&#x27;t blink. I wanted colors that faded into each other, not faded and blinked. I bought these to decorate my wedding, but I&#x27;m afraid I might induce half of my guests in to seizures with the constantly blinking lights.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not exactly sure if I&#x27;ll be able to use these as I had intended.</li>
            <li> Cheap.  Broke.&lt;br /&gt;Not suitable for outdoor use.</li>
            <li> These lights are incredibly well made and will definitely stand to the test of time. Unfortunately the colors change waaay too quickly. I bought them to decorate my dorm room because I thought that the soft changing colors would look cool, but they make me feel like I&#x27;m about to host a rave. They&#x27;re nice, but I&#x27;d only buy them for parties or Christmas.</li>
            <li> Blinking is quite fast to the point of being annoyingly distractive.</li>
            <li> many lights were burned out or blinked erratically</li>
            <li> Came very quickly and was packaged nicely! Wish there was a way to change the pattern but it doesn&#x27;t come with that ability. Either way the colors are very vibrant!</li>
            <li> Not linkable like it claims. There was so much excess glue all over these lights I wondered if they would burst into flames when I plugged them in. When I plugged them in for one brief second they were the coolest lights Iv&#x27;e ever seen, then they blinked and changed colors so violently with no option to stop the seizure inducing flashing I had to throw them right into the trash.</li>
            <li> I wish I could manage the stations some times they get to fast, but in general it works perfect it&#x27;s all they say, amazing bright colors.</li>
            <li> Really nice - we put the lights inside a large terra-cotta turtle and the colorful glow at night is a nice way to accent a dark porch.</li>
            <li> The lights I received have no options to change the way the lights change/blink, and they blink and change really fast. It&#x27;s very busy and distracting for indoor use. Returning immediately.</li>
            <li> We thought these bulbs might change a bit ....slower? Hey, if you like busy (psychedelic twinkling) lights, these are for you!</li>
            <li> A generous number of really fun lights for the price</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good, the lights are bright and good pattern. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> These work just great, but the colors appear more subdued in the picture than on the actual strand.  The colors are not pastel, they are primary.  Not a huge deal for my use, just an observation.</li>
            <li> These were really great lights for and occasion .</li>
            <li> These colorful and active lights worked great right out of the box. Each little globe changes colors with each pulsation. It is an ever changing display of colorful lights. Technology has come a long way. Now all I want is electronic versions of the old Christmas bubble lights. They were always so relaxing to watch.</li>
            <li> These lights look great. They either blink or slowly shift between colors randomly. There is no control of how the lights blink, I do wish there was a on/off switch.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re beautiful! I love that the bulbs are round and perfect size, also great colors.</li>
            <li> The color change on these lights is way too rapid for my taste.  I agree with the reviewer who likened them to something one might put on while listening to techno music.  If you are looking to add a touch of relaxing color to a room or porch (like myself) these are probably not the lights for you. I am going to research and see if I can rig the lights to not blink so quickly or not blink at all. The colors are very pretty and the construction of the product is sturdy, however, the blinking is, in my opinion, mind numbing.</li>
            <li> This line of LED coloring changing lights is amazing. The colors are really nice and it is fascinating to see the balls continue changing colors.</li>
            <li> This is a great light set.  It took quite a while to arrive - but just about anything that&#x27;s being shipped directly from China takes a bit of time.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you can&#x27;t control the speed or anything really...they have two modes: on and off. The description says &amp;#34;Slow and fade color changing on each led&amp;#34; - honestly I have no idea what that means (I&#x27;m assuming there was a language issue involved with whoever wrote that sentence) - but the word slow led me to believe that indicated the speed of something...and unfortunately nothing about these is slow.  The speed of the color changing is very fast - much faster than I&#x27;d prefer (it seems like they&#x27;d go well with techno music - nothing against techno music - but I usually prefer a more mellow pace).  But ultimately, the price is pretty much unbeatable...and my son thinks they&#x27;re pretty neat (he&#x27;s 3 - so a he thinks that of a lot of things).  I like the frosted bulb look they have &amp; they are pretty much exactly as shown in the image.</li>
            <li> works great, pretty colors</li>
            <li> super annoying, but my kids love them!</li>
            <li> Some of the lights do not change color and stayed red at all times. There was one that did not lit at all.</li>
            <li> these are pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> colors not as pictured. Only red, blue, and green. It&#x27;s okay but not what I wanted</li>
            <li> These lights just add the &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; to your christmas tree</li>
            <li> Bright and colorful LED color changing light string added to my Christmas decoration.  Liked it so  much, went back and order 3 more strings.</li>
            <li> They function, but not as pictured: beware! They only display rgb, not any yellow or purple, like in the picture. Also, there is no way to make them stop twinkling.</li>
            <li> I love these lights!! There are so many colors, the colors are bright and fun (not as pastel as pictured), and they blink and alternate colors. The strand is very long which is nice, twice as long as our other light strands for half the price and very high quality to boot. These are now our favorite lights in our holiday decoration collection!</li>
            <li> They came broken. They are like an old phone charger where you have to hold it a certian way or it won&#x27;t work. Boo</li>
            <li> It is beautiful, but kind of advertisement misleading, stating as for indoor and outdoor use.&lt;br /&gt;Who can use it outdoor if it cannot stand for dampness or raining environment?</li>
            <li> These are *beautiful* lights.  They&#x27;re bright and the color changing makes my Christmas tree (yes, sorry, I&#x27;ve got it up already) come alive.  Stunning colors and wonderfully cheerful!</li>
            <li> They took so long to come, I wanted to return them. But they are so cute. and when I put them in the window, they were perfect.</li>
            <li> These appear to be incredibly cheaply produced, no function to keep them from constantly blinking. Spend a few extra bucks and get something a bit more substantial.</li>
            <li> Fun lights but the plug for the wall falls out of the outlet very easily.  *Edited review. I am changing my review from a 1 star to 2 star review for the customer service.</li>
            <li> Beautiful LED light...love it!</li>
            <li> only one setting, no on/off switch.</li>
            <li> My dughter loves these in her room and I like it always being christmas/disco in there.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality! These lights last for hundreds of hours at least! Love the beautiful colors!</li>
            <li> Most AWESOME lights ever!!! I love how they are fast and then slow. and EVERYone at my party wanted to buy some!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice set of low energy LED Christmas lights. Comes with it&#x27;s own built in controller and has various settings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful of the strong chemical smell that comes from the lights and the packaging. Allow time for it to air out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  a good price for an energy efficient  alternative!</li>
            <li> After my initial purchase of 3 of these two years ago, only one remains working. I live in an area that gets winter weather, I don&#x27;t believe they are made to be used outdoors in wet weather. Upon inspection after failure of the lights I found that moisture had gotten into the small black box at the end of the light string and shorted out the tiny circuit board inside. The little black box is not sealed in any way against weather or wetness.</li>
            <li> Great lights. Unique light show and color. My only issue was the length of time in shipping. Didn&#x27;t realize they were shipped from China</li>
            <li> The lights are really very pretty, but they are only blue, green and red (red to blue, and red to green), not all the colors in picture (no yellow). They do not seem very good quality - I will not leave them on when I go out. Multifunction seems to be the brand name, not the description of the lights. They do not have multiple functions/modes, they have only one option which is to constantly twinkle.</li>
            <li> there is no way to control the fast change of color. bulbs change between red and green and some bulbs have a non functioning alt LED so they turn red or green and off. I ordered three strands; one strange is half red and green and the other is purple and red.&lt;br /&gt;either way these are not as advertised.</li>
            <li> The product that I received does NOT look like the picture at all...this picture provides a false representation of the product and I am more disappointed than a child who was just told Santa isn&#x27;t real. In the picture, I see a myriad of lights that are all SOLID. My strand of lights are blinking (seriously, there should be a warning for people who are prone to epileptic seizures). I brought these lights into my office to enhance the spirit of the holidays and instead I was ridiculed and the word &amp;#34;ratchet&amp;#34; was used on multiple occasions to describe my attempt promoting some festive cheer.  There are only three colors- Red, Blue, and Green. Where is the yellow? Have you people never heard of the Color Wheel? Issac Newton invented that.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting lighting string.  The balls are slightly larger than a gumball and the LED is inside.  The primary color is Blue with flashes of red, yellow, green.  I actually enjoy them and use them for low lighting effects where we watch tv and entertain.  If these are the colors you want to see, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised at how great these lights look on our tree! After this Xmas I&#x27;m giving away my old standard led&#x27;s and buying more of these to decorate the tree and the house!</li>
            <li> I bought these last year. I put them out on our hand rail again this year. They slowly change colors. beautiful!</li>
            <li> This wonderful string of quality well made components is well worth having. It is such a refreshing change from the pointed led lamps we usually have. Get two, or more, and they go end to end. I&#x27;m using mine for trim this year but I want to use them on my Christmas tree next year. Just delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve</li>
            <li> I bought a string of similar lights through amazon two years ago, and have had trouble finding more.  This is exactly what I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wires of the lights are black.  Each light globe has a color changing RGB LED in it.  Each light goes through a repeating cycle of first slowly fading between several colors, and then rapid fading between several colors.  The lights are not synchronized, so at any given time, some lights are in the rapid color changing mode, and some are in the slowly color changing mode.  If the lights are kept in a bundle, it provides a very trippy/raver light show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve only had the lights for an hour, I can&#x27;t yet make any statement about how durable they are.  Superficially, the light string looks well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want only slow color fades, Amazon has another string of lights which does that, and it generally looks very similar except the wires are green instead of black:  [[ASIN:B005JSAG98 B005JSAG98]]</li>
            <li> I like this product because of its size and changing color led bulbs . A little bit pricy but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> Very good.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very pretty bright and eye catching. We really like them</li>
            <li> These are very cool! What a great price! Kind of strange, they flash all different speeds and so on but that&#x27;s fun. One of my kids wants a set just for her room.</li>
            <li> These are colorful and balls which have a matte finish. So, they don&#x27;t look weirdly colorful and garish. They have a nice feel about the glow.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I might change was to have a control to regulate the speed of color changing.</li>
            <li> not only did these lights burn out a week after i put them up, they shorted out the rest of the lights i plugged into them.  i figured that out by plugging new lights into them, and watching the new lights immediately short out.  this purchase actually burned $100 of other lights i bought this season.  i&#x27;m effing pissed and never buying anything else from these crooks.  nobody else should either.</li>
            <li> looks nice, but one of them worked only for 2 days, have to return it and reorder one, not sure how long it keep working. I will be happy if it still works next year.</li>
            <li> love these lights and so does everyone who has seen them...colors are soft and gorgeous...would like more of them so hope I will be able to find them again</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, I had to return it. Changing lights were fine on slow fade, frenetically fast otherwise and not relaxing.</li>
            <li> Great light set, bright and colorful</li>
            <li> the charger is not designed for US users.</li>
            <li> They were taken out of their box and the wire was split and were dead on arrival. I had already thrown the package away, when I packed them in the RV. They were for an awning. However, only one of the two boxes worked when I received them.</li>
            <li> Excellent as a mood setter, or as a holiday tribute.</li>
            <li> While my girlfriend really likes these I have to take a star for a horrible product description. They are not what I thought they were, there really should be a video of these lights in action, they don&#x27;t simply change colors they totally flash. These were bought for under a canopy for a 4th of July party, these were kind of nice to watch when sitting and provided just enough light to see who was sitting on the other side of the canopy without being blinding.</li>
            <li> These lights work as expected.  We used them indoors &amp; outdoors and they worked well for our needs.  They do change colors rather quickly so they may not be good for a tree unless you like a strobing tree, but your guests won&#x27;t.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> great lights, just add a controller for the blink speed.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what we wanted. they are colorful, bright, and the different settings allow for different levels of display. they are energy efficient and do not get hot, so they are not a fire hazard. I bought some for family after we liked them so much!</li>
            <li> These soft multi color changing light bulbs look beautiful on my x-mas tree. My family and friends came over for Christmas dinner and they all love how it looks and the way the colors changing so soft and slowly faded out. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it... I recommend it. Will buy it again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but no controls for the erratic/spastic blinking pattern... I don&#x27;t  my use them but saving for an occasion when obnoxious blinking lights would be appropriate.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the lights to be so small, there was nothing in the picture to provide perspective and I don&#x27;t recall the size being mentioned in the description.  I was expecting brighter more dramatic lights and not small low key lights.  Also they use more power than an equivalent string of LED lights. This meant that I wasn&#x27;t able to use them on my boat as I had planned.  All in all for my purposes, they are a failure.</li>
            <li> I saw similar lights at someone&#x27;s home and thought these were the same.  The cord is black which makes it difficult to use at Christmas.  I didn&#x27;t bother to return because I figured it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble.  The other lights were absolutely beautiful with a green cord.  The colors of the lights were amazing on the OTHER brand, they started all one color and slowly began to change, some bulbs changing slightly faster  than others until it was a lovely artful blend.  These just changed rapidly.  If you want rapidly changing multi-colored bulbs on a black cord you will like these. I did not.  They were too much like any other multi-colored lights that change colors rapidly that you can buy at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what it describes, very satisfied with it, only thing is I wished I could make it not blink</li>
            <li> So many things wrong with this item, We are looking for some LED lights like this to redo the outside of the restaurant I work ar, so we will need a few hundred feet. I decided to order one of these and see how they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed was that the one I was sent WASNT EVEN AN AMERICAN PLUG. It had a freaking European plug on it. Not a deal breaker since I had an adapter. Then I noticed that it also wasnt LINKABLE like it says in the description (Imagine how many adapters you would need if it was though). You can plug in ONE strand into an outlet. That is it, no where to plug another strand in on the other end of the lights. And there is also no way to change the mode. Theres a little box on the end, but no buttons or anything to use. Just a little boxx thats glued shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then as far as the lights themselves. Not very bright at all, and the random pattern that they change is from color to color with just looks terrible, and about a fourth of the lights will flicker most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, do not buy, terrible product, etc, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side we just ended up wrapping them around a column for decoration they havent broken yet. Thats really about the only good thing I can say about them.</li>

            <li> Just as they appeared</li>
            <li> The string is exceptionally fragile.  If you tug with the slightest force on the string, it comes apart.  It was one use, and into the trash for me.  It wasn&#x27;t enable to survive taking it back down.</li>
            <li> Pretty good lights, especially for the price. They do change colors a little fast, and would be better if they came with different light changing settings.</li>
            <li> Cheap slow delivery and not what was described by the seller. I was hoping for a slow fade set but these have strobe type blinking. I will not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> These are very cool and colorful, the only nit I&#x27;d pick is that they don&#x27;t do anything in concert. Each bulb is its own entity and on it&#x27;s own pattern so there&#x27;s never any interesting multi-bulb/system pattern that could otherwise emerge as a result of these lights working in concert (at least optionally).</li>
            <li> Super bright at not too big or small. Just wish the lights could be controlled. Other than that shipped fast and great light for any type of decor!</li>
            <li> They are very pretty but one of the wires came exposed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> great,bought 2 of these,very please,bright changing colors,box was a bit smashed,but you cant control the postal service,anyway the content was intact,so 2 thmbs up</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AWFUL! I&#x27;ve never written a product review.....but THESE ARE CRAP! They ARE EXTREMELY FAST BLINKING....NO SLOW FADE like they describe. PLUS I laid one light strand across living room floor to watch the color change. When I picked them up to put them outdoors...I noticed ...that every third light was out.....after bringing them back indoors I realized that some of the wire had come completely undone on at least three lights. I have a career background in electrical...and these lights are JUNK. This is the first product review I&#x27;ve ever written in the almost 70 amazon orders I have placed this year. That should tell you all you need to know</li>
            <li> These lights not only sparked and melted through the wire within within 2 hours of use - when they did, I found there were multiple places where bare wires were soldered and left uninsulated to form the strand.  Not even covered with electrical tape.  After looking at the strands I bought in retrospect, I&#x27;m very surprised they didn&#x27;t cause a fire.  I&#x27;m also fairly confident they would have sparked and melted through the other soldered places if I didn&#x27;t discover the workmanship after the first string burned out.  I&#x27;m amazed at the number of positive reviews on these and I&#x27;ve honestly never bought and received something with this kind of electrical hazard in my entire life.  Maybe I just had bad luck with a few strands that were early engineering prototypes, but even in a shop they would have been dangerous.</li>
            <li> They blink very fast and the only colors that are on the strand are red and blue. I wish they could be used outside. They look nice, though.</li>
            <li> very nice colors and fun, but poor quality,one already died after a week so I am expecting the other 3 to do the same. I like to give zero star on that product.</li>
            <li> very colorful light with great lighting effects. My wife loves them,</li>
            <li> I bought three strings of lights and two stopped working within a week.</li>
            <li> I love these lights! They are my favorite of all my Christmas lights. The colors are Candyland colors, the the lights twinkle off and on in a soft and natural way, like twinkling stars. The lights are big enough to actually create a little bit of light in a room, which I love.</li>
            <li> Used them for Christmas and they were unique and attractive.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 strings of these and liked them so much I bought 4 more.  They change color and blink.</li>
            <li> these  are cool ! they have a totally random blink and color change, each light does its own thing, 2 blinking speeds and color change , they are like no other light i have ever seen, i bought a set for my mom and 3 sets for me, they are cool</li>
            <li> These things are sweet.</li>
            <li> These bulbs do color-change softly, but they are very poorly constructed. The superglue holding them together is very evident in several places and they&#x27;re just generally not as expected.</li>
            <li> another nice piece - Teens love</li>
