            <li> Gets everything off. Even 2 day old waterproof mascara I was too lazy to take off:) worked better than any I tried</li>
            <li> Only thing i will use to remove eyemakeup.  Just Love this!!! and it last for more than six months</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  i have been using it for several years.  Cleans off make-up and leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  After use my face feels exceptionally clean and all make-up is removed.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no where near the shu uemura ones. However, it is the best quality if you take shu uemura out of the equation, in comparison to other oil cleanser.</li>
            <li> It did well cleaning my face just disappointed I could not use it to remove my eye makeup too.  It irritated my eyes.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again because I&#x27;m washing my face after using this so I&#x27;m paying for two cleaning products.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin clean and soft.  Unscented.  It&#x27;s pricey but lasts several months.  One squirt a day is sufficient to cleanse my face.  It feels so good to rub on my face after a day of drying makeup, especially around my eyes.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my skin soo smooth and I love cleaning my makeup brushes with it and it has lasts me soo long especially with my once a week brush cleaning and 4 day a week face cleaning. I love this stuff soo much!</li>
            <li> Great skin care product!</li>
            <li> Great cleansing oil. This is my second time using the oil, I rub the oil on a dry face, eyelashes and lids. Once I feel that all the make up has been dissolved I wash my face with lukewarm water.&lt;br /&gt;I tried removing regular and waterproof, it definitely works with both but with waterproof mascara you&#x27;re going to have to be patient and work around the eye a little bit more. Also once you wash your face there is no oily residue left/which is awesome!!This product is working really well for me so far. The only problems I have with the product is that&lt;br /&gt;1. I don&#x27;t feel that my face feels any moisturized after using the oil(it feels drier, comparing to other cleanser I use on a regular basis &amp; I have combo skin type)&lt;br /&gt;2. it&#x27;s a bit pricy</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!  It&#x27;s a thorough yet gentle cleanser you can use everyday.  I have dry sensitive skin and this cleansing oil is a godsend!  I mistakenly ordered two and the seller was very understanding and prompt in accepting the return and issuing a refund.  Would definitely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels never dry.. cleans and make my face feel soft.great buy. Works great. Using it for years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years because there&#x27;s no other that even comes close to it&#x27;s performance. It was nice to find it for a little less on this site than the price I would&#x27;ve paid on DHC official site. It got to my house QUICKLY and exactly as expected. This is a product worth buying!</li>
            <li> I had a cystic pimple that had not come to a head, and washed my face with this. I washed my face with another cleanser afterwards as suggested when I read the reviews. The next morning the pimple was died up and scabbed over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil as my makeup remover for several years, and I go out of my way to purchase it. It dissolves even water-resistant eye makeup easily, and rinses off nicely. It does not irritate my skin and leaves it feeling soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really remove my eyelash glue and mascara well. Still searching for my perfect remover that can easily cleans my face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; actually makes my face cleaner and does NOT make it oily.  I love this product!  It&#x27;s perfect for me because I really hate washing my face before bed, so with this product I can rub it on (dry face) and then with a wash cloth remove it and it also takes off every bit of make-up I have on.</li>
            <li> I bought this before I was even a fan of the idea of cleansing with a oil type product, I bought it on a whim, but since then, I have become a fan! Its leaves my skin very clean, soft, and no drying effect on my face. Make sure to massage it into your skin for a few minutes, just relax and know you are doing a service to your face and know that it will be a healthy clean when your done. I have been buying this product well for over a year now and will always have it on hand.  Try it just once, and I think you&#x27;ll be hooked too.</li>
            <li> too greasy for my taste...</li>
            <li> It broke up my skin every time after I used it, it just not right for me because it&#x27;s too oily, I will never buy this again !</li>
            <li> Amazing product! It has totally changed the health of my skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> I will never be without this.  I have used it for 13 years. I even tried another brand to see if it worked the same and it definitely didn&#x27;t.  This takes EVERYTHING off and is very water soluble when you rinse it off, the other one I tried (too save a few bucks) left an oily residue and hence some trapped dirt behind.  I even use it in the morning rather than soap, just because it seems so much gentler and non-drying.  It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Interestingly it dried my face out. Love the idea though. Wish it would have worked better.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  The oil sinks in and is a great cleanser without leaving you oily.  Great to wash your face with at night.</li>
