    <ol>
            <li>I especially liked the soufflé consistency.  </li>
            <li>and this was a pleasant surprise!  </li>
            <li>This is a great hair care product too.</li>
            <li>On sale for $3, which is a great deal for the quality.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>But loving d herbal comb!</li>
            <li>In addition, it smells really good.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE AND GLAD TO FIND IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li>I love this mousse!</li>
            <li>The product worked great on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Light and nice!</li>
            <li>Pin up, sexy, voluminous hair... come and get it...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price :)</li>
            <li>I do feel like I need to use a clarifying shampoo more often with usage of this product though which is why I took off a star.</li>
            <li>Tried so many brands of mousse over the years</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and clean without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It made it easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m always on the lookout for hair products that will add volume &amp; body to my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>but if you need just a balance hold and still can run your fingers smoothly through,this is it.  </li>
            <li>I have a faux-hawk and it is strong enough to keep hairs standing, yet amazingly soft-not crunchy.  </li>
            <li>Tried this mousse-like souffle product and it was exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  </li>
            <li>Herbal Essences Naked Volumizing Souffle has been working nicely for me.</li>
            <li>It works best when I put it in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>In fact, my hair feels softer and looks shinier after using it than before which is a first for any type of mousse that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m satisfied &amp; plan on purchasing Herbal Essences Naked Volumizing Souffle again.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very silky.</li>
            <li>Well, the perm didn&#x27;t add much body, but when I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Also it smells really good like the other products in naked volume line</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, fast shipping, A++</li>
            <li>Easy to work through wet hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Herbal Essences is known for their decent shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for anyone with fine, thin hair or anyone wanting more volume in their style.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, not strong and my hair still feels soft, not sticky dry and crispy.  </li>
            <li>I had another baby recently and the hormonal changes really do a number on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It does the trick very well, and doesn&#x27;t make your hair too dry or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a product that adds volume &amp; body to my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>It is less expensive than my salon by far and gives nice volume.</li>

            <li> Unlike other mousse, HE Naked souffle doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel like it&#x27;s going to break or feel like a coating of chemicals!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft that until it gets a little dirty it won&#x27;t hold a curl &amp; even then it goes limp quickly.</li>

            <li> It took me a while to figure out what to actually do with this product. It works best when I put it in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Pin up, sexy, voluminous hair... come and get it...</li>
            <li> Light and nice! Can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price :)</li>
            <li> Leave my hair sticky on the day after! But loving d herbal comb!</li>
            <li> holds hair up enough all day (air drying, no heat) and doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s anything there ! Also it smells really good like the other products in naked volume line</li>
            <li> Very nice. Leaves hair very silky.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, fast shipping, A++</li>

            <li> GREAT PRICE AND GLAD TO FIND IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences has a winner in this volumizing souffle.  It gives my hair volume without making it feel dry or stiff.  In fact, my hair feels softer and looks shinier after using it than before which is a first for any type of mousse that I&#x27;ve used.  The smell is nice and clean without being overpowering.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for anyone with fine, thin hair or anyone wanting more volume in their style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a product that adds volume &amp; body to my baby fine hair. My hair is so soft that until it gets a little dirty it won&#x27;t hold a curl &amp; even then it goes limp quickly. Herbal Essences Naked Volumizing Souffle has been working nicely for me. It adds  some oompf to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always on the lookout for hair products that will add volume &amp; body to my baby fine hair. I recently had my hair permed in hopes adding some body. Well, the perm didn&#x27;t add much body, but when I use [[ASIN:B00FXOPOTK Herbal Essences Naked Volumizing Souffle]] along with  [[ASIN:B002RS6L10 Paul Mitchell Round Trip Curl Definer]], my hair has some body &amp; volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I&#x27;m satisfied &amp; plan on purchasing Herbal Essences Naked Volumizing Souffle again.</li>
            <li> Wife swears by this mousse type volumizing product.  It does the trick very well, and doesn&#x27;t make your hair too dry or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbal Essences is known for their decent shampoos.  This is a great hair care product too.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair out a bit but it does volumize well.</li>
            <li> This volumizing souffle has made my very thin hair have more body.  I had another baby recently and the hormonal changes really do a number on my hair.  My hair has fallen out a lot and I take my prenatal vitamins regularly.  I do feel like I need to use a clarifying shampoo more often with usage of this product though which is why I took off a star.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently and like it a lot. It is less expensive than my salon by far and gives nice volume.</li>
            <li> The product worked great on my fine hair. I especially liked the soufflé consistency.  It made it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Definitely adds volume but does make my hair feel very dry.</li>
            <li> Tried this mousse-like souffle product and it was exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  I did not want a mousse that made my hair dry and stiff!  Since I could not find L&#x27;oreal Studio Line Silk and Gloss,  I picked this.  Nice smell, not strong and my hair still feels soft, not sticky dry and crispy.  If you want extreme hold, this won&#x27;t cut it...but if you need just a balance hold and still can run your fingers smoothly through,this is it.  Easy to work through wet hair.  I have a faux-hawk and it is strong enough to keep hairs standing, yet amazingly soft-not crunchy.  i think I will be using this from now on.  Tried so many brands of mousse over the years and this was a pleasant surprise!  On sale for $3, which is a great deal for the quality.  Unlike other mousse, HE Naked souffle doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel like it&#x27;s going to break or feel like a coating of chemicals!</li>
