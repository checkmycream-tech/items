            <li>Great scent.  </li>
            <li>I bought the cedar one, and even the box smelled great when I opened it up.</li>
            <li>it smells very nice, woodsy.  </li>
            <li>The folks at ManCave have something good going here.</li>
            <li>Good for something like a stocking stuffer or for a guy&#x27;s 1st apartment...</li>
            <li>I looked all over for a man&#x27;s product that offered all the good stuff women are accustomed to.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Wife is happy with the way I smell every morning :)</li>
            <li>The scent, which isn&#x27;t pleasant nor foul is very strong.</li>
            <li>This shower gel has a great smell and leaves me feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>omigod, it smells amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells and feels refreshing after a good gym workout.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a shower gel with a woodsy scent that I liked for a while now.</li>
            <li>I really liked this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and the ingredients are top notch.  </li>
            <li>Do your own research.  </li>
            <li>The feel is nice.</li>
            <li>probably my most favorite shower gel ever!  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing, feels nice on skin, but runs very quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, relatively strong scent</li>
            <li>so you may love it</li>
            <li>And then ON TOP OF THAT:</li>
            <li>Much better than the Every Man wash.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>(this smells more woody than the face wash)    </li>
            <li>Just a ok body wash for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it</li>
            <li>I was actually satisfied with the quality of the &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; soaps, but thought I would try something &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I detected no cedar scent, or anything appealing - much-less &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>so I felt like I was getting better value for my money.</li>
            <li>While it may not build up as many suds as a store bought alternative</li>
            <li>Since the press seemed positive, and &amp;#34;cedarwood&amp;#34; sounds kinda good -</li>
            <li>If they can make it a little bit better quality and have more of that incredible cedarwood fragrance</li>
            <li>suds up fine.</li>
            <li>Smells great but container is smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li>Smooth but not oily or sticky.  </li>
            <li>It smells OK but its a much sweeter, tea-like smell more than woodsy and is not to my liking.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I could wrestle a bear and use its hide as a blanket while making sweet sweet love to the woman of my dreams after showering with ManCave shower gel</li>
            <li>Once lathered in the shower, though, it has a very pleasant smell that is much different than my first whiff straight from the bottle (although it&#x27;s still not quite as I had imagined, which was a very strong cedar scent).</li>
            <li>but it does get you clean.</li>
            <li>The best part about it is that it keeps your wife off your back about your \\&quot;old man\\</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it faded quickly after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gel not only smells good but has a great lather which goes a long way.</li>
            <li>For that reason I save it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I know everything causes cancer these days but why not get a product that doesn&#x27;t if its around the same price and is actually good for you.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Awesomely fresh and leaves me feeling super clean without that chemical filmy feeling.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to use too much</li>
            <li>Well, this smells almost exactly like the &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; scent!  </li>
            <li>I am not anxious to pay more either, just to assure that it is not being done.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice, but does not have a strong cedarwood scent like I expected.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, and the old lady seems to like it as well.</li>
            <li>name!&lt;br /&gt;It is a fun gift, though.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, parfum.</li>
            <li>It lathers really well and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li>The smell is good, but I was hoping for it to be a little stronger/manlier.</li>
            <li>I think overall the scent is OK.</li>
            <li>but in reality it&#x27;s pretty meh on every count.</li>
            <li>I took my first shower with it</li>
            <li>would definetly recommend this specific product, and look forward to trying more Man Cave products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this product over the generic products I&#x27;ve been picking up from Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>We love the smell of this, though it is a present for my husband.</li>
            <li>You might think when you receive it that it will be too much, but it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is as described, woodsy, clean, masculine.</li>
            <li>Better off buying all natural from LUSH.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s also due to the chemicals used in those products which this does not have (and better for it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a cool package-</li>
            <li>It must be me, because everyone is rating this high, but it smells like turpentine to me.</li>
            <li>While not as large as store bought alternatives, when used reasonably it will last</li>
            <li>There was concerns regarding the lather for this product based on other reviews, but if you&#x27;re using a loofa (as you would for any other body wash honestly), then this issue is really non existent.</li>
            <li>I recently bought the every man jack cedarwood shower gel also, and the mancave wins by far.</li>
            <li>It has a very soft smell.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty thin (as in more watery).</li>
            <li>, I like that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bonus, of course, it&#x27;s all natural, so you aren&#x27;t worried about the chemicals you put on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by the brand name and scent name, having been scouring Amazon for &#x27;manly&#x27; shower gel that was also vegan and free of a lot of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Axe, Old Spice, Dove, etc.</li>
            <li>I thought I would interrupt my typical shower soap routine and buy something special.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a subtle but incredible thick woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>new replacement for my old spice in a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>Ok guys - if your wife keeps buying you stuff you hate to use because it costs too much and you smell like a flower, you definitely should quit thinking about trying this and click &#x27;1-click purchase&#x27; right now!!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have an &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; cedar smell, rather it just smells fresh and SLIGHTLY woodsy.</li>
            <li>;  Strrrrraight B.S. I looked at the ingredients and nowhere to be found are there 12 oils, in fact, the only one I saw was Tea Tree oil, the rest was typical stuff you find in most shower gels, absolutely no mention of 12 oils.</li>
            <li>And definitely not a single hint of cedar to be found.</li>
            <li>When it first arrived, the scent out of the bottle was a little disconcertingâ€“it didn&#x27;t smell as I had imagined.</li>
            <li>I ran out of my first tube in less than three weeks!</li>
            <li>Not long lasting.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> as a minor detail, I persoanlly don&#x27;t care about animal testing.  </li>
            <li> (SLS) Dyes, chemicals that can lead to cancer, balding, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I wish they sold this in a larger size and a little cheaper</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what was expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I was beginning to think absolutely no one offered anything like this.</li>
            <li> I wish there was something I loved or hated about this shower gel</li>
            <li> Its fragrance (to me) is nearly offensive - and hard to describe - other than as I said &amp;#34;plastic-like&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, That usually means looking for something more expensive than I would normally use.  </li>
            <li> I want to try their other products.</li>
            <li> Shhitty, stinky cheap perfume that smells like some crap created in a Chinese lab and sold in bulk to a UK supplier.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find male toiletrie products made with your health in mind.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price though.</li>
            <li> I hate to throw away money, but I sure did on this.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up thick and rich - enough to get all the dirt off after a hard day&#x27;s work, cutting grass or just chasing the kids around.  </li>
            <li> my first use was horribly disappointing.  </li>
            <li> You know the little pine tree shaped air freshners?</li>
            <li> The gel is very thick and concentrated, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Gonna hit you guys with the straight facts on why I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I have to tell you that I like the shower gel just as well; if not better!</li>
            <li> I mean, &amp;#34;Man Cave&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> It is subtly woodsy.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very thick and doesn&#x27;t lather well</li>
            <li> (It lasts all day, I sometimes smell out randomly throughout the day).</li>

            <li> Smells and feels refreshing after a good gym workout.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, feels nice on skin, but runs very quickly. I ran out of my first tube in less than three weeks!</li>
            <li> great woody scent.  new replacement for my old spice in a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff.. so do I. It smells great and is not too overwhelming. This is our fourth order.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this. It has a very soft smell. I am definitely ordering this again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this shower gel hoping for a &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; scented gel for men.  The descriptions seem to be what I was looking for but the smell is not the spicy woodsy scent I was hoping for.  It smells OK but its a much sweeter, tea-like smell more than woodsy and is not to my liking.  I know scent is a totally personal matter so you may love it but it did not smell like I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Gonna hit you guys with the straight facts on why I was disappointed. They claim on the back of the bottle &amp;#34;uses 12 essential oils to cleanse and invigorate..&amp;#34;  Strrrrraight B.S. I looked at the ingredients and nowhere to be found are there 12 oils, in fact, the only one I saw was Tea Tree oil, the rest was typical stuff you find in most shower gels, absolutely no mention of 12 oils. And then ON TOP OF THAT: THERE&#x27;S ZERO FREAKIN&#x27; Cedar wood oil or anything related to Cedar. The smell comes from guess what......&amp;#34;Parfum&amp;#34;. That&#x27;s right, parfum. Shhitty, stinky cheap perfume that smells like some crap created in a Chinese lab and sold in bulk to a UK supplier. Bottom line: it isn&#x27;t what it claims to be and I won&#x27;t be buying from this company again, already regret ordering the face wash that is still on the way that I haven&#x27;t even tried. Buyers beware!</li>
            <li> it smells very nice, woodsy.  but it is not as fragrant as i like my soaps, which would stop me from buying it again.  too bad as i do like the scent.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice, but does not have a strong cedarwood scent like I expected.</li>
            <li> Not a prevalent cedar scent. Not long lasting. Maybe 4-6 hours while working. I think overall the scent is OK. Not worth the price though.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Every Man wash.</li>
            <li> Smells great but container is smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> It must be me, because everyone is rating this high, but it smells like turpentine to me. I suppose that&#x27;ll wake you up in the morning. And definitely not a single hint of cedar to be found.</li>
            <li> yay! omigod, it smells amazing, I got it for my boyfriend to use at my apartment and he loves it, I like that it&#x27;s natural and it smells soooo good!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as he loves the smell of cedar. Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long... Wasn&#x27;t what was expected for the price. Better off buying all natural from LUSH.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, relatively strong scent (It lasts all day, I sometimes smell out randomly throughout the day). The lather is short lived, but without the sls, i dont expect it to.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I will stick with Dial and Irish Spring.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and the old lady seems to like it as well.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very thick and doesn&#x27;t lather well so it&#x27;s easy to use too much but it does get you clean. The scent, which isn&#x27;t pleasant nor foul is very strong. I wish there was something I loved or hated about this shower gel but in reality it&#x27;s pretty meh on every count.</li>
            <li> This smells SOOOOOO good! I was looking for a body wash that contained tea tree oil, when I found this.  You know the little pine tree shaped air freshners? Well, this smells almost exactly like the &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; scent!  I took my first shower with it and I was amazed at the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus, of course, it&#x27;s all natural, so you aren&#x27;t worried about the chemicals you put on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definetly recommend this specific product, and look forward to trying more Man Cave products.</li>
            <li> This shower gel has a great smell and leaves me feeling very clean. I was intrigued by the brand name and scent name, having been scouring Amazon for &#x27;manly&#x27; shower gel that was also vegan and free of a lot of harsh chemicals. When it first arrived, the scent out of the bottle was a little disconcertingâ€“it didn&#x27;t smell as I had imagined. Once lathered in the shower, though, it has a very pleasant smell that is much different than my first whiff straight from the bottle (although it&#x27;s still not quite as I had imagined, which was a very strong cedar scent). I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this product over the generic products I&#x27;ve been picking up from Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I feel like I could wrestle a bear and use its hide as a blanket while making sweet sweet love to the woman of my dreams after showering with ManCave shower gel</li>
            <li> great stuff. the scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I recently bought the every man jack cedarwood shower gel also, and the mancave wins by far. It&#x27;s a subtle but incredible thick woodsy scent. I want to try their other products.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a shower gel with a woodsy scent that I liked for a while now. This gel not only smells good but has a great lather which goes a long way. This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. Doesn&#x27;t have an &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; cedar smell, rather it just smells fresh and SLIGHTLY woodsy. Leaves you feeling refreshed, and doesn&#x27;t leave residue. The gel is very thick and concentrated, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Ok guys - if your wife keeps buying you stuff you hate to use because it costs too much and you smell like a flower, you definitely should quit thinking about trying this and click &#x27;1-click purchase&#x27; right now!!  I recently bought (and reviewed) their face wash and I have to tell you that I like the shower gel just as well; if not better! (this smells more woody than the face wash)    This isn&#x27;t that chemically/flowery smell you get with generic or mainstream brands at Wal-Mart.  This stuff smells like Teak and Cedar.  It lathers up thick and rich - enough to get all the dirt off after a hard day&#x27;s work, cutting grass or just chasing the kids around.  The best part about it is that it keeps your wife off your back about your \\&quot;old man\\&quot; soap with Irish swirls in it...  LOL    The folks at ManCave have something good going here.</li>
            <li> did not like the fragrance...</li>
            <li> Wife is happy with the way I smell every morning :)</li>
            <li> Great product! The scent is great for either a man or woman. It is subtly woodsy. It lathers really well and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and clean. The scent lasts great. It&#x27;s the level of scent that only the person next to you can smell, like it should be. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> the smell could be different it smells like the caffeine shampoo. suds up fine. Just a ok body wash for me. I&#x27;m glad I tried it but I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I thought I would interrupt my typical shower soap routine and buy something special. I was actually satisfied with the quality of the &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; soaps, but thought I would try something &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34;.  Unfortunately, That usually means looking for something more expensive than I would normally use.  I landed on the &amp;#34;Man Cave&amp;#34; stuff, and read the reviews for it. Since the press seemed positive, and &amp;#34;cedarwood&amp;#34; sounds kinda good - I ordered some to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well my first use was horribly disappointing.  It actually smelled like some sort of artifical plastic.  It had no lather to speak of,  either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought, I must give it another chance - and perhaps I just needed to use &amp;#34;more&amp;#34; on my washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well no - that didn&#x27;t work either. Its fragrance (to me) is nearly offensive - and hard to describe - other than as I said &amp;#34;plastic-like&amp;#34;. Fortunately, it faded quickly after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems very expensive when you consider its 6+ oz. tube cost over $10. And since it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lather up&amp;#34; - as a soap probably should - it is not at all efficient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for me - it&#x27;s a lesson learned. I hate to throw away money, but I sure did on this.  I threw the MC tube and its un-used portion in the trash - and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn&#x27;t have to talk myself into liking a product, when my senses all tell me otherwise. I detected no cedar scent, or anything appealing - much-less &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a minor detail, I persoanlly don&#x27;t care about animal testing.  The process is not what I buy, but rather the product is.  I am not anxious to pay more either, just to assure that it is not being done. I feel like the regulation of that is left up to the conscience of the manufacturer or the control of the governing authority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for me - I am not a &amp;#34;Man Cave&amp;#34; fan. I won&#x27;t be trying their stuff out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I also ordered some &amp;#34;ole&#x27; reliable&amp;#34; along with this - to wash away the memory of that former experience.</li>
            <li> probably my most favorite shower gel ever!  Awesomely fresh and leaves me feeling super clean without that chemical filmy feeling.  Well done!</li>
            <li> I really liked this stuff.  The brand name is weird.  I wish they sold this in a larger size and a little cheaper so I felt like I was getting better value for my money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It smells good and the ingredients are top notch.  It is hard to find male toiletrie products made with your health in mind.  Axe, Old Spice, Dove, etc. All of those products sell well because of marketing.  But if you look at what is actually in those products, they should be banned.  Do your own research.  Sodium Laurel Sulfate, (SLS) Dyes, chemicals that can lead to cancer, balding, dry skin.  I know everything causes cancer these days but why not get a product that doesn&#x27;t if its around the same price and is actually good for you. I will never go back</li>
            <li> There was concerns regarding the lather for this product based on other reviews, but if you&#x27;re using a loofa (as you would for any other body wash honestly), then this issue is really non existent. While it may not build up as many suds as a store bought alternative, that&#x27;s also due to the chemicals used in those products which this does not have (and better for it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is as described, woodsy, clean, masculine. Not perfumey/flowery, so that&#x27;s a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have (which does not merit a loss of score as I knew before purchasing) is the tube size itself. While not as large as store bought alternatives, when used reasonably it will last fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and recommend to any.</li>
            <li> Just okay-ish. The smell is good, but I was hoping for it to be a little stronger/manlier. It&#x27;s such a cool package- I mean, &amp;#34;Man Cave&amp;#34;? How awesome is that for a man&#x27;s product?! But it&#x27;s pretty thin (as in more watery). I unfortunately won&#x27;t repurchase. If they can make it a little bit better quality and have more of that incredible cedarwood fragrance I&#x27;d buy bulk just for the look &amp; name!&lt;br /&gt;It is a fun gift, though. Good for something like a stocking stuffer or for a guy&#x27;s 1st apartment...</li>
            <li> Great scent.  Lathers and rinses off well.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and feel. It reminds me of the smell of a wood cabin in the winter, with a hint of cinnamon.  The feel is nice. Smooth but not oily or sticky.  The only drawback is the price. For that reason I save it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> We love the smell of this, though it is a present for my husband.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for a man&#x27;s product that offered all the good stuff women are accustomed to. I&#x27;d rather smell like a man and use a generic product if it comes to it, but now I don&#x27;t have to! I was beginning to think absolutely no one offered anything like this. Now we can scratch that. One company does; ManCave. If you&#x27;ve been looking all over like me you can end your search here.</li>
            <li> This shower gel smells wonderful! I bought the cedar one, and even the box smelled great when I opened it up. You might think when you receive it that it will be too much, but it&#x27;s not! I love it!</li>
