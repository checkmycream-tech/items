            <li>These are the best 3 blade shavers I have found!</li>
            <li>Impressed by the packaging, I bought these for 3.50 or something in a drugstore.</li>
            <li>For the price, they are great.</li>
            <li>I said great I will give them a try and the price is nice.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t cheap either!</li>
            <li>I think they would be better off listing these under some sort of weapons category since they seem more suited to grazing your skin than shaving your legs.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re anything BUT smooth!  </li>
            <li>I have never had a razor nick my underarm until this brand and the blade doesn&#x27;t provide a close or smooth shave!  </li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>Press the razor to your skin at the appropriate angle and it will pivot away from your skin.</li>
            <li>The handle feels flimsy compared to most because it is thinner</li>
            <li>You get a better shave with a plastic knife.</li>
            <li>More like is there even blades on this razor?</li>
            <li>Love these razors.</li>
            <li>I am not brand loyal, I do not care how many blades there are.</li>

            <li>Easy to rinse clean.  </li>
            <li>The handle on this razor is ridiculously cheap.</li>
            <li>Seeing as replacement blades these days seem to cost an arm, a leg, the deed to your home, and a lock of hair from your firstborn, we figured they&#x27;d be great until we could afford to drop some decent money on new blades for</li>
            <li>After having to spend several minutes too many shaving, I found my skin was now kind of...yucky.</li>

            <li>These are my absolute favorite disposable razors.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave not so much at all.</li>
            <li>well worth the &amp;#60;</li>

            <li>There is nothing \\&quot;super smooth\\&quot; about these blades, they leave your underarm skin pretty rough; I won&#x27;t even bother trying them on my legs.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are the best 3 blade shavers I have found!</li>
            <li> These razors are horrible! They feel like they are pulling the hairs out one by one and you have to make several passes to get all of the hair. They weren&#x27;t cheap either! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Bought some of these in my local Rite Aid since they were on sale and I&#x27;ve been looking for a new brand.  All I can say is WOW.  I think they would be better off listing these under some sort of weapons category since they seem more suited to grazing your skin than shaving your legs.  I&#x27;ve used cheap nasty razors that gave a smoother shave than these -- and the name is a farce they&#x27;re anything BUT smooth!  You will get sore, bumpy rashes if you use these razors and I just WISH I&#x27;d have checked reviews here before buying them.  It&#x27;s like the company put all of their efforts into making them this bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself and your loved ones (and any other poor sucker) a favor, tell them to boycott this awful product.  How any store can comfortably sell these to their customers I will NEVER know.  Hopefully no young girl tries these for her first time shaving, I shudder to think!  I think I&#x27;ll stick to Venus and Intuition to be honest, or perhaps the men&#x27;s Fusion since men&#x27;s razors are usually better quality or at least I always find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously.  All of this company&#x27;s products, especially razors, ought to be reported and investigated.  Dangerous!</li>
            <li> We found these for a steal at our local Rite Aide; an eight pack for $4.98. Seeing as replacement blades these days seem to cost an arm, a leg, the deed to your home, and a lock of hair from your firstborn, we figured they&#x27;d be great until we could afford to drop some decent money on new blades for our Gillettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, what a waste of money! When I first got one out of the package I could not get the protective plastic off the blade. Figuring it would be easier to just snap the head off, remove the plastic by some other means, and snap it back into place, I did just that. After wrestling to get the protective bit off, the small plastic nubs that snap the blade in place broke when I tried to put it back on. So there went a completely unused razor into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grabbed another (thankfully, no problem getting the plastic off this time) and attempted to shave my underarms. I am spoiled by my Gillette. Three swipes of the blade and I&#x27;m all clear. I had to run this over the same spot over and over and over again, and it still barely did any damage. After having to spend several minutes too many shaving, I found my skin was now kind of...yucky. There is nothing \\&quot;super smooth\\&quot; about these blades, they leave your underarm skin pretty rough; I won&#x27;t even bother trying them on my legs. Being a Noxzema product (I am a frequent and devoted user of their products) I thought the moisture strip would at least leave me feeling as silky and smooth as their face products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even bother with these. I have half a mind to throw the remaining six in the trash.</li>
            <li> They are of decent quality for the price.  We use them all the time.</li>
            <li> My hair is not coarse, but it took at least 5 swipes over the same areas to shave MOST of the hair off.  It did not even get all of it.  I can still see them.  On my legs, my armpits, and my bikini area.  These razors are terrible.  I am going back to Venus right away.</li>
            <li> Impressed by the packaging, I bought these for 3.50 or something in a drugstore. I didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be so flimsy and light upon opening the package, it was flimsier than those regular Gillette disposables. It didn&#x27;t seem to work too, I tried to cut a string with it and it didnt work!!! Unbelievable. I usually cut strings/brand tags from my new clothes with a shaver if I cant find a scissor and it usually works...why doesn&#x27;t it work with this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> First and last time using this razor!!!!!  The quality or manner in which the blade is manufactured has left me nicked and cut up!  I have never had a razor nick my underarm until this brand and the blade doesn&#x27;t provide a close or smooth shave!  Sale or not, this is not a quality razor for me.  After using only two (2) out of the package, I have just decided to toss them as I did attempt to use the same razor twice and that was a huge and bloody mistake!  I have yet to come across any disposable razor that truly is a one time use until Noxema razors!</li>
            <li> I have used these low-cost razors for a while now and I love them.  Very durable, don&#x27;t break when they drop/fall to the shower floor.  Easy to rinse clean.  I have sensitive skin and these razors don&#x27;t cut, burn, or cause irritation.</li>
            <li> I routinely buy the cheapest razors in the store. I am not brand loyal, I do not care how many blades there are. I chose these for the aforementioned reason to replace my - get this - literally two month old Venus razor. The two month old razor I threw in the trash before opening this package did a better job than the brand new Noxema razor. The handle on this razor is ridiculously cheap. And do not even think about a simple wet shave. You must use soap or conditioner or cream otherwise the blades do not make enough contact to do any good at all. I have not cut myself, but for the lack of results, I might as well just skip shaving until I can replace these with something else. I can&#x27;t believe these made it to market. Shame on you, Noxema.</li>
            <li> i only paid $3 and change for these from the food store but they are the worst razors i have ever bought in my life. seriously single blade dollar tree razors are better than these. If your in need, either spend a little mire for a decent on or a little less for one thats at the very least better than these are</li>
            <li> I bought these at my local retailer, thinking I was getting a bargain. 8 razors for slightly more than the package of 4 I usually get? How could I lose??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret ever deviating from my razor routine. I was surprised when it took three passes over the same area with a brand new razor to remove maybe 80% of the hair. Holding the razor under the light revealed that every blade was angled differently--a minor detail but pretty important if you&#x27;re trying to get people excited about three-blade technology. Every razor in the package had this defect, and all were utterly useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on the &amp;#34;pivot action&amp;#34;: It is also useless. Press the razor to your skin at the appropriate angle and it will pivot away from your skin. I had to hold the blade end down with my finger to get it to barely work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a huge favor and spend a little extra money on a nicer razor. Or, if you want to save money, stick with a pack of tried and true Bic single-blade razors. Anything--I beg you--than these.</li>
            <li> these were awful! Won&#x27;t even cut the hair on my legs. I ended up with semi-shaved, bumpy, red, sore legs! I have used cheap razors before, and I even recall using this brand in the past, but something must have changed because these are just terrible.</li>
            <li> The worst razor I have ever used.  Seriously, I don&#x27;t usually post a review to anything, but this was such a horrible experience, I kept the package to ensure I NEVER buy them again.  Please either improve them or discontinue them.  They are a waste of material.</li>
            <li> These are my absolute favorite disposable razors. Each one gets me through 2-3 shaves-- well worth the &amp;#60; $1 each price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for several years and love them. For the price, they are great. The handle feels flimsy compared to most because it is thinner but I&#x27;ve never had a problem shaving. On a scale of 1-10, hair thickness/length for me would be like a 6. These are definitely way better than generic.</li>
            <li> These razors suck.  You get a better shave with a plastic knife.</li>
            <li> When I saw that these where from noxzema I said great I will give them a try and the price is nice. Smooth shave not so much at all. They don&#x27;t even shave that close. More like is there even blades on this razor? Sorry noxzema these disposable razors are the worse I have ever used.</li>
            <li> These razor are absolutely horrible they dont work at all if it does work they just cut your legs all up</li>
            <li> These were the absolute worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used. They did not shave my hair at all! I even tried pushing them hard onto my skin and trying four of them. Did not shave the hair and I purchased 12 of these. What a waste of money! Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I used to buy the Venus cartridges until I was at a store that didn&#x27;t have them in stock. I picked these up instead, and they work just as well, and they&#x27;re tons cheaper.</li>
            <li> These are horrible. They do not shave well at all. The head of the razor moves too much and does not allow a close shave. Would never buy again.</li>
            <li> Love these razors. Won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
