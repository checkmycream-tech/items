    <ol>
            <li>This is the best sun screen.  </li>
            <li>And the best thing is that it doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell.</li>
            <li>Very nice feel to it.</li>
            <li>It goes on just like a good lotion.  </li>
            <li>A good scent doesn&#x27;t matter on a sun screen if the sun screen doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Stick with the tried and true!!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice kind of like a lotion.</li>
            <li>It feels nice.</li>
            <li>Some sunscreens have a very strong smell but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>For this sunblock you pay more for the plastic and air.</li>
            <li>I assumed that maybe they had rebranded it, and this sounded the most similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Did okay protecting us from the sun, but my kids</li>
            <li>It does need to be applied more often, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I have tried many and didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>Threw it away and bought something better.</li>
            <li>So yes the smell is pleasant but that is the only good thing about it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good general purpose sunscreen to keep in my purse as I burn very easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It comes out of the bottle easily because it&#x27;s so greasy&lt;</li>
            <li>It goes on so easily</li>
            <li>Works well and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I have really fair skin and live in Arizona</li>
            <li>It does have a light scent</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an important factor in buying almost anything for me.</li>
            <li>not provide adequate sun protection</li>
            <li>Nice and sheer and not sticky.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen has a light, fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t smell like normal sunscreen, but isn&#x27;t strong enough to bother my allergies.</li>
            <li>I noticed I was starting to burn after just a couple of hours and even applied more but still no luck.</li>
            <li>guess I should have taken the hint the first time when my wife got burnt after using it.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough after our day out in the sun she was burnt to a crisp.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my arms, hands, and neck, and all were burned to a crisp.</li>
            <li>No white marks, a pleasant smell (I think the sunny days is a clearer smell that then pool side - blue bottle).  </li>
            <li>Compared it to other bottles wich are filled full.</li>
            <li>Coppertone Clearly Sheer Sunny Days is a great everyday sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It absorbs really fast once rubbed on the skin.</li>
            <li>I honestly expected better from them.</li>
            <li>This was it finally a sunscreen that has a light fragrance goes on as a lotion does and protects you, we hit the jackpot.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I normally use Coppertone Oil Free SPF 30, but I checked a few local stores, and I couldn&#x27;t find it any more.</li>
            <li>Love it, dries quickly, not at all gooey or stickey.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes that this would protect me, while not making me smell like I was at the beach, and not feeling like I just got out of an oil bath.</li>
            <li>so I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen grows on light, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like some other formulas.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to use this product on a recent international vacation because my husband and I were going to spend a lot of time outside.  </li>
            <li>I think it rubbed off onto one of the young toddlers I watch well after applying it (their eyes kept watering and burning) and a friend who used it told me it swelled</li>
            <li>either they have too much fragrance, feel like toothpaste as I&#x27;m applying or leaves a white film.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen had a soft, not sticky feel</li>
            <li>It leaves skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen but when i recieved it it seemed there was almost a third of the sunscreen missing from the bottle.</li>
            <li>I was able to find it at my local grocery store for a few dollars less, thanks coppertone!</li>
            <li>Normally SPF 30 would be enough for me in those conditions.</li>
            <li>Received a free sample at a triathlon and will spend the next few weeks nursing my skin back to its normal health.</li>
            <li>Within a few seconds of applying, my skin is smooth, dry and protected!  </li>
            <li>Maybe I sweated it off or something, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to wash off easily with soap and water, and I wasn&#x27;t working very hard, so I doubt that&#x27;s the problem.</li>

            <li> It was a separated gloopy, oily mess that took an extreme amount of vigorous shaking to get to the point that I would consider using it (almost 5 minutes of shaking).</li>

            <li> it will come out a little runny.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday for hiking, market, villages, trips to the seaside.  </li>
            <li> used it on a recent hike, and I got severe sunburn on my ears (almost blistering) and moderate sunburn on my neck, almost as bad as it would have been if I had used no sunscreen at all.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it, dries quickly, not at all gooey or stickey.  The only downside is you have to remember to shake it a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen but when i recieved it it seemed there was almost a third of the sunscreen missing from the bottle. Still a good buy just disappointed about the amount.</li>
            <li> This is the best sun screen.  It goes on just like a good lotion.  Once you apply, you don&#x27;t even feel it.  No greasy or oily feeling.  And the best thing is that it doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunblock in a pharmacy and was on sale. Compared it to other bottles wich are filled full. For this sunblock you pay more for the plastic and air. For those of you who don&#x27;t look inside the bottle, if you see the following image I took, you can see for yourself why the reduced price...</li>
            <li> Do not use this product!!  After one use, I had an acne breakout like I haven&#x27;t had since my teenage years and I am 51.  Received a free sample at a triathlon and will spend the next few weeks nursing my skin back to its normal health. Severely disappointed. If you&#x27;re a Neutogena user, don&#x27;t even consider trying this!  Stick with the tried and true!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use this product on a recent international vacation because my husband and I were going to spend a lot of time outside.  After a few days of use the sunscreen was leaving a strange residue/film on our skin and it was flaking off everywhere. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This is the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I normally use Coppertone Oil Free SPF 30, but I checked a few local stores, and I couldn&#x27;t find it any more. I assumed that maybe they had rebranded it, and this sounded the most similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on a recent hike, and I got severe sunburn on my ears (almost blistering) and moderate sunburn on my neck, almost as bad as it would have been if I had used no sunscreen at all. Normally SPF 30 would be enough for me in those conditions. Maybe I sweated it off or something, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to wash off easily with soap and water, and I wasn&#x27;t working very hard, so I doubt that&#x27;s the problem. After that I&#x27;ve started applying it as thick as I can without leaving a white film and reapplying twice as often as I normally would to use up the rest bottle. Even then I avoid using it for activities where I expect a lot of sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The front of the bottle says &amp;#34;for sunny days&amp;#34;, but that doesn&#x27;t even make sense. Why else would I use sunscreen if it wasn&#x27;t a sunny day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It comes out of the bottle easily because it&#x27;s so greasy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Does not provide adequate sun protection&lt;br /&gt;-Smells bad (like synthetic pineapples or something)&lt;br /&gt;-Greasy and leaves skin oily looking&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to wash off with soap&lt;br /&gt;-Causes dirt to stick to skin</li>
            <li> Coppertone Clearly Sheer Sunny Days is a great everyday sunscreen. I have really fair skin and live in Arizona so I use sunscreen all the time. Some sunscreens have a very strong smell but this one doesn&#x27;t. It does have a light scent but it&#x27;s nice kind of like a lotion. You do need to shake the bottle before using it it will come out a little runny. It absorbs really fast once rubbed on the skin. If you are looking for a sunscreen that you can wear for everyday use I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this sunscreen a 0 if I could. Total fail by Coppertone and I honestly expected better from them. I tried it and ended up returning it to the store. I was looking for a good general purpose sunscreen to keep in my purse as I burn very easily. This was not it. It was a separated gloopy, oily mess that took an extreme amount of vigorous shaking to get to the point that I would consider using it (almost 5 minutes of shaking). I think it rubbed off onto one of the young toddlers I watch well after applying it (their eyes kept watering and burning) and a friend who used it told me it swelled their eyes shut for two days. Avoid this sunscreen!!</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve tried several sunscreens for my girlies....either they have too much fragrance, feel like toothpaste as I&#x27;m applying or leaves a white film. This was it finally a sunscreen that has a light fragrance goes on as a lotion does and protects you, we hit the jackpot. I was able to find it at my local grocery store for a few dollars less, thanks coppertone!</li>
            <li> So yes the smell is pleasant but that is the only good thing about it. I went out for a day of fishing and used this product once. I noticed I was starting to burn after just a couple of hours and even applied more but still no luck. I came home with burns all over. Thanks Coppertone!&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should have taken the hint the first time when my wife got burnt after using it.  She bought this for our wedding day because of the scent and because it wouldn&#x27;t leave her skin all shiny. Sure enough after our day out in the sun she was burnt to a crisp.  Twice a failure! A good scent doesn&#x27;t matter on a sun screen if the sun screen doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Did okay protecting us from the sun, but my kids and I all got a rash from this sunblock. I applied to my face, chest and arms and now my eyes and cheeks are puffy and bumpy. No thanks.</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Very nice feel to it. I don&#x27;t like the other sunscreens because they feel heavy and sticky. It does need to be applied more often, but that&#x27;s ok. It feels nice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after being amazed by a sample.  It goes on so easily, it&#x27;s a pleasure to apply to squirming children.  Unfortunately I found that it got into our eyes and for me (not the children) did not prevent a sunburn.</li>
            <li> Nice and sheer and not sticky.  Also none of the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients that are bad for you.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this would protect me, while not making me smell like I was at the beach, and not feeling like I just got out of an oil bath. Usually, two out of three is not so bad, but in this case the protection was what failed. I used this on my arms, hands, and neck, and all were burned to a crisp. I&#x27;ve NEVER had an SPF 30 fail to protect me, but this one did epically. I threw it in the trash and bought something that worked.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sunblock to wear daily because I am outside a lot gardening and walking dogs.  I have tried many and didn&#x27;t like that I either smelled like sunblock when I went to work OR white film got all over the interior of my car or clothing.  No white marks, a pleasant smell (I think the sunny days is a clearer smell that then pool side - blue bottle).  I brought this on a trip to France last week.  I used it everyday for hiking, market, villages, trips to the seaside.  Like another reader with daily use it did &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; a bit but i used a washcloth in the shower.</li>
            <li> I always shake the bottle a couple times before I use it anyway but have not had a single problem with this.  Within a few seconds of applying, my skin is smooth, dry and protected!  It is not greasy or gritty at all and does not leave any residue on my skin.  My skin feels softer when I use it.  I have not used it on my face because I always buy sunscreen specifically for faces for that.  I have also not had even a slight sunburn since I started using this, even when swimming in the sun all day (I always forget to reapply).  I&#x27;m buying their face formula next!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen had a soft, not sticky feel so I had high hopes. I applied liberally and reapplied over the course of three hours and still ended up burnt! Threw it away and bought something better. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The sunscreen has a light, fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t smell like normal sunscreen, but isn&#x27;t strong enough to bother my allergies. That&#x27;s an important factor in buying almost anything for me. The sunscreen grows on light, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like some other formulas. It leaves skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
