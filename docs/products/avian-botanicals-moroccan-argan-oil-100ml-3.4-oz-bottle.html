            <li>I highly recommend this oil.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional hair stylist and when i was offered the chance to review a pure Argan oil I couldn&#x27;t pass the opportunity.</li>
            <li>but I notice that is it a little lighter and help nourish me more.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed about the Aviano botanicals pure argan oil was that is USDA Certified organic which is a big plus for me .  </li>
            <li>We have used it once so far, and her hair was much softer and smoother after using.  </li>
            <li>It helps make my skin soft and really soaks into the skin.</li>
            <li>I like that it comes in a heavy duty glass container with a pump top.</li>
            <li>This oil can be used on a daily basis and it&#x27;s purity and the powerful antioxidants heal the skin from dryness, and</li>
            <li>I love that there is not a strong scent with this oil.  </li>
            <li>No longer can I ever live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always hesitant to rub any new products on my face, but I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>this huge 3.4oz bottle should last me over a month even with daily use.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>it makes his hair soft!</li>
            <li>My straight styles last longer when I use aviano, even in high humidity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for even sensitive skin AND use on your face!!</li>
            <li>far as using in hairdressing, I prefer a less greasy feeling so using this on fine hair</li>
            <li>Argan oil is probably my favorite essential oil for my skin/hair care and has replaced the millions of lotions, aftershave moisturizers, and conditioners that I used previously.</li>
            <li>I have the little red bumps on the top of my thighs and after using this they disappeared.</li>
            <li>Clear up acne</li>
            <li>I used it as a carrier oil to make my own bug repellent and it worked amazing.</li>
            <li>I use it on my cuticles when I do my nails and use it instead of hand cream to keep my hands young looking.</li>
            <li>My favorate so far is useing it in my hair.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised that once I worked it into my skin, it no longer felt oily.  </li>
            <li>It did not make it go away completely</li>
            <li>My legs felt so soft.</li>
            <li>tend to have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It does not have a smell which was a relief to my 13 year old son since he likes to use it in his hair.  </li>
            <li>I also used what was left on my palm of my hands in my hair by gently massaged it into the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that my cuticles are so soft now</li>
            <li>I get dry skin on my legs from shaving and I have hair that can get pretty frizzy looking.</li>
            <li>However, out of desperation on a particularly humid day, I used the oil that was left on my hands after rubbing the oil onto my arms.</li>
            <li>in the facts about this product being a pure organic product, I am not surprised that I believe this is a 5 star product.</li>
            <li>I did put just a little on my heels at night and the rough looking heels look a lot better today.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so very helpful not to let his skin dry out.  </li>
            <li>The presentation when first viewing the package may seem like a small thing, but it really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of Argan Oil lately.</li>
            <li>Also, the antioxidants and fatty acids found in Argan oil may also help with the treatment of mild acne and with the healing of acne-related scarring.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying Argan oil and ditching the chemical and toxin ridden synthetic blends of traditional store bought products, ESPECIALLY for those prone to breakouts or with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I just barely touched the ends of my hair and my bangs.</li>
            <li>I like the pump bottle, and how just one squirt was enough o do completely up my hands to elbow.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s left my skin feeling super soft after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>This comes in a dark amber bottle so that the oil does not deteriorate due to the light.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and have recently been transitioning in using only natural products with no synthetic ingredients and it has helped immensely.</li>
            <li>then other companies products and something that you do not see much</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:1379499dc2a60c57f201181273dd0106]]Argon oil is full of  essential fatty acids, anti-oxidants, vitamins and minerals that promote your overall health by moisturizing, softening as well as protecting your face and hair from sun damage - without harmful toxins and Parabens.</li>
            <li>I like the pump, but you have to be careful not to gettoo much in your hand with a single pump.  </li>

            <li> I have the little red bumps on the top of my thighs and after using this they disappeared.</li>
            <li> Clear up acne</li>
            <li> I used it as a carrier oil to make my own bug repellent and it worked amazing.</li>
            <li> I use it on my cuticles when I do my nails and use it instead of hand cream to keep my hands young looking.</li>
            <li> My favorate so far is useing it in my hair.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised that once I worked it into my skin, it no longer felt oily.  </li>
            <li> It did not make it go away completely</li>
            <li> My legs felt so soft.</li>
            <li> tend to have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It does not have a smell which was a relief to my 13 year old son since he likes to use it in his hair.  </li>
            <li> I also used what was left on my palm of my hands in my hair by gently massaged it into the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that my cuticles are so soft now</li>
            <li> I get dry skin on my legs from shaving and I have hair that can get pretty frizzy looking.</li>
            <li> However, out of desperation on a particularly humid day, I used the oil that was left on my hands after rubbing the oil onto my arms.</li>
            <li> in the facts about this product being a pure organic product, I am not surprised that I believe this is a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> I did put just a little on my heels at night and the rough looking heels look a lot better today.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so very helpful not to let his skin dry out.  </li>
            <li> The presentation when first viewing the package may seem like a small thing, but it really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of Argan Oil lately.</li>
            <li> Also, the antioxidants and fatty acids found in Argan oil may also help with the treatment of mild acne and with the healing of acne-related scarring.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying Argan oil and ditching the chemical and toxin ridden synthetic blends of traditional store bought products, ESPECIALLY for those prone to breakouts or with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just barely touched the ends of my hair and my bangs.</li>
            <li> I like the pump bottle, and how just one squirt was enough o do completely up my hands to elbow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s left my skin feeling super soft after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> This comes in a dark amber bottle so that the oil does not deteriorate due to the light.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have recently been transitioning in using only natural products with no synthetic ingredients and it has helped immensely.</li>

            <li> Those are the harder parts that I cannot keep soft without the help of this and other products.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am so pleased with the results of this oil. First, let me say that this was very well packaged and looks attractive. I like the fact that it&#x27;s stored in a dark brown bottle that has a seal. The presentation when first viewing the package may seem like a small thing, but it really does make a difference. I was also super happy that it came with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is amazing. No scent and the oil is not sticky or oily. It&#x27;s left my skin feeling super soft after only a few uses. It seems like my skin is just drinking it up, but afterwards, my skin is glowing and looks so healthy. I was very hesitant to use it on my hair because my hair is very fine and is easily weighed down by products. However, out of desperation on a particularly humid day, I used the oil that was left on my hands after rubbing the oil onto my arms. I just barely touched the ends of my hair and my bangs. These are the areas most prone to be frizzy on humid days. To my delight, that tiny bit of oil helped tame my hair and didn&#x27;t leave it weighed down and greasy. I love this stuff and I highly recommend giving it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was received either at no or low cost for review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil has become my number one essential oil. Aviano is 100% pure. This is important because that means it&#x27;s fragrance free, chemical free, alcohol free and preservative free. It also means that it&#x27;s best if you use the product within 6 months to receive it&#x27;s maximum benefits. You should keep it out of sunlight and sealed tight as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my hair to keep it from breaking. Not much is needed, just a few drops. I make bath scrubs and facial exfoliators with it. I shave with it and even do a scalp treatment with it. It&#x27;s non staining so you can sleep with it in your hair. I use it on my cuticles when I do my nails and use it instead of hand cream to keep my hands young looking. It&#x27;s the ultimate multi-purpose anti-aging beauty product that every woman should have. It&#x27;s a moisturizer, a toner and emulsifier that reduces wrinkles and dark spots yet is non greasy and penetrates deep to keep you completely hydrated which improves the elasticity of your skin. I look younger now than I did 5 years ago because of it. No longer can I ever live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aviano&#x27;s packaging is beautiful suitable for gifting. It&#x27;s the greatest gift you could give to any woman. I like that they seal it for our protection and that they provide a pump that functions well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying one that only comes with an eye dropper. They can get contaminated. This is a quality product properly packaged. Sample provided to try and test as a consumer for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I have heard a lot about Argan oil and its benefits but I have never used it until I got this. This comes in a dark amber bottle so that the oil does not deteriorate due to the light. It also comes with a pump where you can put some in your hand without dumping the whole bottle. I used it tonight after my shower and it does not have a smell. The product goes into the skin and does not leave an oily feeling. I have the little red bumps on the top of my thighs and after using this they disappeared. I have dealt with that problem for years and have tried different scrubs and lotions and nothing has worked until I got this. This stuff is great.I was offered a promotional discount to test and give my honest opinion of this oil. This is my unbiased opinion after using and testing the product.</li>
            <li> This is my go to argan oil from now on! I received this at an amazing promotional price to try out and I love it! I love the way it feels on my skin, it&#x27;s not greasy, it just melts into my skin and give me a beautiful soft, glow that lasts even after taking a shower. Me being a chocolate girl, it is crucial I keep my skin moisturized, and aviano gives me long-lasting moisture. For me though, the most important thing I use aviano for is my hair. I have wavy/curly, coarse thick hair. I like to straighten my hair on occasion and aviano has served as an excellent heat protectant. It doesn&#x27;t burn in my hair when I am straightening it like other oils, plus it makes my hair so sleek, soft and shiny. My straight styles last longer when I use aviano, even in high humidity. I also use it on my hair after it reverts back to curly when I wash it. It&#x27;s an excellent hot oil treatment and it makes my natural hair so soft and nourished. I love that aviano comes with a convenient pump dispenser that can be attached to the oil and this makes it so easy to use and apply evenly to the areas I need!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil and it&#x27;s benefits for my hair. So when I was offered this  Aviano Botanicals Argan Oil for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it. I ordered it and used it  that night on my hair. I washed my hair like normal and then towel dried it. I pumped a couple pumps of the oil in my hand and put it all over my hair. Then I dried with blow dryer. My hair is so soft and just perfect. I definitely recommend this Argan Oil from Aviano Botanicals.</li>
            <li> This is Argan oil is 100 percent pure and organic.  You get 100mls and comes in an amber bottle so the oil is kept pure.  I love that this oil comes with a pump.  It makes it so much easier to dispense.  I purchased to use on my daughters hair. I am going to be doing several different oil treatments to help repair some of the damage to her hair.  We have used it once so far, and her hair was much softer and smoother after using.  I am also using on my nails.  I made the mistake of applying fake nails, and I have a bit of damage to my nails.  I am going to be applying this oil to  repair the damage.  I highly recommend this oil.  I was provided a sample for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> I really like this argan oil. I have used this for many things. My favorate so far is useing it in my hair. It makes my hair soft silky and smooth. It also has seemed to tame down my frizzyness. I have also used this on my skin. It helps my dry rough skin. I have also found this to work amazing to soften up my cuticles. I like that it comes in a heavy duty glass container with a pump top. I really like the smell of this oil its not strong but has a soft sweet sent.i would recomend this to anyone to improve there skin and hair health. I recived this product free in exchange of my honest opinion and review.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is probably my favorite essential oil for my skin/hair care and has replaced the millions of lotions, aftershave moisturizers, and conditioners that I used previously. Talk about a money saver! I have extremely sensitive skin and have recently been transitioning in using only natural products with no synthetic ingredients and it has helped immensely. My acne has subsided and my skin is glowing and looks so healthy. I use it after my shower and even on freshly shaven legs without any reaction at all. My hair is stronger and softer than ever before. Aviano&#x27;s Argan oil is very light and absorbs quickly so I am not left with a greasy residue. I love that its 100% pure and is a fantastic carrier oil for my other essential oils. It takes very little to cover a large area, only a couple drops and this huge 3.4oz bottle should last me over a month even with daily use. There is a pump for easy application that makes it very convenient as a lotion and the professional packaging makes this a wonderful gift. I highly recommend trying Argan oil and ditching the chemical and toxin ridden synthetic blends of traditional store bought products, ESPECIALLY for those prone to breakouts or with sensitive skin. I know it seems crazy to use OIL if you&#x27;re prone to breakouts, really, I get it, but it really works and I think you&#x27;ll be amazed with the results! I received my bottle free as part of a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience with this Argan oil and my opinions of argan oil in general. I am in no way obligated or compensated for a positive review and really am just honestly sharing my opinion.</li>
            <li> I received this Argon Oil today, I usually use one that I purchase from TV, I have to tell you....First off I loved the fact that they include a pump to use in the bottle!!!!! The pump makes it so much easier than using a dropper or having to pour it out of the bottle. I have extremely dry skin and when I put some on my hands and elbows...a few minutes later they felt wonderful, and looked so much better already. The argon oil has a very faint smell to it...very fresh,, and will not interfere with any perfume that you like to wear.I like to use Argon oil in my hair as a smoother...this argon oil did NOT disappoint! When you apply a small circle of the argon oil to your palm of you hand..rub hands together and apply to ends or like I do all over from scalp to ends....it makes your hair so shiny and healthy looking. I love this argon oil and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product. You receive a decent size bottle . i love the fact that it comes with a pump. I used it in my hair and my daughters hair. Our hair now feels like silk. I would deffintly recomend this product to anyone whos hair is damaged and dry. You can also use it on your skin. MOROCCAN ARGAN OIL IS THE BEST :) * I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT DISCOUNT PRICE FOR MY HONEST OPINION.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of Argan Oil lately. The benefits are awesome. I was given a chance to try Aviano Botanicals Argan Oil and it worked great. This bottle is huge. Usually you get a 4 oz bottle, but this is 100mL. I really liked the fact that it came with a pump and not a dropper. It makes it a lot easier to used without taking the chance of breaking it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Argan Oil in my hair. I like to put a little in the the palm of my hand mixed with with my leave in conditioner. It helps with the manageability. My husband uses it and he says that he can not notice the grays as much. Also, he says it works better to control his hair then hair gel. It works great for people with dry, frizzy hair. It helps tame &amp;#34;puffy&amp;#34; hair. It is scent free.&lt;br /&gt;I also like to add it to my lotion. It helps make my skin soft and really soaks into the skin. It does not leave a sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Argan oil has become so popular these days and there are many many uses for it. My favorite ones are for my hair and skin. I did receive this large bottle free of charge to test it and share my honest and unbiased opinion.This oil is pure argan oil and has been working wonders on my hair and skin. I do apply it at night on my hair and leave it overnight washing in the morning. Also I do use it for bugs bites and on my cuticles as a moisturizer. It did come with a pump which makes easier to dispense. Aviano is now one of my favorite brands, I also use their chamomile essential oil . Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> This product is works great.  I really enjoy using it.  I put it on my face and it leaves my skin feeling really silky smooth. Once you work the oil into your skin it feels really light and does not clog your pores.  I was also surprised that once I worked it into my skin, it no longer felt oily.  I had had soda and it made my face break out terribly.  So I focused putting the oil in the area of the breakout the night before.  The morning after the redness had gone away and they were not so swollen.  It did not make it go away completely but it did seem to help with the irritation.  I really like the results that I am seeing this this oil.  I have very sensitive skin and I have not had any negative effects while using this product.  I am so very glad that I was able to receive this product at a promotional price as it is a wonderful product.  Makes my skin feel healthier.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product. I get dry skin on my legs from shaving and I have hair that can get pretty frizzy looking. First was the shaving, it worked great. Shaving was easy and no dry skin. My legs felt so soft. I was impressed that they still feel soft 24 hours later. Second was hair, I put a small amount on my hair after shampooing and then blow dried it out. No frizz and a easy blow dry. At the end of day, my hair still is smooth,soft.and not oily feeling. I like the pump that comes with the product. You just push gently to get a small amount out. A little amount goes a long way. I did put just a little on my heels at night and the rough looking heels look a lot better today.  I think this product is going to make the winter dry skin go away. Do remember it is an oil, so if you use in a shower it could get the floor a bit slippy. I did receive this product for free for my unbiased option.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hair stylist and when i was offered the chance to review a pure Argan oil I couldn&#x27;t pass the opportunity. In my opinion, Argan oil is a versatile product for all skin and hair uses. I typically use a BIG BRAND name Morrocan Oil as my go to oil for treatments for skin and especially as a hairdressing treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about this brand of Argan is it doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin quickly which allows for maximum deposit onto my clients hair or skin. It also has a nice consistency to it so that I am able to use a small amount per application. When using as a skin treatment it leaves the skin soft and is a great cuticle oil treatment during manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as using in hairdressing, I prefer a less greasy feeling so using this on fine hair I would recommend using a very small amount before drying and a very small amount if you are using as a finishing smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add in the facts about this product being a pure organic product, I am not surprised that I believe this is a 5 star product. I did receive this product as a promotion to review with an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> With my skin as I grow to a mature age I learn that what goes on my skin is important since I was introduced to Argan Oils I have been a FAN but not all oils are organic and I just love that word organic which means my skin is getting something clean and light but helpful for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite way to review oils is once I have taken my shower in the evening I place it onto my skin and see if it absorbs straight into the skin and yes this Av&amp;iacute;an&#x27; Botanicals did not fail me but I notice that is it a little lighter and help nourish me more. My hair just loves the Av&amp;iacute;an&#x27; Botanical Argan oil and I think that if you try this you will be a lover of organic Moroccan oil as well.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil has many benefits for your skin , nails and hair. I use Argan Oil almost everyday. I have tried different Argan Oil in the past, however after applying it my skin felt sticky and greasy. There are so many things I love about this product like the fact that it comes with a pump so you can dispense what you feel you need which means less waste, Non-Greasy &amp; Fast Absorbing, you can use it as a Skin Toner, Nighttime Moisturizer, Help with Razor Bumps and Burn after shaving, Leave-In Conditioner &amp; Styling, Overnight Deep Conditioning Treatment, Lip Conditioner, Help with Sunburns, Great for using as a treatment for cuticles and nails and to help dry hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have sensitive skin and I have had no problem using this product everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered a promotional discount to test and give my honest opinion of this oil. This is my unbiased opinion after using and testing the product.</li>
            <li> There are so many benefits of argan oil from watching the medical shows on TV and from what I&#x27;ve read that I wanted to buy this and give it as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The antioxidants in argan oil make it extremely important when healing a wound, burn, etc.  Argan oil is great for brittle and chipping nails, dry hands and dry and cracked feet. You just need to massage it into the skin.  It&#x27;s also an excellent moisturizer and good for styling hair.</li>

            <li> What I love about Avianõ Botanicals Argan Oil is the many different uses it has!  I had never used any kind of Moroccan Argan Oil before, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect and was excited to put this product to the test.  I have to say, this product exceeded my expectations!  How I use my Avianõ Botanicals Argan Oil:  1.  Skin moisturizer- What impressed me most is the change after one application to my toddler&#x27;s very dry legs.  What a difference!  This oil has also made my elbows and feet much softer! 2.  Facial moisturizer- I have acne prone skin so I&#x27;m always hesitant to rub any new products on my face, but I decided to give it a try.  After two applications there has been no change in acne, but my face is much softer!  I can&#x27;t wait to see long term results! 3. Hair and scalp moisturizer- My teenage son has dry scalp and is always itching his head.  One application of Avianõ Botanicals Argan Oil massaged into his scalp and dry hair and viola!  I have not seen him itch his head once today! 4. Hair styling- My toddler has wild hair with many calicks. I really don&#x27;t like using hair gel on him because it makes his hair look greasy and feel hard.  Avianõ Botanicals Argan Oil works like a charm!  His calicks stay down, his hair has a healthy (not greasy) shine and best of all it makes his hair soft! 5. Hair moisturizer- I massaged one squirt through my wet hair and immediately after drying could tell my hair was softer! 6. Lip shine- just dab a little bit on your lips for some extra shine. 7. Bug bites-  I discovered this benefit by accident.  My toddlers mosquito bites looked remarkably better just hours after one application!  I love that I got such great results with one product!  This Moroccan Argan Oil is certified organic!  I prefer using this on my children opposed to multiple other products containing additives, fillers and other chemicals!  This Aragon oil comes in a nice glass jar with a lid and a pump. I like the pump, but you have to be careful not to gettoo much in your hand with a single pump.  Just a little bit goes along way, especially when it comes to your hair and face.  It does not have a smell which was a relief to my 13 year old son since he likes to use it in his hair.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I do recommend this product!</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed about the Aviano botanicals pure argan oil was that is USDA Certified organic which is a big plus for me .  Comes in a 3.4 Fl oz bottle which is bigger then other companies products and something that you do not see much this comes with a pumper for your bottle instead of a dropper like a lot of other oil products . I have only used this for a little while so far but it def makes my skin feel very nice and keeps my skin moisturized . I will be using this on my hands to see if it will help them from cracking and getting dry.  This product is not a bad smelling product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I got this at a reduced rate for my fair and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> Argan oil from aviano botanicals has many benefits. It can be used for hair skin nails body and my feet. I use this product mainly on my hair and my feet. I feel that it helps spots of my skin where it is hard, dull, flakey skin. I also think my hair is dry and this product makes it better.  I just add a little to my conditioner or just add it to my hair and leave on. My hair is so dry and breaks easy. With this I can feel my hair more shiny and not so breakable. The ends of my hair don&#x27;t break into split ends.  I used this on my elbows, knees and my feet. Those are the harder parts that I cannot keep soft without the help of this and other products. Give it a try and you will see how it helps those parts of the skin. Comes in a very nice bottle with a free pump for easy use.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with Aviano Botanicals Moroccan Argan Oil.  I like the pump bottle, and how just one squirt was enough o do completely up my hands to elbow.  I massaged the oil into my nails and cuticles as well.  I felt like I was pampering myself.  I thought the oil absorbed well into my skin, and I could see the Shine right away.  I also used what was left on my palm of my hands in my hair by gently massaged it into the ends of my hair.  I do like to do a full hair treatment as well.  The scent is a slight, almost wood like, natural aroma.  I received product for my opinion.</li>
            <li> At first when I opened the package some of the product leaked out and got the lable pf the bottle all greased up. So, I figure that the product would be very oily on the skin. Later that day I used it on my face and elbows (because that area tends to be very dry for me). I continued to use it in those areas daily and my skin is very moisturized without feeling oily. I would recommend this 100%</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! I just love this product! Would recommend to my friends!</li>
            <li> I own several Aviano Botanical oils and have had great experiences each of their products! I absolutely love the fact that this oil is USDA organic certified and uses glass bottles to keep their oils pure and toxin free. Argan oil is beneficial for the skin, hair and body. I purchased this item using a one time promotional code, this review is written in my own words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 3-4 drops of this argan oil after I shower to keep my hair from getting frizzy throughout the day. The oil absorbs quickly and evenly unto my hair and has helped reduce dryness and split ends. Argan oil contains many antioxidants and natural moisturizers that help improve the physical appearance of hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is very gentle on sensitive skin and l use the oil to treat my husbands eczema on his feet. The oil is soothing and has helped improve the dryness and itchiness on my husband&#x27;s feet. This oil can be used on a daily basis and it&#x27;s purity and the powerful antioxidants heal the skin from dryness, and itchiness and help stimulate hair growth and promote healthy shiny hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with Aviano&#x27;s USDA certified argan oil! The glass bottle keeps the oil fresh and the included pump is perfect to dispense the right amount of oil. I am thrilled that my hair is softer and longer and that my husband&#x27;s skin is on it&#x27;s road to healing from eczema. The oil has no scent and is quickly absorbed on the skin :)</li>
            <li> When looking for essential oils, Moroccan Argan oil is one of the oils that you see for its multitude of uses and benefits (if you were like me and didn&#x27;t know what to use it for here are a few areas:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Protect against and heal skin infections&lt;br /&gt;• Clear up acne&lt;br /&gt;• Ease eczema&lt;br /&gt;• Hasten recovery from chicken pox&lt;br /&gt;• Heal cracks and burns&lt;br /&gt;and it smells better than tea tree oil (but that&#x27;s personal preference).  I use it for my skin (to keep it moisturized and protect it from the sun and the back of my heels and feet, which due to hypothyroid are cracked and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about the Aviano Botanicals argan oil:&lt;br /&gt;1)It is USDA Certified and 100% Pure and Organic - No fillers, no chemicals&lt;br /&gt;2) It comes in a dark bottle and includes a dispenser cap separately (see pictures)&lt;br /&gt;3) It is fast absorbing leaving your hands and feet feeling smooth and not greasy once it dries up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free in exchange for my opinion and it is what I have provided.  I will update on additional use.  Feel free to ask any questions and let me know if you found this review helpful.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help with my son&#x27;s eczema and we&#x27;ve tried SO MANY products and dermatologist creams over the years. I&#x27;m tired of strong prescription strength creams that work a little but never make the eczema go away (and are expensive too!).  I&#x27;m finding that this pure organic Argan Oil soothes his skin just as well and I feel better about the natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the bottle had a plastic seal on it, and then it had a paper strip further securing it.  The pump screwed on easily and makes it so much easier to use.  My son can use it too, since he just turned 10 and I want him to start taking more care with his eczema care and preventing flare ups.  I don&#x27;t worry he will tip the bottle over and spill it all with an easy to use pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also using this for me as well, especially at night on my dry feet and it&#x27;s making a big difference.  I have problem acne areas from time to time on my chin too, and smoothing some on my chin since I read that it helps with acne.  I have noticed that my cuticles are so soft now and my hands feel wonderful.  I love that there is not a strong scent with this oil.  My son HATES anything that has an odor of perfumes or smells &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; and we can both use this product for many uses.  I will continue to slather this oil in him 2-3 times a day over areas he has eczema.  I see that the skin is not as red and it&#x27;s so very helpful not to let his skin dry out.  He scratches terribly at night when his skin gets dry, so this is a big part of our bedtime routine to calm his itching problems.  Eczema is such a terrible ailment for so many children!  I love trying new skin products so I was thrilled to receive this Argon Oil for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  It&#x27;s a quality product, and pure, Organic oil.  I feel so good about buying the real deal oil, and not worry about harsh ingredients for me or my child.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:1379499dc2a60c57f201181273dd0106]]Argon oil is full of  essential fatty acids, anti-oxidants, vitamins and minerals that promote your overall health by moisturizing, softening as well as protecting your face and hair from sun damage - without harmful toxins and Parabens.This oil is great for anti aging and really does condition your skin and hair.

            <li> I was unsure when I first purchased this product, but now I am sold. I have been looking for a product this to use for both me and my sons. They both have very dry skin and hair as do I. I have been using this product for several days now and I am amazed at the results. Both my kids have very soft smooth skin now and the best part is its not greasy. You would think that this item would leave your hands and skin feeling greasy but it doesn&#x27;t. The oil soaks right into your skin and hair. I also tried it on my hair and I love the soft silky touch my hair has now. This product is a definite must have!  *disclaimer item was purchased and a discounted amount for a honest and nonbiased review</li>
            <li> I want to start off by saying this does have a very unique smell to it, but that should not stop you from trying it out, it is well worth it. The oil is thicker than some others that I have used but it is not a greasy feel to it once it is on. It leaves a nice shimmer to your skin, but IS NOT GREASY even with the shimmer. I used it as a carrier oil to make my own bug repellent and it worked amazing. It comes with a pump top and a normal top which are both excellent quality and do not leak or break easily. I put it in a small spray bottle to use it as the the repellent and I loved it even more. Out of habit I rubbed the oil in once I sprayed it but I really didn&#x27;t need to, it was already very light. I didn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily at all and the best part is I didn&#x27;t have to use any of those harsh chemicals on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product was purchased for the intent of review</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly/frizzy hair that requires multiple products to keep it tame. I put this in my hair and within one hour it was dry and not greasy looking! I used 1 pump worth, worked it into my finger tips first then worked it into my hair.  I did not add any other product... Love the feel, shine  and look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this at a reduced cost for my unbiased opinion.</li>
