            <li>(well more like pebbles)</li>
            <li>Cleans your skin and keeps it healthy.  </li>
            <li>I did receive six 1/2 pound blocks instead of three 1 pound blocks but that is ok.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Surely many have wondered, just as surely as I did upon opening this package, what on earth Mr. Postman had just delivered to my house.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>The soap was great and worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a bit over a week, and my skin improvement was astonishing.  </li>
            <li>The soap came on time and I was pleased with the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than ever.</li>
            <li>I really love using this soap.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have skin issues, I just prefer to use organic products and this works for me :)</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>but once i figured out my problem...i ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.....</li>
            <li>i was able to brush thru my hair even easier than using</li>
            <li>From the first usage I found it to be a good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about it!</li>
            <li>I use it to wash my face daily to get a real good clean feeling.</li>
            <li>This soap was exactly as I expected, Awesome!</li>
            <li>After you use the soap, just make sure to lotion with good lotion (pure or organic because store bought lotions are FULL of chemicals).  </li>
            <li>healthy, moist, conditioned and CLEAN...</li>
            <li>All came back to be more than 1 lb, which was a great news to begin with.    </li>
            <li>Each block is easily divided and can be molded into a bar or a ball for easier usage.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, product.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic.    </li>
            <li>Cheap and can be used all over the body.</li>
            <li>There are no \\&quot;rocks\\&quot; in mine; it is smooth as can be.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to be able to write enough good things to truly highlight the wonders of this</li>
            <li>i was so dissappointed with my hair but loved the way it made my skin feel...so soft.....</li>
            <li>It feels the surface of my skin feeling squeaky clean, but smooth and moisturized as well, so smooth.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clean feel after I use it.</li>
            <li>and if you use it to clean your face</li>
            <li>This one lathers a lot and whenever I use it I get compliments on how clean I smell.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural facial peel or astringent you can buy.  </li>
            <li>LEAVES YOU FEELING SQUEAKY CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I use a balancing toner and a specially formulated aloe vera gel to moisturize my face.</li>
            <li>This is my second order and I must say (just as great as the first).</li>
            <li>Each bar was completely whole and weighed slightly more than one pound.</li>
            <li>The soap has good later, I  didn&#x27;t feel any burning and does not leave a scent (which I like, since I&#x27;m choosy about my scent).</li>
            <li>Overall a good cleansing soap but watch out.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal, people started noticing how healthy my skin look after I used it.</li>
            <li>I use the Black Soap and Jojoba Oil (Pure) together, great combination.!    </li>
            <li>It lathers very richly and has a very creamy texture.  </li>
            <li>Great value for a good quality black soap -- use it with a loofah for cleaning your face, lather it up for a shampoo -- definitely helps keep skin, hair, and scalp clean without causing any damage.</li>
            <li>Must keep it away from water as it will melt quickly if sitting in water.</li>
            <li>THE VERY FIRST TIME.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt clean and smooth, but kind of dry.  </li>
            <li>If a whiff of coffee and aroma scent was not an improvement enough, the added olive oil and jojoba oil in the massage oil transformed the soap extremely mild yet strongly effective cleansing soap.    </li>
            <li>and I felt truly clean for the first time in months.  </li>
            <li>It was this huge, chunky mass of...stuff...with a very earthy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best kept secret.  </li>
            <li>I only use two soaps, this one and my own castile soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already cut one bar into smaller more shower friendly chunks and have them stored.</li>
            <li>My face feels very clean and soft.</li>
            <li>However, I decided to try this black soap from HalalEveryday, because I was sure it was authentic</li>
            <li>squeaky clean and soft and full of body.....</li>
            <li>My entire famliy love this soap.</li>
            <li>IT didn&#x27;t look so hot.....</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I could feel the difference...</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li>it came exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li>Within about 8 days, I thought I noticed something different about my skin quality, but I wasn&#x27;t sure.  </li>
            <li>bought the 1 pound package the first time.  </li>
            <li>The skin feels smooth and silky soft.    </li>
            <li>I love African blacknsoap!!!!</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t want to use it at first because of how it looks.</li>
            <li>I first found out about this soap on an episode of Dr. Oz, so I bought it...</li>
            <li>and if you use it consistently, your skin will glow.</li>
            <li>It resembled more like clay- solid, but sort of rubbery.</li>
            <li>first time washing my hair with it....</li>
            <li>I love it within a week and a half I started noticing how smooth my skin was to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Can be very drying if you don&#x27;t use the right moisturizer, and toner to balance your skin&#x27;s PH.</li>
            <li>I love the resluts, soft clear skin.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s so different, it does clean and smooth my skin and, from the looks of it, it does seem to be all natural.  </li>
            <li>BS/ACV....i&#x27;m loving this black soap compared to the BS...</li>
            <li>Since I just started college, I wanted something that was affordable, good for my skin, and would last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will continue to watch and see if what I think I&#x27;m seeing is really happening.  </li>
            <li>However thanks to fast shipping, its get to me on time..</li>
            <li>, it was very drying.  </li>
            <li>High quality!</li>
            <li>I am very please with the product.</li>
            <li>The smell is very earthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my hair is so much softer.....</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and came in 3 vacume sealed bags.</li>
            <li>But in recent years I&#x27;d been gradually trying to incorporate more natural, chemical-free products into my household, and happened to run across this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have recommend it to other friends and they also love it.</li>
            <li>It will pull oils from your skin, as well as exfoliates, so be sure to use a Shea Butter blend cream, of course I use 100% pure Shea Butter, raw and pure.  </li>
            <li>When I started using the soap, I thought it was a bit harsher than I read in the reviews, because all the reviews said that the soap was mild enough for baby skin.  </li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m in love with it and can&#x27;t imagine going back to regular soap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural a little soft , great lather the soap came in  a box with my name on it and each bar of soap individually wrapped in plastic with no orderform if I had to return it.</li>
            <li>I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I use it and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>The reason, is as it is a raw product it really works, better than anything on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>Real African Black soap comes in a paste type form not a bar, and is amazing.</li>
            <li>That aside, this soap does great, but breaks down quick, and gets scratchy due to material inside, but all you have to do squish it together once its wet and ply it back together.</li>
            <li>At first glace, one of the soaps appeared to be significantly smaller than the rest, so I had my friend weigh them each since she had a postage stamp machine at her office.  </li>
            <li>is cancer causing, shouldn&#x27;t be used in anything, more or less as a preservative in everything we consume and use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I wash my face with the Raw African black Soap before shaving, my face feels great afterward.  </li>
            <li>It also appears to me that blemishes from early shaving are beginning to fade.  </li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin and this has some rocks in it</li>
            <li>Old programming kickin-</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>The cocoa pod and plantain skin ashes act as natural exfoliators, gradually revealing an evened skin tone and healthier skin.  </li>
            <li>Received this product on or before the date marked on the invoice.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the packaging.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have chemicals, all natural, doesn&#x27;t cause eczema, doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals that all companies put out today.  </li>
            <li>Go natural people</li>
            <li>but I use it all over and it leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is an all natural product</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel  soft as well.</li>
            <li>and oh so soft</li>
            <li>this is all natural.</li>
            <li>all natural.</li>
            <li>Holiday time, I will cut it into single person size and wrap it pretty for office gifts.  </li>
            <li>And 10 minutes after your shower, even what little scent remains quickly fades away.  </li>
            <li>It lathered up quickly and became foamy with little effort.</li>
            <li>Additionally, many reviews mentioned that the soap was grainy or had some rocks in it that could be too harsh if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li>I just hope a little still goes along way, and I get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>,after I received the soap, the texture threw me off, because I expected a hard, solid block as shown in the picture, but mine came in a well-packaged, semi-circle kind of shape.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price because black soap last</li>
            <li>Before, I used Dudu Osun black soap, and I like it because it has ingredients, such as honey, Shea butter, and lemon juice, which most black soaps don&#x27;t have, and although it dries my skin out, it also seems to brighten my complexion.  </li>
            <li>However, this soap does not dry out my skin at all!</li>
            <li>I am deployed and it is hard to stay clean with all the sand.  </li>
            <li>Both really compliments each other.</li>
            <li>I tried Oil of Olay facial cleanser for sensitive skin with no effect and the rash was becoming worse.  </li>
            <li>Really works for acne and other skin problems.</li>
            <li>Doesn not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, there are tutorials on how to melt the soap down and add your own oils such as olive oil or coconut oil then pour it into molds which will lower the ph and make it less harsh.</li>
            <li>Only wish I could&#x27;ve found out if it worked. :o</li>
            <li>i have caucasian,very long, fine (stranded), but alot of hair so its thick....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s darker in color, smokier smelling, and slightly more gritty than African Black soap I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>I heard some pretty awesome things about African black soap but this product gave me a nasty embarrassing rash all over my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve largely stuck to a narrow variety of men&#x27;s body wash products over the last 15 years or so.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who tried the black soap would notice that the soap is raw, completely unscented, so it had strong, sharp scent.  </li>

            <li> I use a balancing toner and a specially formulated aloe vera gel to moisturize my face.</li>
            <li> This is my second order and I must say (just as great as the first).</li>
            <li> Each bar was completely whole and weighed slightly more than one pound.</li>
            <li> The soap has good later, I  didn&#x27;t feel any burning and does not leave a scent (which I like, since I&#x27;m choosy about my scent).</li>
            <li> Overall a good cleansing soap but watch out.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal, people started noticing how healthy my skin look after I used it.</li>
            <li> I use the Black Soap and Jojoba Oil (Pure) together, great combination.!    </li>
            <li> It lathers very richly and has a very creamy texture.  </li>
            <li> Great value for a good quality black soap -- use it with a loofah for cleaning your face, lather it up for a shampoo -- definitely helps keep skin, hair, and scalp clean without causing any damage.</li>
            <li> Must keep it away from water as it will melt quickly if sitting in water.</li>
            <li> THE VERY FIRST TIME.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt clean and smooth, but kind of dry.  </li>
            <li> If a whiff of coffee and aroma scent was not an improvement enough, the added olive oil and jojoba oil in the massage oil transformed the soap extremely mild yet strongly effective cleansing soap.    </li>
            <li> and I felt truly clean for the first time in months.  </li>
            <li> It was this huge, chunky mass of...stuff...with a very earthy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best kept secret.  </li>
            <li> I only use two soaps, this one and my own castile soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already cut one bar into smaller more shower friendly chunks and have them stored.</li>
            <li> My face feels very clean and soft.</li>
            <li> However, I decided to try this black soap from HalalEveryday, because I was sure it was authentic</li>
            <li> squeaky clean and soft and full of body.....</li>
            <li> My entire famliy love this soap.</li>
            <li> IT didn&#x27;t look so hot.....</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I could feel the difference...</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li> it came exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li> Within about 8 days, I thought I noticed something different about my skin quality, but I wasn&#x27;t sure.  </li>
            <li> bought the 1 pound package the first time.  </li>
            <li> The skin feels smooth and silky soft.    </li>
            <li> I love African blacknsoap!!!!</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t want to use it at first because of how it looks.</li>
            <li> I first found out about this soap on an episode of Dr. Oz, so I bought it...</li>
            <li> and if you use it consistently, your skin will glow.</li>
            <li> It resembled more like clay- solid, but sort of rubbery.</li>
            <li> first time washing my hair with it....</li>
            <li> I love it within a week and a half I started noticing how smooth my skin was to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Can be very drying if you don&#x27;t use the right moisturizer, and toner to balance your skin&#x27;s PH.</li>
            <li> I love the resluts, soft clear skin.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s so different, it does clean and smooth my skin and, from the looks of it, it does seem to be all natural.  </li>
            <li> BS/ACV....i&#x27;m loving this black soap compared to the BS...</li>
            <li> Since I just started college, I wanted something that was affordable, good for my skin, and would last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will continue to watch and see if what I think I&#x27;m seeing is really happening.  </li>
            <li> However thanks to fast shipping, its get to me on time..</li>
            <li> , it was very drying.  </li>
            <li> High quality!</li>
            <li> I am very please with the product.</li>
            <li> The smell is very earthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair is so much softer.....</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and came in 3 vacume sealed bags.</li>
            <li> But in recent years I&#x27;d been gradually trying to incorporate more natural, chemical-free products into my household, and happened to run across this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have recommend it to other friends and they also love it.</li>
            <li> It will pull oils from your skin, as well as exfoliates, so be sure to use a Shea Butter blend cream, of course I use 100% pure Shea Butter, raw and pure.  </li>
            <li> When I started using the soap, I thought it was a bit harsher than I read in the reviews, because all the reviews said that the soap was mild enough for baby skin.  </li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m in love with it and can&#x27;t imagine going back to regular soap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural a little soft , great lather the soap came in  a box with my name on it and each bar of soap individually wrapped in plastic with no orderform if I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use it and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The reason, is as it is a raw product it really works, better than anything on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> Real African Black soap comes in a paste type form not a bar, and is amazing.</li>
            <li> That aside, this soap does great, but breaks down quick, and gets scratchy due to material inside, but all you have to do squish it together once its wet and ply it back together.</li>
            <li> At first glace, one of the soaps appeared to be significantly smaller than the rest, so I had my friend weigh them each since she had a postage stamp machine at her office.  </li>
            <li> is cancer causing, shouldn&#x27;t be used in anything, more or less as a preservative in everything we consume and use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with the Raw African black Soap before shaving, my face feels great afterward.  </li>
            <li> It also appears to me that blemishes from early shaving are beginning to fade.  </li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin and this has some rocks in it</li>
            <li> Old programming kickin-</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> The cocoa pod and plantain skin ashes act as natural exfoliators, gradually revealing an evened skin tone and healthier skin.  </li>
            <li> Received this product on or before the date marked on the invoice.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the packaging.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have chemicals, all natural, doesn&#x27;t cause eczema, doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals that all companies put out today.  </li>
            <li> Go natural people</li>
            <li> but I use it all over and it leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is an all natural product</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel  soft as well.</li>
            <li> and oh so soft</li>
            <li> this is all natural.</li>
            <li> all natural.</li>
            <li> Holiday time, I will cut it into single person size and wrap it pretty for office gifts.  </li>
            <li> And 10 minutes after your shower, even what little scent remains quickly fades away.  </li>
            <li> It lathered up quickly and became foamy with little effort.</li>
            <li> Additionally, many reviews mentioned that the soap was grainy or had some rocks in it that could be too harsh if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> I just hope a little still goes along way, and I get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> ,after I received the soap, the texture threw me off, because I expected a hard, solid block as shown in the picture, but mine came in a well-packaged, semi-circle kind of shape.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price because black soap last</li>
            <li> Before, I used Dudu Osun black soap, and I like it because it has ingredients, such as honey, Shea butter, and lemon juice, which most black soaps don&#x27;t have, and although it dries my skin out, it also seems to brighten my complexion.  </li>
            <li> However, this soap does not dry out my skin at all!</li>
            <li> I am deployed and it is hard to stay clean with all the sand.  </li>
            <li> Both really compliments each other.</li>
            <li> I tried Oil of Olay facial cleanser for sensitive skin with no effect and the rash was becoming worse.  </li>
            <li> Really works for acne and other skin problems.</li>
            <li> Doesn not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, there are tutorials on how to melt the soap down and add your own oils such as olive oil or coconut oil then pour it into molds which will lower the ph and make it less harsh.</li>
            <li> Only wish I could&#x27;ve found out if it worked. :o</li>
            <li> i have caucasian,very long, fine (stranded), but alot of hair so its thick....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s darker in color, smokier smelling, and slightly more gritty than African Black soap I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> I heard some pretty awesome things about African black soap but this product gave me a nasty embarrassing rash all over my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve largely stuck to a narrow variety of men&#x27;s body wash products over the last 15 years or so.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who tried the black soap would notice that the soap is raw, completely unscented, so it had strong, sharp scent.  </li>
            <li> Each bar came individually wrapped in vacuum sealed plastic.</li>
            <li> For another, the soap residue left in the tub or sink is not the characteristic dark brown color of typical black soap, it&#x27;s a very light brown, lighter than sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first few times I used it, it seemed to leave my skin dry.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it dried my skin, but from what I had read on it,it was expected.</li>
            <li> There are enough comments about this soap both positive and negative.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve spent more money or worst things.</li>
            <li> Since I started using the rebatched black soap, my skin has clear glowing quality.  </li>
            <li> Finally, it will dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> I am reminded of that commercial that pointed out the question of how can we expect something that dries itself out not to dry us out.</li>
            <li> For those who have really sensitive skins, I would recommend them to buy the black soap with shea butter.  </li>
            <li> The soap is soft and will draw a little moisture so unused portions need to be in plastic.  </li>
            <li> sooooooooo very long.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like detergent based soaps.</li>
            <li> My wife saw this down in Charleston at the open air market and has been a convert ever since.</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap thinking it was African black soap, which is made out of palm oil, palm kernel oil and water.</li>
            <li> I still use a skin toner and facial cream after washing my face with the black soap; however, I can tell the difference when I put them on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to believe they sent me the Shea butter black soap instead.</li>
            <li> so i heard about african black soap and decided to try it....</li>
            <li> ok so i almost gave this product a bad review</li>
            <li> Totally natural, at least from what they say.  </li>
            <li> I have not used this soap because it is already dried out on the outside...</li>
            <li> The soap appears to be too moist with wet a look.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quicker than what I expected.</li>
            <li> A little of the soap goes a long way.</li>
            <li> cuz i live in missouri, usa and have very hard water....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not smooth, but when I apply it...it lasts all day long period.  </li>
            <li> so second washing i rinsed with my usual ACV</li>
            <li> My face felt a little dry after rinsing, I use emu oil on my face anyway</li>
            <li> SAAQIN&#x27;s a keeper when ordering my Raw African Black Soap from Ghana.&lt;br /&gt;~anita</li>
            <li> At $20 for three pounds, I&#x27;m not complaining, although I would like some reassurance that I did in fact receive raw African black soap from Ghana like they said.</li>
            <li> not immediately, but after a few body washes it does dry you out.  </li>
            <li> I gave this soap three stars, because the black soap that I received is different from other types of black soap that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I will not use any other product but the black soap.</li>
            <li> How do I melt this stuff down without wasting any?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered black soap before</li>
            <li> It was BLACK....</li>
            <li> Since my shea butter order didn&#x27;t arrive at that time, I rebatched the black soap with milk, coffee, olive oil and some aroma massage oil.  </li>
            <li> but with the black soap and ACV rinse i feel zero.....</li>
            <li> Maybe because all my life I&#x27;ve been told anything BLACK is no GOOD, I made it a point to be open minded when trying this product.</li>
            <li> and that was the cause of it, but it was tightly wrapped in plastic and stored in my trunk before I used it.  </li>
            <li> Another comment that people made about the black soap was that it dried out their skin.  </li>
            <li> This soap is a whisper of &#x60;one of God&#x27;s little secrets.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Also, I think the caffeine in the coffee helped erasing my wrinkles a little bit.    </li>
            <li> I prefer the soap wrapped in paper, a little dryer than what I got.  </li>
            <li> find it hard to believe that this is really black soap, because it defies everything about the Dudu Osun black soap and differs from other reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> even with BS/ACV i would still feel a little soap scumy...</li>
            <li> This is \\&quot;Raw Black Soap\\&quot; and is made out of water, cocoa pod ashes, plantain skins ashes, and palm oil.</li>
            <li> Get some for yourself and a few friends or to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li> Its heavily lather up you hands then rub the lather into your hair.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t an antibacterial soap but it does remove dirt and dead skin well.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the black soap to do this, since I have had that experience in the past.  </li>
            <li> i been doing the noo-poo for about 3 months now using baking soda and apple cider vinegar rinse...but been getting dandruff pretty bad from the BS...</li>
            <li> It is organic, natural, etc., doesn&#x27;t contain benzene salts (sodium benzonate)which seems awkward to me being as benzene</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was made incorrectly, or if I had an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> took about 1/2 cup of it and made a small bar of soap.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable</li>
            <li> But all you have to do is pull off a small chunk and roll it into a ball.</li>
            <li> You only need a little it lathers like crazy.</li>
            <li> I use this soap at the end of each day followed with a thin layer of Black Castor oil...</li>
            <li> since started using the raw shea butter as well, and using the products in tandem, man, I&#x27;ll tell you!  </li>
            <li> Since the lather is brown, I&#x27;m hesitant to use it to shampoo my silver hair because I&#x27;m worried it might dull the silver.  </li>
            <li> Plus, when I broke a piece off to use, the soap wasn&#x27;t hard at all.</li>
            <li> it makes all the difference if you have hard water....</li>
            <li> I buy at least 3lbs each</li>
            <li> felt like i had soap scum in my hair</li>
            <li> so for any body out there that is trying this soap and feels a film (soap scum), use ACV....</li>
            <li> Since August, I started to develop some redish rashes on my face, which forced me to use foundation to cover it up.  </li>
            <li> My skin has decreased its usual break outs, unless its my mistake of eating dairy or junk food</li>
            <li> IT is BLACK and IT is AWSOME!!!  </li>
            <li> I have not had any serious issues with the soap.</li>
            <li> A+ product that truly does get rid of troubled acne.</li>
            <li> It was difficult getting beyond the \\&quot;cake\\&quot; of it -- the way that it was made -- too bulky to use in the shower, and too bulky to lay in a soapdish.</li>
            <li> so bad it felt like cotton candy and was impossible to brush thru</li>
            <li> It smells bad but it works.</li>
            <li> and it does not smell bad.</li>
            <li> i hated it...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Can be very drying if you don&#x27;t use the right moisturizer, and toner to balance your skin&#x27;s PH. I use a balancing toner and a specially formulated aloe vera gel to moisturize my face. My skin has decreased its usual break outs, unless its my mistake of eating dairy or junk food I shouldn&#x27;t be eating anyway.They give you a lot of soap, and it lasts forever if you keep it in a soap box. Great buy</li>
            <li> I received my soap today. I love it.  I am deployed and it is hard to stay clean with all the sand.  I actually cut the block with a plastic spoon handle.  My shower was great and I felt truly clean for the first time in months.  You will need to moisturize immediately after showering. It is  soap</li>
            <li> I love my soap it&#x27;s all natural a little soft , great lather the soap came in  a box with my name on it and each bar of soap individually wrapped in plastic with no orderform if I had to return it. I didn&#x27;t return it because I love my soap I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love it within a week and a half I started noticing how smooth my skin was to the touch.  I wash my face with the Raw African black Soap before shaving, my face feels great afterward.  It also appears to me that blemishes from early shaving are beginning to fade.  I will continue to watch and see if what I think I&#x27;m seeing is really happening.  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered black soap before but I&#x27;ve used it with great results. I was running out and decided to try getting online. This soap was exactly as I expected, Awesome! Each bar came individually wrapped in vacuum sealed plastic. Each bar was completely whole and weighed slightly more than one pound. The soap has good later, I  didn&#x27;t feel any burning and does not leave a scent (which I like, since I&#x27;m choosy about my scent). I&#x27;ve already cut one bar into smaller more shower friendly chunks and have them stored. It&#x27;s enough to last for several months. I will be buying from this seller again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Totally natural, at least from what they say.  It is organic, natural, etc., doesn&#x27;t contain benzene salts (sodium benzonate)which seems awkward to me being as benzene is cancer causing, shouldn&#x27;t be used in anything, more or less as a preservative in everything we consume and use on a daily basis. That aside, this soap does great, but breaks down quick, and gets scratchy due to material inside, but all you have to do squish it together once its wet and ply it back together. It smells like some type of pumice soap or inate neutral substance, but not overbearing.  Finally, it will dry your skin out. period. not immediately, but after a few body washes it does dry you out.  Something like natural shea butter, a dynamite lotion, etc. is perfect.</li>
            <li> That should speak for itself that I&#x27;ve purchased this product because I like how it smells and I love it&#x27;s clean feel after I use it. Tah, Tahh!</li>
            <li> I heard some pretty awesome things about African black soap but this product gave me a nasty embarrassing rash all over my face. I&#x27;m not sure if it was made incorrectly, or if I had an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients. Either way, it&#x27;s not for me and I definitely will not buy it again or recommend this product to anyone. Beware folks!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she swears by this soap.  She has sensitive skin and this has some rocks in it (well more like pebbles) and if you use it to clean your face you cay get alittle scratched up.  Overall a good cleansing soap but watch out.</li>
            <li> This was my second order.  It&#x27;s an amazing product.  Lathers very well, cleans excellently.  Stumbled upon this soap and started searching.  It&#x27;s the best kept secret.  The reason, is as it is a raw product it really works, better than anything on the shelf.  It is a basic blend that just cleans without masking ordors with perfumes and added scents.  Cleans your skin and keeps it healthy.  It will pull oils from your skin, as well as exfoliates, so be sure to use a Shea Butter blend cream, of course I use 100% pure Shea Butter, raw and pure.  It&#x27;s not smooth, but when I apply it...it lasts all day long period.  Both really compliments each other.</li>
            <li> There are enough comments about this soap both positive and negative.  If you are thinking about buying it... Buy It!  My sister has eczema and she uses it.  I have psoriasis and I use it.  My friend used it (still does) after a curling iron mishaps with no scars.  Just try it.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve spent more money or worst things.</li>
            <li> This is my second order and I must say (just as great as the first). My entire famliy love this soap. Its a product that should be sold in my area. However thanks to fast shipping, its get to me on time..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s darker in color, smokier smelling, and slightly more gritty than African Black soap I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  Since the lather is brown, I&#x27;m hesitant to use it to shampoo my silver hair because I&#x27;m worried it might dull the silver.  Has anyone tried using it to shampoo their white/grey/silver hair on a regular basis?</li>
            <li> This soap is a whisper of &#x60;one of God&#x27;s little secrets.&#x27; Maybe because all my life I&#x27;ve been told anything BLACK is no GOOD, I made it a point to be open minded when trying this product. Having had severe, at time, skin(facial) problems.  My BUSH-Doctor recommended it over, and over again.  IT didn&#x27;t look so hot.....Old programming kickin-in...It was BLACK.... They LIED.... IT is BLACK and IT is AWSOME!!!  It leaves your skin breathable without that filmy or slippery finish. Your skin feels cleansed. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like detergent based soaps. It leaves your hair Fan-freekin-tastic...natural hair...healthy, moist, conditioned and CLEAN... I can&#x27;t get enough. I &#x60;luguriate,&#x27; according to Wendy Williams, as I bath ...shower...and wash my hair. I wish it lasted longer. In 1 week I&#x27;ve gone through 1/3 of my 1lb order. How do I melt this stuff down without wasting any?</li>
            <li> Fantastic, product.  I did receive six 1/2 pound blocks instead of three 1 pound blocks but that is ok.  You only need a little it lathers like crazy.</li>
            <li> The soap it God sent.  The first time I used it I could feel the difference... THE VERY FIRST TIME.  My skin felt clean and smooth, but kind of dry.  The first couple of times I used it, it was very drying.  But now, two weeks later, its not so drying.  After you use the soap, just make sure to lotion with good lotion (pure or organic because store bought lotions are FULL of chemicals).  I ordered some Jojoba Oil (Pure and Organic) and it moturizes my skin perfectly.  I use the Black Soap and Jojoba Oil (Pure) together, great combination.!    Well worth the price because black soap last sooooooooo very long.  Check youtube.com for video reviews.</li>
            <li> I use it to wash my face daily to get a real good clean feeling. it came exactly as ordered. High quality! I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap thinking it was African black soap, which is made out of palm oil, palm kernel oil and water. This is \\&quot;Raw Black Soap\\&quot; and is made out of water, cocoa pod ashes, plantain skins ashes, and palm oil. There is a big difference. I have not used this soap because it is already dried out on the outside...I am reminded of that commercial that pointed out the question of how can we expect something that dries itself out not to dry us out. Real African Black soap comes in a paste type form not a bar, and is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to be able to write enough good things to truly highlight the wonders of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it, frankly, on a whim.  I&#x27;ve largely stuck to a narrow variety of men&#x27;s body wash products over the last 15 years or so.  But in recent years I&#x27;d been gradually trying to incorporate more natural, chemical-free products into my household, and happened to run across this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surely many have wondered, just as surely as I did upon opening this package, what on earth Mr. Postman had just delivered to my house.  Wow.  It was this huge, chunky mass of...stuff...with a very earthy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took about 1/2 cup of it and made a small bar of soap.  It lathers very richly and has a very creamy texture.  I use it also to shampoo and shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months now and this is what I can say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first few times I used it, it seemed to leave my skin dry.  After about four days, that abated entirely.  Within about 8 days, I thought I noticed something different about my skin quality, but I wasn&#x27;t sure.  After two weeks, the improvements could not be denied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since given several away as gifts to friends and family.  I can&#x27;t imagine that I&#x27;ll ever use any brand-name soaps ever again.  I don&#x27;t know why I would.  This product cleans your skin.  The cocoa pod and plantain skin ashes act as natural exfoliators, gradually revealing an evened skin tone and healthier skin.  All these months later, my skin continues to improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some complain about the smell of it, but I think it smells great.  And 10 minutes after your shower, even what little scent remains quickly fades away.  You can add essential oils if you&#x27;d like to get creative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is some really good soap.  Get some for yourself and a few friends or to give as gifts.  It lasts forever (between uses, put your bar someplace where it doesn&#x27;t get water splashed on it or it will \\&quot;melt\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#x27;ve since started using the raw shea butter as well, and using the products in tandem, man, I&#x27;ll tell you!  Unbelievable the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 1 pound package the first time.  This is my second order.  I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap and cleans well. Will never purchase regular soap ever again. My face is clearing up from this product!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I only use two soaps, this one and my own castile soap. This one lathers a lot and whenever I use it I get compliments on how clean I smell.</li>
            <li> Received this product on or before the date marked on the invoice.  S&amp;H costs were comparable and the price EXCELLENT!!!  SAAQIN&#x27;s a keeper when ordering my Raw African Black Soap from Ghana.&lt;br /&gt;~anita</li>
            <li> Great value for a good quality black soap -- use it with a loofah for cleaning your face, lather it up for a shampoo -- definitely helps keep skin, hair, and scalp clean without causing any damage.</li>
            <li> The soap was great and worked very well.  The wood ash in the soap is great at controlling body order.  Its like running a carbon filter, no sent at all after the shower.  The soap is soft and will draw a little moisture so unused portions need to be in plastic.  But all you have to do is pull off a small chunk and roll it into a ball. You do have to change how you wash your hair.  Its heavily lather up you hands then rub the lather into your hair.  If you try to rub the ball of soap into your hair it will get stuck there.</li>
            <li> One of the best soaps I&#x27;ve ever used!!  It is fantastic.    I ordered 3 lb, 3-1lb package.  At first glace, one of the soaps appeared to be significantly smaller than the rest, so I had my friend weigh them each since she had a postage stamp machine at her office.  All came back to be more than 1 lb, which was a great news to begin with.    When I started using the soap, I thought it was a bit harsher than I read in the reviews, because all the reviews said that the soap was mild enough for baby skin.  Then I ran into a youtube video that one girl added some shea butter to the soap.    Since my shea butter order didn&#x27;t arrive at that time, I rebatched the black soap with milk, coffee, olive oil and some aroma massage oil.  The result was heavenly!!  Anyone who tried the black soap would notice that the soap is raw, completely unscented, so it had strong, sharp scent.  If a whiff of coffee and aroma scent was not an improvement enough, the added olive oil and jojoba oil in the massage oil transformed the soap extremely mild yet strongly effective cleansing soap.    I&#x27;ve used it a bit over a week, and my skin improvement was astonishing.  Since August, I started to develop some redish rashes on my face, which forced me to use foundation to cover it up.  I tried Oil of Olay facial cleanser for sensitive skin with no effect and the rash was becoming worse.  Since I started using the rebatched black soap, my skin has clear glowing quality.  The skin tone improved, the rash was gone, and the skin appears to be almost transparent.  Also, I think the caffeine in the coffee helped erasing my wrinkles a little bit.    I still use a skin toner and facial cream after washing my face with the black soap; however, I can tell the difference when I put them on.  The skin feels smooth and silky soft.    For those who have really sensitive skins, I would recommend them to buy the black soap with shea butter.  My shea butter has arrived and I&#x27;m going to rabatch the rest of 2 lb soap with it.  I&#x27;m so excited about it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and this time the soap size are smaller than the actual size of 1lb, so what is up with that?</li>
            <li> I love African blacknsoap!!!! For the last 3 years it is all I use head to toe!! Love it! Swear by it! Will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> Not to thrilled with the plastic bag. The soap appears to be too moist with wet a look. I prefer the soap wrapped in paper, a little dryer than what I got.  I was surprised at the packaging. And the soap itself is not what I&#x27;m accustomed to. It was a \\&quot;nice price\\&quot; purchase, but I think I lost on quality.</li>
            <li> This is great. It has turned my skin around. No acne on my face or body anymore! How simple was that. It also got rid of a persistant skin irratation on my hubbys shoulder. He didn&#x27;t want to use it at first because of how it looks. Now we are both happy.</li>
            <li> My wife saw this down in Charleston at the open air market and has been a convert ever since. Now she&#x27;s got me using it and I have to say it&#x27;s the bomb!</li>
            <li> The soap came on time and I was pleased with the packaging.  I am about to order again. I make shampoo and bath soap with it, I cleanse my face with it. Very good product. Happy customer right here!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it , Jury is still out with me because it has a funky smell. Works well though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have chemicals, all natural, doesn&#x27;t cause eczema, doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals that all companies put out today.  Do you know your toothpaste, deodorant, baby powder, lotions, and shampoos contain toxic materials?  Go natural people</li>
            <li> I use this soap at the end of each day followed with a thin layer of Black Castor oil... I love the resluts, soft clear skin.  This is a staple for my family.  I buy at least 3lbs each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Holiday time, I will cut it into single person size and wrap it pretty for office gifts.  No complaints...</li>
            <li> A+ product that truly does get rid of troubled acne. It smells bad but it works. Cheap and can be used all over the body.</li>
            <li> This soap suds up and lasts forever.  It leaves your skin nice and soft.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I first found out about this soap on an episode of Dr. Oz, so I bought it...now I&#x27;m in love with it and can&#x27;t imagine going back to regular soap. It was said that it is a facial cleanser but I use it all over and it leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! Great value and if you use it consistently, your skin will glow. I started using this almost two years ago and have not wanted to use anything  since. I even wash my hair with it occasionally.</li>
            <li> I love the product. The delivery was quicker than what I expected. The product cleared my skin and also my sons. The first time I used it, it dried my skin, but from what I had read on it,it was expected.I have been using for a month and I&#x27;m very happy. My skin looks better than ever. A little of the soap goes a long way.I will not use any other product but the black soap. I have recommend it to other friends and they also love it.</li>
            <li> I really love using this soap. I have not had any serious issues with the soap. I like the fact that it is an all natural product and it does not smell bad. I don&#x27;t have skin issues, I just prefer to use organic products and this works for me :)</li>
            <li> Great on all skin types. Perfect for those who suffer from acne. Deep cleans your skin. Please use moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural facial peel or astringent you can buy.  I love it.  This is my fourth order.</li>
            <li> Doesn not dry out your skin. It isn&#x27;t an antibacterial soap but it does remove dirt and dead skin well. Must keep it away from water as it will melt quickly if sitting in water.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, people started noticing how healthy my skin look after I used it. It made my skin feel  soft as well. I am very please with the product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The soap promises to do wonders: It probably does. It was difficult getting beyond the \\&quot;cake\\&quot; of it -- the way that it was made -- too bulky to use in the shower, and too bulky to lay in a soapdish. Only wish I could&#x27;ve found out if it worked. :o(</li>
            <li> LEAVES YOU FEELING SQUEAKY CLEAN. GREAT PRODUCT AND YOU GET ALOT.</li>
            <li> This was great for my body makeup. It went beyond what I was expecting. It was a lot softer then others I had purchase before allowing me to make smaller balls to use.</li>
            <li> I had been given samples of this soap by a friend.  From the first usage I found it to be a good product. It lathered up quickly and became foamy with little effort. I washed my face and hair with it. My face felt a little dry after rinsing, I use emu oil on my face anyway so that took care of any dryness. My face feels very clean and soft. My hair is manageable and oh so soft now.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this product and it came in a well sealed bag containing three smaller sealed bags. Each bag weighing a bit over a pound. Each block is easily divided and can be molded into a bar or a ball for easier usage. Or you can cut off a piece. My husband and I are now using this as are only body and hair soap. If you have sensitive skin, there are tutorials on how to melt the soap down and add your own oils such as olive oil or coconut oil then pour it into molds which will lower the ph and make it less harsh. The smell is very earthy.&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion is that my acne problems are milder, my husbands dandruff that he has had for years is gone. My hair is no longer having the problem of being too oily. And I do not have itchiness of the skin any more.&lt;br /&gt;And this is all natural. NO CHEMICALS. I use it and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I gave this soap three stars, because the black soap that I received is different from other types of black soap that I have used in the past.  Before, I used Dudu Osun black soap, and I like it because it has ingredients, such as honey, Shea butter, and lemon juice, which most black soaps don&#x27;t have, and although it dries my skin out, it also seems to brighten my complexion.  However, I decided to try this black soap from HalalEveryday, because I was sure it was authentic and it was cheaper than Dudu Osun.  Since I just started college, I wanted something that was affordable, good for my skin, and would last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now,after I received the soap, the texture threw me off, because I expected a hard, solid block as shown in the picture, but mine came in a well-packaged, semi-circle kind of shape.  Plus, when I broke a piece off to use, the soap wasn&#x27;t hard at all. It resembled more like clay- solid, but sort of rubbery.I thought it had been exposed to water or something and that was the cause of it, but it was tightly wrapped in plastic and stored in my trunk before I used it.  Additionally, many reviews mentioned that the soap was grainy or had some rocks in it that could be too harsh if you aren&#x27;t careful.  There are no \\&quot;rocks\\&quot; in mine; it is smooth as can be.  Another comment that people made about the black soap was that it dried out their skin.  I was expecting the black soap to do this, since I have had that experience in the past.  However, this soap does not dry out my skin at all! It feels the surface of my skin feeling squeaky clean, but smooth and moisturized as well, so smooth.  For another, the soap residue left in the tub or sink is not the characteristic dark brown color of typical black soap, it&#x27;s a very light brown, lighter than sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it hard to believe that this is really black soap, because it defies everything about the Dudu Osun black soap and differs from other reviews I read.  I just hope a little still goes along way, and I get my money&#x27;s worth.  Although it&#x27;s so different, it does clean and smooth my skin and, from the looks of it, it does seem to be all natural.  At $20 for three pounds, I&#x27;m not complaining, although I would like some reassurance that I did in fact receive raw African black soap from Ghana like they said. I&#x27;m starting to believe they sent me the Shea butter black soap instead.</li>
            <li> ok so i almost gave this product a bad review but once i figured out my problem...i ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.....let me tell you my story in case anyone else is having this problem....i been doing the noo-poo for about 3 months now using baking soda and apple cider vinegar rinse...but been getting dandruff pretty bad from the BS...so i heard about african black soap and decided to try it....first time washing my hair with it....i hated it...felt like i had soap scum in my hair so bad it felt like cotton candy and was impossible to brush thru...i have caucasian,very long, fine (stranded), but alot of hair so its thick....i was so dissappointed with my hair but loved the way it made my skin feel...so soft.....then i remembered i had to use the ACV with the BS cuz it did something of the same sort....cuz i live in missouri, usa and have very hard water....so second washing i rinsed with my usual ACV and omg it made a world of difference..i was able to brush thru my hair even easier than using BS/ACV....i&#x27;m loving this black soap compared to the BS...my hair is so much softer.....even with BS/ACV i would still feel a little soap scumy...but with the black soap and ACV rinse i feel zero.....squeaky clean and soft and full of body.....so for any body out there that is trying this soap and feels a film (soap scum), use ACV....it makes all the difference if you have hard water....never going back to regular shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Great Product that ia all natural. Really works for acne and other skin problems. Shipped fast and came in 3 vacume sealed bags. I would definitely order again from this seller.</li>
