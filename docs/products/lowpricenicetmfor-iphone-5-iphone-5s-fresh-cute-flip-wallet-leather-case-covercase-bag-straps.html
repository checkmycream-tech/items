            <li>so make sure you read all of the information</li>
            <li>This is a really cute wallet/iPhone case.</li>
            <li>Still cute though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably order more.</li>
            <li>within an hour of receiving it the bow fell off the front of it, and that was what I considered to be the most appealing part of it.</li>

            <li>just as described shipped fast</li>
            <li>I was worried about that at first but since it&#x27;s tight, it actually feels more secure when you wear the wallet cross-body style or on the shoulder.</li>

            <li> so cute protective chain broke on first day but fixable</li>
            <li> This is a really cute wallet/iPhone case. On delivery I saw that the &#x27;lace&#x27; is not a piece of material as I thought when I ordered it. It&#x27;s like a tattoo. Still cute though. It fits my 5s perfectly. I had to finagle the hook eye to get the chain strap on. I was worried about that at first but since it&#x27;s tight, it actually feels more secure when you wear the wallet cross-body style or on the shoulder. TIP: squeeze the corner inward to position the clasp so that it closes securely.</li>
            <li> UGLY, UGLY, UGLY.  Looks absolutely nothing like the picture.  I opened the package, and threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> it turned colors in less than two days the black was almost gone and it looked so bad that i had to oder another one.  loved the spaces and place for money.  it just looked tacky in less than two days</li>
            <li> Fades easily but great case</li>

            <li> Bad when u put your credit cards or $ inside it won&#x27;t close</li>
