            <li>it has many benefits from moisturising the skin to clearing a lot of skin problems from acne to helping with skin discolouration.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not so sure.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel like it pulls more toxins out of your skin.</li>
            <li>Made me breakout even more.</li>
            <li>So, unless you wish to chance the loss of otherwise healthy patches of skin</li>
            <li>and I will let you all know how it works when I get to use it more often.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>When I get this soap I wasn&#x27;t really sure it was going to work.</li>
            <li>Great natural soap that is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>- it will leave a brownish residue (don&#x27;t worry, it can easily be wiped off).&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>but their not the huge cystic whiteheads ones.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice, and I love that it&#x27;s made from natural products.</li>
            <li>your best option is to toss this soap into the nearest waste receptacle.  </li>
            <li>It didnt prevent pimples redness as i heard and thought it would its smells good at first when you open the box but after a couple of uses it kind of has a oder</li>
            <li>DUDU-OSUN Soap is a very pleasant soap to use; it lathers up very well and really deep clean the skin.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is seriously the best!</li>
            <li>currently pregnant</li>
            <li>It came in 3 days, will definitely order more !</li>
            <li>Great for anyone suffering with acne and wants a natural way to clear their acne.</li>
            <li>This soap will stain your wash cloths but it is well worth</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smoother my discoloration is not as noticeable, I love that it has  all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>IT really dries your skin so for those who already have dry skin, it will not be so pleasant unless you use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The shipping was VERY fast.</li>
            <li>Most cleansers i use makes my face red after washing, but this doesn&#x27;t which I really like!</li>
            <li>The first time I used tgis soap, my pimple did sting while washing my face, but now not anyone.</li>
            <li>I might purchase it again depending on how I like the results when I finish the first bar</li>
            <li>There seems to be no quality control when it comes to this product, and you&#x27;ll probably get more misses than hits when you purchase several bars of  this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I had really high expectations about this soap!!</li>
            <li>I had the pleasure to use this soap for the first time when I ordered it...</li>
            <li>I bought it because of the positive reviews about moisturizing</li>
            <li>I used part of it in another black soap liquid to melt and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to keep dry between uses.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend this to the whole world...</li>
            <li>i didnt really like too well</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen any result yet as in fading my acne scars, but this does keep my acne in control.</li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t really noticed to much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I just wish it didnt go so fast</li>
            <li>I like it as an everyday soap and leave the acne washing to the handy Purpose Soap.</li>
            <li>so far I like it!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with this soap and would buy it again (which will be awhile because it lasts forever as a facial cleanser!)</li>
            <li>and this broke me out even more and over dried my skin.</li>
            <li>I live in the south.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>btw, I used it on my face today and it made my face very soft.</li>
            <li>Honey is long been used for healing and this adds the black soap feature to make a super rich cleansing product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money in the past two years trying to find a good product to help my acne.</li>
            <li>I have oily acne prone skin and it clear my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves a natural, soft scent, it cleans well, doesn&#x27;t try skin out, and exfoliates well.</li>
            <li>I also get frequent compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have had some breakouts on my face, but it leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>Was not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>Acne scars are slowly fading :)</li>
            <li>This does have a really strong fragrance to it, but after using the soap a few times, the frangrace isn&#x27;t really a big deal.</li>
            <li>There is no other soap that I use on my face.</li>
            <li>It does work as a nice everyday facial soap but does have a slight scent that my husband does not like.</li>
            <li>I also like how it has only natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Have old skin and this feels like a facial.</li>
            <li>This soap with one wash pulls all that out where most soap makes it worse.</li>
            <li>but this soap did not dry my skin out!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This soap with one wash pulls all that out where most soap makes it worse.</li>
            <li> but this soap did not dry my skin out!</li>
            <li> it is very harsh but very efficient.</li>
            <li> ALL the bars I bought caused stinging; it was only when one bar actually left me with several raw areas on my cheeks and nose that I stopped using this soap alltogether.  </li>
            <li> I think that this soap and using african shea butter on my skin has made my stretch marks less visible in about three weeks.</li>
            <li> also, be careful leaving it in showers, on sinks, etc</li>
            <li> I have used regular black soap before and boy is that drying!</li>
            <li> My back would always have these little bumps but since using this black soap i havnt had any.</li>
            <li> This soap does make your face feel extremely tight and dry</li>
            <li> This smell of this soap might be a little off-putting to some - it&#x27;s a little musty, fruity and nutty at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have really bad acne and huge cystic acne</li>
            <li> im using this to get rid of dark marks on my skin</li>
            <li> I would like to use the lighter color black soap since soap have plantain leaves but not noted on as an ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I also tried jelly black soap, that was drying as well.</li>
            <li> I still do get little pimples here</li>
            <li> This really dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> JUST AS EXPECTED!!!!</li>
            <li> The stinging is NOT a good sign that the soap is &#x27;working&#x27;, as I so foolishly thought.   </li>
            <li> If you do use it, wash your face with cold water for less stinging.</li>
            <li> the soap isn&#x27;t a bad smell.</li>
            <li> Broke me out sooo bad :(</li>
            <li> So disappointed 😔😏</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The reason it is called &amp;#34;DuDu&amp;#34; is because it is unadulterad crap.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Used it, but doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me. Might work on others.</li>
            <li> This smell of this soap might be a little off-putting to some - it&#x27;s a little musty, fruity and nutty at the same time. But I love it!&lt;br /&gt;And also, be careful leaving it in showers, on sinks, etc - it will leave a brownish residue (don&#x27;t worry, it can easily be wiped off).&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of the soap - it&#x27;s awesome! It leaves a natural, soft scent, it cleans well, doesn&#x27;t try skin out, and exfoliates well. I can&#x27;t say anything about preventing acne, because I&#x27;m not a sufferer of it. Overall, I am pleased with this soap and would buy it again (which will be awhile because it lasts forever as a facial cleanser!) Just be sure to keep dry between uses.</li>
            <li> DUDU-OSUN Soap is a very pleasant soap to use; it lathers up very well and really deep clean the skin.  I used part of it in another black soap liquid to melt and it is amazing.  My skins looks 65% better on the sun burned area of my face and I am very pleased.  I would recommend this soap to anyone with any type of skin ailment. I would like to use the lighter color black soap since soap have plantain leaves but not noted on as an ingredient.  THE OVERALL REVIEW IS EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li> JUST AS EXPECTED!!!! THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Everyone knows this is a all in one soap it has many benefits from moisturising the skin to clearing a lot of skin problems from acne to helping with skin discolouration. This soap will stain your wash cloths but it is well worth it just don&#x27;t use it with your more expensive wash cloths.</li>
            <li> amazing item i am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Great for anyone suffering with acne and wants a natural way to clear their acne.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, it&#x27;s amazing on my skin it&#x27;s smoother my discoloration is not as noticeable, I love that it has  all natural ingredients. Love</li>
            <li> Many people suggest this is great for acne prone people but I&#x27;m not so sure.  It does work as a nice everyday facial soap but does have a slight scent that my husband does not like. After you rinse it off though, the scent goes away.  I like it as an everyday soap and leave the acne washing to the handy Purpose Soap.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years. There is no other soap that I use on my face. I also get frequent compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. I use it for my body and face. I live in the south. After eating crawfish, your hands will burn because of the spices. This soap with one wash pulls all that out where most soap makes it worse. It was kind of amazing. Makes me feel like it pulls more toxins out of your skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing soap!!! Whether you have acne or not, it gives a clear face and a lovely glow!!! Im using this forever!!!! I would reccomend this to the whole world...</li>
            <li> Made me breakout even more. Im currently pregnant so maybe my hormones just didnt mesh well with this soap. Made my chest break out as well and i never get acne there. Also the smell kind of made me nauseous but that could be my pregnancy as well.</li>
            <li> It didnt prevent pimples redness as i heard and thought it would its smells good at first when you open the box but after a couple of uses it kind of has a oder i didnt really like too well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for about a week and I have to say that its a great product! I have really bad acne and huge cystic acne and I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money in the past two years trying to find a good product to help my acne. Nothing works until I found this. Most cleansers i use makes my face red after washing, but this doesn&#x27;t which I really like! I haven&#x27;t really seen any result yet as in fading my acne scars, but this does keep my acne in control. I still do get little pimples here and there but their not the huge cystic whiteheads ones. The first time I used tgis soap, my pimple did sting while washing my face, but now not anyone. This does have a really strong fragrance to it, but after using the soap a few times, the frangrace isn&#x27;t really a big deal. I also like how it has only natural ingredients. This soap does make your face feel extremely tight and dry so make sure to use a good hydrated moisturizer! Also make sure not to get this soap in your eyes! It will hurt! The shipping was VERY fast. Overall, I recommend this soap. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Been using all over body. I have had some breakouts on my face, but it leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft. I might purchase it again depending on how I like the results when I finish the first bar</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. I have very sensitive skin and this broke me out even more and over dried my skin.</li>
            <li> I love it ! My acne scars are starting to fade away as well !! It came in 3 days, will definitely order more !</li>
            <li> It smells great but have not seen any results on lightening brown marks yet.</li>
            <li> I use at night before using Shea butter. Works wonders for acne prone skin, but you will need a really good moisturizer (Shea butter) it is very harsh but very efficient.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously the best! Everytime I see that I have a pimple, the next day it shrinks! I use it at night then after I put Egyptian magic on my face and both these products together work wonders for my skin! Acne scars are slowly fading :)</li>
            <li> ...using this soap, then you&#x27;ve gotten a bar from a lye-heavy batch (meaning the soap maker skimped on the amount of oil used). There seems to be no quality control when it comes to this product, and you&#x27;ll probably get more misses than hits when you purchase several bars of  this stuff.  The stinging is NOT a good sign that the soap is &#x27;working&#x27;, as I so foolishly thought.   ALL the bars I bought caused stinging; it was only when one bar actually left me with several raw areas on my cheeks and nose that I stopped using this soap alltogether.  So, unless you wish to chance the loss of otherwise healthy patches of skin your best option is to toss this soap into the nearest waste receptacle.  The reason it is called &amp;#34;DuDu&amp;#34; is because it is unadulterad crap.</li>
            <li> The soap smells great!!!&amp;#34; Even my sister loved the smell . I think that this soap and using african shea butter on my skin has made my stretch marks less visible in about three weeks. My back would always have these little bumps but since using this black soap i havnt had any.</li>
            <li> Broke me out sooo bad :( I had really high expectations about this soap!! So disappointed 😔😏</li>
            <li> This soap did not work for me. It stings like hell when you apply it. If you do use it, wash your face with cold water for less stinging. If you are looking to treat your acne, try smashing some aspirin and mixing it with water to make a paste and then apply it to the tip of your acne or pimple. Now that is effective.</li>
            <li> I totally love this soap ,work great for my oily skin and even lightened my brown spots.love the way it smells also</li>
            <li> This really dried my skin out. I bought it because of the positive reviews about moisturizing so I was disappointed. Just FYI, I&#x27;m Caucasian and have combination skin.</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday. I received way before it estimated I would, and im happy about that! it comes just as the picture show. the soap isn&#x27;t a bad smell. to me it smells like nature! I only used it once and its not as drying as people say it is. I have used regular black soap before and boy is that drying! I also tried jelly black soap, that was drying as well. but this soap did not dry my skin out! I had bio oil in hand just in case it was drying. im using this to get rid of dark marks on my skin and I will let you all know how it works when I get to use it more often.  btw, I used it on my face today and it made my face very soft. I love it. I haven&#x27;t put anything on it after that. 1/28/14</li>
            <li> I bought it because someone recommended it to me since I have acne prone skin. But I haven&#x27;t really noticed to much of a difference in my skin. It does smell nice, and I love that it&#x27;s made from natural products.</li>
            <li> When I get this soap I wasn&#x27;t really sure it was going to work. So I cut a piece of it to try. It worked great. I have oily acne prone skin and it clear my skin. Was not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> This soap made me broke out with cystic acne and to begin with I didn&#x27;t have a lot. IT really dries your skin so for those who already have dry skin, it will not be so pleasant unless you use a moisturizer. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great natural soap that is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Have old skin and this feels like a facial. Honey is long been used for healing and this adds the black soap feature to make a super rich cleansing product. Good price too!</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure to use this soap for the first time when I ordered it...so far I like it!!! I just wish it didnt go so fast</li>
