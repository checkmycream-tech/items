            <li> This is my personal scent. I&#x27;ve worn it since it came out and I don&#x27;t feel like myself if I don&#x27;t have it on. I&#x27;m constantly being told I smell lovely, and it&#x27;s a light enough scent that a person has to be close to smell it. Perfect in my book.</li>
            <li> Just like it always has smelled.  The fragrance is the same and I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it really is divine. You cannot go wrong and will surely be back for more. Happy scent!</li>
            <li> Exactly the perfume I wanted! Smells great and the bottle is huge, way more cost efficient than any where else!</li>
            <li> good size for the money</li>
            <li> Priced right with speedy delivery….perfect!</li>
            <li> I like the light, clean fragrance.  So many are heavy and offensive to me and others.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I Got exactly what I wanted in a very timely fashion too !  exactly as billed and advertised with my iPhone app Thanks!</li>
            <li> it is nice, doesn&#x27;t smell very long but nice while it lasts.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Victoria Secrets perfumes and body mist!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter, she loves it</li>
            <li> Gift, sister asked for it, only disappointed it did not come with a box</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter. Came with no packaging and looked either old or a knockoff</li>
            <li> This product absolutely smells amazing and it is just the best product.  It is awesome!!</li>
            <li> I love this scent but I hate that it has been discontinued. I paid way more than it was worth but, oh well</li>
            <li> sexy...feminine...I love it n my hubby just can&#x27;t stay away once I spray it on!!!</li>
            <li> fast delivery. got as gift for my daughter, she loves it so I do too. A+</li>
            <li> this is a great day time fragence. It is not overpowering and very plesant. Many of the stronger smells give me bad headaches, but this one never bothers me. A great buy!</li>
            <li> smells great on my wife.</li>
            <li> I have bad allergies to most prefumes and this is one of the only ones that my wife can wear that does not trigger an attack.</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume because of my daughter-in-law.  She&#x27;s loves it, but I am not too fun of it.</li>
            <li> this is a mist not as fragrant as the perfume, very light smelling. You only get what you pay for, the perfume may be a little more expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> It loved this fragrance. It came right on time.</li>
