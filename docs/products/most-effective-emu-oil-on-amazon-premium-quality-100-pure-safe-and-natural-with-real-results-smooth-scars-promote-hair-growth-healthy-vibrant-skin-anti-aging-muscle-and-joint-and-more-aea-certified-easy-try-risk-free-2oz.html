            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love this and recommend this great quality product.</li>
            <li>All together a good product with a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>Product is excellent, it spreads quite far without leaving the skin oily.</li>
            <li>will be buying lots more .</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is odorless.  </li>
            <li>So many beauty products are overly fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lovely.......</li>
            <li>This Emu oil is great and very silky.</li>
            <li>and you use more</li>
            <li>the skin was smooth and so healthy looking.</li>
            <li>The other brand is a better product!!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my under eye area and after a couple I have seen an increase in skin firmness and a decrease in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>i know i would have healed without this emu oil, but not as fast and not as healthy and smooth looking as it does now.</li>
            <li>Going to order another bottle for my daughter to use right now!  </li>
            <li>the texture of my face is so much better.it is smoother ,brighter and the tone is much more even.</li>
            <li>I also love that it comes in a dropper; it is really convenient.</li>
            <li>I got my husband to use and he could not believe how quick it took away the pain.</li>
            <li>.......Emu Oil doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin very well.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that it is absolutely positively free from ANY scent whatsoever.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried using this on my skin yet, since I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily - I&#x27;m a bit nervous.</li>
            <li>Good in my hair and less in the comb, when I style my hair in the morning and it is not oily.</li>
            <li>First I use a cream moisturizer on my hair, and then I add oil to help seal it in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve still got a way to go, before I see real growth, but I know my hair needs this oil!</li>
            <li>This was a gift for a friend who is very grateful!</li>
            <li>He was skeptical, but now tells me, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t ever run out of this stuff,&amp;#34;  Also excellent on sore hangnails and cuticles because it soothes and medicates without stinging..  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working, My hair is definitely more soft!</li>
            <li>Virgin coconut oil is still my default dry skin magic oil.  </li>
            <li>i used a drop of this emu oil on both areas and gently rubbed it in about 3 times each day.</li>
            <li>good thing about this oil is that you don&#x27;t need a lot - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This emu oil has worked really well on my hair so far.</li>
            <li>Not thick like this one and dropper</li>
            <li>in about 10 days both areas were completly closed and not ugly anymore.</li>
            <li>My hair has always been fine and limp and just recently it started to look &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>After using Premium Emu Oil for the last week, I&#x27;ve noticed a new shine and life to my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I have seen better results with other brand!!!!!</li>
            <li>I have natural kinky/coily hair, which needs a lot of moisture; it gets dry very easily (especially my ends), which is often a pain.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Product is excellent, it spreads quite far without leaving the skin oily. Used it on my chapped lips and worked great. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Still experimenting with uses, but it does instantly moisturize skin.</li>
            <li> I Couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin after using it.  I am not sure it did as well as coconut oil or grape seed and their cheaper.</li>
            <li> Very good service and follow up information on the product. Great product to reduce inflammation. Has helped my hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer,  tips on usage for skin and hair growth were great.</li>
            <li> i will tell you what this brand of emu oil did for me. ----  i received this on april15th. i had surgery on my hand 2 weeks prior. the incision site of cource was not healed yet, but sutures were removed and an ugly open cut across the entire width of my palm remained, and one across my thumb. i used a drop of this emu oil on both areas and gently rubbed it in about 3 times each day. in about 10 days both areas were completly closed and not ugly anymore. the skin was smooth and so healthy looking. i know i would have healed without this emu oil, but not as fast and not as healthy and smooth looking as it does now. i also have used this on my face, legs and feet since i received it. the texture of my face is so much better.it is smoother ,brighter and the tone is much more even. i don&#x27;t wear makeup so it makes a big difference to me to have even toned skin and just put lipstick on and go. the soles and heels of my feet are softer and smoother. i used it on my husbands arthritic ,painful knee. it did help so he says and he never likes rubs and creams on his knee because &amp;#34;they dont help his pain&amp;#34;. this did. every one is different, our body chemestries are not the same. i am just telling you what it did for me. will be buying lots more . they need to sell a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the best product I have ever bought.  I put it on my shoulder and back for pain and boy does it work. I got my husband to use and he could not believe how quick it took away the pain. don&#x27;t want to be without again.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been fine and limp and just recently it started to look &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.  After using Premium Emu Oil for the last week, I&#x27;ve noticed a new shine and life to my hair.  It now has body and volume.  I wish I would have know about this earlier.  Going to order another bottle for my daughter to use right now!  AMAZING!  Disclaimer: I obtained this item at a discount for my unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my under eye area and after a couple I have seen an increase in skin firmness and a decrease in fine lines.  I am extremely pleased with this product.  A little goes a long way so no need to over do it.  I love that it is odorless.  So many beauty products are overly fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> This product appeared to have restored hair growth in my problem areas. I have recommended this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I like this product on my face except in the T- zone.  I had to stop putting it on my nose because it caused the pores to clog and have break outs.  I am still attempting to heal my nose from the pimples.  Use VERY LITTLE!!  It does not have any odor to it.</li>
            <li> Just wished the made a bigger bottle instead of buying 2-3 of them ... other wise it was great!</li>
            <li> Already reviewed this.  It was not as I expected, the eye dropper did not work, and I lost wasted a lot of product.  Would never order again.  Amazon already knows this.</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky/coily hair, which needs a lot of moisture; it gets dry very easily (especially my ends), which is often a pain. This emu oil has worked really well on my hair so far. First I use a cream moisturizer on my hair, and then I add oil to help seal it in. My hair already feels softer and has stayed moisturized longer than with just the moisturizer. With continued use, I&#x27;m hoping that I won&#x27;t have to deal with extreme dryness anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this oil is that you don&#x27;t need a lot - a little goes a long way. I also love that it comes in a dropper; it is really convenient. I haven&#x27;t tried using this on my skin yet, since I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily - I&#x27;m a bit nervous. If I do, I&#x27;ll come back and update this review with my results!</li>
            <li> Great product! great for scalp &amp; Hair...love it!</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working, My hair is definitely more soft! I&#x27;ve still got a way to go, before I see real growth, but I know my hair needs this oil! I&#x27;ll be ordering another bottle.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it for dry skin daily.</li>
            <li> Lovely.......but, I really want to stay away from products that require harvesting from a DEAD ANIMAL.  Virgin coconut oil is still my default dry skin magic oil.  I wish I understood the science of Ph and such as that.......Emu Oil doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin very well.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that it is absolutely positively free from ANY scent whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend who is very grateful! She has arthritis and has said that this product has helped her with the pain.</li>
            <li> Good in my hair and less in the comb, when I style my hair in the morning and it is not oily. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have ordered emu oil in the past and was concerned with ordering a different brand. This Emu oil is great and very silky. Love this and recommend this great quality product.</li>
            <li> I use it as a facial moisturizer my  it is the best at any price. My husband finds it relieves aches and pain due to old injuries on his knees and back or when working out.  He was skeptical, but now tells me, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t ever run out of this stuff,&amp;#34;  Also excellent on sore hangnails and cuticles because it soothes and medicates without stinging..  Nothing else works like it!</li>
            <li> The other brand is a better product!!! Not thick like this one and dropper you can&#x27;t use that well cause it so thick and you use more and I have seen better results with other brand!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for my skin and scalp. All together a good product with a nice fragrance. It helped against those ugly scabs on my scalp and also helped reduce some skin irritation on my chest.</li>
