            <li>Satisfied with thumbs up.</li>
            <li>Fit my Clarisonic nicely.  </li>
            <li>great discount compared to real Clarisonic brushes.</li>
            <li>My girls love them and now I have a couple of replacements as well.  </li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t ask for anything more...</li>
            <li>and I feel like it is better for my skin.</li>
            <li>these worked just as good as the real deal.</li>
            <li>Seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>They work fine for the price.</li>
            <li>when I use them, BUT they work just fine.</li>
            <li>I threw them away as I didn&#x27;t want to ruin my machine by using cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>I received these brushes a few days ago,and I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li>The brush heads fit well, and they feel like the Clarisonic replacements.</li>
            <li>They fit just like the original</li>
            <li>son likes these, says they&#x27;re a bit softer than the original ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer than the original brush head from Mia 2, after I finish all of them will not buy again.</li>
            <li>I got these brushes as a replacement for my original MIA 2 brush.</li>
            <li>Works as well as original</li>
            <li>They clean your face, but not in the way the deep-pore brushes should.</li>
            <li>They came quickly and neatly packaged.  </li>
            <li>But they were pretty cheap, so there you go.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY like the name brand clarisonic ones!</li>
            <li>Works great in my Mia 2, a little softer than the Clarisonic brand, but doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>They fit my Mia perfectly,and although the brushes were softer than the Clarisonic brushes,they still worked very well</li>
            <li>These fit PERFECTLY and work pretty much exactly like the  (MUCH) more expensive Clarisonic brushes!  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend used to sell Clarisonic products in a department store and she says these are the same or even better quality than the original.</li>
            <li>The brush is softer then the original clarisonic brush, but I actually like it better.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really after a Deep Pore cleansing, you might be better off with the genuine product.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much to the seller!</li>
            <li>times there is a light noise from the replacement oscillating but considering the price, it is worth the occasional sound.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to tell much of a difference between these and the actual clarisonic brushes.</li>
            <li>I can tell these brushes don&#x27;t feel the same as the original once, but it is worth saving my money and still does the job I guess.</li>
            <li>Bristles are softer than what I have used in the past, but for the cost and having four to replace it is a good deal.  </li>
            <li>These are a great alternative to the super expensive brand name brush heads.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I used one and noticed absolutely no difference between it and the more costly brand one.</li>
            <li>These work very well.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>After using one brush, I replaced it with the Clarisonic original that I&#x27;d already used for a few months, and even that old brush achieved better results.</li>
            <li>cheaper than the original and works about the same</li>
            <li>After using it for a few days, however, I decided that I LOVE it VERY much and wanted to get brush heads so that my 2 daughters could use the Mia as well.  </li>
            <li>Comparing to my brush these Deep Cleansing brushes are too soft and clean absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I think they are a little more exfoliant than the brand-named products, which may or may not work for you.</li>
            <li>I have four new ones which work well on my Mia.  </li>
            <li>Practically the exact same as Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t clean as deeply or efficiently as I&#x27;d hoped, and allowed facial anomalies to return.</li>
            <li>The brush heads don&#x27;t fit eactly, so they do slightly &amp;#34;rattle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>A little softer than my first Clarisonic brush head, but much cheaper, and my skin loves it!</li>
            <li>Great way to save money on such an expensive product.</li>
            <li>However, I never noticed my old brushes smelling but this one does.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are far too soft and therefore ineffective.  </li>
            <li>Not like the actual ones from the real company, Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference as soon as I replaced my old brush head.</li>
            <li>works so far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>A little softer brush fiber than the original.</li>
            <li>works very well at deep cleaning and working with my facial cleansers!</li>
            <li>Bristles were obviously much much softer and pliable not nearly as &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; as the real deep pore brush.</li>
            <li>would say these have a similar feel to the Normal Brush Head that comes standard with Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>Priced wayyyy less than the brand name and looks, works and made exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>Beware, though, if you previously used the sensitive brush heads (I have the sensitive version of these, as well) and use your Clarisonic twice a day, this product goes deeper than that brush, so you may have to cut your usage to once a day.</li>
            <li>They do tend to &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; slightly faster than the name brand, but for the price of these, I&#x27;ll live with it!</li>

            <li> Having read previous reviews on generic brush heads (stating they were too soft) I chose the Deep Pore Cleansing model since it is supposed to have stiffer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And the last just as long!!</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;nt buy the original expensive one.</li>
            <li> Too soft and not very good quality.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT as nice as the Clarisonic heads, and each one does not last nearly as long, but if you&#x27;re looking for something inexpensive, this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> After checking out other options here on Amazon and reading that these were a match for my Mia I decided to give them a try.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find only a couple of true Clairsonic brush heads to choose from with prices not much better then the other stores.  </li>
            <li> I was wary of off-brand replacement heads, but the reviews for this particular product was correct.  </li>
            <li> theyve dried.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on clairsonic brushes at $25 a brush.</li>
            <li> Same brush, much less expensive than the manufacturers.  </li>
            <li> These are identical if not better.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy the Clarisonic because the OEM replacement brushes were so costly, but these work just as well and are MUCH less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Bristles not as stiff as the real Clarisonic brushes, and caused my Clarisonic to make this awful noise when I touched it to my face.  </li>
            <li> It came with 2 brushes and was ridiculously expensive.  </li>
            <li> I got these and was somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> Save your money and you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Buy this you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> After pricing them at Sephora, Ulta and QVC, however, I found the price of replacement brushes outrageous</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Same brush, much less expensive than the manufacturers.  I&#x27;ve more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> There is no difference in how these brushes work.  However, I never noticed my old brushes smelling but this one does.  I havent used the others so will update if i noticed that others dont smell once theyve dried.</li>
            <li> These are a great alternative to the super expensive brand name brush heads. Beware, though, if you previously used the sensitive brush heads (I have the sensitive version of these, as well) and use your Clarisonic twice a day, this product goes deeper than that brush, so you may have to cut your usage to once a day. I now use my Sephora pore cleaner in the morning and my Clarisonic at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Seems to work just fine. No problems.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for me!</li>
            <li> Work great and are an amazing value. I almost didn&#x27;t buy the Clarisonic because the OEM replacement brushes were so costly, but these work just as well and are MUCH less expensive.  Love the Clarisonic and the Maeline brushes,</li>
            <li> Bristles not as stiff as the real Clarisonic brushes, and caused my Clarisonic to make this awful noise when I touched it to my face.  I tried all 4 brushes in the pack and they all did that.  I threw them away as I didn&#x27;t want to ruin my machine by using cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> I can tell these brushes don&#x27;t feel the same as the original once, but it is worth saving my money and still does the job I guess. They just feel gentler on the skin, but fit perfectly into the clarisonic device.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY like the name brand clarisonic ones!</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Priced wayyyy less than the brand name and looks, works and made exactly the same.  I&#x27;ll never pay 25 dollars a head again.</li>
            <li> The bristles are far too soft and therefore ineffective.  This brush head is nothing like the Clairsonic brand. I plan on returning and buying the brand name. I was hoping to save some money and get there</li>
            <li> cheaper than the original and works about the same</li>
            <li> I used one and noticed absolutely no difference between it and the more costly brand one.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> As expected. Good product.</li>
            <li> These fit my Clarisonic Mia perfectly! They do tend to &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; slightly faster than the name brand, but for the price of these, I&#x27;ll live with it!</li>
            <li> Perfect alternative to OEM&lt;br /&gt;But these if you want to save lots of money....</li>
            <li> Great product and price</li>
            <li> Get them! Fits my Clarisonic wonderfully. No rattling like some reviewers have reported. Softer than the name-brand brush replacements but still cleans well and costs about 1/5 of the price per brush head than Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> Used this replacement this morning!  They fit just like the original I cannot tell any difference.  Buy this you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> These work great and such a great savings!</li>
            <li> Great value for the money.  A little softer than my first Clarisonic brush head, but much cheaper, and my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> son likes these, says they&#x27;re a bit softer than the original ones.</li>
            <li> Very good product ...will order it again!</li>
            <li> Too soft and not very good quality. Not like the actual ones from the real company, Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; originals. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  Works great in my Mia 2, a little softer than the Clarisonic brand, but doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are great for the Mia 1 for a fraction of the price.  They do have a different feel than the brand-names deep cleansing brushes.  I think they are a little more exfoliant than the brand-named products, which may or may not work for you.</li>
            <li> They work great on my clairisonic. Great price!!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend used to sell Clarisonic products in a department store and she says these are the same or even better quality than the original. Satisfied with thumbs up.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the name brand ones at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on clairsonic brushes at $25 a brush. These are identical if not better. Great way to save money on such an expensive product. And you can replace them as often as you like at this price, which is great for cleanliness.</li>
            <li> Fit my Clarisonic nicely.  Great savings.  I would definitely recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, great discount compared to real Clarisonic brushes.</li>
            <li> They work fine for the price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to the firmness of the Clarisonic brushes and like that texture, then the Maeline version will not satisfy. The product doesn&#x27;t clean as deeply or efficiently as I&#x27;d hoped, and allowed facial anomalies to return. After using one brush, I replaced it with the Clarisonic original that I&#x27;d already used for a few months, and even that old brush achieved better results. If you&#x27;re really after a Deep Pore cleansing, you might be better off with the genuine product.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a Clarisonic Mia 2.  It came with 2 brushes and was ridiculously expensive.  After using it for a few days, however, I decided that I LOVE it VERY much and wanted to get brush heads so that my 2 daughters could use the Mia as well.  After pricing them at Sephora, Ulta and QVC, however, I found the price of replacement brushes outrageous so I thought I&#x27;d check on Amazon.  I was disappointed to find only a couple of true Clairsonic brush heads to choose from with prices not much better then the other stores.  After checking out other options here on Amazon and reading that these were a match for my Mia I decided to give them a try.  So glad I did!  These fit PERFECTLY and work pretty much exactly like the  (MUCH) more expensive Clarisonic brushes!  They came quickly and neatly packaged.  My girls love them and now I have a couple of replacements as well.  I will definitely be buying these again and again.  Great price, great quality.  Thank you so much to the seller!</li>
            <li> Having read previous reviews on generic brush heads (stating they were too soft) I chose the Deep Pore Cleansing model since it is supposed to have stiffer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I would say these have a similar feel to the Normal Brush Head that comes standard with Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;At times there is a light noise from the replacement oscillating but considering the price, it is worth the occasional sound.&lt;br /&gt;This works very well at deep cleaning and working with my facial cleansers!</li>
            <li> Fit clarasonic brushes perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Practically the exact same as Clarisonic. No reason to buy clarisonic ever again.</li>
            <li> Works just the same as the clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes a few days ago,and I&#x27;m very happy with them.They fit my Mia perfectly,and although the brushes were softer than the Clarisonic brushes,they still worked very well and I actually preferred them over the Clarisonic.The price is amazing.They work out to about $5.00 per brush,as opposed to the $30.00 per brush for Clarisonic.I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> These work very well.  Glad I did&#x27;nt buy the original expensive one.</li>
            <li> Way better price than the $25 per head that Clairsonic charges! Works just as well.</li>
            <li> These appear to be identical to the Clarisonic Deep Pore Cleansing brushes. They fit perfectly. Four for $16 versus 1 for $25 can&#x27;t be beat. Shipping was extremely fast as well.</li>
            <li> Best value for these brush heads that I&#x27;ve seen so far. Quality is great and they fit my Clarisonic Mia perfectly! Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased these. They fit on the Mia perfectly, and work as well as the name brand. I will continue to use these</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer than the original brush head from Mia 2, after I finish all of them will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to tell much of a difference between these and the actual clarisonic brushes.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my Clarisonic. I noticed a difference as soon as I replaced my old brush head.</li>
            <li> These work for Clarsonic</li>
            <li> I was wary of off-brand replacement heads, but the reviews for this particular product was correct.  The brush heads fit well, and they feel like the Clarisonic replacements.</li>
            <li> I have been getting &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; Clarisonic brushes for a while now because of the price difference. I got these and was somewhat disappointed. They clean your face, but not in the way the deep-pore brushes should. But they were pretty cheap, so there you go.</li>
            <li> Fits great, great price</li>
            <li> Bought for Mia 2 - I prefer these heads vs the over priced ones from Ulta.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these!  They fit my Clarisonic perfectly and do the job well. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great price for great product!</li>
            <li> Good fit on the clairsonic. A little softer brush fiber than the original. But I like that.</li>
            <li> works so far. can&#x27;t ask for anything more...great buy</li>
            <li> These are great! Just like the clarisonic, but way cheaper. At these prices I can actually replace my brushes as often as I want.</li>
            <li> Cant complain, this set is cheap and the brushes are even better than the ones the device comes with! Very satisfied, glad that I have purchased</li>
            <li> I got these brushes as a replacement for my original MIA 2 brush. Comparing to my brush these Deep Cleansing brushes are too soft and clean absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> These are gray alternatives to brand replacements. And the last just as long!! Save your money and you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bristles were obviously much much softer and pliable not nearly as &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; as the real deep pore brush. Not the same.</li>
            <li> They work just fine and are a great value for the price...</li>
            <li> these worked just as good as the real deal. the brushes seem to be well built, and it goes on with ease.  if this review is helpful, hit the button.</li>
            <li> Bristles are softer than what I have used in the past, but for the cost and having four to replace it is a good deal.  I can not justify paying $2o plus to Clarisonic for a brush head.  I have four new ones which work well on my Mia.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT as nice as the Clarisonic heads, and each one does not last nearly as long, but if you&#x27;re looking for something inexpensive, this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> The brush heads don&#x27;t fit eactly, so they do slightly &amp;#34;rattle&amp;#34; when I use them, BUT they work just fine. I will order them again!!</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. The brush is softer then the original clarisonic brush, but I actually like it better. I have sensitive skin and I feel like it is better for my skin. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Works as well as original</li>
