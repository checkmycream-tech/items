            <li>so this is the best I can get!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>300 also isn&#x27;t the best sample size</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something cushy on the end, this will not be it.    </li>
            <li>Best to check the thickness of the swab&#x27;s ends before using them for health applications; otherwise, a great value.</li>
            <li>The product was great and the price was excellent</li>
            <li>good product for a good price !!!</li>
            <li>I was greatly relieved to discover that Amazon was a source of these \\&quot;old-fashiioned\\&quot; Q Tips.  </li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>They are a great product, work great</li>
            <li>But if you know what your doing, these wood stick brand is a great buy for the pricy cost wood brands go for.</li>
            <li>By the way, used wood Q-tips (with ear-wax) are great to toss in with kindling as fire starters..</li>
            <li>No comparison with flexible sticks: much more control: the best!</li>
            <li>us MORE and add more Cotton!!!</li>
            <li>This is a good item and plenty of cotton on the tips.</li>
            <li>Oh yes, a fair price too.  </li>
            <li>You know they are good because they are &amp;#34;Royal&amp;#34; after all.  </li>
            <li>I have it on good authority that the Queen herself has these on her bathroom sink and her minions have no problem digging Royal Ear Boogers out with em&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all their a good alternative.</li>
            <li>These were surprising.  </li>
            <li>these are the best of whats currently available.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the name brand</li>
            <li>Not the best replacement for the original Q-Tips brand, but it will do.</li>
            <li>These are for people who like only the best of the best.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the wood stick swabs.</li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>I love that there is no plastic in these!  </li>
            <li>Happy you have it available as it is not in my area.</li>
            <li>A nice  cotton swab that will not bend out of shape when I use it.</li>
            <li>I know, you&#x27;re not supposed to put them in your ears, but it sure feels good and gets the wax out.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a nice cotton padded tip</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find them for her!</li>
            <li>Good for make up, not the most comfortable for ear cleaning.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t agree with the \\&quot;Highlander\\&quot; more.  </li>
            <li>I really love this deal.  </li>
            <li>Most cotton swabs nowadays &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The price was OK, and the package arrived on time and with no damage.    </li>
            <li>I love these Cotton Swabs because they never break.</li>
            <li>The wood stick is so much better than the bendy cardboard, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!    </li>
            <li>glad someone is still selling them    </li>
            <li>I use them for personal hygiene and they&#x27;re wonderful</li>
            <li>I LOVE USING STICK COTTON SWABS</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM</li>
            <li>The U.S. Cotton ones from Vermont Country store are better in my mind.  </li>
            <li>Q-tips are much more stronger but these wood stick brand is even better.</li>
            <li>All in all, though, this is still my favorite cotton swab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>This is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find them in the stores any more.  </li>
            <li>These are so much better than the flimsy cardboard ones that are aparently designed for babies or something.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for making this product available!</li>
            <li>These are just ok.  </li>
            <li>They do have the most cotton I have found on the tips.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m ok with this B-grade product.  </li>
            <li>She likes the wooden stick swabs best.  </li>
            <li>Q-Tips wood stick swabs, but since you cannot get those on Amazon anymore these are an OK</li>
            <li>Wood allows for more pressure that paper.</li>
            <li>Simply the best cotton swabs in the market.  </li>
            <li>Nice sturdy swabs,[...] suitable for an adult with good sense not to jab these in their ears.  </li>
            <li>but if you think name brand Q-Tips are light on cotton or you wish they had more cotton</li>
            <li>I read somewhere in a review that the wood shanks broke easily.  </li>
            <li>They almost all break easily with the lightest of pressure.</li>
            <li>The stick part broke easily.</li>
            <li>Also better than swabs that bend out of shape when trying to clean dogs ears.</li>
            <li>These break easily and the cotton on the swabs comes off easily also.  </li>
            <li>The wood breaks to easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are strong and the tip doesn&#x27;t just disintegrate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cotton tips are fine.</li>
            <li>Royal, however, makes a fine wood stick cotton swab.  </li>
            <li>Nice large container.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t bring myself to pay huge money for the originals on ebay.</li>
            <li>HOW CHEAP THEY ARE ADVERTISED.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just happy to finally find wood cottton swabs again.  </li>
            <li>If you feel the same, you will be happy with the Royal swabs, because they have a generous amount of cotton on the tips.  </li>
            <li>Work great, they don&#x27;t bend in the middle or come apart like the paper ones that I buy at the drug storel</li>
            <li>I always buy Q-tips as the plastic stick brands are so cheap that they bend every time I use them.</li>
            <li>All the brands available (imho)</li>
            <li>But they have good cotton on the ends, like the old Q-tips.  </li>
            <li>The size of the cotton swabs is perfect for what I have been using it for, which is mainly craft related.</li>
            <li>These knockoffs function as I have found nothing better, but the sticks break easily and at times the cotton comes off the stick and stays in the ear which never happened with a real Q-tips</li>
            <li>I am a man and the swabs that just bend over don&#x27;t allow me to really clean the outer rim of my ear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They allow me to really clean my ear</li>
            <li>Everything as advertised and better than some other brands, but still not quite as good as original &amp;#34;Q Tips&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>These do the job, the shaft doesn&#x27;t break easily and they are priced right</li>
            <li>Hard to find wood stick cotton swabs at the stores, so these suit my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li>Wooden sticks are not so good</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, and the product I needed, thats what gives this four stars.</li>
            <li>Those were of consistent quality with thick sticks and plenty of cotton, and excellent quality control.</li>
            <li>they are useful for a LOT of things, including cleaning out your ear tubes.</li>
            <li>so I can keep getting a fresh one.  </li>
            <li>it is far better than&lt;</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a fresh box of these wood stick swabs.</li>
            <li>Very nice and firm</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s hard to go back to paper shaft or plastic shaft cotton swabs after one has experienced the really &amp;#34;firm control&amp;#34; of good quality wood</li>
            <li>I ordered these cotton swabs because, like many people, I prefer the stiffness of the wood stick over the rolled paper sticks used now by the major brands.  </li>
            <li>These are a decent alternative to the original.</li>
            <li>Wooden Cotton Swabs are so far superior than the flexible ones.</li>
            <li>At least they&#x27;re cheap, so you can keep on breaking them until you get a good one.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The purpose of the wooden stick in any cotton swab is to provide a stronger and more stable unit that won&#x27;t bend when you use it.</li>
            <li>These sort of do the job, but the wooden sticks are thinner and more bendable than the originals.</li>
            <li>A real &amp;#34;Q-tips&amp;#34; box of 125 safety swabs wood sticks, appears to have part number of 036364 are far superior to these Royal (Chinese) Wood Sticks.</li>
            <li>The wood stick is nice but the amount of cotton minimal.  </li>
            <li>This morning I finished my first box of 300 swabs and wanted to mention a couple things about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No company makes these for love of the human ear.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure they would be great for other beauty purposes (i.e. nail painting/art, cleaning tight spots, crafts, etc...)</li>
            <li>They are a little flimsy and break easily, but are better than nothing.</li>
            <li>not at all like the old Q-tips!!!!</li>
            <li>My whole family prefers the wood stick and so many of the so-called name brands only make wimpy cotton ones.</li>
            <li>I remember the old Q-tips brand of cotton swab, the kind that came on a wooden stick....</li>
            <li>The paper stick on regular cotton swabs have gotten weaker over the years and bend so easily with the slightest pressure.  </li>
            <li>The product is fine and unavailable locally.</li>
            <li>80% or so of the sticks are pretty decent, which floats my boat</li>
            <li>I too was a huge fan of the Q-Tip brand Wooden Stick Cotton Swab.  </li>
            <li>A cotton swab that has a very sturdy stick.  </li>
            <li>if you use much force</li>
            <li>These are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I really miss them.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to using Q-Tips, you&#x27;ll like this product just as much</li>
            <li>and it costs much less.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>Inexpensive Cotton swabs use a flimsy plastic stick; NOT ENVIROMENTALLY FRIENDLY and NOT SOLID.</li>
            <li>Made in China, the manufacturer has achieved a new low in cheap products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the swabs are shorter than a normal cotton swab, so you won&#x27;t have much reach with them.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t confident that they would do the job, as some that I had found previously, were skimpy with the cotton.  </li>
            <li>But the more important issue is the extremely poor quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Shipping is a bit high</li>
            <li>Its just a cotton swab, but its a high quality cotton swab.</li>
            <li>Out of 300 swabs I had exactly 12 break in half while using them to clean my ears.  </li>
            <li>They used to be made better - now they always break and some of them the wood is not smooth.</li>
            <li>&amp; you can easily toss them in with your compost pile to break down.  </li>
            <li>I found a new brand, for me, named Royal.  </li>
            <li>Well, I ordered an new supply.</li>
            <li>NO wood stick cotton swabs of the standard 3&amp;#34; or so length, that are available on the market today,  are anywhere near as good as the old Q-tips brand that were sadly discontinued a decade ago or so.</li>
            <li>With light use, several will break, which means I probably throw away 2-3 q-tips for every one I can actually use.</li>
            <li>First Q-Tips stopped making the wood shanks, then CVS stopped selling their wooden q-tips.  </li>
            <li>I went back to using name brand Q-Tips for the first time in months.  </li>
            <li>being said, overall they work pretty well, but the quality is not on par with the name brand Q-Tip version.</li>
            <li>I really liked the wooden ones I used to get from CVS, but they are no more.</li>
            <li>The shafts are inconsistent as to thickness, and wood grain direction, so yes, a certain amount of them break, generally in the middle, usually at first flex, and it&#x27;s not a big deal, they don&#x27;t get stuck in your ear or anything.</li>
            <li>Well, the Q-Tips were the best, too bad the 20 boxes that I ordered when they were still being made didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>It really does look like the manufacturer had a lot of left over toothpicks</li>
            <li>/&gt;A high-quality, non-bendable, natural cotton Q-tip.</li>
            <li>Soft Q-tips tend to bend and hurt my ears.  </li>
            <li>I am still looking for a replacement for the old Q-tips that had plenty of cotton on them.  </li>
            <li>I do worry about the cotton sometimes, as to how much bleach, chemicals etc was used in the processing of the cotton, whether it was washed out properly (wherever it is they make these), and the degree of sterility one assumes they have.</li>
            <li>if it doesn&#x27;t gross you out too much to keep a baggieor jar of them till winter.</li>
            <li>really would like to find wooden q-tips than match the quality that Q-tip brand had.</li>
            <li>If you miss the Q-tip wooden version (long gone) you will love these, a bit less cotton than real Q-tips but get the job done well</li>
            <li>I have easily snapped this stick with very little pressure each time I used one.</li>
            <li>If you have to clean anything in a tight space, I recommend these.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of pressure when I clean my ears but be careful not to push deep inside.</li>
            <li>The cotton is not as soft and the wood sticks are very inconsistent and splinter easily.&lt;br /&gt;Going back to regular old q-tips.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re like me and you appreciate a strong wooden stick for firm control then I would not recommend these.</li>
            <li>It is impossible to find wood cotton swabs at the store anymore, so I was happy to find an alternative on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They are as expected, a little thin on the cotton but not bad, the real plus is the hard to find wood stem which are much better than the paper stems that bend too easily.</li>
            <li>The low cotton volume means harsh swabbing when using to clean the ear canal.</li>
            <li>Back ordered merchandise should be clearly explained.</li>
            <li>I know someone who uses these all of the time (I just order them) - and has had them break off in his ears frequently - and has needed to go to a doctor multiple times to have the broke piece removed.  </li>
            <li>The wood looks a little rough, but they hold up just fine.  </li>
            <li>Ironic that over half of them break with the lightest touch.</li>
            <li>THE STICKS ARE SO THIN THAT THEY BREAK EASILY</li>
            <li>The sticks are thin and break easy..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Wood allows for more pressure that paper.</li>
            <li> Simply the best cotton swabs in the market.  </li>
            <li> Nice sturdy swabs,[...] suitable for an adult with good sense not to jab these in their ears.  </li>
            <li> but if you think name brand Q-Tips are light on cotton or you wish they had more cotton</li>
            <li> I read somewhere in a review that the wood shanks broke easily.  </li>
            <li> They almost all break easily with the lightest of pressure.</li>
            <li> The stick part broke easily.</li>
            <li> Also better than swabs that bend out of shape when trying to clean dogs ears.</li>
            <li> These break easily and the cotton on the swabs comes off easily also.  </li>
            <li> The wood breaks to easily</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are strong and the tip doesn&#x27;t just disintegrate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cotton tips are fine.</li>
            <li> Royal, however, makes a fine wood stick cotton swab.  </li>
            <li> Nice large container.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t bring myself to pay huge money for the originals on ebay.</li>
            <li> HOW CHEAP THEY ARE ADVERTISED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just happy to finally find wood cottton swabs again.  </li>
            <li> If you feel the same, you will be happy with the Royal swabs, because they have a generous amount of cotton on the tips.  </li>
            <li> Work great, they don&#x27;t bend in the middle or come apart like the paper ones that I buy at the drug storel</li>
            <li> I always buy Q-tips as the plastic stick brands are so cheap that they bend every time I use them.</li>
            <li> All the brands available (imho)</li>
            <li> But they have good cotton on the ends, like the old Q-tips.  </li>
            <li> The size of the cotton swabs is perfect for what I have been using it for, which is mainly craft related.</li>
            <li> These knockoffs function as I have found nothing better, but the sticks break easily and at times the cotton comes off the stick and stays in the ear which never happened with a real Q-tips</li>
            <li> I am a man and the swabs that just bend over don&#x27;t allow me to really clean the outer rim of my ear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They allow me to really clean my ear</li>
            <li> Everything as advertised and better than some other brands, but still not quite as good as original &amp;#34;Q Tips&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These do the job, the shaft doesn&#x27;t break easily and they are priced right</li>
            <li> Hard to find wood stick cotton swabs at the stores, so these suit my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> Wooden sticks are not so good</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, and the product I needed, thats what gives this four stars.</li>
            <li> Those were of consistent quality with thick sticks and plenty of cotton, and excellent quality control.</li>
            <li> they are useful for a LOT of things, including cleaning out your ear tubes.</li>
            <li> so I can keep getting a fresh one.  </li>
            <li> it is far better than&lt;</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a fresh box of these wood stick swabs.</li>
            <li> Very nice and firm</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s hard to go back to paper shaft or plastic shaft cotton swabs after one has experienced the really &amp;#34;firm control&amp;#34; of good quality wood</li>
            <li> I ordered these cotton swabs because, like many people, I prefer the stiffness of the wood stick over the rolled paper sticks used now by the major brands.  </li>
            <li> These are a decent alternative to the original.</li>
            <li> Wooden Cotton Swabs are so far superior than the flexible ones.</li>
            <li> At least they&#x27;re cheap, so you can keep on breaking them until you get a good one.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> The purpose of the wooden stick in any cotton swab is to provide a stronger and more stable unit that won&#x27;t bend when you use it.</li>
            <li> These sort of do the job, but the wooden sticks are thinner and more bendable than the originals.</li>
            <li> A real &amp;#34;Q-tips&amp;#34; box of 125 safety swabs wood sticks, appears to have part number of 036364 are far superior to these Royal (Chinese) Wood Sticks.</li>
            <li> The wood stick is nice but the amount of cotton minimal.  </li>
            <li> This morning I finished my first box of 300 swabs and wanted to mention a couple things about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No company makes these for love of the human ear.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure they would be great for other beauty purposes (i.e. nail painting/art, cleaning tight spots, crafts, etc...)</li>
            <li> They are a little flimsy and break easily, but are better than nothing.</li>
            <li> not at all like the old Q-tips!!!!</li>
            <li> My whole family prefers the wood stick and so many of the so-called name brands only make wimpy cotton ones.</li>
            <li> I remember the old Q-tips brand of cotton swab, the kind that came on a wooden stick....</li>
            <li> The paper stick on regular cotton swabs have gotten weaker over the years and bend so easily with the slightest pressure.  </li>
            <li> The product is fine and unavailable locally.</li>
            <li> 80% or so of the sticks are pretty decent, which floats my boat</li>
            <li> I too was a huge fan of the Q-Tip brand Wooden Stick Cotton Swab.  </li>
            <li> A cotton swab that has a very sturdy stick.  </li>
            <li> if you use much force</li>
            <li> These are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I really miss them.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to using Q-Tips, you&#x27;ll like this product just as much</li>
            <li> and it costs much less.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> Inexpensive Cotton swabs use a flimsy plastic stick; NOT ENVIROMENTALLY FRIENDLY and NOT SOLID.</li>
            <li> Made in China, the manufacturer has achieved a new low in cheap products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the swabs are shorter than a normal cotton swab, so you won&#x27;t have much reach with them.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t confident that they would do the job, as some that I had found previously, were skimpy with the cotton.  </li>
            <li> But the more important issue is the extremely poor quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Shipping is a bit high</li>
            <li> Its just a cotton swab, but its a high quality cotton swab.</li>
            <li> Out of 300 swabs I had exactly 12 break in half while using them to clean my ears.  </li>
            <li> They used to be made better - now they always break and some of them the wood is not smooth.</li>
            <li> &amp; you can easily toss them in with your compost pile to break down.  </li>
            <li> I found a new brand, for me, named Royal.  </li>
            <li> Well, I ordered an new supply.</li>
            <li> NO wood stick cotton swabs of the standard 3&amp;#34; or so length, that are available on the market today,  are anywhere near as good as the old Q-tips brand that were sadly discontinued a decade ago or so.</li>
            <li> With light use, several will break, which means I probably throw away 2-3 q-tips for every one I can actually use.</li>
            <li> First Q-Tips stopped making the wood shanks, then CVS stopped selling their wooden q-tips.  </li>
            <li> I went back to using name brand Q-Tips for the first time in months.  </li>
            <li> being said, overall they work pretty well, but the quality is not on par with the name brand Q-Tip version.</li>
            <li> I really liked the wooden ones I used to get from CVS, but they are no more.</li>
            <li> The shafts are inconsistent as to thickness, and wood grain direction, so yes, a certain amount of them break, generally in the middle, usually at first flex, and it&#x27;s not a big deal, they don&#x27;t get stuck in your ear or anything.</li>
            <li> Well, the Q-Tips were the best, too bad the 20 boxes that I ordered when they were still being made didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> It really does look like the manufacturer had a lot of left over toothpicks</li>
            <li> /&gt;A high-quality, non-bendable, natural cotton Q-tip.</li>
            <li> Soft Q-tips tend to bend and hurt my ears.  </li>
            <li> I am still looking for a replacement for the old Q-tips that had plenty of cotton on them.  </li>
            <li> I do worry about the cotton sometimes, as to how much bleach, chemicals etc was used in the processing of the cotton, whether it was washed out properly (wherever it is they make these), and the degree of sterility one assumes they have.</li>
            <li> if it doesn&#x27;t gross you out too much to keep a baggieor jar of them till winter.</li>
            <li> really would like to find wooden q-tips than match the quality that Q-tip brand had.</li>
            <li> If you miss the Q-tip wooden version (long gone) you will love these, a bit less cotton than real Q-tips but get the job done well</li>
            <li> I have easily snapped this stick with very little pressure each time I used one.</li>
            <li> If you have to clean anything in a tight space, I recommend these.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of pressure when I clean my ears but be careful not to push deep inside.</li>
            <li> The cotton is not as soft and the wood sticks are very inconsistent and splinter easily.&lt;br /&gt;Going back to regular old q-tips.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re like me and you appreciate a strong wooden stick for firm control then I would not recommend these.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to find wood cotton swabs at the store anymore, so I was happy to find an alternative on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They are as expected, a little thin on the cotton but not bad, the real plus is the hard to find wood stem which are much better than the paper stems that bend too easily.</li>
            <li> The low cotton volume means harsh swabbing when using to clean the ear canal.</li>
            <li> Back ordered merchandise should be clearly explained.</li>
            <li> I know someone who uses these all of the time (I just order them) - and has had them break off in his ears frequently - and has needed to go to a doctor multiple times to have the broke piece removed.  </li>
            <li> The wood looks a little rough, but they hold up just fine.  </li>
            <li> Ironic that over half of them break with the lightest touch.</li>
            <li> THE STICKS ARE SO THIN THAT THEY BREAK EASILY</li>
            <li> The sticks are thin and break easy..</li>
            <li> The wood has split a few times but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> Wood stick swabs are getting hard to find and the paper sticks are not tough enough for what I need to do.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get it, because the inner ear is so delicate, you can cause damage with a cardboard stick Q-tip if you do&#x27;t know how to handle one.</li>
            <li> when using them you will want to be careful that you don&#x27;t snap a smaller portion of the swab off such that it can fall into your ear.  </li>
            <li> The cotton tips have barely any cotton on them, way less than you find on American Q Tips.</li>
            <li> However the wood itself is not high quality and sometimes when enough pressure is applied, they snap and break.</li>
            <li> The wood is very thin and breaks too easily.</li>
            <li> They have enough cotton to not let the shaft break through and scratch or cut your ear, probably about 2/3 of what Q-tips had, but enough to do the job in pretty deep without being scary.</li>
            <li> I typically pinch the cotton on one end of the swab with my thumb and middle finger and then use my index finger to apply pressure to the middle of the stick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are NOT strong like the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;the wood quality is shotty quality</li>
            <li> Just filling the little niche left when Q-tips decided there was not enough profit in this product.  </li>
            <li> Although there are a few swabs in my package with splintered or cracked or otherwise defective swabs, I still prefer these stiffer wooden ones and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered just a single pack to try.  </li>
            <li> Depending on what you are using them for, having it snap in half while using could be potentially dangerous.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A double ended cotton swab with a wooden stick is so hard to find these days that I am ecstatic to find these.</li>
            <li> Some sticks even have ZERO cotton on an end, only a few strands.</li>
            <li> tip not very padded.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no comparison.  </li>
            <li> All current brands have this issue.. with these, you can tell when you get a thinnish one.. and relatively few break.</li>
            <li> The sticks have gotten thinner and thinner, and wood quality has gotten poorer and poorer over the last few years.</li>
            <li> The wooden sticks themselves are thinner than a tooth pick and completely irregular, some breaking off when using, others coming out of the box already broken.</li>
            <li> It is less than half the diameter of other wooden swabs I have used.</li>
            <li> They are entirely too small in length.</li>
            <li> Yes, I read the other reviews</li>
            <li> That being said, I tried all the other brands I could find and</li>
            <li> About 9 dollars a box, ridiculous, but cheaper than the long wood stick individually wrapped ones I&#x27;ve been getting at Walmart and are now priced out.</li>
            <li> Since they were discontinued I have tried almost every imitation brand I have found.  </li>
            <li> I need the wood sticks, they break very easily, not sturdy enough.</li>
            <li> I can hardly buy wood stick swabs locally.</li>
            <li> The plastic ones that replaced them many years ago certainly will prevent damage to babies&#x27; ear canals as opposed to wood Q Tips being used stupidly; but they are useless to collect wax from adults&#x27; ears, as they bend before one can apply sufficient pressure to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely NOT worth buying,</li>
            <li> Sticks are thinner than what I&#x27;m used to, but breakage seems about average.</li>
            <li> There is a very small amount of cotton on each end, and you can get poked or scratched with the end of the wooden stick through the cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, they have broken, causing a little discomfort, but less discomfort than the soft ones.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, these wood sticks have an inherent weakness when compared to rolled paper sticks: wood can snap in half where paper just bends.  </li>
            <li> biggest complaint is that there are occasional ones that are broken or cracked and mid swipe on your ear</li>
            <li> The Royal Wood Stick Cotton Swabs are a little thinner and shorter with less cotton on the end than the discontinued Q-Tips brand, but beggars can&#x27;t be choosers.  </li>
            <li> The cotton is a little skimpy.  </li>
            <li> There is so little cotton on the end that they hurt, I wouldn&#x27;t use them in my ears or to apply makeup for fear of scratching myself.</li>
            <li> Also a little stingy with the cotton on the tips.</li>
            <li> The link above is for two boxes of 300 each swabs, quite a few, but less expensive than a single box of 300.  </li>
            <li> Wooden sticks are very hard to think,  </li>
            <li> Finally I got tired of the rolled paper q-tips bending and looked on here.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would say poor quality.  </li>
            <li> These are firm and won&#x27;t bend, so work well for crafts.</li>
            <li> Wood sticks are said to be for firm control.</li>
            <li> suppose you could really harm yourself with this wooden stick if you are an idiot</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;I would go back to my old brand.</li>
            <li> they have wood sticks but VERY LITTLE cotton on the end of them</li>
            <li> Not much better than plastic sticks.  </li>
            <li> This makes them useless for craft projects (such as blending pencil leads in graphite or colored pencils).  </li>
            <li> This has become a required replacement for the usual cotton swabs that never hold up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works well for cleaning and detailing small areas.</li>
            <li> Too small  they almost get lost in your ear.  </li>
            <li> The cotton swabs were very hard and overall poor quality.</li>
            <li> The wooden stick is very thin.</li>
            <li> Some of these q-tips are very thin with little cotton on the tips and sone of the wooden stems are so thin they crack</li>
            <li> at least half of those felt weak when I picked them up</li>
            <li> They are about the same as the new Q-tips, that are terrible.  </li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to find wood sticks like these?</li>
            <li> And, don&#x27;t expect to do anything delicate with these swabs.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint is that the cotton is not always even</li>
            <li> I mean, hey-</li>
            <li> 12 out of 300 means there was a 4% failure rate and</li>
            <li> Sticks are thin and flimsy, not sure they&#x27;re all wood or a mix of wood and cardboard.  </li>
            <li> cotton parts at the end use very small amounts ....</li>
            <li> I opened the box the product had opened in shipment and spilled all over the floor and was totally wasted and useless as it is no longer sterile - so I had to throw them all out and obtain them from another store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using cotton swabs can be dangerous, so be careful when using these.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the contrast between the wooden stick of these swabs and the rolled paper stick used on the Q-Tip!  </li>
            <li> They are skinny and weak.</li>
            <li> so I could have avoided some of the breakages just by throwing away the obviously weak</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 30 - 40 of them up to now, none have broken on me.</li>
            <li> wood stems are as thin as toothpicks and just snap.....</li>
            <li> Manufacturer poor quality and durability.</li>
            <li> Wood is too thin, and does not give a sturdy feel when using it.</li>
            <li> By far one of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever reviewed.</li>
            <li> This product fails measurably at that task.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found it difficult to find wood sticks comparable to the ones that used to be sold as Q-tips.</li>
            <li> Expensive for q tips.</li>
            <li> If you like to feel like you&#x27;re firmly pressing against the inside of your ear when cleaning them the rolled paper stick of a Q-Tip is worthless compared to these wood sticks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t think a 4% failure rate is that bad</li>
            <li> The product was what i expected, the shipping prices were outrageous.</li>
            <li> are too expensive, with the cheapest ones being really worthless and dangerous.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.  </li>
            <li> you will be disappointed in these Royal</li>
            <li> I just hated the flimbsy paper and plastic sticks now sold by</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Everything as advertised and better than some other brands, but still not quite as good as original &amp;#34;Q Tips&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  A cotton swab that has a very sturdy stick.  This is a good item and plenty of cotton on the tips.</li>
            <li> They are entirely too small in length.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t agree with the \\&quot;Highlander\\&quot; more.  First Q-Tips stopped making the wood shanks, then CVS stopped selling their wooden q-tips.  Finally I got tired of the rolled paper q-tips bending and looked on here.  Shipping is a bit high but I counter that by buying 2 boxes of 300.  I read somewhere in a review that the wood shanks broke easily.  I&#x27;ve used 30 - 40 of them up to now, none have broken on me.</li>
            <li> 20% of them break when you use them...</li>
            <li> Bought as an alternative to Swisspers Wood Swabs....broke 2 of these in my ear this morning....wood stems are as thin as toothpicks and just snap.....the only 2 I used from the box of 300 I received yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;This product is unsafe....DO NOT EVEN THINK OF PURCHASING !!&lt;br /&gt;ABSOLUTE JUNK.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this product is the wooden sticks.  They are skinny and weak. They almost all break easily with the lightest of pressure. Overall, I would say poor quality.  The cotton tips are fine.</li>
            <li> Hard to find wood stick cotton swabs at the stores, so these suit my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> The purpose of the wooden stick in any cotton swab is to provide a stronger and more stable unit that won&#x27;t bend when you use it. Otherwise, you can just use the ones made with rolled paper sticks that they sell in any drug store. This product fails measurably at that task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the swabs are shorter than a normal cotton swab, so you won&#x27;t have much reach with them. But the more important issue is the extremely poor quality of this product. The wooden stick is very thin. It is less than half the diameter of other wooden swabs I have used. I have easily snapped this stick with very little pressure each time I used one. And, don&#x27;t expect to do anything delicate with these swabs. There is a very small amount of cotton on each end, and you can get poked or scratched with the end of the wooden stick through the cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It really does look like the manufacturer had a lot of left over toothpicks and they just wrapped a couple strands of cotton on each end. I cannot recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Sticks are thin and flimsy, not sure they&#x27;re all wood or a mix of wood and cardboard.  Not much better than plastic sticks.  I should have ordered just a single pack to try.  Costly lesson.</li>
            <li> I was greatly relieved to discover that Amazon was a source of these \\&quot;old-fashiioned\\&quot; Q Tips.  The plastic ones that replaced them many years ago certainly will prevent damage to babies&#x27; ear canals as opposed to wood Q Tips being used stupidly; but they are useless to collect wax from adults&#x27; ears, as they bend before one can apply sufficient pressure to do the job.  I assume that the manufacturers save production costs by making these of plastic versus wood, so they jump gleefully on the bandwagon of political correctness.  It&#x27;s such a shame that money governs every human endeavour in today&#x27;s world.  There was a time when retailers felt an obligation to supply all functional needs, regardless of profitability.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, and the product I needed, thats what gives this four stars. However the wood itself is not high quality and sometimes when enough pressure is applied, they snap and break. But you cant get these off the shelf in the USA so this is the best I can get!</li>
            <li> I really love this deal.  My whole family prefers the wood stick and so many of the so-called name brands only make wimpy cotton ones.</li>
            <li> The cotton swabs were very hard and overall poor quality. The stick part broke easily. Manufacturer poor quality and durability. I threw them away.</li>
            <li> Most cotton swabs nowadays &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; when you apply pressure.  This makes them useless for craft projects (such as blending pencil leads in graphite or colored pencils).  These are firm and won&#x27;t bend, so work well for crafts.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy swabs,[...] suitable for an adult with good sense not to jab these in their ears.  The cotton is a little skimpy.  If you&#x27;re looking for something cushy on the end, this will not be it.    The price was OK, and the package arrived on time and with no damage.    The link above is for two boxes of 300 each swabs, quite a few, but less expensive than a single box of 300.  Go figure!?</li>
            <li> The item was shipped with its packaging \\&quot;undone\\&quot; by Toys-Go-Round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box the product had opened in shipment and spilled all over the floor and was totally wasted and useless as it is no longer sterile - so I had to throw them all out and obtain them from another store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy from this seller again and recommend that you avoid this seller at all costs.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted. A nice  cotton swab that will not bend out of shape when I use it. The wood has split a few times but I can live with that. The size of the cotton swabs is perfect for what I have been using it for, which is mainly craft related. If I do manage to run out I will buy them again. Also better than swabs that bend out of shape when trying to clean dogs ears.</li>
            <li> No comparison with flexible sticks: much more control: the best!</li>
            <li> I love these Cotton Swabs because they never break. Wooden Cotton Swabs are so far superior than the flexible ones.</li>
            <li> By far one of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever reviewed. Made in China, the manufacturer has achieved a new low in cheap products. The cotton tips have barely any cotton on them, way less than you find on American Q Tips. Some sticks even have ZERO cotton on an end, only a few strands. The low cotton volume means harsh swabbing when using to clean the ear canal. The wooden sticks themselves are thinner than a tooth pick and completely irregular, some breaking off when using, others coming out of the box already broken. Absolutely NOT worth buying, NO MATTER HOW CHEAP THEY ARE ADVERTISED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just happy to finally find wood cottton swabs again.  They are a little flimsy and break easily, but are better than nothing.</li>
            <li> These are great. The wood stick is so much better than the bendy cardboard, in my opinion.  Nice large container.</li>
            <li> My father said that they stopped carrying wooden sticks in the pharmacy stores.  I had to find them for him online</li>
            <li> I remember the old Q-tips brand of cotton swab, the kind that came on a wooden stick.... they are useful for a LOT of things, including cleaning out your ear tubes. Inexpensive Cotton swabs use a flimsy plastic stick; NOT ENVIROMENTALLY FRIENDLY and NOT SOLID. Its just a cotton swab, but its a high quality cotton swab.</li>
            <li> I am a man and the swabs that just bend over don&#x27;t allow me to really clean the outer rim of my ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THESE ARE AWESOME&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&lt;br /&gt;They allow me to really clean my ear&lt;br /&gt;They are strong and the tip doesn&#x27;t just disintegrate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&lt;br /&gt;I suppose you could really harm yourself with this wooden stick if you are an idiot</li>
            <li> I have found it difficult to find wood sticks comparable to the ones that used to be sold as Q-tips. These sort of do the job, but the wooden sticks are thinner and more bendable than the originals.</li>
            <li> I had been looking everywhere for wood stick swabs without any luck.  Then realised I hadn&#x27;t looked on Amazon.  I found a new brand, for me, named Royal.  I wasn&#x27;t confident that they would do the job, as some that I had found previously, were skimpy with the cotton.  Royal, however, makes a fine wood stick cotton swab.  I just hated the flimbsy paper and plastic sticks now sold by J&amp;J.  How about you?  If you feel the same, you will be happy with the Royal swabs, because they have a generous amount of cotton on the tips.  Oh yes, a fair price too.  Enjoy!    The Highlander</li>
            <li> Work great, they don&#x27;t bend in the middle or come apart like the paper ones that I buy at the drug storel</li>
            <li> Not the best replacement for the original Q-Tips brand, but it will do.</li>
            <li> They just work, no bending. This has become a required replacement for the usual cotton swabs that never hold up.</li>
            <li> i always buy the wooden ones although they are not recommended.  with these, the sticks often snap and they also leave the cotton swab in your ear.  will never purchase these again.</li>
            <li> The product was what i expected, the shipping prices were outrageous. I will be looking elsewhere for my next purchase.  Thank you</li>
            <li> glad someone is still selling them    the plastic variety do not hold up</li>
            <li> Wood sticks are said to be for firm control. Ironic that over half of them break with the lightest touch. They must select the wood grain purposely so that no one can hurt themselves on their product. At least they&#x27;re cheap, so you can keep on breaking them until you get a good one. Wood sticks are unavailable in stores in California, I suppose because they think someone might hurt themselves.</li>
            <li> You know they are good because they are &amp;#34;Royal&amp;#34; after all.  I have it on good authority that the Queen herself has these on her bathroom sink and her minions have no problem digging Royal Ear Boogers out with em&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well for cleaning and detailing small areas.</li>
            <li> Great product. Happy you have it available as it is not in my area.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.  There is so little cotton on the end that they hurt, I wouldn&#x27;t use them in my ears or to apply makeup for fear of scratching myself. The description 110% is misleading.....I bought 10 packs which will now be thrown in the trash because i just don&#x27;t have time to return them.</li>
            <li> Well, I ordered an new supply. I must like them a lot.</li>
            <li> tip not very padded. Good for make up, not the most comfortable for ear cleaning. Expensive for q tips.</li>
            <li> they have wood sticks but VERY LITTLE cotton on the end of them</li>
            <li> A real &amp;#34;Q-tips&amp;#34; box of 125 safety swabs wood sticks, appears to have part number of 036364 are far superior to these Royal (Chinese) Wood Sticks. Longer, thicker stick, and larger cotton swab. These knockoffs function as I have found nothing better, but the sticks break easily and at times the cotton comes off the stick and stays in the ear which never happened with a real Q-tips</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A high-quality, non-bendable, natural cotton Q-tip. I use them for personal hygiene and they&#x27;re wonderful, I&#x27;m sure they would be great for other beauty purposes (i.e. nail painting/art, cleaning tight spots, crafts, etc...) These are the only cotton swabs I am going to use from now on!</li>
            <li> The product is fine and unavailable locally. Problem was I didn&#x27;t knew it was back-ordered and bought them elsewhere and now I have about a thousand of these cue tips. Back ordered merchandise should be clearly explained. As I recall the order  feedback said only &amp;#34;out of stock&amp;#34; and not back ordered.</li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to find wood sticks like these?</li>
            <li> The product is made in China, but what isn&#x27;t these days. They are as expected, a little thin on the cotton but not bad, the real plus is the hard to find wood stem which are much better than the paper stems that bend too easily. All in all their a good alternative.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the flimsy cardboard- or plastic-stick swabs. Wood is where it&#x27;s at. Although there are a few swabs in my package with splintered or cracked or otherwise defective swabs, I still prefer these stiffer wooden ones and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I only use wooden q tips and they can no longer be purchased in the stores.  These were surprising.  The wood looks a little rough, but they hold up just fine.  I have no problem with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Soft Q-tips tend to bend and hurt my ears.  These wooden Q-tips don&#x27;t bend, so I  use  them instead.  However, they have broken, causing a little discomfort, but less discomfort than the soft ones.  I would like for the company to make them thicker.</li>
            <li> I can hardly buy wood stick swabs locally. Like the product, bought enough to last me for years.</li>
            <li> These break easily and the cotton on the swabs comes off easily also.  I know someone who uses these all of the time (I just order them) - and has had them break off in his ears frequently - and has needed to go to a doctor multiple times to have the broke piece removed.  They used to be made better - now they always break and some of them the wood is not smooth.</li>
            <li> Yes, I read the other reviews and I still bought them&lt;br /&gt;They are NOT strong like the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;the wood quality is shotty quality&lt;br /&gt;and if you use much force they SNAP&lt;br /&gt;if you want WOOD, this is about it!&lt;br /&gt;The cotton parts at the end use very small amounts ....&lt;br /&gt;CHARGE us MORE and add more Cotton!!!</li>
            <li> I know, you&#x27;re not supposed to put them in your ears, but it sure feels good and gets the wax out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE USING STICK COTTON SWABS HOWEVER THE STICKS ARE SO THIN THAT THEY BREAK EASILY AND SOME TIMES THEY BREAK IN THE EARS...I LOVE THEM BUT I WISH THEY WERE STRONGER.</li>
            <li> Some of these q-tips are very thin with little cotton on the tips and sone of the wooden stems are so thin they crack and some are cracked already.</li>
            <li> Great product! No bending like plastic. Very pleased with the wood stick swabs.</li>
            <li> I love these!  The paper stick on regular cotton swabs have gotten weaker over the years and bend so easily with the slightest pressure.  These are very sturdy.  Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I love that there is no plastic in these!  They are a great product, work great &amp; you can easily toss them in with your compost pile to break down.  Will def be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Wish that Q-tip brand would resume making their wood q-tips. I really miss them. Thought I&#x27;d try these as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;They feel inferior in quality. The cotton is not as soft and the wood sticks are very inconsistent and splinter easily.&lt;br /&gt;Going back to regular old q-tips.</li>
            <li> The tip is a bit scant for personal hygiene, but I bought these for cleaning and oiling my firearms.  Wood stick swabs are getting hard to find and the paper sticks are not tough enough for what I need to do.  These do the job, the shaft doesn&#x27;t break easily and they are priced right so I can keep getting a fresh one.  If you have to clean anything in a tight space, I recommend these.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time as promised.</li>
            <li> About 9 dollars a box, ridiculous, but cheaper than the long wood stick individually wrapped ones I&#x27;ve been getting at Walmart and are now priced out. But they have good cotton on the ends, like the old Q-tips.  No difference between these and the 200 box Royal which was cheaper but almost the same price per box including shipping.</li>
            <li> The wood stick is nice but the amount of cotton minimal.  They are about the same as the new Q-tips, that are terrible.  I am still looking for a replacement for the old Q-tips that had plenty of cotton on them.  Still looking because these are not the answer.</li>
            <li> ...with the cotton.  The U.S. Cotton ones from Vermont Country store are better in my mind.  Well, the Q-Tips were the best, too bad the 20 boxes that I ordered when they were still being made didn&#x27;t last.  I just can&#x27;t bring myself to pay huge money for the originals on ebay.</li>
            <li> This product is no longer made by the &amp;#34;Q-Tip&amp;#34; people...it is far better than&lt;br /&gt;a plastic cotton swab.&lt;br /&gt;A package of 300 lasts me well over a year....good product for a good price !!!</li>
            <li> I need the wood sticks, they break very easily, not sturdy enough.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the control of wooden cotton swabs, but this brand&#x27;s cotton tends to be occasionally thin at either end.  Best to check the thickness of the swab&#x27;s ends before using them for health applications; otherwise, a great value.</li>
            <li> Wood is too thin, and does not give a sturdy feel when using it.</li>
            <li> The sticks are thin and break easy..not at all like the old Q-tips!!!!</li>
            <li> The product was great and the price was excellent even w/shipping. E. Dennison</li>
            <li> I always buy Q-tips as the plastic stick brands are so cheap that they bend every time I use them. Q-tips are much more stronger but these wood stick brand is even better. I use a lot of pressure when I clean my ears but be careful not to push deep inside. Using cotton swabs can be dangerous, so be careful when using these. But if you know what your doing, these wood stick brand is a great buy for the pricy cost wood brands go for. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. These are for people who like only the best of the best.</li>
            <li> I used to get another brand. The wood is very thin and breaks too easily. :(&lt;br /&gt;I would go back to my old brand.</li>
            <li> The cotton on the ends of the stick is world class! The wooden sticks are world class! Everything about these swabs are world class!</li>
            <li> I ordered these cotton swabs because, like many people, I prefer the stiffness of the wood stick over the rolled paper sticks used now by the major brands.  This morning I finished my first box of 300 swabs and wanted to mention a couple things about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have not pulled the cotton off of these swabs and measured it against the cotton on a Q-Tip but I&#x27;d estimate these have about 85-90% the amount of cotton as the name brand.  Personally, this is not a problem for me but if you think name brand Q-Tips are light on cotton or you wish they had more cotton you will be disappointed in these Royal swabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, these wood sticks have an inherent weakness when compared to rolled paper sticks: wood can snap in half where paper just bends.  Out of 300 swabs I had exactly 12 break in half while using them to clean my ears.  I typically pinch the cotton on one end of the swab with my thumb and middle finger and then use my index finger to apply pressure to the middle of the stick.  This meant that the swabs broke in the middle and didn&#x27;t cause me any problems.  However, if you have a different approach to holding the swabs or you hold your head to the side when using them you will want to be careful that you don&#x27;t snap a smaller portion of the swab off such that it can fall into your ear.  I think the risk is low but it&#x27;s worth mentioning.  12 out of 300 means there was a 4% failure rate and at least half of those felt weak when I picked them up so I could have avoided some of the breakages just by throwing away the obviously weak swabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t think a 4% failure rate is that bad so I&#x27;m giving the swabs 4 stars.  300 also isn&#x27;t the best sample size so your experience may be different but I&#x27;d definitely expect several to break on you.  All in all, though, this is still my favorite cotton swab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (November 16, 2012)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wrote the above review I ordered a fresh box of these wood stick swabs.While waiting on them to arrive I went back to using name brand Q-Tips for the first time in months.  I was shocked at the contrast between the wooden stick of these swabs and the rolled paper stick used on the Q-Tip!  There is absolutely no comparison.  If you like to feel like you&#x27;re firmly pressing against the inside of your ear when cleaning them the rolled paper stick of a Q-Tip is worthless compared to these wood sticks.</li>
            <li> I really liked the wooden ones I used to get from CVS, but they are no more. This is the next best thing. Wooden sticks are not so good but they serve the purpose. Gave 4 stars because they were my only choice. I would purchase again unless I can find quality ones at CVS or Walgreens, but I doubt it.</li>
            <li> Thank God for wooden stick Q-tips! Can&#x27;t find them in the stores any more.  Personally, I require some leverage.  These are so much better than the flimsy cardboard ones that are aparently designed for babies or something.  I don&#x27;t really get it, because the inner ear is so delicate, you can cause damage with a cardboard stick Q-tip if you do&#x27;t know how to handle one. These are substantial enough to  provide the leverage I need. Thank you for making this product available!</li>
            <li> Sticks are thinner than what I&#x27;m used to, but breakage seems about average. Also a little stingy with the cotton on the tips. They&#x27;ll do, though I wish Q-Tips would start making wood stick swabs again!</li>
            <li> Too small  they almost get lost in your ear.  Wooden sticks are very hard to think,  Probably won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> I too was a huge fan of the Q-Tip brand Wooden Stick Cotton Swab.  Since they were discontinued I have tried almost every imitation brand I have found.  These are just ok.  They do have the most cotton I have found on the tips.  But they are also the thinnest and shortest wooden sticks.  So if you&#x27;re looking for a nice cotton padded tip then I would definitely recommend these.  But if you&#x27;re like me and you appreciate a strong wooden stick for firm control then I would not recommend these.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s hard to go back to paper shaft or plastic shaft cotton swabs after one has experienced the really &amp;#34;firm control&amp;#34; of good quality wood shafts.&lt;br /&gt;But just to cut to the chase.. NO wood stick cotton swabs of the standard 3&amp;#34; or so length, that are available on the market today,  are anywhere near as good as the old Q-tips brand that were sadly discontinued a decade ago or so. Those were of consistent quality with thick sticks and plenty of cotton, and excellent quality control. That era is OVER. That being said, I tried all the other brands I could find and these are the best of whats currently available. They have enough cotton to not let the shaft break through and scratch or cut your ear, probably about 2/3 of what Q-tips had, but enough to do the job in pretty deep without being scary. The shafts are inconsistent as to thickness, and wood grain direction, so yes, a certain amount of them break, generally in the middle, usually at first flex, and it&#x27;s not a big deal, they don&#x27;t get stuck in your ear or anything. All current brands have this issue.. with these, you can tell when you get a thinnish one.. and relatively few break. 80% or so of the sticks are pretty decent, which floats my boat, in this post wood Q-tip era.. So I&#x27;m ok with this B-grade product.  I do worry about the cotton sometimes, as to how much bleach, chemicals etc was used in the processing of the cotton, whether it was washed out properly (wherever it is they make these), and the degree of sterility one assumes they have. I mean, hey- We stick these into our ears!!  No company makes these for love of the human ear. Just filling the little niche left when Q-tips decided there was not enough profit in this product.  All the brands available (imho) are too expensive, with the cheapest ones being really worthless and dangerous. By the way, used wood Q-tips (with ear-wax) are great to toss in with kindling as fire starters.. if it doesn&#x27;t gross you out too much to keep a baggieor jar of them till winter.</li>
            <li> This was for my mother in law.  She likes the wooden stick swabs best.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to find them for her!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the name brand Q-Tips wood stick swabs, but since you cannot get those on Amazon anymore these are an OK substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is that there are occasional ones that are broken or cracked and mid swipe on your ear they break in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second biggest complaint is that the cotton is not always even and you occasionally get a wooden pointed jab in the ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, overall they work pretty well, but the quality is not on par with the name brand Q-Tip version.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to find wood cotton swabs at the store anymore, so I was happy to find an alternative on Amazon.  The Royal Wood Stick Cotton Swabs are a little thinner and shorter with less cotton on the end than the discontinued Q-Tips brand, but beggars can&#x27;t be choosers.  These are a decent alternative to the original.</li>
            <li> Only swab I use. Wood allows for more pressure that paper.</li>
            <li> Simply the best cotton swabs in the market.  Very nice and firm and they don&#x27;t bend.  I will definitely buy these again even if they are pricier.</li>
            <li> The wood breaks to easily but Qtips stopped making them.</li>
            <li> The sticks have gotten thinner and thinner, and wood quality has gotten poorer and poorer over the last few years. With light use, several will break, which means I probably throw away 2-3 q-tips for every one I can actually use. Depending on what you are using them for, having it snap in half while using could be potentially dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really would like to find wooden q-tips than match the quality that Q-tip brand had.</li>
            <li> A double ended cotton swab with a wooden stick is so hard to find these days that I am ecstatic to find these.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to using Q-Tips, you&#x27;ll like this product just as much and it costs much less.&lt;br /&gt;Try it...</li>
            <li> If you miss the Q-tip wooden version (long gone) you will love these, a bit less cotton than real Q-tips but get the job done well</li>
