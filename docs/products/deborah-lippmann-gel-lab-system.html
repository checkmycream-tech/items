    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>say again the best.</li>
            <li>Excellent topcoat--lasts longer than any product I&#x27;ve tried before!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s very good considering</li>
            <li>This product keeps polish looking good for anywhere from 1-2 weeks.......if you&#x27;re not doing the dishes by hand !</li>
            <li>When I saw the Gel Lab System, it seemed like a great concept.</li>
            <li>This product works great for me.</li>
            <li>The best, my clients just love both bottom and top coat</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Manicure, with a nice glossy finish.</li>
            <li>The Deborah Lippmann Gel Lab System does not look nearly as nice a gel manicure as advertised and</li>
            <li>I own- not anything close to a gel.  </li>
            <li>I have my own length :-)</li>
            <li>Great lasting easy to use!!!</li>
            <li>This looks great, easy to apply, and dries instantly, so it&#x27;s quick to apply.</li>
            <li>I even used Deborah Lippmann polish to make sure and It still chipped and became within 10 hours.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I got creative with the directions.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i havent used it for a month and nails are healthy again :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Didnt like gel nails cause my nails weren&#x27;t healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the look of a gel manicure but do not like exposing myself to the UV light and the labor involved in removing the polish.</li>
            <li>Um, they were $3 for full size DL nail polish - so I ordered 3!  </li>
            <li>Oh, and it is extremely easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I never thought painting your nails could be so easy.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it pealed off easily too.</li>
            <li>and I believe this makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, the polish choices are fabulous</li>
            <li>And trust me, I&#x27;m not coordinated with nail polish - this just looks way better than a normal polish and top coat</li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me at my local beauty supply store and I am now into day 3 and my nails look as good as day 1.  </li>
            <li>so I think that is quite a good result and not one I&#x27;ve heard had with a regular manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>got the mini set last Christmas and loved it.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions so conscientiously that I was sure the product would work perfectly and prevent yet another expensive gel manicure.  </li>
            <li>Basic top coats work better then this.  </li>
            <li>The shine was there for a day or two but quickly wore off.  </li>
            <li>But otherwise, this is worth the money, will last you months, and will give you professional looking results you&#x27;d be proud to wear anywhere.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about it was the look, it looks like a professional&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Chipped right away.</li>
            <li>Its fine if you want something between a normal nail polish and a gel polish.</li>
            <li>One week into it, I applied a second coat of top coat and the polish lasted the full two weeks.  </li>
            <li>for $45 it&#x27;s a good buy, especially if you figure it&#x27;s $40 to have 1 gel manicure done professionally!</li>
            <li>The second day I applied another layer of top coat.</li>
            <li>I have actually gotten a manicure at a salon, come home, stripped it off, and put this stuff on because it looked better.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li>I used this today for the first time.</li>
            <li>The finish is not like a gel finish and most certainly does not last like a gel manicure.  </li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see how long this manicure holds up....</li>
            <li>My nails are super shiny and look like a professionally done gel manicure.</li>
            <li>I used one coat of each and found that it wasn&#x27;t quite strong enough for my nails.  </li>
            <li>It really goes along way.</li>
            <li>Save your money or invest In a real gel manicure.</li>
            <li>On the rare occasion I go get my nails done, they usually ask me where I got them done the last time because they look so darn good.</li>
            <li>I could have achieved the same from a cheap bottle of clear polish.  </li>
            <li>For color, I used a China Glaze polish in a light pink.  </li>
            <li>When you use it the manicure will last a little bit longer not as long as the gel or shellac but great.</li>
            <li>Ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through my first top coat before I finished the base coat, so I wish that were available separately!</li>
            <li>certainly does not last.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your $40 purchasing this item.  </li>
            <li>thank goodness I received this as a gift , because it completely over priced.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 2 stars, but the fact that it dries fast and woke up with no sheet lines awarded an  extra star.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little on the pricey side, but so worth it.  </li>
            <li>I work with gloves and wash my hands pretty frequent and the last me for a week with little or no ship.</li>
            <li>-- I settle in with a TV show and take the color off (super easy, no special products required), put the base coat on, put two coats of color on, finish with the top coat, let dry for a while just in case.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it only lasts three days before it all just started majorly chipping off.</li>
            <li>There was nothing special about either the base or top coat.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works very well - week and a half</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I used one base layer, two color layers and then one top coat on the first day.</li>
            <li> will try again this weekend with a dark nail polish, but thus far, I highly recommended it as a more natural and &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; alternative to shellac nails which for me, proved to be very harsh on my weak nails due to the soaking in acetone that is usually need to remove shellac.</li>
            <li> It stays shiny and pretty and absolutely never chips, for at least a week.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen is much better than this product and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this is any better than any other normal base coat/top coat</li>
            <li> The polish does not look any different than regular polish with a base and top coat.  </li>
            <li> As of today, 5 days later, there is only a small chip on two nails.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago on a whim and had not used it until last Sunday.  </li>
            <li> a lot of that time was spent snorkeling.</li>
            <li> You might as well just use a regular base and top coat.</li>
            <li> so I will try the polish with  a regular base and top coat and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I allowed each layer (the DL base coat, the two layers of polish and the DL top gel coat) to completely dry at least 2-3 minutes each before applying the next layer</li>
            <li> This product does not do what it claims, and is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on day 5 of my manicure with a dark polish and do not have one chip.</li>
            <li> I applied 2 coats of base, 1 coat of color, and 1 coat of top just before a 2 weeks vacation.  </li>
            <li> For an expensive at home gel-like kit, the number one thing I&#x27;m looking for is long lasting.</li>
            <li> $40 for this gel set is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $</li>
            <li> I even wasted another $17 buying the Deborah Lippmann polish thinking that would help...</li>
            <li> $57 wasted.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, waste of manicure.</li>
            <li> The gel peeled off within a few days.</li>
            <li> If it can repel and work in salt water, it can tolerate everyday with no sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This did nothing to give my nails the hard finish I wanted and the price was extreme.  </li>
            <li> I used as directed, thought I might have done something wrong, tried again following directions.  </li>
            <li> Did not make my nail polish last any longer than normal at all, really a waste of money, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> , polish stays on for at least two weeks without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is essentially very expensive base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> Two days later ... looked so bad</li>
            <li> I have tried shellac, but the removal still damages my weak nails.  </li>
            <li> If the polish even lasts close to a week for me I will consider myself ahead of the game.  </li>
            <li> I have thin nails</li>
            <li> I tried it three times thinking that i was doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> My nails are VERY hard after using this, so I guess the acrylic ingredient is doing its job!!</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> Bad choice.</li>
            <li> it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed AND think of the money you will save by doing it yourself.</li>
            <li> I tried nail salon gel and hated it.</li>
            <li> Terrible chips after just one day.</li>

            <li> $40 for this gel set is a waste of money.  There was nothing special about either the base or top coat.  I used as directed, thought I might have done something wrong, tried again following directions.  Product peeled the very next day.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions so conscientiously that I was sure the product would work perfectly and prevent yet another expensive gel manicure.  WRONG!  Big disappointment.  One day after applying ... chips and peels.  Two days later ... looked so bad I took this stuff off.  Don&#x27;t waste your $</li>
            <li> Um, they were $3 for full size DL nail polish - so I ordered 3!  Because I followed the directions - this worked for me!  What a deal!</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen is much better than this product and less expensive.</li>
            <li> Did not make my nail polish last any longer than normal at all, really a waste of money, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Despite the price, it does help extend the life of regular manicures.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your $40 purchasing this item.  The polish does not look any different than regular polish with a base and top coat.  The Gel Lab peels off next day even same day it starts chipping.  I even wasted another $17 buying the Deborah Lippmann polish thinking that would help... no go!  $57 wasted.</li>
            <li> Terrible chips after just one day. The only thing I liked about it was the look, it looks like a professional&lt;br /&gt; Manicure, with a nice glossy finish. This product does not do what it claims, and is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Gel polish destroyed my nails and I didn&#x27;t want to go back to acrylics.  The only problem is that regular polish won&#x27;t stay on my nails even a day.  This was recommended to me at my local beauty supply store and I am now into day 3 and my nails look as good as day 1.  If the polish even lasts close to a week for me I will consider myself ahead of the game.  Oh, and it is extremely easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I tried this product twice and both times my nails chipped within 2 days. The Deborah Lippmann Gel Lab System does not look nearly as nice a gel manicure as advertised and certainly does not last. You might as well just use a regular base and top coat. It works the same.</li>
            <li> This is essentially very expensive base coat and top coat. It does not last any longer than regular nail polish. It is deceptive to sell it as anything else.</li>
            <li> I stopped gel manicures because I thought they were ruining my nails. When I saw the Gel Lab System, it seemed like a great concept. Bad choice. My nails do not chip with a regular manicure with OPI polish. Within only 2 days several nails had chipped and my daughter had the same problem. Waste of money, waste of manicure. Now, the polish choices are fabulous so I will try the polish with  a regular base and top coat and see what happens. Would like a refund!</li>
            <li> thank goodness I received this as a gift , because it completely over priced. Basic top coats work better then this.  I tried it three times thinking that i was doing something wrong.  I even used Deborah Lippmann polish to make sure and It still chipped and became within 10 hours.  I would have given it 2 stars, but the fact that it dries fast and woke up with no sheet lines awarded an  extra star.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to my sally hansen or going to try seche vite or essie brand.</li>
            <li> When you use it the manicure will last a little bit longer not as long as the gel or shellac but great. I work with gloves and wash my hands pretty frequent and the last me for a week with little or no ship.</li>
            <li> The best, my clients just love both bottom and top coat , polish stays on for at least two weeks without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;I say again the best.</li>
            <li> Excellent topcoat--lasts longer than any product I&#x27;ve tried before!</li>
            <li> This product works great for me. I love the look of a gel manicure but do not like exposing myself to the UV light and the labor involved in removing the polish. I&#x27;m on day 5 of my manicure with a dark polish and do not have one chip. I used one base layer, two color layers and then one top coat on the first day. The second day I applied another layer of top coat. My nails are super shiny and look like a professionally done gel manicure. I love this product!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as UV cured gel systems. Its fine if you want something between a normal nail polish and a gel polish. I found it chipped and lifted well before my UV cured system would.</li>
            <li> This gel set has basically changed my life. I have actually gotten a manicure at a salon, come home, stripped it off, and put this stuff on because it looked better. On the rare occasion I go get my nails done, they usually ask me where I got them done the last time because they look so darn good. And trust me, I&#x27;m not coordinated with nail polish - this just looks way better than a normal polish and top coat combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I change my color once a week. It takes a while because I&#x27;m thorough -- I settle in with a TV show and take the color off (super easy, no special products required), put the base coat on, put two coats of color on, finish with the top coat, let dry for a while just in case. It stays shiny and pretty and absolutely never chips, for at least a week. People constantly ask me where I get my nails done. Ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through my first top coat before I finished the base coat, so I wish that were available separately! But otherwise, this is worth the money, will last you months, and will give you professional looking results you&#x27;d be proud to wear anywhere. I am sold.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago on a whim and had not used it until last Sunday.  I have tried shellac, but the removal still damages my weak nails.

I allowed each layer (the DL base coat, the two layers of polish and the DL top gel coat) to completely dry at least 2-3 minutes each before applying the next layer and I believe this makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriends all noticed the shiny &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; look.  As of today, 5 days later, there is only a small chip on two nails.  I have done dishes by hand and I work all day with papers, staples, labels, etc. so I think that is quite a good result and not one I&#x27;ve heard had with a regular manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try again this weekend with a dark nail polish, but thus far, I highly recommended it as a more natural and &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; alternative to shellac nails which for me, proved to be very harsh on my weak nails due to the soaking in acetone that is usually need to remove shellac.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I tried nail salon gel and hated it. The gel peeled off within a few days. This gel lab set solved my problem.&lt;br /&gt;I got the mini set last Christmas and loved it. It really goes along way. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just received the product a week before a trip which gave me a chance to try the product.  I used one coat of each and found that it wasn&#x27;t quite strong enough for my nails.  I have thin nails and they are prone to breakage..I got creative with the directions.  I applied 2 coats of base, 1 coat of color, and 1 coat of top just before a 2 weeks vacation.  Extra drying time is required.  One week into it, I applied a second coat of top coat and the polish lasted the full two weeks.  Terrific!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I don&#x27;t like how my nails are weakened from a salon gel mani. The Deborah Lippmann two polish approach seemed ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well - week and a half and that&#x27;s very good considering a lot of that time was spent snorkeling. If it can repel and work in salt water, it can tolerate everyday with no sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed AND think of the money you will save by doing it yourself. This set pays for itself.</li>
            <li> tried it twice.  still chips, nail tips started to peel, and leaves white marks all over nail beds when nail polished was removed.  will try to get my $$$ back from d.lipmann since cant get refund from store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i havent used it for a month and nails are healthy again :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy from nordstrom in case you don&#x27;t like it you can get a refund.</li>
            <li> Chipped after 3 days of wear.  I can&#x27;t say that this is any better than any other normal base coat/top coat I own- not anything close to a gel.  Sad to say this because I normally love Deborah Lippman nail polish.</li>
            <li> This is a deceptive product!  The finish is not like a gel finish and most certainly does not last like a gel manicure.  I painted my nails one evening and they started chipping after only one day.  I followed the instructions exactly.  Save your money or invest In a real gel manicure.</li>
            <li> I used this today for the first time. I will say if you are looking for that &#x27;truly gel look&#x27;, this product does not warrant. It just looks like regular nail polish without that thicker look that gel nails have.  My nails are VERY hard after using this, so I guess the acrylic ingredient is doing its job!! It will be interesting to see how long this manicure holds up....for $45 it&#x27;s a good buy, especially if you figure it&#x27;s $40 to have 1 gel manicure done professionally!</li>
            <li> A little on the pricey side, but so worth it.  My manicures last up to 6 days without a scratch.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Didnt like gel nails cause my nails weren&#x27;t healthy. This product keeps polish looking good for anywhere from 1-2 weeks.......if you&#x27;re not doing the dishes by hand !</li>
            <li> Great lasting easy to use!!! Thumbs up! I never thought painting your nails could be so easy. It even dried fast and appears to have strengthened my nails. I have my own length :-)</li>
            <li> This was as overstated and overpriced as anything I have ever purchased.  The shine was there for a day or two but quickly wore off.  This did nothing to give my nails the hard finish I wanted and the price was extreme.  I could have achieved the same from a cheap bottle of clear polish.  Oh, and it pealed off easily too.</li>
            <li> Nothing like Gel nails. Chipped right away.</li>
            <li> This looks great, easy to apply, and dries instantly, so it&#x27;s quick to apply. I was so excited. The only problem is that it only lasts three days before it all just started majorly chipping off. For an expensive at home gel-like kit, the number one thing I&#x27;m looking for is long lasting.</li>
