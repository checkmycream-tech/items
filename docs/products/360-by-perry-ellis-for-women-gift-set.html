            <li>Such a wonderful prout and amazon did such a good job getting it to me.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite because it&#x27;s a light clean fragrance</li>
            <li>The fragrance is so clean and fresh!!  </li>
            <li>This is the real thing - I love this perfume!</li>
            <li>THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AND ITS A GREAT PRODUCT AND</li>
            <li>The set showed up at my door early, everything was good when it arrived.</li>
            <li>I love this fragance, it is so clean and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>Buying process was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>This clean fresh fragrance is a winner in my book!  </li>
            <li>so fresh and light and clean..</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off just not buying the whole set.</li>
            <li>The cost was reasonable and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>OKAY, BUT DON&#x27;T THINK IT IS THE REAL</li>
            <li>FAST FREE SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>It is my absolute favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This item not only arrived on time but everything was nicely entacted.</li>
            <li>It did not smell fresh.  </li>
            <li>Right on time for the holidays.</li>
            <li>Yes this product meets my needs and very much so and thank you very much.</li>
            <li>This kit comes well packaged and smells accurate - sometimes with discounted perfume the scent is off - but this is accuarate as far as scent.</li>
            <li>But still not with your $35, better off just getting the individual bottle of eau de tiolette.</li>
            <li>I find that the gift set is a better value than buying these items individually.  </li>
            <li>I was paying so much more at a local retailer until I decided to look on Amazon....</li>
            <li>I suggest if you have never tried it before, that you try it on first and see how it goes with you.</li>
            <li>We compared it side by side to the bottle she had paid tons more for at a department store and it was exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing 360 ever since it first came out on the market.  </li>
            <li>Was able to give my 12 yr old a purse mini and my 10 yr old</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve not found it at any other place with such a great price..</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks..</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for offering this.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing this since high school!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>#34;what are you weaeing?&amp;#34;  At first it surprised me because it would be hours ago</li>
            <li>I am having a ball with my new 360!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, just subtle clean fresh scent staying with you all day!  </li>
            <li>Well the same except for this gift set had more perfume and cost half as much as the one bottle she had bought for herself.</li>
            <li>Love the little bottle for my purse!</li>
            <li>Long lasting and not too strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the lotion has a strange smell to it-I really don&#x27;t care too much for it</li>
            <li>The lotion was old and could not be used.</li>
            <li>They can sell you an old product and you can&#x27;t return it.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell the way I thought it would, kind of an imposter perfume, and the lotion just made it worse</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think you can beat this price - basically two bottles for the same amount (or less) than what you might normally pay for one.  </li>
            <li>While part of the Perry Ellis Gift Set is fine, the large bottle of Perfume and lotion smells really stale.  </li>
            <li>, it seem to me it was old and sat for a long time</li>
            <li>I finally received the package from my shipping company today and noticed that the box on the outside was discoloured in certain areas and when I uncovered the box I discovered that all the shower gel had leaked out into the box and about half of the lotion have leaked out as well.</li>

            <li> The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the fragrance of the lotion and shower gel just seem &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; and they smell bitter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other fragrances, but I always revert back to this one.  </li>
            <li> The product is dry in the box and packaging which indicates that this did not occur in transit.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> what I expected and meets loa offer made.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller to be told that due to health laws it could not be returned because I had \\&quot;tried\\&quot; it.  </li>
            <li> No thanks!  </li>
            <li> have purchased from other sellers and did not have any</li>
            <li> It smells nothing like the bottle you would find in Macy&#x27;s or any other perfume store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for me with low blood pressure to find perfumes with a soft scents.</li>
            <li> My average rating comes from the smell of the lotion, it smells like something that has been stuffed for years and needs air.  </li>
            <li> all for less than one medium bottle of perfume in the store!</li>
            <li> They smelled a little rancid and unpleasant, which was definitely not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s passable, but just not ideal.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had bought two sets and had given one set as a gift.</li>
            <li> I cant return it ill just use it to spray around the house</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, NOT SO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the product was stale.  </li>
            <li> but I was disappointed in this gift set.</li>
            <li> Am disappointed.</li>

            <li> Perry Ellis is my favorite smell in the world. This item not only arrived on time but everything was nicely entacted. No scratches, it looks like picked it off the shelf from Macy&#x27;s.  My average rating comes from the smell of the lotion, it smells like something that has been stuffed for years and needs air.  I cannot smell the perry ellis in it at all.  It has a musty smell.  You&#x27;re better off just not buying the whole set. The shower gel is better than the lotion. But still not with your $35, better off just getting the individual bottle of eau de tiolette.</li>
            <li> Yes this product meets my needs and very much so and thank you very much. Shipping was great and on time. I am having a ball with my new 360!</li>
            <li> my wife really liked this set, the price was very convenient and the material is very good, i like it too</li>
            <li> Very nice for a Mother&#x27;s Day gift</li>
            <li> I love this perfume but I was disappointed in this gift set. The lotion was old and could not be used. Unfortunately I had bought two sets and had given one set as a gift.</li>
            <li> Excited to find 360 online!  The cost was reasonable and I love the scent.  I wear this cologne, forget I have it on, and someone will always ask &amp;#34;what are you weaeing?&amp;#34;  At first it surprised me because it would be hours ago that I put it on, but I&#x27; m always complemented on it.  Light, fresh, I just love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent, very nice, I will get it again!😃😍</li>
            <li> I LOVE PERRY ELLIS, AND THIS WAS A GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> OKAY, BUT DON&#x27;T THINK IT IS THE REAL</li>
            <li> Uuhhhhh, my lady loves it and that is what I wanted... she smells better than a bucket of puppies... thanks</li>
            <li> While part of the Perry Ellis Gift Set is fine, the large bottle of Perfume and lotion smells really stale.  Am disappointed.</li>
            <li> ..packaged well, arrived on time and smelled great .&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful gift for mom. Size was as promised, as if purchased from a leading store.</li>
            <li> not quite the way I&lt;br /&gt;remember it smelling its okay&lt;br /&gt;the lotion has a strange smell to it-I really don&#x27;t care too much for it&lt;br /&gt;since I cant return it ill just use it to spray around the house</li>
            <li> FAST FREE SHIPPING! The gift set arrived in perfect condition. I&#x27;ve worn Perry Ellis 360 for over seven years.  I&#x27;ve tried other fragrances, but I always revert back to this one.  A very beautiful, soft fragrance that lasts ALL DAY!  I find that the gift set is a better value than buying these items individually.  I plan to purchase the gift set online from now on!  Very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> This fragrance smell really nice and has always been on of my favorite.The price was&lt;br /&gt;excellent and it came in a timely manner</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal!  This time of year you cannot find gift sets.  Most of the time they are much more pricey than this set was.  Thank You</li>
            <li> I have worn PE 360 for years.  This looked like a great deal.  Sorry to say, NOT SO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a gift to myself.  It arrived in good condition and on time.  However, the product was stale.  It did not smell fresh.  I contacted the seller to be told that due to health laws it could not be returned because I had \\&quot;tried\\&quot; it.  Nice operation.  They can sell you an old product and you can&#x27;t return it.  I was offered a voucher/credit for another purchase.  No thanks!  I will not take that chance ever again with this seller.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased from other sellers and did not have any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00304XY24 360 By Perry Ellis For Women Gift Set]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for me and very convenient to be able to order it through Amazon. Try the fragrance you might like it.</li>
            <li> Right on time for the holidays. Delivery did not take long and it was the best gift under the tree.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. I have worn 360 for years but this seems to have no scent!  Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I finally received the package from my shipping company today and noticed that the box on the outside was discoloured in certain areas and when I uncovered the box I discovered that all the shower gel had leaked out into the box and about half of the lotion have leaked out as well. The product is dry in the box and packaging which indicates that this did not occur in transit. The package should have been inspected before it was shipped. This was purchased as a gift for someone but I am ashamed to give it in this condition,</li>
            <li> This is my favorite because it&#x27;s a light clean fragrance and I&#x27;ve not found it at any other place with such a great price..I was paying so much more at a local retailer until I decided to look on Amazon....I shop more with Amazon now , not just for my movies and DVD but for my Art supplies ...office printer....and household merchandise...Amazon you have it all...and at the Best Prices...Thanks..I&#x27;ll be Back...you are my one stop shopping place!!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRICE ITS ALWAYS THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AND ITS A GREAT PRODUCT AND VERY CHEAP ON AMAZON NO ONE CAN BET IT. I BUY ALL THE TIME .</li>
            <li> This set came and everything  smelled as if it had turned.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very good I bought for my wife</li>
            <li> This perfume set is remarkable.  I love the little travel size that fits perfectly in my overnight bag!  This clean fresh fragrance is a winner in my book!  Not overpowering, just subtle clean fresh scent staying with you all day!  Love the body wash and the lotion...sure would love a scented body powder too!</li>
            <li> Have loved 360 Perry Ellis for Women for years.  Was so glad to find this set for this price!!  Thanks so much for offering this.  The fragrance is so clean and fresh!!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> the packaging and design is excellent. what I expected and meets loa offer made. I arrive on time. happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful prout and amazon did such a good job getting it to me.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this since high school! 18 years already and it is my favorite. I guess it works with my chemistry, get compliments all the time.  But it doesn&#x27;t go well with everyone.  I know people that don&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t like how they smell with Perry Ellis.  I suggest if you have never tried it before, that you try it on first and see how it goes with you.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift for a friend. She loved it. Buying process was quick and easy. Package came promptly.</li>
            <li> I bought this gift set as a gift for my girlfriend on her birthday. The shipping was quick and she was very pleased with the perfume. We compared it side by side to the bottle she had paid tons more for at a department store and it was exactly the same. Well the same except for this gift set had more perfume and cost half as much as the one bottle she had bought for herself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for years and it&#x27;s my favorite  it&#x27;s a nice clean smell and works well in summer or winter!  I really don&#x27;t think you can beat this price - basically two bottles for the same amount (or less) than what you might normally pay for one.  I like the smaller bottle too -- perfect for your handbag or travel.  The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the fragrance of the lotion and shower gel just seem &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; and they smell bitter.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing - I love this perfume!</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for over 10 yrs..it&#x27;s a go to in warmer weather..but great anytime. Especially day wear..so fresh and light and clean..everyone asks What are you wearing?..Plus..great deal!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It has been a favorite perfume for years. This kit comes well packaged and smells accurate - sometimes with discounted perfume the scent is off - but this is accuarate as far as scent. (I hope that makes sense!!)  Would buy again. Love the little bottle for my purse!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and I question its authenticity. The perfume included seemed acceptable, but the creams definitely were not. They smelled a little rancid and unpleasant, which was definitely not what I was hoping for. The perfume smelled okay, not quite sure though. I don&#x27;t hate the scent, but I also feel like there may be something off with it. It&#x27;s passable, but just not ideal. I used Amazon as my vendor, so it wasn&#x27;t a third-party shop. I was hoping this would ensure I received the best product, but I guess I was unlucky with this purchase.</li>
            <li> 360 is my favorite I wear it all the time I love to hear the men tell me how good I smell</li>
            <li> OMG!!! I was very happy due to the price was very low. I will be ordering this AGAIN.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents.  Have ordered a set before but this one had the lotion and gel that are quite desirable.  This was a good buy.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, and it was terrible. It smells nothing like the bottle you would find in Macy&#x27;s or any other perfume store. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing 360 ever since it first came out on the market.  It is my absolute favorite fragrance.  I receive compliments on it everywhere I go.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the product was in great shape.The product was in the gift set and was a great value . I have been using this product for ten years now. I get compliments all the time I love the clean scent. Will keep buying it</li>
            <li> excellent product. very good product, good quality, I recommend it 100%, I loved it, thank you very much thank you. greetings..</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell the way I thought it would, kind of an imposter perfume, and the lotion just made it worse, it seem to me it was old and sat for a long time</li>
            <li> Love my purchase !! All was there and would go anywhere else to purchas it!!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t beat it for the $$$$! Was able to give my 12 yr old a purse mini and my 10 yr old a shower gel...and I got a giant bottle of the perfume along with potion....all for less than one medium bottle of perfume in the store!</li>
            <li> My mom will love this gift. The set showed up at my door early, everything was good when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Muy lindos cumplen con todo lo ofrecido por el proveedor, manejan buen tiempo de entrega, muy buen servicio y calidad.</li>
            <li> Excelent. I love it. Great value for the  price.U can&#x27;t find it in any store. Long lasting and not too strong. It&#x27;s difficult for me with low blood pressure to find perfumes with a soft scents. This one is very nice. I will buy it again. Try it,you will not be dessapointed.</li>
