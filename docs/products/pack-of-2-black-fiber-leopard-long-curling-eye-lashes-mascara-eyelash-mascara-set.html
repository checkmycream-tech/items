            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be awesome</li>
            <li>This is great stuff just as good as younique.</li>
            <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t buy YouNique fiber mascara because this is just as good!!!</li>
            <li>Very cute container and the product is in nice metal tubes, very good quality.  </li>
            <li>This is the best mascara i have ever used, it does expand your lashes and doesnt clump up and doesnt come of easily, nor does it smear ...</li>
            <li>But the product is great and kind of made up for the wait.</li>
            <li>Loved how it made lashes thicker, but Lil flakes come off on cheeks &amp; under eyes.</li>
            <li>Works good.  </li>
            <li>Results look good.</li>
            <li>The transplanting gel mascara is great on it&#x27;s own without using the fibers.</li>
            <li>As good as Younique brand fiber mascara.</li>
            <li>This product is as good as Younique (yes, I have used theirs as well).</li>
            <li>The product is a good deal.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>good product for the price</li>
            <li>This is good for the price.</li>
            <li>Works as good as younique look up the youtube videos.</li>
            <li>The product is good.</li>
            <li>I just found something cheaper and works just as good.</li>
            <li>the product is good</li>
            <li>This is reallly good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good item.  </li>
            <li>its good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Super cute case!!!!</li>
            <li>love this mascara ,good quailty and looks great on every makeup style.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, you can get a very exotic \\&quot;falsie\\&quot; look with this stuff.</li>
            <li>and it comes very stylish.</li>
            <li>The cost was great and the mascara was ok</li>
            <li>On top of that the product doesn&#x27;t work as great as promised.</li>
            <li>so great value for a sometimes use..:)</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Was good for the knock off kind</li>
            <li>Although I think my daughter is beautiful, it always kind of bothered me that everyone implied that she couldn&#x27;t have gotten such beautiful lashes from a mom who is not as beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this product and how well it works!  </li>
            <li>I was not about to spend $30 on Younique&#x27;s fiber lash mascara, so I started looking for inexpensive fiber lash mascara and found Love Alpha!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>

            <li>Love this product amazing fuller longer lashes in seconds every morning :) great price for this product coworker pays $29 for her fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li>After my daughter was born though and came out with AMAZING lashes, people would always look at me and my husband and then say, &amp;#34;Where</li>
            <li>and you can see the amazing transformations for yourself.</li>

            <li>This mascara is amazing.</li>
            <li>I had never used fiber lashes before but they&#x27;re amazing.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because the shipping took forever, like I forgot about it kind of forever.</li>
            <li>A good mascara worked better.</li>
            <li>It honestly works.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the more exspensive one.</li>
            <li>its okay, not as good as another brand i have but will do the job</li>
            <li>The shipper was extremely nice and resent my product after it got lost in the mail.</li>
            <li>The mascara is nice, but forget about using the fibers.  </li>
            <li>I liked this mascara, my kids also approve of it.</li>
            <li>Makes my eyelashes huge and beautiful, and is easy to put on!</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to my cute case to carry alone my mascara!!!</li>
            <li>Works good and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Makes your eyelashes look super full and beautiful!</li>
            <li>so itd be nice if the gel held those lashes better</li>
            <li>by far the best mascara ever!</li>
            <li>Amazing product I love this...</li>
            <li>easy and cute packaging!</li>
            <li>This product is great ladies not expensive.</li>
            <li>Will most certainly be buying again!!!!</li>
            <li>then you apply the fibers as many coats as You like to get the desired lenghth and fullness xomes off easily with warm water ....</li>
            <li>I had seen many, many advertisements for Younique fiber mascara and always wanted to try it, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend the $30 for something I may not like.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I just could not see myself spending $30 on these fibers and not knowing for sure</li>
            <li>I am 150% satisfied with this product and my purchase.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>especially after most of the reviews said that this was an awesome mascara.  </li>
            <li>absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not at all satisfied.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff, will order it over and over again.</li>
            <li>Not so hot...doesn&#x27;t work any better than drugstore products.</li>
            <li>Also, overall great customer service!</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this and the case is a great bonus</li>

            <li>Why do I have to add more words.</li>

            <li>Your favorite Mascara.  </li>
            <li>optional* top off with waterproof mascara to seal.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine the Younique could be any better than this.</li>
            <li>i fell in love i didnt want to have to be committed to spendin 30+</li>
            <li>i wish the smell wasnt so offensive (mostly cuz it just scares me about what the heck its made out of...</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I love the product and would have given it a 5 star</li>
            <li>But its towards the end of the use so its OK.</li>
            <li>I did ok on day one</li>
            <li>Everyone gave it great reviews, but $30 dollars really?????</li>
            <li>When I learn to use it properly it will be wonderful.</li>
            <li>all mine :-)</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>It has become my favorite and that is saying something as I sell MaryKay products(including mascara).</li>
            <li>Maybe others are better at applying it....</li>
            <li>I love the lusher lashes but these fibers flake quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason this is so cheap!</li>
            <li>Younique is definitely a better choice</li>
            <li>I just have to be more patient in applyi</li>
            <li>This works fabulously!</li>
            <li>Started with the serum, then layered the fibers on top.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased with them anyway before leaving the house.</li>
            <li>I ordered more for gifts.</li>
            <li>I love the case and design.  </li>
            <li>I love these lashes.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>great price and beautiful color and lengthening but not worth it</li>
            <li>but mostly they will  just look fuzzy.</li>
            <li>I love this and will continue to purchase it over and over.</li>
            <li>:) I gave it 4 Stars because it didn&#x27;t come with the Case .:</li>
            <li>I love the way my lashes look with this product.</li>
            <li>I already ordered more.</li>
            <li>I would recommend two coats for more fuller lashes</li>
            <li>will be ordering from here a lot more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten sooo many compliments.</li>
            <li>BUT the product i LOVE.</li>
            <li>But it was ok because someone posted instructions in their review.  </li>
            <li>Although it may flake and yo can see the fibers on your eyelids, all you have to do is coat your lashes with your favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>then apply the fiber adhesive then the fibers; keep repeating until you reach your desired length and then go over it with your favorite mascara again to seal in the fibers.  </li>
            <li>For more help there are tutorials on YouTube that I found helpful.</li>
            <li>And you can repeat the gel and fibers for more oomph.</li>
            <li>Thought I would order some more.</li>
            <li>Flakes off on top of everything else, Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>glad I bought the item when I did</li>
            <li>Love it wish I knew about it sooner.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>The packaging is adorable as well.</li>
            <li>Was a favorite as for my granddaughter wishes.</li>
            <li>I will gladly buy again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE it.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;oy</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I would honestly say that this is very comparable and waaaaaaay cheaper!!!</li>
            <li>but this mascara out them at full bloom LOVE!</li>
            <li>The case it comes in is super cute!</li>
            <li>wondering how my eye lashes got so long lmao!!!!</li>
            <li>Pretty good</li>
            <li>While this mascara is not a miracle, I will admit that the difference in my lashes is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use the gel by itself and I love how it easily comes off..</li>
            <li>But when I wake up, the product of course isn&#x27;t going to look as good as the day applied, but it looks as good as my regular mascara.</li>
            <li>this stuff works GREAT and both my husband and my daughter on separate occasions commented on how full and pretty my eyelashes looked (they had no idea i had purchased this stuff)...</li>
            <li>As great as it would be to help a friend out and get lush lashes to boot, I don&#x27;t have $25 to spend on mascara.  </li>
            <li>Next you repeat step 1, and if you want them longer, step 2 may be applied to the tips and so on until you reached your ideal look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy so far with this product.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product for fabulous lashes!</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than their competitors but just as good.</li>
            <li>i loved for one how fast i got it and two</li>
            <li>The price was right!!</li>
            <li>The price is right and the product is amazing.</li>
            <li>goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t clump, make my eyes water or burn.</li>
            <li>on easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and Easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Its easy to aply</li>
            <li>Easy application.</li>
            <li>I love this product it really works and the price is amazing</li>
            <li>but it does flake easy</li>
            <li>The brush on the fibers is also too long and you cant put them on very good.</li>
            <li>The shipping takes a while so make sure to order another right when you get one!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll be buying more right now!</li>
            <li>normally I have good wear for about 8- 10 hours.</li>
            <li>and I really liked it for the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li>It does make my lashes longer and more full, but the fibers tend to smear at the bottom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better that you pay full price for younique.</li>
            <li>Not super impressed with the results of this kit....</li>
            <li>The fibers were fine but often didnt stick to the gel, gets clumpy</li>
            <li>So cheap and SO easy to use.</li>
            <li>Super cheap!</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted with fast shipping and cute packaging!</li>
            <li>(cheap is fine</li>
            <li>Great product that I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li>This is a very cost effective fiber mascara option.</li>
            <li>hope it is always available .</li>
            <li>but it was cheaply made.</li>
            <li>My friend sells Younique make-up and is always posting pictures online of the fabulous mascara.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the Look it gives me.</li>
            <li>I think a great mascara will do the same.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a different brand before, so this was great.</li>
            <li>Maybe cause it a cheap price, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>but the larger one is great.</li>
            <li>For how cheap they are it did was it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure my wait won&#x27;t be worth it</li>
            <li>just remember to put the fiber on 2nd lol</li>
            <li>This is such a great deal.</li>
            <li>I would not invest money on these, they may be cheap</li>
            <li>All I do is take a shower and lightly wash my face and the mascara just slides off..</li>
            <li>Better than regular mascara but not as good as I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Wonderful price people are selling this thing for $30 which is good because the product really works thick long beautiful lashes</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say much more other than the seller is AWESOME at customer service.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, The case is stylish!</li>
            <li>first then I used this product it works wonders!!</li>
            <li>very worth the month</li>
            <li>Liked it right away on first use.  </li>
            <li>I received so many compliments on the length of my eyelashes the first day I used this.  </li>
            <li>It took 5 weeks to arrive and I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>so I was excited.</li>
            <li>Transplant gel works great as a mascara, makes lashes extremely long.</li>
            <li>So I was really excited.</li>
            <li>but it was sooo worth the wait!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to use it, came before delivery date too.</li>
            <li>I find it interesting that the box, tube size/ shape, and the consistancy of the product seems to match exactly.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed as you get what you pay for.. plus</li>
            <li>I always have a qtip with me and clean around per application.</li>
            <li>So, be prepared that you might have to clean and reapply any foundation you&#x27;ve applied after using this product.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure u put either a coat of ur own mascara or the gel on last</li>
            <li>The fibers are amazing, very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>Ok but not as good as other fiber lash products out there.</li>
            <li>so I can retire my falsies until special events.</li>
            <li>If used right, it works wonders!</li>
            <li>Its super easy to use, the case is fun</li>
            <li>although i saw results with the younique brand one, i feel like my results with the lovealpha brand are even more dramatic :D  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care for this product, was super excited</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this and had very high hopes of it being comparable to Younique</li>
            <li>I purchased pink one and it worked so great</li>
            <li>Its an amazing product , but , the  natural fibers continue to get into my eyes.</li>
            <li>Now I no longer need to envy my daughters lashes with full youthful lashes in this tube.</li>
            <li>ur lashes and tgey get on ur under eyes but overall its good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend much on this</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really make them longer just bought cover girl bombshell and works better than these mascara.</li>
            <li>lashes looked full, but funky....</li>
            <li>but it seems very close to my Younique mascarra that I use and spend a lot more money on.</li>
            <li>Really makes your eyelashes fuller and longer love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not waterproof but it lasts a good 10-12 hours and could last more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall good deal for the lash impaired.</li>
            <li>took almost a month to ship, nice case and attractive design, one tube was completely empty, the other tube was full, does the job and makes your lashes look great, just un pleased with time frame and empty tube</li>
            <li>love the item I love how full my lashes look after using the product compared to regular mascara</li>
            <li>The look is very natural and its easy!</li>
            <li>Now, it did take quite a while to get to me, but these have got to be the most amazing thing I have ever spent $7 on.</li>
            <li>I try to make my makeup routine quick, with this it takes a while longer.</li>
            <li>I see this to be similar, however I see that it thickens more than lengthens, as do many products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone wanting longer fuller lashes..... :)</li>
            <li>I love my lashes with Vakind and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and i didnt get the case that shows on here but other than that i love it!!</li>
            <li>I love the glue even just over normal mascara without the fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s makes lashes very pretty...</li>
            <li>Not near as good as the younique stuff.</li>
            <li>Next you apply more of the mascara from the big tube on top of the fibers which pulls them out towards the tips of your own lashes, extending them.  </li>
            <li>So I ordered these because they were a good price compared to other fibers, and they had the &amp;#34;transplant gel&amp;#34; The gel was more like a watery mascara and didn&#x27;t really help with the fibers.</li>
            <li>I think these are great for the price..shipping took about a month and a half though...</li>
            <li>It completely does exactly what it claims and my lashes look amazing.  </li>
            <li>I am buying 10 more just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out for a long time.</li>
            <li>They made my lashes look much longer and fuller and was fairly easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this so the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Overall LOVE it!</li>
            <li>even though the bottles are super cute, not a quality product, and the instructions weren&#x27;t clear.  </li>
            <li>But over all, great product and though it causes a little irritation from the fibers that can get in eye ... I still like it.</li>
            <li>I came across this brand, and decided at $6 it was worth the risk if I didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>Although the shipping took quite awhile it was still worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>Takes some practice to use, but worth the $5</li>
            <li>it makes lashes thicker , not much longer but, for the price it is good</li>
            <li>I liked this product, however, the second time I used it the fiber brush fell off and became STUCK inside the tube.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a problem with anything, I just simply had ants in my pants and was curious if they knew where in route my package was and they were awesome.</li>
            <li>If you have used fibers might be worth it</li>
            <li>but for the price it was worth it</li>
            <li>The case it comes in and the fibers are well worth the price I payed for it.</li>
            <li>But wasn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li>but I think I will have fun with theses</li>
            <li>Def worth the money I paid</li>
            <li>So for 2 weeks I guess I got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait</li>
            <li>but it was worth it 100% .</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Takes about a month to get in the mail but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>So worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will honestly become a daily part of my make-up</li>
            <li>Unless you want fibers falling all over your fresh makeup and in your eye I would go with younique 3D fibers.</li>
            <li>totally worth the money</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase..</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice and the actual tubes feel like metal which are sturdy but the product in itself is not quality..</li>
            <li>but well worth the money and time</li>
            <li>I love this product my lashes look long and full using this product!</li>
            <li>And it clumps up pretty quick as well, but</li>
            <li>So other then the fact that I had mistaken this for mascara this product works good.</li>
            <li>I saw my lashes had gone straight and to my original stubby form and fibers</li>
            <li>Fibers fall right off your lashes and into your eyes</li>
            <li>You just need to apply the right way.</li>
            <li>right becasue</li>
            <li>This went right into the garbage.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>You might not want this because of the long shipping, but for free shipping and the low price this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>i was excited but doesnt seem like theres much peoduct in the tubes also the fibers kept going into my eyes and stung, had to wash it off in the first 10 min.</li>
            <li>it still makes the lashes nice and long!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Also the packaging is so cute, does take a while for shipping so order a few at a time: ).</li>
            <li>I liked the lashes but the gel I got was already dry.</li>
            <li>First off it took a month to get to me.</li>
            <li>this is my first time trying this type of product.these</li>
            <li>I receive two mascara but the first one works but</li>
            <li>put on the gel mascara first like</li>
            <li>Kinda tricky to use at first</li>
            <li>You can do a youtube search on love alpha fiber mascara, they show before and afters and how tos.. its really simple.</li>
            <li>Step 1-You apply the transplanting gel first, step</li>
            <li>I really like this item!</li>
            <li>started looking for the same thing, but better price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty amazed by this.</li>
            <li>Would recommend spending the extra money to get a better one.</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic when I first ordered it..</li>
            <li>This kit arrived in the cute leopard case but instructions are in Chinese.</li>
            <li>Once I finally got it I was in love.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERY WOMAN!!</li>
            <li>Pretty good,love them.</li>
            <li>And yes I&#x27;m a real person!</li>
            <li>This was my first time ever trying a fiber mascara</li>
            <li>but I am a real person not a computer saying this I lovvvveeedd it!</li>
            <li>I like this pretty well.</li>
            <li>Regular mascara is 100 times better</li>
            <li>I love this product I ordered initially for the Mascara</li>
            <li>it also has fibre extensions in the Pretty carrying case ....</li>
            <li>My first fiber lash mascara</li>
            <li>I will most definitely continue to buy this brand.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I&#x27;m buying my sister one for Christmas!</li>
            <li>I love it especially for the money.</li>
            <li>And after the first time, you don&#x27;t need to look at the instructions anymore.</li>
            <li>I received it about a month after placing the order and the first time I tried it</li>
            <li>Also, I was only able to apply one coat.</li>
            <li>Im totally satisfied especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I like the design and the price is right, but every time I use it I feel like my eyes are very irritated.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply and didn&#x27;t really take long to do.  </li>
            <li>so far i honestly keep going back to THIS one and using it!  </li>
            <li>Just as good or even better than the expensive brand(s).</li>
            <li>Kind of fun, takes a few coats and some does flake off but after a while (probably an hour or so)</li>
            <li>There is is some fall when first applied, but wipe away with a cotton swab, and you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li>This came really really fast, and worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>The lashed look full and lush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use (even though the instructions are in Chinese) and just give you comfortable and long lashes.</li>
            <li>The instructions are not in english, however you can easily find tutorials on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Ok, There are so many &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; mascaras, but this one is NOT good at all.</li>
            <li>The instructions aren&#x27;t in English though, so I looked up an easy youtube tutorial for Youniqe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>They are awesome and make my lashes look so long thick.  </li>
            <li>A great product for the price, the same or less than you&#x27;d pay for any mascara in a supermarket or drugstore.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality</li>
            <li>your own little case..</li>
            <li>I recommend that you make up your eyes first then finish your face, that way, if you get any of the fibers or gel on your face you can use some makeup remover on a cotton ball or swab to clean it up...and not ruin your entire look when doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fibers don&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>which i was really waiting for i don&#x27;t know why the have a pic of a case if they not going to send it.</li>
            <li>but after that it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Also if you apply too much fiber you be shedding and dealing with falling flakes that can irritate eyes and skin.  </li>
            <li>it goes on much quicker.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really lengthen my lashes, just made them thicker.</li>
            <li>I personally didn&#x27;t enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>really crappy mascara.</li>
            <li>Fibers got in my eyes and contacts which was really irritating.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>of course, I could have applied it too much</li>
            <li>Received item fast too.</li>
            <li>and i really do like it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and will buy again!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought, nothing like the real 3d mascara</li>
            <li>The fibers weren&#x27;t really fibers.</li>
            <li>You can really get a flash eyelash look if you want.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say, this stuff works really well.</li>
            <li>I absolutely noticeably lengthens my lashes in just one coat.  </li>
            <li>Can this really lengthen your lashes like it says???</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t apply very well.</li>
            <li>It made my eyelashes so much longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>, I could not tell much difference at all.</li>
            <li>Cheap enough to try.  </li>
            <li>Love that i can add volume and length without glue and falselys but be careful not to get the fibers in your eye because it hurts</li>
            <li>Does not work very well.</li>
            <li>this product works really well.</li>
            <li>These really do make your lashes appear longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li>I have thinner lashes and this products makes them much fuller.</li>
            <li>Tried them on my daughter who has very find eyelashes</li>
            <li>I really have just started using this</li>
            <li>This product was really for me.</li>
            <li>fast shipping  but fiber falls off</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>The mascara is by far my favorite as it just makes the eyelashes really stand out as well as lasting all day.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand the hype.</li>
            <li>I noticed longer, but not so much thicker.</li>
            <li>what a joke this is absolute junk but get what you pay for</li>
            <li>mission accomplished</li>
            <li>Company it ships from was very concerned with my customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Fantastic quality similar to Younique but way cheaper will be buying again!</li>
            <li>The process of putting on the 3-D fiber lashes is very time consuming.</li>
            <li>I read so much about this.</li>
            <li>The fibers end up in your eyes a lot which is really counterproductive when you&#x27;re having to remove it bc</li>
            <li>However, the price was much much cheaper, 1/3 of the drugstore brand and 1/6 of a high price brand!</li>
            <li>Far more affordable than the younique product that does the same thing.</li>
            <li>I feel sorry for people that are wasting a lot of money on the more popular name brand versions.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely be buying more and its cheaper than the $30 younique brand and its the same exact product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t noticed a significant change in the volume or length of my lashes with 3 coats of this vs. 3 coats of regular mascara.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I love it</li>
            <li>Appears to be the same stuff as the Unique brand.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to received mine and finally got it after after waiting for a month.</li>
            <li>This product is an &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; product.. like many other reviews ive read, the fibers get all over ur face and some get in my eye.</li>
            <li>(and I live in the country&#x27;s most wet and humid place imaginable and sweat buckets when I go out dancing--which is specifically when I use this product).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to get off with just my natural almond soap and water (so if you have actual remover, it&#x27;ll be a snap), but it NEVER gave me raccoon eyes</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t make my lashes huge and spidery like some of the other fiber lash mascaras that I&#x27;ve seen advertised and they were much cheaper!</li>
            <li>I completely understand that some fibers are going to naturally fall, but the amount of fibers that is left on my face is almost more than are on my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I have beautiful long lashes without a huge price tag or fake looking adhesive lashes.</li>
            <li>its nice the tube with the lash fabrics goes onto your face :/</li>
            <li>full eyelashes such as these</li>
            <li>Overall, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the fence with this stuff, it looks pretty great when I first put it on, especially for a dramatic night time look.</li>
            <li>less is more.</li>
            <li>Mascara will pull off fiber and clump if you try to layer more on the following day or apply touch ups later in the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting either get back over the top or regular mascara to seal, but it pulls a Lil off in process...</li>
            <li>Decent for the price</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my eye lashes darker and more obvious.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money, same as the really over priced stuff because I have compared the two side by side.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Did not have high hopes for this but thought I would try it for the price.  </li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this mascara, but they didn&#x27;t play out.  </li>
            <li>I took a pic with regular mascara on one eye and this on the other - the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>the mascara has well quality although it is more of a natural look rather than extremely volumized eyelashes</li>
            <li>The fibers will flake off occasionally, but mostly when I&#x27;m adjusting the final look with a lash comb and then VERY minimally after several hours of wearing it (which I easily catch when I go freshen up and comb my hair--they sweep right away, and no one else notices them at all).</li>
            <li>...goes on smooth and a bit too wet.</li>
            <li>the natural fibers sometimes fall into my eyes or make this itchy, but that&#x27;s what happens if you put to much on or don&#x27;t seal it with transplanting gel.</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t normal.</li>
            <li>worth the price as well, mine were cheaper than regular mascara!!</li>
            <li>but it takes 2 times the amount of time it takes to put on normal mascara.</li>
            <li>it makes my eyelashes look long full and voluminous</li>
            <li>It is not hard to put on at all</li>
            <li>Loved it but only gave it a 4 star because of the fibers kinda flake off and make a mess if you are not careful when applying.</li>
            <li>One thing that put me off right away, is that the packet that had the instructions were all in an Asian</li>
            <li>The upper right is a picture of this product vs a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price and at least as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product, other than i did not get my case.</li>
            <li>Mascara is cheap and the other bottle is just a bottle of lint.</li>
            <li>Really cheap stuff- not like other varieties.</li>
            <li>Amazing product does exactly what the more expensive product does but for half the price.</li>
            <li>it was brand new</li>
            <li>Give you the super long soft look your looking for!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already reordered, not because I needed to, but because I&#x27;m afraid that when I run out,  I won&#x27;t be able to find anything better.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend for those with light or short lashes!</li>
            <li>The fiber comes out very clumpy and it&#x27;s kind of irritating to the eye.</li>
            <li>The case the product came in is really cute, otherwise I would list this as a complete waste.</li>
            <li>People even ask if they&#x27;re real because they are so unbelievable  full!</li>
            <li>and I try to apply as much of the gel and fiber in the first application before they dry and set.  </li>
            <li>I sell Younique and decided that I would try these, just to see if they were truly the same as our products, and I can tell you first hand</li>
            <li>After trying this mascara, wow!</li>
            <li>exactly the same quality as the $40 brand name fiber lashes...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty simple to figure out.</li>
            <li>, I put on regular mascara first then apply the gel then the fibers.</li>
            <li>Even though its cheap its not worth it</li>
            <li>I wear contact lense and have super sensitive eyes, but I haven&#x27;t had a single issue.  </li>
            <li>I liked this mascara the first couple times I tried it, but now the fibers just seem to fall off my lashes and leave them thin and short.</li>
            <li>The cost was low and the product was amazing only down side</li>
            <li>although it washes off easily keep eyes closed as mich as possible when removing ......</li>
            <li>I was excited about trying this product due to the price and the reviews!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hard to get more fibers on</li>
            <li>Takes a long time to apply, so I will probably only use the set on special occasions.</li>
            <li>and the tubes make a metal grinding sound when I twist the tubes open and closed.</li>
            <li>I like it as much as my regular mascara really.</li>
            <li>I like how I got it early</li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>It also appears that the fiber is already used up or old in some way.</li>
            <li>My lashes look real when I use this product, and I have gotten several compliments.</li>
            <li>so they are fairly sensitive so if you do not have sensitive eyes you may not have this reaction.</li>
            <li>but the second day they really did make my eyes sore and irritated.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive eyes..caution.</li>
            <li>I would go ahead and spend the money for the real deal next time.</li>
            <li>i always get wow</li>
            <li>but when it got here the finer part seemed like it was old and wouldn&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>As for the actual product, it works really well.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly fast shipping - received the next day when using my Prime.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter</li>
            <li>and it takes forever to come in, by the time I received the package I had completely forgot I had ordered it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46 years old and do not have the lashes I had in my 20s.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this product would not only make my lashes look longer, but thicker.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the product as far as using the mascara.  </li>
            <li>and I saved so much money compared to different brands.</li>
            <li>That is a complete turn off.  </li>
            <li>Younique is natural &amp; have no smell.</li>
            <li>but it flakes off so much that by mid day, my lashes looked like I had no mascara on.</li>
            <li>They really are tiny.  </li>
            <li>you have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply, at least on a second person.</li>
            <li>This mascara is a 3 step process and really does build up to long lush lashes if you are patient thru the process.</li>
            <li>If you like, you can then add more fiber from the small tube and then coat with the big tube.  </li>
            <li>Not a typical review writer but</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but after watching you tube videos on application, I tried and love this product.  </li>
            <li>product made my lashes look both fuller and longer, which I love because I feel cheated on the lash end of the gene pool (honestly my daily makeup usually includes falsies because of this).&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they actually came about a week before they were due, so pretty fast shipping for coming from overseas.</li>
            <li>I do like the effect though; I just don&#x27;t go to the trouble unless it&#x27;s a special occasion.</li>
            <li>But I was worried they would be difficult and messy but it was easy, quick and really made her eyes just pop!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, you use the bigger tube to apply a coat of mascara just as you normally would.  </li>
            <li>so I was only able to use one and didińt use it much because it had a very strong smell to it that made me sick!</li>
            <li>Fibers were very flaky and dry.</li>
            <li>Dried out quickly.</li>
            <li>Does make it look like I have mascara on, but nothing too major.</li>
            <li>I do recommend adding additional adhesive after the fibers have had a chance to dry as they can fall off, especially if its hot and humid like here in Miami.</li>
            <li>Went from stright blond lash to curled long vibrant lashes.</li>
            <li>There are barely any fibers in the tube</li>
            <li>WOW, I was skeptical at first, but it really does work and looks like real lashes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The fibers can get in your eyes if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>My eyes are so sensitive that I have to wear daily contacts because even contact solution bothers them.</li>
            <li>u can barely see</li>
            <li>First, you apply the regular mascara and then the fiber fluff.</li>
            <li>This will fix any of the fuzzy look normally but also pull off any fibers that were on the end actually making it look longer to result in a big fat nothing.</li>
            <li>I use regular mascara first while wet</li>
            <li>The picture in the upper left is this product vs my normal eye.</li>
            <li>and it was even better than false lashes.</li>
            <li>After experimenting for a few weeks with application I&#x27;ve decided that less is better</li>
            <li>I do get some flakes from fibers within the first half an hour of applying, but once I swipe those away, I do not see continued fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had a little bit of success with the later.</li>
            <li>Although I only spent around $5, I expected more since other people raved about this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I compared one eye with the fibers and one eye without, and you can seriously tell a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I was truly surprised by the results (and at such a low price).</li>
            <li>Not only does it make my lashes thicker and longer than my regular mascara, but it also looks really natural, and it stays on for two days</li>
            <li>Not the worst I have tried,  but far from the best.</li>
            <li>I love this fiber lash mascara, only downfall is that it does have a little fallout after you apply it, but just a little wipe away</li>
            <li>The little fibers really make your lashes longer!</li>
            <li>I would use it for special occasion type stuff if you have the patience to spend at least 5 minutes putting it on and then have time for the flakes to stop falling off.</li>
            <li>Not to impressed with these maybe I wasn&#x27;t doing it right but didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference they kept flaking off on my cheeks and eyes were itching like crazy after a couple of hours :(</li>
            <li>My Lashes look long and natural.  </li>
            <li>I find a third coat too much for me, but others might prefer the extreme length and fullness of a third coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does extend lashes and gives a false lash look, but can clump up very quickly</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice an extreme difference from regular mascara in appearance, but the main irritation was that the micro fibers were always getting in my eyes or falling onto my skin; not just during application but throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Use your normal mascara then put on the &amp;#34;transplanting gel&amp;#34; which is black and will color your lashes black but not change the way they look like real mascara.</li>

            <li> This is great stuff just as good as younique.</li>
            <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t buy YouNique fiber mascara because this is just as good!!!</li>
            <li> Very cute container and the product is in nice metal tubes, very good quality.  </li>
            <li> This is the best mascara i have ever used, it does expand your lashes and doesnt clump up and doesnt come of easily, nor does it smear ...</li>
            <li> But the product is great and kind of made up for the wait.</li>
            <li> Loved how it made lashes thicker, but Lil flakes come off on cheeks &amp; under eyes.</li>
            <li> Works good.  </li>
            <li> Results look good.</li>
            <li> The transplanting gel mascara is great on it&#x27;s own without using the fibers.</li>
            <li> As good as Younique brand fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> This product is as good as Younique (yes, I have used theirs as well).</li>
            <li> The product is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.</li>
            <li> good product for the price</li>
            <li> This is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Works as good as younique look up the youtube videos.</li>
            <li> The product is good.</li>
            <li> I just found something cheaper and works just as good.</li>
            <li> the product is good</li>
            <li> This is reallly good stuff.</li>
            <li> Good item.  </li>
            <li> its good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Super cute case!!!!</li>
            <li> love this mascara ,good quailty and looks great on every makeup style.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, you can get a very exotic \\&quot;falsie\\&quot; look with this stuff.</li>
            <li> and it comes very stylish.</li>
            <li> The cost was great and the mascara was ok</li>
            <li> On top of that the product doesn&#x27;t work as great as promised.</li>
            <li> so great value for a sometimes use..:)</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Was good for the knock off kind</li>
            <li> Although I think my daughter is beautiful, it always kind of bothered me that everyone implied that she couldn&#x27;t have gotten such beautiful lashes from a mom who is not as beautiful.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this product and how well it works!  </li>
            <li> I was not about to spend $30 on Younique&#x27;s fiber lash mascara, so I started looking for inexpensive fiber lash mascara and found Love Alpha!</li>

            <li> After my daughter was born though and came out with AMAZING lashes, people would always look at me and my husband and then say, &amp;#34;Where</li>
            <li> and you can see the amazing transformations for yourself.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I really enjoy it.</li>

            <li> This mascara is amazing.</li>
            <li> I had never used fiber lashes before but they&#x27;re amazing.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because the shipping took forever, like I forgot about it kind of forever.</li>
            <li> A good mascara worked better.</li>
            <li> It honestly works.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the more exspensive one.</li>
            <li> its okay, not as good as another brand i have but will do the job</li>
            <li> The shipper was extremely nice and resent my product after it got lost in the mail.</li>
            <li> The mascara is nice, but forget about using the fibers.  </li>
            <li> I liked this mascara, my kids also approve of it.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes huge and beautiful, and is easy to put on!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to my cute case to carry alone my mascara!!!</li>
            <li> Works good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Makes your eyelashes look super full and beautiful!</li>
            <li> so itd be nice if the gel held those lashes better</li>
            <li> by far the best mascara ever!</li>
            <li> Amazing product I love this...</li>
            <li> easy and cute packaging!</li>
            <li> This product is great ladies not expensive.</li>
            <li> Will most certainly be buying again!!!!</li>
            <li> then you apply the fibers as many coats as You like to get the desired lenghth and fullness xomes off easily with warm water ....</li>
            <li> I had seen many, many advertisements for Younique fiber mascara and always wanted to try it, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend the $30 for something I may not like.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love.  </li>
            <li> I just could not see myself spending $30 on these fibers and not knowing for sure</li>
            <li> I am 150% satisfied with this product and my purchase.</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> especially after most of the reviews said that this was an awesome mascara.  </li>
            <li> absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not at all satisfied.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff, will order it over and over again.</li>
            <li> Not so hot...doesn&#x27;t work any better than drugstore products.</li>
            <li> Also, overall great customer service!</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this and the case is a great bonus</li>
            <li> I love how I go from almost no eyelashes to</li>

            <li> Why do I have to add more words.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Your favorite Mascara.  </li>
            <li> optional* top off with waterproof mascara to seal.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine the Younique could be any better than this.</li>
            <li> i fell in love i didnt want to have to be committed to spendin 30+</li>
            <li> i wish the smell wasnt so offensive (mostly cuz it just scares me about what the heck its made out of...</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> I love the product and would have given it a 5 star</li>
            <li> But its towards the end of the use so its OK.</li>
            <li> I did ok on day one</li>
            <li> Everyone gave it great reviews, but $30 dollars really?????</li>
            <li> When I learn to use it properly it will be wonderful.</li>
            <li> all mine :-)</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> It has become my favorite and that is saying something as I sell MaryKay products(including mascara).</li>
            <li> Maybe others are better at applying it....</li>
            <li> I love the lusher lashes but these fibers flake quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this mascara.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason this is so cheap!</li>
            <li> Younique is definitely a better choice</li>
            <li> I just have to be more patient in applyi</li>
            <li> This works fabulously!</li>
            <li> Started with the serum, then layered the fibers on top.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with them anyway before leaving the house.</li>
            <li> I ordered more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I love the case and design.  </li>
            <li> I love these lashes.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> great price and beautiful color and lengthening but not worth it</li>
            <li> but mostly they will  just look fuzzy.</li>
            <li> I love this and will continue to purchase it over and over.</li>
            <li> :) I gave it 4 Stars because it didn&#x27;t come with the Case .:</li>
            <li> I love the way my lashes look with this product.</li>
            <li> I already ordered more.</li>
            <li> I would recommend two coats for more fuller lashes</li>
            <li> will be ordering from here a lot more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten sooo many compliments.</li>
            <li> BUT the product i LOVE.</li>
            <li> But it was ok because someone posted instructions in their review.  </li>
            <li> Although it may flake and yo can see the fibers on your eyelids, all you have to do is coat your lashes with your favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> then apply the fiber adhesive then the fibers; keep repeating until you reach your desired length and then go over it with your favorite mascara again to seal in the fibers.  </li>
            <li> For more help there are tutorials on YouTube that I found helpful.</li>
            <li> And you can repeat the gel and fibers for more oomph.</li>
            <li> Thought I would order some more.</li>
            <li> Flakes off on top of everything else, Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> glad I bought the item when I did</li>
            <li> Love it wish I knew about it sooner.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> The packaging is adorable as well.</li>
            <li> Was a favorite as for my granddaughter wishes.</li>
            <li> I will gladly buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;oy</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I would honestly say that this is very comparable and waaaaaaay cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> but this mascara out them at full bloom LOVE!</li>
            <li> The case it comes in is super cute!</li>
            <li> wondering how my eye lashes got so long lmao!!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good</li>
            <li> While this mascara is not a miracle, I will admit that the difference in my lashes is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use the gel by itself and I love how it easily comes off..</li>
            <li> But when I wake up, the product of course isn&#x27;t going to look as good as the day applied, but it looks as good as my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> this stuff works GREAT and both my husband and my daughter on separate occasions commented on how full and pretty my eyelashes looked (they had no idea i had purchased this stuff)...</li>
            <li> As great as it would be to help a friend out and get lush lashes to boot, I don&#x27;t have $25 to spend on mascara.  </li>
            <li> Next you repeat step 1, and if you want them longer, step 2 may be applied to the tips and so on until you reached your ideal look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy so far with this product.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product for fabulous lashes!</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than their competitors but just as good.</li>
            <li> i loved for one how fast i got it and two</li>
            <li> The price was right!!</li>
            <li> The price is right and the product is amazing.</li>
            <li> goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t clump, make my eyes water or burn.</li>
            <li> on easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and Easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Its easy to aply</li>
            <li> Easy application.</li>
            <li> I love this product it really works and the price is amazing</li>
            <li> but it does flake easy</li>
            <li> The brush on the fibers is also too long and you cant put them on very good.</li>
            <li> The shipping takes a while so make sure to order another right when you get one!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll be buying more right now!</li>
            <li> normally I have good wear for about 8- 10 hours.</li>
            <li> and I really liked it for the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li> It does make my lashes longer and more full, but the fibers tend to smear at the bottom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better that you pay full price for younique.</li>
            <li> Not super impressed with the results of this kit....</li>
            <li> The fibers were fine but often didnt stick to the gel, gets clumpy</li>
            <li> So cheap and SO easy to use.</li>
            <li> Super cheap!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted with fast shipping and cute packaging!</li>
            <li> (cheap is fine</li>
            <li> Great product that I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is a very cost effective fiber mascara option.</li>
            <li> hope it is always available .</li>
            <li> but it was cheaply made.</li>
            <li> My friend sells Younique make-up and is always posting pictures online of the fabulous mascara.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the Look it gives me.</li>
            <li> I think a great mascara will do the same.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a different brand before, so this was great.</li>
            <li> Maybe cause it a cheap price, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> but the larger one is great.</li>
            <li> For how cheap they are it did was it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure my wait won&#x27;t be worth it</li>
            <li> just remember to put the fiber on 2nd lol</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal.</li>
            <li> I would not invest money on these, they may be cheap</li>
            <li> All I do is take a shower and lightly wash my face and the mascara just slides off..</li>
            <li> Better than regular mascara but not as good as I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Wonderful price people are selling this thing for $30 which is good because the product really works thick long beautiful lashes</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say much more other than the seller is AWESOME at customer service.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, The case is stylish!</li>
            <li> first then I used this product it works wonders!!</li>
            <li> very worth the month</li>
            <li> Liked it right away on first use.  </li>
            <li> I received so many compliments on the length of my eyelashes the first day I used this.  </li>
            <li> It took 5 weeks to arrive and I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li> so I was excited.</li>
            <li> Transplant gel works great as a mascara, makes lashes extremely long.</li>
            <li> So I was really excited.</li>
            <li> but it was sooo worth the wait!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to use it, came before delivery date too.</li>
            <li> I find it interesting that the box, tube size/ shape, and the consistancy of the product seems to match exactly.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed as you get what you pay for.. plus</li>
            <li> I always have a qtip with me and clean around per application.</li>
            <li> So, be prepared that you might have to clean and reapply any foundation you&#x27;ve applied after using this product.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure u put either a coat of ur own mascara or the gel on last</li>
            <li> The fibers are amazing, very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> Ok but not as good as other fiber lash products out there.</li>
            <li> so I can retire my falsies until special events.</li>
            <li> If used right, it works wonders!</li>
            <li> Its super easy to use, the case is fun</li>
            <li> although i saw results with the younique brand one, i feel like my results with the lovealpha brand are even more dramatic :D  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this product, was super excited</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this and had very high hopes of it being comparable to Younique</li>
            <li> I purchased pink one and it worked so great</li>
            <li> Its an amazing product , but , the  natural fibers continue to get into my eyes.</li>
            <li> Now I no longer need to envy my daughters lashes with full youthful lashes in this tube.</li>
            <li> ur lashes and tgey get on ur under eyes but overall its good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend much on this</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make them longer just bought cover girl bombshell and works better than these mascara.</li>
            <li> lashes looked full, but funky....</li>
            <li> but it seems very close to my Younique mascarra that I use and spend a lot more money on.</li>
            <li> Really makes your eyelashes fuller and longer love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof but it lasts a good 10-12 hours and could last more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall good deal for the lash impaired.</li>
            <li> took almost a month to ship, nice case and attractive design, one tube was completely empty, the other tube was full, does the job and makes your lashes look great, just un pleased with time frame and empty tube</li>
            <li> love the item I love how full my lashes look after using the product compared to regular mascara</li>
            <li> The look is very natural and its easy!</li>
            <li> Now, it did take quite a while to get to me, but these have got to be the most amazing thing I have ever spent $7 on.</li>
            <li> I try to make my makeup routine quick, with this it takes a while longer.</li>
            <li> I see this to be similar, however I see that it thickens more than lengthens, as do many products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone wanting longer fuller lashes..... :)</li>
            <li> I love my lashes with Vakind and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and i didnt get the case that shows on here but other than that i love it!!</li>
            <li> I love the glue even just over normal mascara without the fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s makes lashes very pretty...</li>
            <li> Not near as good as the younique stuff.</li>
            <li> Next you apply more of the mascara from the big tube on top of the fibers which pulls them out towards the tips of your own lashes, extending them.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered these because they were a good price compared to other fibers, and they had the &amp;#34;transplant gel&amp;#34; The gel was more like a watery mascara and didn&#x27;t really help with the fibers.</li>
            <li> I think these are great for the price..shipping took about a month and a half though...</li>
            <li> It completely does exactly what it claims and my lashes look amazing.  </li>
            <li> I am buying 10 more just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out for a long time.</li>
            <li> They made my lashes look much longer and fuller and was fairly easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this so the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Overall LOVE it!</li>
            <li> even though the bottles are super cute, not a quality product, and the instructions weren&#x27;t clear.  </li>
            <li> But over all, great product and though it causes a little irritation from the fibers that can get in eye ... I still like it.</li>
            <li> I came across this brand, and decided at $6 it was worth the risk if I didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> Although the shipping took quite awhile it was still worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> Takes some practice to use, but worth the $5</li>
            <li> it makes lashes thicker , not much longer but, for the price it is good</li>
            <li> I liked this product, however, the second time I used it the fiber brush fell off and became STUCK inside the tube.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with anything, I just simply had ants in my pants and was curious if they knew where in route my package was and they were awesome.</li>
            <li> If you have used fibers might be worth it</li>
            <li> but for the price it was worth it</li>
            <li> The case it comes in and the fibers are well worth the price I payed for it.</li>
            <li> But wasn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li> but I think I will have fun with theses</li>
            <li> Def worth the money I paid</li>
            <li> So for 2 weeks I guess I got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait</li>
            <li> but it was worth it 100% .</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Takes about a month to get in the mail but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> So worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will honestly become a daily part of my make-up</li>
            <li> Unless you want fibers falling all over your fresh makeup and in your eye I would go with younique 3D fibers.</li>
            <li> totally worth the money</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase..</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice and the actual tubes feel like metal which are sturdy but the product in itself is not quality..</li>
            <li> but well worth the money and time</li>
            <li> I love this product my lashes look long and full using this product!</li>
            <li> And it clumps up pretty quick as well, but</li>
            <li> So other then the fact that I had mistaken this for mascara this product works good.</li>
            <li> I saw my lashes had gone straight and to my original stubby form and fibers</li>
            <li> Fibers fall right off your lashes and into your eyes</li>
            <li> You just need to apply the right way.</li>
            <li> right becasue</li>
            <li> This went right into the garbage.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> You might not want this because of the long shipping, but for free shipping and the low price this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> i was excited but doesnt seem like theres much peoduct in the tubes also the fibers kept going into my eyes and stung, had to wash it off in the first 10 min.</li>
            <li> it still makes the lashes nice and long!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Also the packaging is so cute, does take a while for shipping so order a few at a time: ).</li>
            <li> I liked the lashes but the gel I got was already dry.</li>
            <li> First off it took a month to get to me.</li>
            <li> this is my first time trying this type of product.these</li>
            <li> I receive two mascara but the first one works but</li>
            <li> put on the gel mascara first like</li>
            <li> Kinda tricky to use at first</li>
            <li> You can do a youtube search on love alpha fiber mascara, they show before and afters and how tos.. its really simple.</li>
            <li> Step 1-You apply the transplanting gel first, step</li>
            <li> I really like this item!</li>
            <li> started looking for the same thing, but better price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty amazed by this.</li>
            <li> Would recommend spending the extra money to get a better one.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic when I first ordered it..</li>
            <li> This kit arrived in the cute leopard case but instructions are in Chinese.</li>
            <li> Once I finally got it I was in love.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERY WOMAN!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good,love them.</li>
            <li> And yes I&#x27;m a real person!</li>
            <li> This was my first time ever trying a fiber mascara</li>
            <li> but I am a real person not a computer saying this I lovvvveeedd it!</li>
            <li> I like this pretty well.</li>
            <li> Regular mascara is 100 times better</li>
            <li> I love this product I ordered initially for the Mascara</li>
            <li> it also has fibre extensions in the Pretty carrying case ....</li>
            <li> My first fiber lash mascara</li>
            <li> I will most definitely continue to buy this brand.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I&#x27;m buying my sister one for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I love it especially for the money.</li>
            <li> And after the first time, you don&#x27;t need to look at the instructions anymore.</li>
            <li> I received it about a month after placing the order and the first time I tried it</li>
            <li> Also, I was only able to apply one coat.</li>
            <li> Im totally satisfied especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I like the design and the price is right, but every time I use it I feel like my eyes are very irritated.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to apply and didn&#x27;t really take long to do.  </li>
            <li> so far i honestly keep going back to THIS one and using it!  </li>
            <li> Just as good or even better than the expensive brand(s).</li>
            <li> Kind of fun, takes a few coats and some does flake off but after a while (probably an hour or so)</li>
            <li> There is is some fall when first applied, but wipe away with a cotton swab, and you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li> This came really really fast, and worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> The lashed look full and lush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use (even though the instructions are in Chinese) and just give you comfortable and long lashes.</li>
            <li> The instructions are not in english, however you can easily find tutorials on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Ok, There are so many &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; mascaras, but this one is NOT good at all.</li>
            <li> The instructions aren&#x27;t in English though, so I looked up an easy youtube tutorial for Youniqe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> They are awesome and make my lashes look so long thick.  </li>
            <li> A great product for the price, the same or less than you&#x27;d pay for any mascara in a supermarket or drugstore.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality</li>
            <li> your own little case..</li>
            <li> I recommend that you make up your eyes first then finish your face, that way, if you get any of the fibers or gel on your face you can use some makeup remover on a cotton ball or swab to clean it up...and not ruin your entire look when doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fibers don&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li> It really works</li>
            <li> which i was really waiting for i don&#x27;t know why the have a pic of a case if they not going to send it.</li>
            <li> but after that it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Also if you apply too much fiber you be shedding and dealing with falling flakes that can irritate eyes and skin.  </li>
            <li> it goes on much quicker.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really lengthen my lashes, just made them thicker.</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> really crappy mascara.</li>
            <li> Fibers got in my eyes and contacts which was really irritating.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> of course, I could have applied it too much</li>
            <li> Received item fast too.</li>
            <li> and i really do like it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and will buy again!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought, nothing like the real 3d mascara</li>
            <li> The fibers weren&#x27;t really fibers.</li>
            <li> You can really get a flash eyelash look if you want.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say, this stuff works really well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely noticeably lengthens my lashes in just one coat.  </li>
            <li> Can this really lengthen your lashes like it says???</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t apply very well.</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes so much longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> , I could not tell much difference at all.</li>
            <li> Cheap enough to try.  </li>
            <li> Love that i can add volume and length without glue and falselys but be careful not to get the fibers in your eye because it hurts</li>
            <li> Does not work very well.</li>
            <li> this product works really well.</li>
            <li> These really do make your lashes appear longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have thinner lashes and this products makes them much fuller.</li>
            <li> Tried them on my daughter who has very find eyelashes</li>
            <li> I really have just started using this</li>
            <li> This product was really for me.</li>
            <li> fast shipping  but fiber falls off</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> The mascara is by far my favorite as it just makes the eyelashes really stand out as well as lasting all day.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the hype.</li>
            <li> I noticed longer, but not so much thicker.</li>
            <li> what a joke this is absolute junk but get what you pay for</li>
            <li> mission accomplished</li>
            <li> Company it ships from was very concerned with my customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality similar to Younique but way cheaper will be buying again!</li>
            <li> The process of putting on the 3-D fiber lashes is very time consuming.</li>
            <li> I read so much about this.</li>
            <li> The fibers end up in your eyes a lot which is really counterproductive when you&#x27;re having to remove it bc</li>
            <li> However, the price was much much cheaper, 1/3 of the drugstore brand and 1/6 of a high price brand!</li>
            <li> Far more affordable than the younique product that does the same thing.</li>
            <li> I feel sorry for people that are wasting a lot of money on the more popular name brand versions.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely be buying more and its cheaper than the $30 younique brand and its the same exact product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t noticed a significant change in the volume or length of my lashes with 3 coats of this vs. 3 coats of regular mascara.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I love it</li>
            <li> Appears to be the same stuff as the Unique brand.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to received mine and finally got it after after waiting for a month.</li>
            <li> This product is an &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; product.. like many other reviews ive read, the fibers get all over ur face and some get in my eye.</li>
            <li> (and I live in the country&#x27;s most wet and humid place imaginable and sweat buckets when I go out dancing--which is specifically when I use this product).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to get off with just my natural almond soap and water (so if you have actual remover, it&#x27;ll be a snap), but it NEVER gave me raccoon eyes</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make my lashes huge and spidery like some of the other fiber lash mascaras that I&#x27;ve seen advertised and they were much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I completely understand that some fibers are going to naturally fall, but the amount of fibers that is left on my face is almost more than are on my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I have beautiful long lashes without a huge price tag or fake looking adhesive lashes.</li>
            <li> its nice the tube with the lash fabrics goes onto your face :/</li>
            <li> full eyelashes such as these</li>
            <li> Overall, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence with this stuff, it looks pretty great when I first put it on, especially for a dramatic night time look.</li>
            <li> less is more.</li>
            <li> Mascara will pull off fiber and clump if you try to layer more on the following day or apply touch ups later in the day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting either get back over the top or regular mascara to seal, but it pulls a Lil off in process...</li>
            <li> Decent for the price</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my eye lashes darker and more obvious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money, same as the really over priced stuff because I have compared the two side by side.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Did not have high hopes for this but thought I would try it for the price.  </li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this mascara, but they didn&#x27;t play out.  </li>
            <li> I took a pic with regular mascara on one eye and this on the other - the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> the mascara has well quality although it is more of a natural look rather than extremely volumized eyelashes</li>
            <li> The fibers will flake off occasionally, but mostly when I&#x27;m adjusting the final look with a lash comb and then VERY minimally after several hours of wearing it (which I easily catch when I go freshen up and comb my hair--they sweep right away, and no one else notices them at all).</li>
            <li> ...goes on smooth and a bit too wet.</li>
            <li> the natural fibers sometimes fall into my eyes or make this itchy, but that&#x27;s what happens if you put to much on or don&#x27;t seal it with transplanting gel.</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t normal.</li>
            <li> worth the price as well, mine were cheaper than regular mascara!!</li>
            <li> but it takes 2 times the amount of time it takes to put on normal mascara.</li>
            <li> it makes my eyelashes look long full and voluminous</li>
            <li> It is not hard to put on at all</li>
            <li> Loved it but only gave it a 4 star because of the fibers kinda flake off and make a mess if you are not careful when applying.</li>
            <li> One thing that put me off right away, is that the packet that had the instructions were all in an Asian</li>
            <li> The upper right is a picture of this product vs a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price and at least as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, other than i did not get my case.</li>
            <li> Mascara is cheap and the other bottle is just a bottle of lint.</li>
            <li> Really cheap stuff- not like other varieties.</li>
            <li> Amazing product does exactly what the more expensive product does but for half the price.</li>
            <li> it was brand new</li>
            <li> Give you the super long soft look your looking for!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already reordered, not because I needed to, but because I&#x27;m afraid that when I run out,  I won&#x27;t be able to find anything better.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend for those with light or short lashes!</li>
            <li> The fiber comes out very clumpy and it&#x27;s kind of irritating to the eye.</li>
            <li> The case the product came in is really cute, otherwise I would list this as a complete waste.</li>
            <li> People even ask if they&#x27;re real because they are so unbelievable  full!</li>
            <li> and I try to apply as much of the gel and fiber in the first application before they dry and set.  </li>
            <li> I sell Younique and decided that I would try these, just to see if they were truly the same as our products, and I can tell you first hand</li>
            <li> After trying this mascara, wow!</li>
            <li> exactly the same quality as the $40 brand name fiber lashes...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty simple to figure out.</li>
            <li> , I put on regular mascara first then apply the gel then the fibers.</li>
            <li> Even though its cheap its not worth it</li>
            <li> I wear contact lense and have super sensitive eyes, but I haven&#x27;t had a single issue.  </li>
            <li> I liked this mascara the first couple times I tried it, but now the fibers just seem to fall off my lashes and leave them thin and short.</li>
            <li> The cost was low and the product was amazing only down side</li>
            <li> although it washes off easily keep eyes closed as mich as possible when removing ......</li>
            <li> I was excited about trying this product due to the price and the reviews!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get more fibers on</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to apply, so I will probably only use the set on special occasions.</li>
            <li> and the tubes make a metal grinding sound when I twist the tubes open and closed.</li>
            <li> I like it as much as my regular mascara really.</li>
            <li> I like how I got it early</li>
            <li> I was surprised.</li>
            <li> It also appears that the fiber is already used up or old in some way.</li>
            <li> My lashes look real when I use this product, and I have gotten several compliments.</li>
            <li> so they are fairly sensitive so if you do not have sensitive eyes you may not have this reaction.</li>
            <li> but the second day they really did make my eyes sore and irritated.</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive eyes..caution.</li>
            <li> I would go ahead and spend the money for the real deal next time.</li>
            <li> i always get wow</li>
            <li> but when it got here the finer part seemed like it was old and wouldn&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> As for the actual product, it works really well.  </li>
            <li> Incredibly fast shipping - received the next day when using my Prime.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter</li>
            <li> and it takes forever to come in, by the time I received the package I had completely forgot I had ordered it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 years old and do not have the lashes I had in my 20s.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this product would not only make my lashes look longer, but thicker.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the product as far as using the mascara.  </li>
            <li> and I saved so much money compared to different brands.</li>
            <li> That is a complete turn off.  </li>
            <li> Younique is natural &amp; have no smell.</li>
            <li> but it flakes off so much that by mid day, my lashes looked like I had no mascara on.</li>
            <li> They really are tiny.  </li>
            <li> you have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> It was very easy to apply, at least on a second person.</li>
            <li> This mascara is a 3 step process and really does build up to long lush lashes if you are patient thru the process.</li>
            <li> If you like, you can then add more fiber from the small tube and then coat with the big tube.  </li>
            <li> Not a typical review writer but</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after watching you tube videos on application, I tried and love this product.  </li>
            <li> product made my lashes look both fuller and longer, which I love because I feel cheated on the lash end of the gene pool (honestly my daily makeup usually includes falsies because of this).&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they actually came about a week before they were due, so pretty fast shipping for coming from overseas.</li>
            <li> I do like the effect though; I just don&#x27;t go to the trouble unless it&#x27;s a special occasion.</li>
            <li> But I was worried they would be difficult and messy but it was easy, quick and really made her eyes just pop!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, you use the bigger tube to apply a coat of mascara just as you normally would.  </li>
            <li> so I was only able to use one and didińt use it much because it had a very strong smell to it that made me sick!</li>
            <li> Fibers were very flaky and dry.</li>
            <li> Dried out quickly.</li>
            <li> Does make it look like I have mascara on, but nothing too major.</li>
            <li> I do recommend adding additional adhesive after the fibers have had a chance to dry as they can fall off, especially if its hot and humid like here in Miami.</li>
            <li> Went from stright blond lash to curled long vibrant lashes.</li>
            <li> There are barely any fibers in the tube</li>
            <li> WOW, I was skeptical at first, but it really does work and looks like real lashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The fibers can get in your eyes if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> My eyes are so sensitive that I have to wear daily contacts because even contact solution bothers them.</li>
            <li> u can barely see</li>
            <li> First, you apply the regular mascara and then the fiber fluff.</li>
            <li> This will fix any of the fuzzy look normally but also pull off any fibers that were on the end actually making it look longer to result in a big fat nothing.</li>
            <li> I use regular mascara first while wet</li>
            <li> The picture in the upper left is this product vs my normal eye.</li>
            <li> and it was even better than false lashes.</li>
            <li> After experimenting for a few weeks with application I&#x27;ve decided that less is better</li>
            <li> I do get some flakes from fibers within the first half an hour of applying, but once I swipe those away, I do not see continued fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had a little bit of success with the later.</li>
            <li> Although I only spent around $5, I expected more since other people raved about this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I compared one eye with the fibers and one eye without, and you can seriously tell a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I was truly surprised by the results (and at such a low price).</li>
            <li> Not only does it make my lashes thicker and longer than my regular mascara, but it also looks really natural, and it stays on for two days</li>
            <li> Not the worst I have tried,  but far from the best.</li>
            <li> I love this fiber lash mascara, only downfall is that it does have a little fallout after you apply it, but just a little wipe away</li>
            <li> The little fibers really make your lashes longer!</li>
            <li> I would use it for special occasion type stuff if you have the patience to spend at least 5 minutes putting it on and then have time for the flakes to stop falling off.</li>
            <li> Not to impressed with these maybe I wasn&#x27;t doing it right but didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference they kept flaking off on my cheeks and eyes were itching like crazy after a couple of hours :(</li>
            <li> My Lashes look long and natural.  </li>
            <li> I find a third coat too much for me, but others might prefer the extreme length and fullness of a third coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does extend lashes and gives a false lash look, but can clump up very quickly</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice an extreme difference from regular mascara in appearance, but the main irritation was that the micro fibers were always getting in my eyes or falling onto my skin; not just during application but throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Use your normal mascara then put on the &amp;#34;transplanting gel&amp;#34; which is black and will color your lashes black but not change the way they look like real mascara.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to clean off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the fibers, they don&#x27;t stick all that great unless you put a lot of the mascara on...more than usual.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference from the mascara that I usually use (loreal double extend mascara).</li>
            <li> I was worried about the fibers slightly because I do wear contacts which are very sensitive to anything getting in your eye</li>
            <li> Does take a little longer than normal mascara to apply but now that I found a balance</li>
            <li> Certainly this is MUCH less expensive than the original product.</li>
            <li> If you want to pay for flaky, hard lashes, be my guest, otherwise visit a Younique representative and order the real thing!</li>
            <li> However the fiber lash part is hard to get off, and it ran out after the first use.</li>
            <li> i really did notice a dramatic increase in lenght with this product though so in my opinion its worth a little irritaion every now and then, it didnt make my eyes red or anything.</li>
            <li> For only six dollars you will not believe how long it makes your lashes.</li>
            <li> It does last long though..</li>
            <li> ; extra long lashes look.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive eyes and was a little cautious about trying this.  </li>
            <li> The only down side was that the instructions are only in Chinese, no english translation.  </li>
            <li> It makes them not only long, but thicker looking as well!</li>
            <li> Junk...doesn&#x27;t work,very disappointed !,,, buy the good stuff this is a wast of money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically putting a clear mascara on your lashes and then black lint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry and doesn&#x27;t last, also flakes.</li>
            <li> The bottom right is standard false eyelashes that I wear.</li>
            <li> use the black gel to color my lower lashes because my eyelashes are fairly long naturally</li>
            <li> So I just my fiber 3d mascara after waiting a month to be ship to me due to being exported from CHINA this mascara has the good and the bad</li>
            <li> Eyelashes look natural, little clumping if any.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I can&#x27;t use it - not for daily wear, not for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Flaked everywhere, did not last, did not really increase lash length.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lashes incredibly long.</li>
            <li> If you take your time doing your eyelashes, you can make them really long.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what I have been looking for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a natural product like Y.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> I took off one star because the shipping took so long</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t get the long lash effect and it took a month to get to my house.</li>
            <li> if this less expensive stuff worked better or just as well.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t about to spend $40 on the stuff that she buys when I&#x27;m sure that this is equivalent and a LOT less expensive.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t have the money to just waste on dry and old products.</li>
            <li> I hate the fibers because they can spread on your face because they look like fuzzies to me but other than that it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> yes it give you that amazing long eyelashes look bad part fiber starts falling down to your eye and irritate you got red eye</li>
            <li> The other actually worked.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews, the instructions are in Chinese; however, I did find a video on YouTubewhich illustrated the process.</li>
            <li> The only con, which is no big deal to me, is that after hours of wear, you may see a little fiber break off on your cheek.  </li>
            <li> Does a better job than the expensive brands!</li>
            <li> They do add length but the little fibers gets in your eyes and causes iratation, I have better results with fake eye lashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes looked twice as long with this without even curling them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving a 4 star because I think it works similarly to other products, such as drugstore 1 step brands.</li>
            <li> Yes it took a VERY long time to get it</li>
            <li> but be very careful or you also get the tiny fibers in your eyes!</li>
            <li> But if you get the adhesive on and everything dry it wont be a problem.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t biyt this it came dry and it does nothing to eyelashes</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re dry and flakey and don&#x27;t work at all with the mascara.</li>
            <li> The results were a dry, brittle, spider look that flaked onto my under eyes and cheeks.</li>
            <li> the mascara is dry.</li>
            <li> the gel is dry and the fibers fall off under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Do one eye at a time, though, so the gel stuff doesn&#x27;t dry on you before you use the fibers.</li>
            <li> One of the mascara came supper dry</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend buying in bulk due to how long it takes to get to you!!</li>
            <li> DID NOT LIVE UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS</li>
            <li> Basically you get two tubes, one is regular mascara and the other is a tube of fluff.</li>
            <li> So I had red, irritated eyes with dark smudges everywhere.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s basically useless, which is really unfortunate because this could have been a really good deal considering the low price.</li>
            <li> the quality of shelles are not as good as picture and my expectation, it feels very rough, a big different with my previous one which I brought in store in China, it make me a little bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I assume it is the loose fibers.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the fibers sometimes get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Both were completely dry!</li>
            <li> No worries about getting it in your eyes, there is a tool to aid with application if you hands are not steady. .</li>
            <li> No need to buy the really expensive beans when this one gives you exactly the same results.</li>
            <li> Wet then dry immediately after.</li>
            <li> not like the transplanting gel, it was very dry.</li>
            <li> I spend an extra 2 minutes after I use the product scrubbing my face from all the little fibers.  </li>
            <li> but didn&#x27;t see the point to the other since it was completely dry</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the issues some people did no rash, no flaking off, it didn&#x27;t seem old or hard</li>
            <li> It came in empty and one brush was destroyed.  </li>
            <li> Big waste of money.</li>
            <li> the second one all dried out.</li>
            <li> I expected it to come with the case</li>
            <li> 2- then, while its still wet, apply the fibers just like you would a mascara.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> one of them is even empty</li>
            <li> 1timer I saw theses on Facebook and was curious</li>
            <li> It was delivered way before the expected date</li>
            <li> I got it way sooner then was expected.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s to be expected since there are fibers staying on the wand.</li>
            <li> just want to be careful not to ger the fibers in Your eyes as for Myself</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a brush in an empty tube.</li>
            <li> fibers were empty.</li>
            <li> Product comes empty and takes for ever to arrive</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it will flake off as the day goes on , (or if you cry).. it wont run like regular mascara, but you will notice slight smudging along with the tiny black fibers.</li>
            <li> My little secret ;)</li>
            <li> the cap wasn not really close tight and the one I got was dry.</li>
            <li> It does make ur eyelashes look very long but the black fibers end up on ur face and in ur eyes also ur eyelash look clumpy and mushed together</li>
            <li> makes your lashes extra thick and long.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashed longer the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because during the day I get little black fibers under my eyes..,</li>
            <li> other people said about this thing.</li>
            <li> but, this product was nothing like the other one.</li>
            <li> You might want to look into other brands.</li>
            <li> Then use the small tube using the same motions to place the fibers on your lashes.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to always start and end with the big tube sandwiching the small tube process in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First you have to apply fake &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; then cover it with the mascara.</li>
            <li> Other mascaras like this go for 30.00</li>
            <li> not worth the money i spent and the time waiting.</li>
            <li> Do other eye</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wanna use any other one ever again .</li>
            <li> Other products like this are around $25.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day after my other make up has rubbed off my mascara is still intact..</li>
            <li> Skip it and purchase pink instead!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have any other fiber mascara to compare it to.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it a 5 star is because I think the transplanting gel is a little dried out.</li>
            <li> Other then it taking a month and a half to get to me</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Any negative reviews you are reading on this product MAY be from people who did not apply the product properly or people expecting a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint with this is that the directions are all in Chinese</li>
            <li> I had to do at least 10 coats for it to actually show.</li>
            <li> its not worth the wait &amp; price.</li>
            <li> in fact fake lashes are much easier to put on and wear and take off.</li>
            <li> fallen down my eye and had to discontinue it after just one use do to doctor order</li>
            <li> Extremely dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical due to low price and mixed reviews</li>
            <li> Fibers were dry, and item was 3 weeks past the estimated arrival time.</li>
            <li> Too bad, I was really excited about it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the little fibers end up under your eyes sometimes</li>
            <li> The other one was half way dried out and clumpy.</li>
            <li> The fibers are all over your face by the end of the day and it looks like you have black eyes</li>
            <li> I previously researched.)</li>
            <li> They did give a fuller appearance but not super drastic.</li>
            <li> Received this after about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> This makes me wonder/worry that it was used previously.  </li>
            <li> Half of my office has bought this product because of me.</li>
            <li> Feels/smells like I&#x27;m putting black paint in my lashes.</li>
            <li> Especially for this price, it&#x27;s such a step up from mascara without going the fake lashes route.</li>
            <li> Millions of little fibers fall down from your lashes and you look like you have black dandruff all over your face periodically throughout the day.</li>
            <li> does make lashes a little longer but some curls down and sideways</li>
            <li> It kinda mess me up there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess to take off.  </li>
            <li> Gel is black and a little stringy</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> can cause a little irritation if you get any in your eyes</li>
            <li> I wear contacts though and the little fiber lashes sometimes bug my eyes</li>
            <li> Yes, it does flake a little</li>
            <li> and im still not sure what the other one is for....</li>
            <li> Took a little while to get here</li>
            <li> and I do see a bit of an added fullness to my lashes, but it takes a little bit of patience when working with the fibers.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to see if I could save a little money and find something that worked as well.</li>
            <li> little fibers will fall under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot, but it gets a little spidery.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product ill never buy mascara again!!!</li>
            <li> and this one is less expensive by far.  </li>
            <li> so when I got the product it was dried</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The fiber gel I received was dried up</li>
            <li> When I received my package, the gel was dried and I didn&#x27;t get the box as advertise..</li>
            <li> #ijs a waste.</li>
            <li> but then after a few times wearing it u get the hang of how to use it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I will clarify I have green eyes</li>
            <li> waste of money, didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> That said, it is messy to apply.  </li>
            <li> but when I opened the case it was MISSING the fibers tube.</li>
            <li> but then it was like the fibers dried out.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> One of the mascaras was all dried out</li>
            <li> I do a few coats of each to get the fibers to stick well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it just takes a few minutes, the lash fibers dont get all over your face or anything.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money even if it&#x27;s just 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> Dried out fibers.</li>
            <li> Giving it 1 star because the fibers tube is completely dried out.</li>
            <li> drawbacks are that the wet gel can get a bit sloppy if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> fiber tube was dry and brush applicator was caked with dry product- unable to use.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the other reviews stating how much it sucks.</li>
            <li> I noticed a dramatic difference on my naturally  short lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are buildable so you can do a second coat if you&#x27;re looking for REALLY dramatic lashes.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased.  </li>
            <li> this is does not do as described, it irritated my eyes and small pieces of fuzz were stuck all over my eyelashes and did not make them look longer at all.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, or money!</li>
            <li> Hate this product is really dried and was expecting a least to last 3 times of used but not was only one cause of how dried was it</li>
            <li> most horrible thing on they planet</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not good not worth it, don&#x27;t spend your money on this..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in search for the next product for eyelashes,when lash extensions became costly and damaging, then to expensive eye serums that never worked for me.</li>
            <li> I just received this product today and the gel is dried!</li>
            <li> I usually so one eye at a time</li>
            <li> not sure what to do with the fiber wand.</li>
            <li> It looked as if I had sprouted black hairs all over my face!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little dried out, Difficult to apply because the brush has already dried out.</li>
            <li> And who would want just a couple random long lashes?&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and I think long lashes underneath the eye look weird, so it gets two stars for me</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it says I have medium length lashes and the base mascara</li>
            <li> Was really disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like was that it made my lashes so hard</li>
            <li> It hardly gave me any length</li>
            <li> I hardly have lashes but one I put this on</li>
            <li> The fiber is still something that I am getting used to and now hardly use it.</li>
            <li> it was a little irritating...  </li>
            <li> At least younique comes with the case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Watch some Youtube videos on this type of mascara (commonly called 3D mascara)</li>
            <li> However, I can say that this mascara lengthens my lashes by at least 3x and also adds fullness.</li>
            <li> read through the negative responses</li>
            <li> it does take awhile to come in because its overseas, but for the price: I recommend ordering a few at a time, they&#x27;ll last a very long time and you won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is sometimes throughout the day small partials from the lashes fall into my eyes..</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in the smaller tube as it was dried up when I received it</li>
            <li> After looking online for a less expensive option, I purchased these.  </li>
            <li> this is ridiculous 0 stars</li>
            <li> Very weird that the case was sealed but missing half the items .</li>
            <li> Im not talking about a little bit of flaking, this product flakes so badly that I look like I have really dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people are giving this such bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> when i used it,,fibers went into my eyes, not good for a contact lens wearer.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the actual product yet, but disappointed that there was no case included.</li>
            <li> i was really disappointed in this product I ask for a refund or a resknow what seller didn&#x27;t replay back.</li>
            <li> It does nothing to my eyelashes but make them look thin and spaced out.</li>
            <li> I was not happy at all with that</li>
            <li> broken  </li>
            <li> but id hate for the actual formula to change since its working so well)</li>
            <li> However, it does tend to flake and those flakes leave behind smudges.</li>
            <li> not happy I give it a zero all it did was flake and make it feel like I had six in my eyes and hurt</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s irritating.</li>
            <li> I do not look like I am wearing False Lashes-not the look I am going for.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking to false lashes.</li>
            <li> false lashes &amp;#34; but with this product I no longer need to use false lashes on my clients unless they ask for them.</li>
            <li> It looks like I have false eyelashes on when I use this</li>
            <li> lashes flake and get stiff, which was the biggest disappointment.</li>
            <li> if you have been purchasing younique brand try these...more dramatic.  </li>
            <li> The fibers hardly stay on your eyes and the mascara part stinks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this instead of another brand going around social media for an outrageous price.</li>
            <li> I used it once and had to flush my eyes out with water because they were plastered with little particles of this crap.</li>
            <li> and I was unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Works just like the expensive stuff that I won&#x27;t name.</li>
            <li> The description is wrong, it is telling about how to apply eyelid tattoos.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable and stung.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the expensive name brands..</li>
            <li> Does not need to be expensive.  </li>
            <li> your lashes are they fake</li>
            <li> Just sad that i did not receive the case that came with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so angry</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical</li>
            <li> I just use them with a different mascara, but the mascara that comes in this set is terrible.</li>
            <li> not impressed.</li>
            <li> , I repeat, do not get even close to looking like ur wearing fake lashes....</li>
            <li> U want fake lashes buy fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I use to wear lashes and of course they pulled off my babies ;&#x27;( but this product gives my hope they will grow back again.</li>
            <li> I had been using a expensive version and needed to reorder it. . .</li>
            <li> I will not b ordering the expensive product again.</li>
            <li> My friends often ask me if I am wearing false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I have very thin and medium length lashes.</li>
            <li> but then all day long it flakes off all over your face and looks horrible.  </li>
            <li> the other reviewers said to, and then the fibers....which ended up being horrible.  </li>
            <li> and it was extremely clumpy and looked horrible.</li>
            <li> The small container didn&#x27;t have anything in it, disappointed!</li>
            <li> and you go crazy.</li>
            <li> It looks dangerous for your eyes.  </li>
            <li> kinda finding a use for part of the product, but it is certainly a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Not at all what it was suppossed to be it was dried out and in clumps terrible buy!</li>

            <li> makes lash look fake !</li>
            <li> They got in my eyes and burned so badly the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> It can leave some fibers on  your skin but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> bad thing is the fibers get in your ey</li>
            <li> horrible and irritating to eyes</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything but disappointed.</li>
            <li> Both of them were dried !!!!!!</li>
            <li> THEY ARE FAKE!!</li>
            <li> Just gives you a base.  </li>
            <li> The longest tube is the mascara base and shorter holds &amp;#34;mink&amp;#34; fibers.</li>
            <li> If you go too close to the base there will be eye irritation from the fibers falling in your eyes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First off it took a month to get to me. Second off the fibers do not go onto my lashes they fall onto my cheek. Not worth it!</li>
            <li> LASHES LOOK LONGER. MASCARA SMELLS LIKE PLASTIC</li>
            <li> Great Company to work with!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I didn&#x27;t want to pay $29 plus shipping for the Younique fiber mascara.  With this, you get what you pay for.  I use regular mascara, along with the gel and fiber mascara in this set, and you can&#x27;t tell any difference when I use this and regular mascara.  Also, when you use this, the fibers seem to go all over your face instead of your eyelashes.  I spend an extra 2 minutes after I use the product scrubbing my face from all the little fibers.  I am probably going to suck it up and buy the Younique fiber mascara or a comparable product.  When I contacted the seller after using the product, they said that having fibers all over my face was &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.  I completely understand that some fibers are going to naturally fall, but the amount of fibers that is left on my face is almost more than are on my eyelashes.  That isn&#x27;t normal.</li>
            <li> This item is horrible. &amp; smells horrible.</li>
            <li> It came in empty and one brush was destroyed.  I contacted the company and they replied &amp;#34;it&#x27;s gel it&#x27;s suppose to be like that.&amp;#34;  Do not recommend!!!! You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I like it as much as my regular mascara really. The fibers don&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li> this is my first time trying this type of product.these can cause a little irritation if you get any in your eyes but i get that with regular mascara. i really did notice a dramatic increase in lenght with this product though so in my opinion its worth a little irritaion every now and then, it didnt make my eyes red or anything. worth the price as well, mine were cheaper than regular mascara!!</li>
            <li> It really works but then you have all these fiber stuff all over your face and have to be constantly cleaning it...it dosnt come with the CASEEEE! which i was really waiting for i don&#x27;t know why the have a pic of a case if they not going to send it.</li>
            <li> fiber tube was dry and brush applicator was caked with dry product- unable to use.</li>
            <li> Shipped to me with the product open so when I got the product it was dried and I was unable to use it. Big waste of money. Instructions are in Chinese.</li>
            <li> The fibers are all over your face by the end of the day and it looks like you have black eyes</li>
            <li> Did not like this product at all! There are barely any fibers in the tube and they go all over the place during application.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. 👎</li>
            <li> I had seen many, many advertisements for Younique fiber mascara and always wanted to try it, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend the $30 for something I may not like.  I came across this brand, and decided at $6 it was worth the risk if I didn&#x27;t like it.  Although the shipping took quite awhile it was still worth the wait.  I used the directions for applications that another reviewer had posted since this only comes with directions in Chinese.  I fell in love.  The difference between using this and a regular mascara is miraculous.  I received so many compliments on the length of my eyelashes the first day I used this.  Great product that I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Even though this was arriving from China, and said the arrival time would be about a month, it only took about 2 weeks. It&#x27;s a great product too! I&#x27;ll definitely order again once I&#x27;m out!! Far more affordable than the younique product that does the same thing.</li>
            <li> I like, but directions are not in English, so I went on u-tube to see application process.</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to explain how happy I am with this product. I just recently saw a bunch of people using the Younique 3D fiber lashes and that is what made me look into these types of products. I just could not see myself spending $30 on these fibers and not knowing for sure if I would like them, so that is when I found this product and ordered it. What&#x27;s $7 is what I kept telling myself. Now, it did take quite a while to get to me, but these have got to be the most amazing thing I have ever spent $7 on. I am 150% satisfied with this product and my purchase. I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> Admittedly it takes a couple weeks to get but you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  I also was tempted to try Younique. However, I didn&#x27;t want to pay $30. So, I decided to give this a try. For only six dollars you will not believe how long it makes your lashes. I&#x27;ve had it for over week I&#x27;ve already reordered, not because I needed to, but because I&#x27;m afraid that when I run out,  I won&#x27;t be able to find anything better.</li>
            <li> works great! Makes you look like you have falsies on! Takes some practice to use, but worth the $5</li>
            <li> I liked this mascara the first couple times I tried it, but now the fibers just seem to fall off my lashes and leave them thin and short. Great for a couple uses but after that it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> This leaves flakes all over your face! Waist of money. Used a couple times and then threw away!</li>
            <li> Loved it but only gave it a 4 star because of the fibers kinda flake off and make a mess if you are not careful when applying. But over all, great product and though it causes a little irritation from the fibers that can get in eye ... I still like it.</li>
            <li> All I got to say is that it&#x27;s not like wat other people said about this thing. I like how I got it early but the thing is tht my mascara doesn&#x27;t turn out the way I wanted. I receive two mascara but the first one works but the second one all dried out. It kinda mess me up there. I hope some of u don&#x27;t be like me. I won&#x27;t recommended this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the case , upset :(</li>
            <li> A great product for the price, the same or less than you&#x27;d pay for any mascara in a supermarket or drugstore.  After experimenting for a few weeks with application I&#x27;ve decided that less is better and I try to apply as much of the gel and fiber in the first application before they dry and set.  Mascara will pull off fiber and clump if you try to layer more on the following day or apply touch ups later in the day.  Also if you apply too much fiber you be shedding and dealing with falling flakes that can irritate eyes and skin.  Does take a little longer than normal mascara to apply but now that I found a balance it goes on much quicker.  The fibers are amazing, very natural looking.  I definitely recommend for those with light or short lashes!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really lengthen my lashes, just made them thicker. What I didn&#x27;t like was that it made my lashes so hard, I was scared they would just break off! I personally didn&#x27;t enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> constantly picking fibers out of my eyes. does make lashes a little longer but some curls down and sideways and it is not buildable.</li>
            <li> really crappy mascara. the fibers get everywhere and doesnt even look any different than regular mascara. unimpressed</li>
            <li> Probably the best things I&#x27;ve ever done for my lashes. It makes them not only long, but thicker looking as well! I was surprised. LOVE. 5/5 stars.</li>
            <li> Not super impressed with the results of this kit....especially after most of the reviews said that this was an awesome mascara.  Overall, it gave me the same results as my regular mascara.  One thing that put me off right away, is that the packet that had the instructions were all in an Asian language.&lt;br /&gt;I put on the gel mascara first like the other reviewers said to, and then the fibers....which ended up being horrible.  I wear contacts, so for those of you who also wear contacts, this is a nightmare.  Fibers got in my eyes and contacts which was really irritating.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t plan on buying this mascara again....even though the bottles are super cute, not a quality product, and the instructions weren&#x27;t clear.  Although I only spent around $5, I expected more since other people raved about this mascara.  It hardly gave me any length but some increase in volume.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara and was absolutely disappointed. It was a terrible buy. It does nothing to my eyelashes but make them look thin and spaced out. It did not make my eyelashes any longer or thicker looking. I have tried multiple ways of applying this product in hope that they would turn out, but they never did. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a very cost effective fiber mascara option. Its super easy to use, the case is fun and I never have to reapply. I do recommend adding additional adhesive after the fibers have had a chance to dry as they can fall off, especially if its hot and humid like here in Miami. But if you get the adhesive on and everything dry it wont be a problem. I gave 4 stars because the shipping took forever, like I forgot about it kind of forever. But the product is great and kind of made up for the wait.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t biyt this it came dry and it does nothing to eyelashes makes ur eye hurt</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh the best mascara to pump up your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it is always available .</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. of course, I could have applied it too much but it was cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!! cheaper and  better then any store product!! and wayyyyy cheaper! i would definitely recommend buying in bulk due to how long it takes to get to you!!</li>
            <li> Works just like the expensive stuff that I won&#x27;t name. Received item fast too.</li>
            <li> The fiber gel I received was dried up and I was under the impression based on the pic and description it was to be in a case. Not at all satisfied.</li>
            <li> Seriously so horrible. I should have paid attention to the other reviews stating how much it sucks. The fibers just get all over the place. I used it once and had to flush my eyes out with water because they were plastered with little particles of this crap.</li>
            <li> When I received my package, the gel was dried and I didn&#x27;t get the box as advertise.. #ijs a waste.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff, will order it over and over again. Makes my eyelashes huge and beautiful, and is easy to put on!</li>
            <li> Flaked everywhere, did not last, did not really increase lash length.  Threw it out after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Not so hot...doesn&#x27;t work any better than drugstore products.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!! Kinda tricky to use at first but then after a few times wearing it u get the hang of how to use it. Just sux it took forever to get here and i didnt get the case that shows on here but other than that i love it!!</li>
            <li> Well i ordered this on 12/6/13 and recieved in on 2/15/14. Yes it took a VERY long time to get it and we had some problems with the mailing. But i finally got it and i really do like it. I wear contacts though and the little fiber lashes sometimes bug my eyes so itd be nice if the gel held those lashes better it still makes the lashes nice and long! Also, overall great customer service!</li>
            <li> Loved how it made lashes thicker, but Lil flakes come off on cheeks &amp; under eyes. Wish they made a &#x27;spray&#x27; sealer to seal them in. I&#x27;ve been putting either get back over the top or regular mascara to seal, but it pulls a Lil off in process...</li>
            <li> Fibers fall right off your lashes and into your eyes then it burns, doesn&#x27;t add volume or length.</li>
            <li> The picture advertised the gel and fibers in a case I received the gel and mascara but no case.  I am not pleased.  I expected it to come with the case so I would have a place to put it. At least younique comes with the case.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used! Super cheap! Makes your eyelashes look super full and beautiful! Highly recommended and will buy again!</li>
            <li> I would rather buy the 3d fiber lashes. I did not like this at all. &#x3D;( The instructions didn&#x27;t come in english either.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product and how well it works!  The only bad thing is sometimes throughout the day small partials from the lashes fall into my eyes.. This can be a pain, but it looks amazing on!</li>
            <li> I sell Younique and decided that I would try these, just to see if they were truly the same as our products, and I can tell you first hand, you get what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lashes flake and get stiff, which was the biggest disappointment. The fact that the seller states they do not have the ingredients bothers me as well. All of our Younique products list the ingredients, so you know what you&#x27;re putting on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took FOREVER for me to receive them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, you get what you pay for. If you want to pay for flaky, hard lashes, be my guest, otherwise visit a Younique representative and order the real thing!</li>
            <li> This product  does what it says- I need to use the product longer... Thanks for making this and the case is a great bonus</li>
            <li> it makes lashes thicker , not much longer but, for the price it is good</li>
            <li> took almost a month to ship, nice case and attractive design, one tube was completely empty, the other tube was full, does the job and makes your lashes look great, just un pleased with time frame and empty tube</li>
            <li> This product contains banned substances in my country do not know what I&#x27;ve bought, but did not I receive will be destroyed by customs</li>
            <li> This mascara is AH-Maz-ing!!!!! My eye leashes look way longer then before ahaha my mom just sits there n stares at me wondering how my eye lashes got so long lmao!!!! My little secret ;)</li>
            <li> Love this product amazing fuller longer lashes in seconds every morning :) great price for this product coworker pays $29 for her fiber lash mascara. Very happy with the results this product brings.</li>
            <li> I use almost every day! I love how I go from almost no eyelashes to *bam* look at me!</li>
            <li> I can not believe the amazing price of this mascara! I have really short lashes and have tried falsies (to know avail!) and lengthening mascaras. I have had a little bit of success with the later. After my daughter was born though and came out with AMAZING lashes, people would always look at me and my husband and then say, &amp;#34;Where did she get those lashes?&amp;#34; Although I think my daughter is beautiful, it always kind of bothered me that everyone implied that she couldn&#x27;t have gotten such beautiful lashes from a mom who is not as beautiful.  After trying this mascara, wow! I have beautiful long lashes without a huge price tag or fake looking adhesive lashes. The look is very natural and its easy!</li>
            <li> its nice the tube with the lash fabrics goes onto your face :/</li>
            <li> My friend sells Younique make-up and is always posting pictures online of the fabulous mascara.  As great as it would be to help a friend out and get lush lashes to boot, I don&#x27;t have $25 to spend on mascara.  After looking online for a less expensive option, I purchased these.  They are awesome and make my lashes look so long thick.  Now I no longer need to envy my daughters lashes with full youthful lashes in this tube.</li>
            <li> This item did not dissapoint.  Very cute container and the product is in nice metal tubes, very good quality.  The only down side was that the instructions are only in Chinese, no english translation.  You will either have to watch a youtube video on how to apply it or I just played around with it until I got it to work how I wanted to.  Definitely works though!</li>
            <li> I was not about to spend $30 on Younique&#x27;s fiber lash mascara, so I started looking for inexpensive fiber lash mascara and found Love Alpha! BEST PURCHASE EVER!!!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! Makes me look like I actually have lashes! I highly recommend this product, The case is stylish! Very high quality No worries about getting it in your eyes, there is a tool to aid with application if you hands are not steady. .</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these mascaras and I hate it!! It took 5 weeks to arrive and I was so excited to try it. It looked as if I had sprouted black hairs all over my face!! Fibers went everywhere, in my eyes, face and clothes!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought, nothing like the real 3d mascara</li>
            <li> Other then it taking a month and a half to get to me i love it ........very awesome case also</li>
            <li> Admittedly, my expectations for this product were very low. I was truly surprised by the results (and at such a low price). I got so many compliments on my lashes! For daytime, I stuck to one coat; but for evening I tried two and it was even better than false lashes. I bought this because I wanted to try fiber mascara before committing to Younique, but at this price I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll look anywhere else!</li>
            <li> The description is wrong, it is telling about how to apply eyelid tattoos. You can do a youtube search on love alpha fiber mascara, they show before and afters and how tos.. its really simple. Step 1-You apply the transplanting gel first, step 2- then, while its still wet, apply the fibers just like you would a mascara. Next you repeat step 1, and if you want them longer, step 2 may be applied to the tips and so on until you reached your ideal look. It can be applied in as many coats as you wish. My only complaint is that it will flake off as the day goes on , (or if you cry).. it wont run like regular mascara, but you will notice slight smudging along with the tiny black fibers. It does last long though.. normally I have good wear for about 8- 10 hours. Awesome product. Love love love this. Plus on the official website this product retails upwards of $30.00</li>
            <li> Works good.  It does leave fibers all over your face when you apply it.  It&#x27;s a mess to take off.  Regular soap and water will not remove it.</li>
            <li> I love the glue even just over normal mascara without the fiber lashes. It makes me lashes fuller and appear longer. However the fiber lash part is hard to get off, and it ran out after the first use. There&#x27;s like none in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Give you the super long soft look your looking for! Best purchase ever! I would definitely be buying more and its cheaper than the $30 younique brand and its the same exact product.</li>
            <li> goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t clump, make my eyes water or burn. Doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all would order again.</li>
            <li> Makes lashes look great</li>
            <li> I like the design and the price is right, but every time I use it I feel like my eyes are very irritated. It is a great idea since you can just wash it off at the end of the night and it does not hurt your lashes, but is does hurt my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I have it on I want to wash it off. :(</li>
            <li> Let me tell you this is the BEST mascara I have EVER used, and I have used a lot! It makes my lashes incredibly long. My friends often ask me if I am wearing false eyelashes! Not only is this mascara awesome but it is way cheaper than the regular drugstore brands. Yes, it does flake a little but I don&#x27;t mind cause I love the way my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; extra long lashes look. I am buying 10 more just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Not to impressed with these maybe I wasn&#x27;t doing it right but didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference they kept flaking off on my cheeks and eyes were itching like crazy after a couple of hours :(</li>
            <li> i was excited but doesnt seem like theres much peoduct in the tubes also the fibers kept going into my eyes and stung, had to wash it off in the first 10 min. Dissapointed</li>
            <li> So I ordered these because they were a good price compared to other fibers, and they had the &amp;#34;transplant gel&amp;#34; The gel was more like a watery mascara and didn&#x27;t really help with the fibers. A good mascara worked better. The brush on the fibers is also too long and you cant put them on very good.</li>
            <li> very worth the month wait it took to receive this item,  I love it would suggest to anyone wanting to try fiber lashes</li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected. It did come before the scheduled arrival date though. It irritated my eyes big time. I tried it out a couple times. I went and purchased Younique&#x27;s 3D Mascara for $29 and it is amazing!!!!!!! I recommend you spend the extra money and buy the Younique brand.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used a product that was similar to this before but, this product was nothing like the other one. The other actually worked. This product was a waste of my money. The fibers weren&#x27;t really fibers. It was like munched up cotton put into a file and they called it fibers. But, I guess I shoulder known that I get what I pay for.</li>
            <li> Product continually got in my eyes. Uncomfortable and stung. Not worth it. Why do I have to add more words.</li>
            <li> Pretty good just dont like that the fiber falls out ur lashes and tgey get on ur under eyes but overall its good</li>
            <li> It does make ur eyelashes look very long but the black fibers end up on ur face and in ur eyes also ur eyelash look clumpy and mushed together</li>
            <li> It did not come in the case like it said it would. It also appears that the fiber is already used up or old in some way. You might want to look into other brands. The fiber comes out very clumpy and it&#x27;s kind of irritating to the eye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good..at all.</li>
            <li> this is does not do as described, it irritated my eyes and small pieces of fuzz were stuck all over my eyelashes and did not make them look longer at all.  It was very hard to clean off.</li>
            <li> worst product ever and it came damaged but no one ever responded back to me to take it back.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the expensive name brands..</li>
            <li> its the best fiber lash mascara.... i have ever had..</li>
            <li> This mascara is a 3 step process and really does build up to long lush lashes if you are patient thru the process. Step 1 is the gel...goes on smooth and a bit too wet. Step 2 brush the fibers over the gel. Step 3seal the fibers with a coat of gel. Repeat step 2 and 3 until you achieve the look you want. You can really get a flash eyelash look if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawbacks are that the wet gel can get a bit sloppy if you aren&#x27;t careful. And, the fibers will flake all over your face during the process of application. I recommend that you make up your eyes first then finish your face, that way, if you get any of the fibers or gel on your face you can use some makeup remover on a cotton ball or swab to clean it up...and not ruin your entire look when doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in the USA so took about 3 weeks to get. But, that was expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, you can get a very exotic \\&quot;falsie\\&quot; look with this stuff. No doubt.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, however, the second time I used it the fiber brush fell off and became STUCK inside the tube. Now it&#x27;s basically useless, which is really unfortunate because this could have been a really good deal considering the low price. If I even had a replacement (fiber) tube &amp; brush I&#x27;d be happy.</li>
            <li> I really like this item! The shipping takes a while so make sure to order another right when you get one!</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier then predicted!  Results look good. Gel is black and a little stringy so I might use regular mascara to apply the fibers. Can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;Took pics. One eye has product. One eye does not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little dried out, Difficult to apply because the brush has already dried out. I&#x27;d be hesitant to recommend</li>
            <li> The fibers hardly stay on your eyes and the mascara part stinks. I won&#x27;t buy this product again. I went and bought $1 NYC mascara and it works so much better!</li>
            <li> I was using a similar, more expensive product.  I was not happy at all with that product.&lt;br /&gt;Did not have high hopes for this but thought I would try it for the price.  I am glad I did.  Liked it right away on first use.  Eyelashes look natural, little clumping if any.  My Lashes look long and natural.  I do not look like I am wearing False Lashes-not the look I am going for.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on easy. There is is some fall when first applied, but wipe away with a cotton swab, and you are ready to go.  Any negative reviews you are reading on this product MAY be from people who did not apply the product properly or people expecting a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are not in English.  If you are unfamiliar with fiber lashes and do not read Chinese; this will be problematic.&lt;br /&gt;1. Your favorite Mascara.  Does not need to be expensive.  Just gives you a base.  I also find this step helps with any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;2. transplanting Gel&lt;br /&gt;3. Fibers.  less is more. repeat steps if needed.&lt;br /&gt;4. transplanting gel&lt;br /&gt;5. Repeat steps 2-4 to achieve desired look&lt;br /&gt;6. *optional* top off with waterproof mascara to seal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing advertisements for the Younique 3d fiber lashes. Not wanting to spend $29 on mascara, I looked around and found this which appeared to be almost identical. I can&#x27;t imagine the Younique could be any better than this. Love it!</li>
            <li> Does extend lashes and gives a false lash look, but can clump up very quickly so I like to keep an eyelash comb to comb through the clumps. Takes a long time to apply, so I will probably only use the set on special occasions. The transplanting gel mascara is great on it&#x27;s own without using the fibers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this instead of another brand going around social media for an outrageous price. I have to say, this stuff works really well. If applied correctly, (which there were no instructions. I previously researched.) there are next to no clumps. My lashes look real when I use this product, and I have gotten several compliments. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the version from Younique at the same time.  I get the same results from both.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference and this one is less expensive by far.  The directions for this do not come in English so you have to know how to use this on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you use the bigger tube to apply a coat of mascara just as you normally would.  Then use the small tube using the same motions to place the fibers on your lashes.  Note that you should do this soon after applying the big tube, so I only do one eye at at time.  Next you apply more of the mascara from the big tube on top of the fibers which pulls them out towards the tips of your own lashes, extending them.  If you like, you can then add more fiber from the small tube and then coat with the big tube.  Just remember to always start and end with the big tube sandwiching the small tube process in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the results?  Unreal!!!  I absolutely noticeably lengthens my lashes in just one coat.  A second go-round adds length and thickness to my lashes.  I find a third coat too much for me, but others might prefer the extreme length and fullness of a third coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no issues with smudging. smearing, or running mascara.  I do get some flakes from fibers within the first half an hour of applying, but once I swipe those away, I do not see continued fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch some Youtube videos on this type of mascara (commonly called 3D mascara) and you can see the amazing transformations for yourself.</li>
            <li> While this mascara is not a miracle, I will admit that the difference in my lashes is pretty good. Not only does it make my lashes thicker and longer than my regular mascara, but it also looks really natural, and it stays on for two days (Sometimes, I won&#x27;t wash off my makeup at night). But when I wake up, the product of course isn&#x27;t going to look as good as the day applied, but it looks as good as my regular mascara. For this price, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GARBAGE! Did not do anything to my lashes. Extremely dissatisfied! Please.. Don&#x27;t waste your time, or money!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the Look it gives me. The only down side is the fibers sometimes get in your eyes. Which can be very annoying. Then there are no instructions in English to reference back to.</li>
            <li> I thought come with the box but it&#x27;s just  2 pieces of mascara on the plastic n one of them is even empty n  broken  It looks like left over stock</li>
            <li> this stuff works GREAT and both my husband and my daughter on separate occasions commented on how full and pretty my eyelashes looked (they had no idea i had purchased this stuff)... the ONLY reason i gave this a 4 start instead of 5, is because of the smell of the transfer gel. it smells REALLY strongly of nasty chemicals...!!  i ordered this because of the price (approx 5-7 dollars total), and i had purchased the $30+ younique brand 3d fiber lash at the same and wanted to compare them in case i fell in love i didnt want to have to be committed to spendin 30+ dollars on the younique brand over and over if this less expensive stuff worked better or just as well.  so far i honestly keep going back to THIS one and using it!  although i saw results with the younique brand one, i feel like my results with the lovealpha brand are even more dramatic :D  i will be ordering more of this!  i wish the smell wasnt so offensive (mostly cuz it just scares me about what the heck its made out of...but id hate for the actual formula to change since its working so well)</li>
            <li> I love this.  I really can&#x27;t say much more other than the seller is AWESOME at customer service. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with anything, I just simply had ants in my pants and was curious if they knew where in route my package was and they were awesome.</li>
            <li> horrible and irritating to eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week. My friends and I have seen a difference of length in the lashes. The length and thickness last throughout the day. Over night if you put it on towards the end of the day. I use a regular eye makeup remover to take it off and it came off easily enough without hurting the lashes. I use the product as they showed on YouTube. I love the product and would have given it a 5 star but the fibers start to flake towards the end of the day. But its towards the end of the use so its OK.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes eyelashes thicker! but be very careful or you also get the tiny fibers in your eyes! but for the price this stuff is awesome. And I&#x27;m sure this would also be a problem even with the expensive ones</li>
            <li> I will clarify I have green eyes so they are fairly sensitive so if you do not have sensitive eyes you may not have this reaction. I did ok on day one but the second day they really did make my eyes sore and irritated. I can wear most fake lashes with no problems. I assume it is the loose fibers. They did give a fuller appearance but not super drastic. I think a great mascara will do the same. If you have used fibers might be worth it but if you have sensitive eyes..caution.</li>
            <li> I got introduced to \\&quot;Younique 3D Lashes\\&quot;, and was immediately intrigued.  Can this really lengthen your lashes like it says??? Everyone gave it great reviews, but $30 dollars really????? Hell no.&lt;br /&gt;I started looking for the same thing, but better price.  THIS product hit it!!!! It does work, and if it isn&#x27;t working for you.... then you are applying it incorrectly. It lengthens my lashes to a noticeable difference!!! I am hooked, and at a whopping $8... even better!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never stop supplying this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I think these are great for the price..shipping took about a month and a half though...but for the price it was worth it</li>
            <li> I felt like it worked, but the fibers felt like they got in my eye. Was good for the knock off kind</li>
            <li> It does not work-seriously.  My wand was bent too.  It&#x27;s basically putting a clear mascara on your lashes and then black lint.</li>
            <li> This came really really fast, and worked pretty well. The fibers are great, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them falling on my face or anything. The only reason this didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because of the mascara it comes with. It doesn&#x27;t apply very well. I just use my regular mascara with it which is no problem. The case it comes in and the fibers are well worth the price I payed for it. It honestly works. It made my eyelashes so much longer and fuller. I compared one eye with the fibers and one eye without, and you can seriously tell a HUGE difference. I&#x27;m pretty amazed by this. I recommend this 100%.</li>
            <li> waste of money, didn&#x27;t work. First you have to apply fake &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; then cover it with the mascara. The &amp;#34;fake hair&amp;#34; gets everywhere except for the lashes! I&#x27;m sticking to false lashes.</li>
            <li> DID NOT LIVE UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS WASNT ANYTHING IN ONE OF THE TUBES</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I really enjoy it. I haven&#x27;t used a different brand before, so this was great.</li>
            <li> Did not stay on as well as the Younique brand.</li>
            <li> Instructions are in chinese which doesn&#x27;t help. I was given instructions from a friend that had used 3d fiber lashes, I could not tell much difference at all. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend much on this and I would not buy again. The case the product came in is really cute, otherwise I would list this as a complete waste.</li>
            <li> Makes lashes clump together. Doesn&#x27;t really make them longer just bought cover girl bombshell and works better than these mascara.</li>
            <li> Certainly this is MUCH less expensive than the original product. As mentioned in other reviews, the instructions are in Chinese; however, I did find a video on YouTubewhich illustrated the process. I would go ahead and spend the money for the real deal next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence with this stuff, it looks pretty great when I first put it on, especially for a dramatic night time look. However, it does tend to flake and those flakes leave behind smudges. I&#x27;ve tried putting a coat of waterproof mascara as the last coat in an attempt to &amp;#34;lock in&amp;#34; the fibers and that helps, but it still does not give an &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; wear that I want.</li>
            <li> No need to buy the really expensive beans when this one gives you exactly the same results.</li>
            <li> Great product would buy another.</li>
            <li> the mascara worked great. but didn&#x27;t see the point to the other since it was completely dry</li>
            <li> It works great! My lashes look awesome!</li>
            <li> Does what it claims. Great product.</li>
            <li> Better than Younique Fiber Lash Mascara!!!</li>
            <li> Hate this product is really dried and was expecting a least to last 3 times of used but not was only one cause of how dried was it</li>
            <li> Looks like regular mascara. Doesn&#x27;t add extra length.</li>
            <li> I have friends that sell the more expensive version of these fiber lashes, but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend $30 on mascara, so of course looked on trusty Amazon.com and found these for under $10.  Cheap enough to try.  I put one coat on with the fibers  and was immediately impressed.  WOW, I was skeptical at first, but it really does work and looks like real lashes.  The only con, which is no big deal to me, is that after hours of wear, you may see a little fiber break off on your cheek.  Not really a big thing at all.  I feel sorry for people that are wasting a lot of money on the more popular name brand versions.  If you&#x27;ve always wanted to try but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot, give this product a try.  IF you don&#x27;t like it, you didn&#x27;t waste that much money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people are giving this such bad reviews.  I think it&#x27;s amazing! I use a lot of mascara daily because of how think my eyelashes are and this one works like a charm. I was worried about the fibers slightly because I do wear contacts which are very sensitive to anything getting in your eye but nothing about this mascara irritates my eye.  Will definitely be ordering again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Fibers were dry, and item was 3 weeks past the estimated arrival time.</li>
            <li> Worked as described.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions!&lt;br /&gt;My lashes looked full, but funky....gives you the punk look rather than glamourous.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> I tried the fiber ONCE and never again. Millions of little fibers fall down from your lashes and you look like you have black dandruff all over your face periodically throughout the day. Not to mention that the fiber gets in your eyes as well and you go crazy. The mascara itself, however, isnt too shabby.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! If you take your time doing your eyelashes, you can make them really long. I always have a qtip with me and clean around per application. I never get the fibers in my eyes. I do it 4 times and makes them look like extensions.</li>
            <li> When I learn to use it properly it will be wonderful.</li>
            <li> Ok, so NEVER do reviews but this stuff rocks!!!  It completely does exactly what it claims and my lashes look amazing.  My sister was going to buy the younique brand but after seeing mine, she went with this one also!  I got the same effect for 1/3 of the price!  Awesome!</li>
            <li> Love that i can add volume and length without glue and falselys but be careful not to get the fibers in your eye because it hurts i also used my regular masscara to color my blonde roots before layering the transfer get and fibers ....... i always get wow your lashes are they fake nope all mine :-) and for the price awsome</li>
            <li> Does not work very well. Read all reviews and followed instructions. Does make it look like I have mascara on, but nothing too major. Would recommend spending the extra money to get a better one.</li>
            <li> I love this fiber lash mascara, only downfall is that it does have a little fallout after you apply it, but just a little wipe away and you&#x27;re good for the rest of the day ! makes your lashes extra thick and long. I love it! it does take awhile to come in because its overseas, but for the price: I recommend ordering a few at a time, they&#x27;ll last a very long time and you won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect :) that&#x27;s what I have been looking for a long time. I am gonna order more :) strongly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this mascara. I was a skeptic when I first ordered it.. But I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a week now and it&#x27;s AMAZING! I wear contact lense and have super sensitive eyes, but I haven&#x27;t had a single issue.  You just need to apply the right way. I&#x27;ve already ordered another one! This item is a must have!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. This is my go to mascara. Being a make up artist you always go for drama lashes &amp;#34; false lashes &amp;#34; but with this product I no longer need to use false lashes on my clients unless they ask for them.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this and had very high hopes of it being comparable to Younique but it&#x27;s just not. It&#x27;s not a natural product like Y. It&#x27;s dry and doesn&#x27;t last, also flakes. So bummed because the price was amazing, but you get what you pay for. I&#x27;m going back to paying $29.</li>
            <li> So other then the fact that I had mistaken this for mascara this product works good. except  the instructions came in a different language so my sister youtubed how to use it and then we discovered this is to enhance mascara you already have on. this product works really well. the natural fibers sometimes fall into my eyes or make this itchy, but that&#x27;s what happens if you put to much on or don&#x27;t seal it with transplanting gel.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work like it says. Maybe cause it a cheap price, I don&#x27;t know. But wasn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I really love this! It does the job of extending your lashes. Does a better job than the expensive brands!</li>
            <li> it is the worst I have ever tried. not happy I give it a zero all it did was flake and make it feel like I had six in my eyes and hurt</li>
            <li> These really do make your lashes appear longer and thicker.  That said, it is messy to apply.  I always get the fibers all over my cheeks.  So, be prepared that you might have to clean and reapply any foundation you&#x27;ve applied after using this product.  I do like the effect though; I just don&#x27;t go to the trouble unless it&#x27;s a special occasion.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this so the first time I used it I applied a regular mascara first then I used this product it works wonders!! Makes my lashed longer the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because during the day I get little black fibers under my eyes..,</li>
            <li> Not as good as the more exspensive one.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Was disappointed in the smaller tube as it was dried up when I received it but the larger one is great. It has become my favorite and that is saying something as I sell MaryKay products(including mascara). I have thinner lashes and this products makes them much fuller.</li>
            <li> 1timer I saw theses on Facebook and was curious it&#x27;s seemed like I waited forever for them to come in.  Tried them on my daughter who has very find eyelashes and I was very impressed. It was very easy to apply, at least on a second person. I haven&#x27;t tried on myself yet and I have medium eyelashes.  But I was worried they would be difficult and messy but it was easy, quick and really made her eyes just pop!! And looked amazing.  I am really happy I got them.  Not for a every day wear but I think I will have fun with theses</li>
            <li> I love this product my lashes look long and full using this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff suck&#x27;s the fibers get all over your face and in your eyes suck&#x27;s!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you apply this product as the directions suggest then you shouldn&#x27;t have any eye irritations.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this product, was super excited but when it got here the finer part seemed like it was old and wouldn&#x27;t stick. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I really have just started using this but it seems very close to my Younique mascarra that I use and spend a lot more money on. I&#x27;m really happy so far with this product.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this mascara, but they didn&#x27;t play out.  I didn&#x27;t noticed a significant change in the volume or length of my lashes with 3 coats of this vs. 3 coats of regular mascara.  I did have problems with the fibers falling off the brush as I applied them and fibers getting in my eyes as the day went on.  Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.  Maybe others are better at applying it....</li>
            <li> i thought they were both mascara however only one is mascara and im still not sure what the other one is for....</li>
            <li> This two stage mascara system is awesome. The gel layer goes on then you add a layer of lengthening fibers. Easy to apply and Easy to remove. I have sensitive eyes and this did not bother my eyes at all. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Definitely works, lashes looked longer and thicker. My only complaint is the little fibers end up under your eyes sometimes</li>
            <li> exactly the same quality as the $40 brand name fiber lashes... EXCELLENT value, I&#x27;ll be buying more right now! It looks like I have false eyelashes on when I use this</li>
            <li> It was delivered way before the expected date so I was excited. The case was sealed and packaged well but when I opened the case it was MISSING the fibers tube. Very disappointed . Can&#x27;t even try it out. What am I supposed to do with just transplanting gel? Very weird that the case was sealed but missing half the items .</li>
            <li> This kit arrived in the cute leopard case but instructions are in Chinese. The longest tube is the mascara base and shorter holds &amp;#34;mink&amp;#34; fibers. After applying the mascara you apply fibers. I love the lusher lashes but these fibers flake quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Received this after about a month and a half. Transplant gel works great as a mascara, makes lashes extremely long. Fibers were very flaky and dry. They got in my eyes and burned so badly the rest of the day. I emailed the seller and they gave me a refund. I would buy this again just for the transplant gel.</li>
            <li> sorry i meant to give a 5star but accidently hit just one star :(</li>
            <li> it clugs the lashes so they look all sticky. after a while the mascare starts cheaping and falling on the face.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the actual product yet, but disappointed that there was no case included.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this mascara. I cannot compare it&#x27;s quality to that of the $30 brand, as I have never used it. However, I can say that this mascara lengthens my lashes by at least 3x and also adds fullness. I will be a repeat buyer!</li>
            <li> Meh...it&#x27;s ok...took forever to receive. Wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> This product is great ladies not expensive. Just make sure u put either a coat of ur own mascara or the gel on last so fibers wont come off makes lash look fake ! But they are not ! Love it</li>
            <li> Would not by this brand again&lt;br /&gt;Did not like the transplanting gel, it was very dry. The fibers were fine but often didnt stick to the gel, gets clumpy also.&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again</li>
            <li> most horrible thing on they planet</li>
            <li> I actually like these. They don&#x27;t make my lashes huge and spidery like some of the other fiber lash mascaras that I&#x27;ve seen advertised and they were much cheaper! Def worth the money I paid and they actually came about a week before they were due, so pretty fast shipping for coming from overseas.</li>
            <li> Just as good or even better than the expensive brand(s).</li>
            <li> its okay, not as good as another brand i have but will do the job</li>
            <li> As for the actual product, it works really well.  However mine came without the case.  The two tubes were simply put in a ziplock-type bag.  This makes me wonder/worry that it was used previously.  Wouldn&#x27;t you?</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with a case like it said it would. But it works great. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. I hardly have lashes but one I put this on they look amazing. It did take like 3 months for me to receive it in the mail. Once I finally got it I was in love.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara ever! My eye lashes look amazing. ITS LIKE THEY ARE FAKE!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERY WOMAN!!</li>
            <li> I got it way sooner then was expected. So I was really excited. But upon opening I noticed it looked nothing like the tubes shown in the picture that I seen when I bought it. And it did not come on a case as shown. But it did work and I really liked it for the first 2 weeks but then it was like the fibers dried out. Couldn&#x27;t get any out of the tube. So for 2 weeks I guess I got my moneys worth. Def going to try the younique.</li>
            <li> As good as Younique brand fiber mascara. Worth the buy. Super cute case!!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely buying again! Great price!</li>
            <li> Incredibly fast shipping - received the next day when using my Prime. This product is as good as Younique (yes, I have used theirs as well). Save yourself some money and buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it! I took a pic with regular mascara on one eye and this on the other - the difference is amazing. Half of my office has bought this product because of me.</li>
            <li> Made the purchase of the product&lt;br /&gt;and he did not send</li>
            <li> Love this item!!! My 16 year old daughter and I both have purchased this set and are very happy with it!!!  Its easy to aply and we get lots of compliments!!!</li>
            <li> This is in chinesse. The lengthening tube looks like it&#x27;s pieces of fibers. It looks dangerous for your eyes.  I am not using it.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get but I love this product! Worth the wait</li>
            <li> The small container didn&#x27;t have anything in it, disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product was really for me. I have very thin and medium length lashes. I did follow the steps but it just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason this is so cheap! It&#x27;s Horrible, this knock-off is nothing like YOUNIQUE 3D Fiber Lash Mascara!  Don&#x27;t waste your money! If you&#x27;re going to put something on your eyes to make them stand out.. go with the best: Younique!</li>
            <li> Not good not worth it, don&#x27;t spend your money on this..</li>
            <li> fast shipping  but fiber falls off</li>
            <li> I love this product... and the case is awesome</li>
            <li> Decent for the price but they don&#x27;t make a big difference and it takes forever to come in, by the time I received the package I had completely forgot I had ordered it. Younique is definitely a better choice</li>
            <li> It does make my lashes longer and more full, but the fibers tend to smear at the bottom. I just have to be more patient in applyi mg the gel. Overall it does work!</li>
            <li> Stuff is amazing. Really works. Not a typical review writer but this product deserves my efforts. Easy application. Wet then dry immediately after. Went from stright blond lash to curled long vibrant lashes. Always get compliment. Other mascaras like this go for 30.00</li>
            <li> It came in but didn&#x27;t have any mascara in The bottle. i was really disappointed in this product I ask for a refund or a resknow what seller didn&#x27;t replay back. So if your going buy this go ahead but just letting yall know what happen to me. It was a waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The shipper was extremely nice and resent my product after it got lost in the mail. I will definitely buy again once I run out.</li>
            <li> Received my package 2 weeks earlier than was expected.&lt;br /&gt;the mascara works great, too!</li>
            <li> Works great !!!! Does irritate eyes though .</li>
            <li> Fiber are something to get use to.</li>
            <li> Ok but not as good as other fiber lash products out there.</li>
            <li> The product is a good deal. It took a long time to arrive. There were no instructions in english. It tends to clump my lashes together.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Came in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Good for the price. Better than regular mascara but not as good as I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money. One of the mascaras was all dried out so I had to throw it away. The other one was half way dried out and clumpy. Will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff wasn&#x27;t any good!</li>
            <li> I got this yesterday and applied it to my lashes this morning. I like it a lot. For how cheap they are it did was it was supposed to do. The only issues I had with this was 1. It took a month to Recieve it and 2.&lt;br /&gt;It sheds when applying. Other than that I love it and it comes very stylish. The picture doesn&#x27;t do it  justice. In person it looks like you spend $30 instead of $5</li>
            <li> The mascara is nice, but forget about using the fibers.  They&#x27;re dry and flakey and don&#x27;t work at all with the mascara.</li>
            <li> The mascara is a bit goopy, but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s no big deal anymore. The fiber is still something that I am getting used to and now hardly use it. The mascara is by far my favorite as it just makes the eyelashes really stand out as well as lasting all day.</li>
            <li> Pretty good,love them.But they didn t come in the box as advertised,it s ok tho!</li>
            <li> I only use this mascara now. Since using fiber lash I havent gone back to regular mascara. It can leave some fibers on  your skin but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> Love it works wonderful...</li>
            <li> This was the worst product I have received. I would give 0 stars if I could. Just avoid it.</li>
            <li> This works fabulously!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with case but I didn&#x27;t care. Love this product! Super fast shipping. I watched how-tp videos on YouTube so I knew how to put them on. So much cheaper than their competitors but just as good. I&#x27;m 46 years old and do not have the lashes I had in my 20s. I have been trying everything to get lashes again and now I need look no further! If you&#x27;re on the fence....go for it!</li>
            <li> The  fiber mascara works great! I noticed a dramatic difference on my naturally  short lashes. Just sad that i did not receive the case that came with it.</li>
            <li> it just clumps my lashes. not worth the money i spent and the time waiting. plus i thought itd come with the case and it didnt.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product ill never buy mascara again!!! The cost was low and the product was amazing only down side it took like 3 weeks to get to me but it was sooo worth the wait! And yes I&#x27;m a real person!</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint with this is that the directions are all in Chinese so I can&#x27;t read them. That being said, I think I&#x27;m doing it right becasue it&#x27;s pretty simple to figure out. Basically you get two tubes, one is regular mascara and the other is a tube of fluff. First, you apply the regular mascara and then the fiber fluff. I do a few coats of each to get the fibers to stick well.&lt;br /&gt;The fibers can get in your eyes if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> good product for the price</li>
            <li> This is good for the price. But with my experience it clums together when trying to put layers on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting almost 2 months for this product I&#x27;m so angry and I&#x27;m sure my wait won&#x27;t be worth it this is ridiculous 0 stars</li>
            <li> Both were completely dry!</li>
            <li> Forget the $30+ fiber mascara! This works just as well! Just like any fiber mascara, it takes some getting used to but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s great! My eyes are so sensitive that I have to wear daily contacts because even contact solution bothers them. This mascara hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyes once!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the hype. Came from China so didn&#x27;t mind the wait in shipping, that was a given I&#x27;m always in search for the next product for eyelashes,when lash extensions became costly and damaging, then to expensive eye serums that never worked for me. I received this about a week ago. Can&#x27;t say anything but disappointed. Started with the serum, then layered the fibers on top. The results were a dry, brittle, spider look that flaked onto my under eyes and cheeks. After using it on trial to see what it looked after errands I ran on a weekend afternoon. I saw my lashes had gone straight and to my original stubby form and fibers disappeared,this was only after a couple hours. I wasn&#x27;t pleased with them anyway before leaving the house.</li>
            <li> Did not like the gel.  I will stick with regular mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used.  It actually makes my eyelashes look longer!  I ordered more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Just as good or better than younique!!! What an amazing find! I have this and younique on my makeup counter and I actually prefer this brand. My lashes stay all day and they do not irritate my eyes at all! You need to know how to apply these lashes:&lt;br /&gt;1. Coat your lashes with non clumping mascara (cheap is fine they just need a coat of regular mascara first).&lt;br /&gt;2. Do one eye at a time; apply transplanting gel (focus on tips of lashes)&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply fibers&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply gel again to seal&lt;br /&gt;5. Do other eye&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are buildable so you can do a second coat if you&#x27;re looking for REALLY dramatic lashes.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!!  Great price!</li>
            <li> So disappointed!! I waited almost a month to get my mascara. The fibers get all over your face and in your eyes. WASTE OF MONEY!! I WANT MY 6 DOLLARS BACK!!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this product would not only make my lashes look longer, but thicker.  I noticed longer, but not so much thicker.</li>
            <li> Took a little while to get here but it was worth it 100% . This is my absolute new favorite mascara. I don&#x27;t wanna use any other one ever again . I will definitely be ordering this again .</li>
            <li> They do add length but the little fibers gets in your eyes and causes iratation, I have better results with fake eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Works good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> the quality of shelles are not as good as picture and my expectation, it feels very rough, a big different with my previous one which I brought in store in China, it make me a little bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> i loved for one how fast i got it and two how great it works it was brand new nothing opened</li>
            <li> I tried this to compare against 3D Lashes from Younique. There is NO comparison! These drop fibers all over my face! I can sleep in my 3D Mascara! [...]</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after watching you tube videos on application, I tried and love this product.  It is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> the mascara has well quality although it is more of a natural look rather than extremely volumized eyelashes look the packaging is to die for!! I do not regret my purchase</li>
            <li> what a joke this is absolute junk but get what you pay for so if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re going for then mission accomplished</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use it yet but I have open the package and it looks the the name brand. I&#x27;m sure it will be awesome</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the product as far as using the mascara.  I love the case and design.  I use the case for glasses and the mascaras as decorative in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. The price was right!! It works great and I saved so much money compared to different brands. I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> Amazing! This was my first time ever trying a fiber mascara so I was skeptical but I am a real person not a computer saying this I lovvvveeedd it! I have tiny lashes u can barely see but this mascara out them at full bloom LOVE!</li>
            <li> Great product. Will buy it again in the future. Company it ships from was very concerned with my customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> When you put it on it looks awesome but then all day long it flakes off all over your face and looks horrible.  great price and beautiful color and lengthening but not worth it because almost an hour after you put on it flakes off all over your face and under eyes.  That is a complete turn off.  If they could figure out how to make it stick to your eyelashes all day it would be awesome!</li>
            <li> The instructions are not in English so here is how you put on 3D mascara. Use your normal mascara then put on the &amp;#34;transplanting gel&amp;#34; which is black and will color your lashes black but not change the way they look like real mascara. Then you put on the fibers. The fibers will not all go where you want them to, and you&#x27;ll have some longer lashes but mostly they will  just look fuzzy. Then you put the gel over the fibers to keep them in place. This will fix any of the fuzzy look normally but also pull off any fibers that were on the end actually making it look longer to result in a big fat nothing. You would think putting on 3 layers would somehow make them look somewhat bigger but it doesn&#x27;t. And if you manage to get some fibers to stay on the end making it look longer trust me when I say this will not happen to all of them. And who would want just a couple random long lashes?&lt;br /&gt; I didn&#x27;t have the issues some people did no rash, no flaking off, it didn&#x27;t seem old or hard BUT it also didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the black gel to color my lower lashes because my eyelashes are fairly long naturally and I think long lashes underneath the eye look weird, so it gets two stars for me kinda finding a use for part of the product, but it is certainly a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Not at all what it was suppossed to be it was dried out and in clumps terrible buy!</li>
            <li> Amazing product does exactly what the more expensive product does but for half the price. Takes about a month to get in the mail but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I like this pretty well. It definitely makes my eye lashes darker and more obvious. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the fibers, they don&#x27;t stick all that great unless you put a lot of the mascara on...more than usual. And it clumps up pretty quick as well, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected since there are fibers staying on the wand. I&#x27;ll wash it tonight and see what happens. Overall, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> by far the best mascara ever! I love this and will continue to purchase it over and over. just remember to put the fiber on 2nd lol</li>
            <li> It was no big deal!! The cost was great and the mascara was ok I didn&#x27;t think the Fiber lash was that great!</li>
            <li> They make your lashes 10 Times longer and fuller looking! I hate the fibers because they can spread on your face because they look like fuzzies to me but other than that it&#x27;s amazing! And way cheaper than the ones I was going to get!</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal. They work great!!!! Other products like this are around $25. This is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Sooo I just got this and I&#x27;m excited to use it, came before delivery date too. :) I gave it 4 Stars because it didn&#x27;t come with the Case .:(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do anything. Regular mascara is 100 times better</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara i have ever used, it does expand your lashes and doesnt clump up and doesnt come of easily, nor does it smear ...At the end of the day after my other make up has rubbed off my mascara is still intact.. I will be buying this product again and again.. I ordered it and had a shipping problem and did&#x27;nt receive it , i contacted the company and they sent another out immediatly and i got it in 2 weeks... A great product</li>
            <li> I received my product but not the case that it was suppose to come in. I was really looking forward to my cute case to carry alone my mascara!!!</li>
            <li> You might not want this because of the long shipping, but for free shipping and the low price this stuff is amazing! My lashes looked twice as long with this without even curling them! It&#x27;s super easy to use (even though the instructions are in Chinese) and just give you comfortable and long lashes.</li>
            <li> Appears to be the same stuff as the Unique brand. I find it interesting that the box, tube size/ shape, and the consistancy of the product seems to match exactly. After a side by side comparison of both products, I cant tell the difference. You know what they say, if it looks like a duck....</li>
            <li> I love the way my lashes look with this product. The only thing that bothers me is the tiny fibers go into my eyes sometimes throughout the day and it&#x27;s irritating.</li>
            <li> Took a month to get to me. It came in a plastic baggie. Not in the case it shows. Makes my eyelashes fall out.</li>
            <li> Works as good as younique look up the youtube videos. Also the packaging is so cute, does take a while for shipping so order a few at a time: ).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing best mascara out there and it doesn&#x27;t leave fiber in my face like I thought it would. Really loved it !</li>
            <li> Love !! So worth the price. Shipping took forever though.</li>
            <li> I just received this product today and the gel is dried! I had to do at least 10 coats for it to actually show. I do not recommend this at all. It&#x27;s better that you pay full price for younique.</li>
            <li> The product is good. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it. The case it comes in is super cute!</li>
            <li> I love it! I already ordered more. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it a 5 star is because I think the transplanting gel is a little dried out. Im hoping I just got a defected one. Overall LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I like the fibers! I just use them with a different mascara, but the mascara that comes in this set is terrible. Not a fan of it at all!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality similar to Younique but way cheaper will be buying again! I would recommend two coats for more fuller lashes</li>
            <li> I love this product I ordered initially for the Mascara it also has fibre extensions in the Pretty carrying case .... it does exactly what it says I have medium length lashes and the base mascara is the 1st coat then you apply the fibers as many coats as You like to get the desired lenghth and fullness xomes off easily with warm water .... just want to be careful not to ger the fibers in Your eyes as for Myself it was a little irritating...  although it washes off easily keep eyes closed as mich as possible when removing ...... Great Product I highly recommend to anyone wanting longer fuller lashes..... :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece at Christmas and she wanted more for her wedding!</li>
            <li> I ordered this 12 days ago and just got this (way before their estimated arrival is why I stress this), instinctively I tried it. The instructions are not in english, however you can easily find tutorials on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;This product made my lashes look both fuller and longer, which I love because I feel cheated on the lash end of the gene pool (honestly my daily makeup usually includes falsies because of this).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually already told my roommate about it and showed her a comparison after one lash and she&#x27;s already planning on ordering some.&lt;br /&gt;This will honestly become a daily part of my make-up so I can retire my falsies until special events.</li>
            <li> absolutely amazing! I didnt think it would work but after i applied it I could not believe it. The little fibers really make your lashes longer!</li>
            <li> I love this product it really works and the price is amazing Really makes your eyelashes fuller and longer love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product I love this... I have the tiniest lashes ever this product makes my lashes look 10x thicker and longer and great for the prices will be ordering from here a lot more</li>
            <li> Unless you want fibers falling all over your fresh makeup and in your eye I would go with younique 3D fibers. Younique is natural &amp; have no smell. These have chemicals and man- man fibers and smell terrible.</li>
            <li> Ok, There are so many &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; mascaras, but this one is NOT good at all. I purchased pink one and it worked so great so I assumed the bottles with the leopard print would be the same and I purchased 3. DO NOT BUY this kind!!!! Skip it and purchase pink instead!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because a friend keeps ranting about 3d mascara and I wasn&#x27;t about to spend $40 on the stuff that she buys when I&#x27;m sure that this is equivalent and a LOT less expensive. I do like this stuff and I do see a bit of an added fullness to my lashes, but it takes a little bit of patience when working with the fibers. I try to make my makeup routine quick, with this it takes a while longer. It&#x27;s worth the money, same as the really over priced stuff because I have compared the two side by side.</li>
            <li> I have the Younique brand as well and I would honestly say that this is very comparable and waaaaaaay cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I looked online at Youniqu lashes which run at about $35. The price is right and the product is amazing. I usually so one eye at a time, I put on regular mascara first then apply the gel then the fibers. I&#x27;ll move to the next eye then put another coat of gel and fibers on each eye. I&#x27;ve gotten sooo many compliments. People even ask if they&#x27;re real because they are so unbelievable  full! Will most certainly be buying again!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this item. It did not come with the case as shown in the pucture, but in plastic! On top of that the product doesn&#x27;t work as great as promised. The 3-D fiber lashes when applied look the same as regular mascara but it takes 2 times the amount of time it takes to put on normal mascara. This product also burns your eyes. I would not invest money on these, they may be cheap but I&#x27;d prefer quality of the name BRAND fiber lashes. The process of putting on the 3-D fiber lashes is very time consuming. I do not like this product what so ever...</li>
            <li> it works! buy this. its great</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE product. It doesn&#x27;t even work and the fibers get everywhere. Also woke up the next morning with a rash on my face from it!!!</li>
            <li> I like it but it does flake easy so I have to constantly brush off my face! It&#x27;s makes lashes very pretty... I use regular mascara first while wet I put gel on and then the fibers, gel again, fibers until I get the intensity I want then I finish off with the gel to seal the deal! totally worth the money and the case is beautiful</li>
            <li> Its an amazing product , but , the  natural fibers continue to get into my eyes. Causing irritation. I dont like that ,  butt the end result is beautiful.</li>
            <li> it took forever for Me to get. about a month. the mascara is dry. the gel is dry and the fibers fall off under your eyes. figures with the price paid</li>
            <li> When my product arrived it did not come in the case shown. I only got the two items inside. Photo should be changed or customer should be informed the case will not come with this item.</li>
            <li> So I just my fiber 3d mascara after waiting a month to be ship to me due to being exported from CHINA this mascara has the good and the bad yes it give you that amazing long eyelashes look bad part fiber starts falling down to your eye and irritate you got red eye so I put eye drop next day woke up with a infected eye do to all fiber fallen down my eye and had to discontinue it after just one use do to doctor order</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, other than i did not get my case. It came in a plastic bag. BUT the product i LOVE.</li>
            <li> I loooveee this mascara!!! Definitely worth the purchase.. I sometimes use the gel by itself and I love how it easily comes off.. All I do is take a shower and lightly wash my face and the mascara just slides off.. no smudging no raccoon eyes lol</li>
            <li> My first fiber lash mascara and I absolutely love it! I will most definitely continue to buy this brand. I like it so much that I&#x27;m buying my sister one for Christmas! Very good quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Junk...doesn&#x27;t work,very disappointed !,,, buy the good stuff this is a wast of money!</li>
            <li> I love it especially for the money. It is not hard to put on at all it just takes a few minutes, the lash fibers dont get all over your face or anything. I would definitely get it again</li>
            <li> I purchased the Vakind Pack last week and it came about 4 days later.  I have VERY sensitive eyes and was a little cautious about trying this.  It works Great!! And I have not had any issues with the fibers flaking or getting in my eyes. It was very easy to apply and didn&#x27;t really take long to do.  Only thing is the instructions were not in English?  But it was ok because someone posted instructions in their review.  And after the first time, you don&#x27;t need to look at the instructions anymore. Came with a super cute case and the price was FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!  It cost me $7.32 for it..Cant beat the price!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited about trying this product due to the price and the reviews! I received it about a month after placing the order and the first time I tried it I  went to put the fibers back in the tube and pulled it out one last time and the wand broke off inside the tube!!  So, I guess I can&#x27;t use it again even if I wanted to. Also, I was only able to apply one coat. This product is not buildable at all. You put on the gel and then fibers and gel again and that is all you get. I tried to put on another coat and it was extremely clumpy and looked horrible. You do get some extension on your lashes but I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about Younique so I wanted to see if I could save a little money and find something that worked as well. This was a complete waste of my money.  It took about a month, maybe longer, to deliver, none of the instructions were in English and it flakes. Im not talking about a little bit of flaking, this product flakes so badly that I look like I have really dark circles under my eyes and it gets all over my face. It also gets in my eyes and makes me constantly feel like I need to rub them. It did make my lashes look longer but it flakes off so much that by mid day, my lashes looked like I had no mascara on. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice an extreme difference from regular mascara in appearance, but the main irritation was that the micro fibers were always getting in my eyes or falling onto my skin; not just during application but throughout the day. So I had red, irritated eyes with dark smudges everywhere. Sadly, I can&#x27;t use it - not for daily wear, not for special occasions. It was a waste of money. Too bad, I was really excited about it.</li>
            <li> if you have been purchasing younique brand try these...more dramatic.  ordering again now. read through the negative responses and I think they are using the products  incorrectly</li>
            <li> wasnt in english. not sure what to do with the fiber wand. when i used it,,fibers went into my eyes, not good for a contact lens wearer.</li>
            <li> I am trying everything to get longer lashes and always forget to use the lash serum. Thought I would give this a try. Kind of fun, takes a few coats and some does flake off but after a while (probably an hour or so) it stops flaking. Don&#x27;t have any other fiber mascara to compare it to. I would use it for special occasion type stuff if you have the patience to spend at least 5 minutes putting it on and then have time for the flakes to stop falling off. I wear contacts and even if the flakes get on my contacts - you can&#x27;t feel them. They really are tiny.  I just bring a q-tip with me and check for flakes once in a while. They do not come with instructions so check out a youtube video.</li>
            <li> The lashes flake off and sometimes clump.  Not the worst I have tried,  but far from the best.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to received mine and finally got it after after waiting for a month. I wasn&#x27;t really happy with it coz as I open it the cap wasn not really close tight and the one I got was dry. its not worth the wait &amp; price.</li>
            <li> It had chinese writing on it. i think it may be a knock off product and the tubes make a metal grinding sound when I twist the tubes open and closed. not impressed.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this mascara!!!! It makes my lashes look longer and fuller. Although it may flake and yo can see the fibers on your eyelids, all you have to do is coat your lashes with your favorite mascara. then apply the fiber adhesive then the fibers; keep repeating until you reach your desired length and then go over it with your favorite mascara again to seal in the fibers.  For more help there are tutorials on YouTube that I found helpful. I would certainly buy this again because it was a good price and arrived before the scheduled date!!!</li>
            <li> If used right, it works wonders! One coat mascara; one coat gel; one coat fibers; additional coat gel. Bam! And you can repeat the gel and fibers for more oomph. Just remember to end with gel else little fibers will fall under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I read so much about this. It is basically lengthening mascara separated into 2 different vials. It is terrible to use. It flakes all over ur cheeks, You do not, I repeat, do not get even close to looking like ur wearing fake lashes.... in fact fake lashes are much easier to put on and wear and take off. This went right into the garbage. Don&#x27;t buy into the hype. U want fake lashes buy fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I liked the lashes but the gel I got was already dry. Was really disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work very well. Thought I would order some more. But I don&#x27;t have the money to just waste on dry and old products. What a waste.</li>
            <li> I liked this mascara, my kids also approve of it. They made my lashes look much longer and fuller and was fairly easy to apply and remove. Definitely worth the price and at least as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I use to wear lashes and of course they pulled off my babies ;&#x27;( but this product gives my hope they will grow back again. Wonderful price people are selling this thing for $30 which is good because the product really works thick long beautiful lashes I just found something cheaper and works just as good.</li>
            <li> Feels/smells like I&#x27;m putting black paint in my lashes. Plus the smaller tube has no mascara in it. It&#x27;s just a brush in an empty tube.Flakes off on top of everything else, Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> This product is an &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; product.. like many other reviews ive read, the fibers get all over ur face and some get in my eye. The packaging is nice and the actual tubes feel like metal which are sturdy but the product in itself is not quality.. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it or re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Product does add length to your lashes but won&#x27;t add volume to them. Once the transplanting gel dries the fibers will stay in your lashes. It&#x27;s not waterproof but it lasts a good 10-12 hours and could last more.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive eyes I dont recommend buying it because the fibers will get in your eyes. Take your time when using these.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that great at all. Horrid smell. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> love the item I love how full my lashes look after using the product compared to regular mascara glad I bought the item when I did</li>
            <li> The packaging is great.. your own little case.. the product is good but I had a lot of flaking compared to another brand.  I am not disappointed as you get what you pay for.. plus full eyelashes such as these I can&#x27;t wear on a daily basis anyway.. so great value for a sometimes use..:)</li>
            <li> Both of them were dried !!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff just as good as younique. Im totally satisfied especially for the price!</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing. Love it wish I knew about it sooner.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot, but it gets a little spidery.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. So cheap and SO easy to use. Do one eye at a time, though, so the gel stuff doesn&#x27;t dry on you before you use the fibers. Skip the bottom lashes, too, because your regular mascara will suffice on those. It&#x27;s easy to get off with just my natural almond soap and water (so if you have actual remover, it&#x27;ll be a snap), but it NEVER gave me raccoon eyes (and I live in the country&#x27;s most wet and humid place imaginable and sweat buckets when I go out dancing--which is specifically when I use this product). The fibers will flake off occasionally, but mostly when I&#x27;m adjusting the final look with a lash comb and then VERY minimally after several hours of wearing it (which I easily catch when I go freshen up and comb my hair--they sweep right away, and no one else notices them at all). It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all. The packaging is adorable as well. I got mine just as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I will likely purchase this again--for me and for friends. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Was a favorite as for my granddaughter wishes.</li>
            <li> Took about a month to arrive.  Was skeptical due to low price and mixed reviews but once i tried it i was very happy.  I will gladly buy again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference from the mascara that I usually use (loreal double extend mascara).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy, leaves flakes all over your face and doesn&#x27;t look any different</li>
            <li> Works really good! Fibers fall all over your cheeks but you can just wipe them off with anything.</li>
            <li> I  see the reviews .... And was kinda scared to get it. I&#x27;m so glad I did order it .. I&#x27;m amazed how my lashes look I love it</li>
            <li> Wish it would have worked but the fiber lashes kept falling into my contacts and hurting my eyes</li>
            <li> One of the mascara came supper dry so I was only able to use one and didińt use it much because it had a very strong smell to it that made me sick!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. The fibers end up in your eyes a lot which is really counterproductive when you&#x27;re having to remove it bc your eyes are watering from the fibers getting in them. Dried out quickly. Not near as good as the younique stuff.</li>
            <li> Works great if you know how to apply correctly I have had it for a month already and their is still a lot of product I recommend this product</li>
            <li> Horrible!!! Does not work at all. Mascara is cheap and the other bottle is just a bottle of lint. Waste of money even if it&#x27;s just 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> fibers were empty. waste of money.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy! Product comes empty and takes for ever to arrive</li>
            <li> I had been using a expensive version and needed to reorder it. . . then I seen this on amazon and decided to order. I am glad I did. The lashed look full and lush. I keep a q-tip dipped in moisturizer to remove any spots from extra fiber. The q-tip would not b necessary for a neet person, I am not. I love my lashes with Vakind and highly recommend. The price can not b beat for the quality. I will not b ordering the expensive product again.</li>
            <li> It is very horrible don&#x27;t buy.!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Dried out fibers. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I had never used fiber lashes before but they&#x27;re amazing. Especially for this price, it&#x27;s such a step up from mascara without going the fake lashes route. The instructions aren&#x27;t in English though, so I looked up an easy youtube tutorial for Youniqe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step one: Apply the gel&lt;br /&gt;Step two: Apply the fiber&lt;br /&gt;Step three: Apply another layer of gel to set&lt;br /&gt;Step four: Repeat until you reach desired effect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super easy and cute packaging!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it. it makes my eyelashes look long full and voluminous :)&lt;br /&gt;oy bad thing is the fibers get in your ey</li>
            <li> This is reallly good stuff. I took off one star because the shipping took so long I forgot about it. The trick to using it for me is to only use the fibers on the uppermost part of the lash. If you go too close to the base there will be eye irritation from the fibers falling in your eyes. Overall good deal for the lash impaired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to Younique and this can not compare... It gets everywhere and makes eyelashes sticky n clumpy.. Even though its cheap its not worth it and mine didnt come in a case .</li>
            <li> Do not recommend product. Hurts my eyes</li>
            <li> Good item.  It does work! So glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t buy YouNique fiber mascara because this is just as good!!!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product for fabulous lashes! LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> a great product it help build the lashes for volume and length.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Just like the stuff I payed 35.$ for</li>
            <li> Really cheap stuff- not like other varieties.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving a 4 star because I think it works similarly to other products, such as drugstore 1 step brands. However, the price was much much cheaper, 1/3 of the drugstore brand and 1/6 of a high price brand! I posted a photo. The picture in the upper left is this product vs my normal eye. The upper right is a picture of this product vs a drugstore brand. The bottom left is this product vs a drugstore brand PLUS this product. The bottom right is standard false eyelashes that I wear. I see this to be similar, however I see that it thickens more than lengthens, as do many products.</li>
            <li> Giving it 1 star because the fibers tube is completely dried out. So I can&#x27;t get the long lash effect and it took a month to get to my house.</li>
            <li> The fiber on the brush runs out and it&#x27;s hard to get more fibers on but when it works, it looks great</li>
            <li> has a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> love this mascara ,good quailty and looks great on every makeup style. its good quality for the price.Just what I wanted with fast shipping and cute packaging!</li>
            <li> I love it all the mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought can&#x27;t compare to this yeah it took awhile to get but well worth the money and time</li>
