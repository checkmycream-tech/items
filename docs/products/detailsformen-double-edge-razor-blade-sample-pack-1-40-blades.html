            <li>Item came in excellent condition just as described.  </li>
            <li>Going thru them now to see which will work best for me.  </li>

            <li>The Derby blades weren&#x27;t very good, but the others were great!</li>

            <li>Good way to find the blades that best suit your skin and hair.</li>
            <li>The Derby brand was a pleasant suprise, lasts about 3 to 4 shaves, gets a real nice close shave &amp; doesnt leave me with any razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I feel the variety is nice, so you can choose a blade that works the best with your skin.</li>
            <li>Either way, great price and a GREAT set of blades to get you started.</li>
            <li>This sample is great.  </li>
            <li>Probably take a while to try all the blades, but the ones I have tried work great.</li>
            <li>Some of these are great blades, some I could have done without.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the two brands I&#x27;ve tried and look forward to sampling others.</li>

            <li>They work great.  </li>
            <li>I think this was a great way to get some experience with a variety of blades without spending a lot of time or money.</li>
            <li>After using all of the blades in this pack I learned that most of them aren&#x27;t very good.  </li>
            <li>Very nice package to find your favorite blades!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve heard good things about as well.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good sample of a variety of manufacturers and styles of blades, and at a good price.</li>
            <li>this is a good pack to start with.</li>
            <li>The package came as advertised and had a good mix of blades; some brands had 5 blades and others</li>
            <li>Gives a good idea about what you may prefer in a razor blade.</li>
            <li>Mostly good choices but a dog or two in the mix</li>
            <li>Nice selection, great price.</li>
            <li>This is a good selection of razor blades.  </li>
            <li>It has a good assortment of brands and blaze thickness.  </li>
            <li>this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>and I thought I liked the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li>I bought a de for my husband but was unsure of what kind of blade he might like.  </li>
            <li>A good range of blade sharpness that truly assists with finding the appropriate blade for one&#x27;s beard type.</li>
            <li>They have included some of the most popular choices</li>
            <li>I have 3 more brands to try yet, and am looking forward to it.  </li>
            <li>Get to try out multiple brands to find the blade that works best for me.  </li>
            <li>For me, I ended up liking the Merkur blades the most.</li>
            <li>and I have since fell in love with the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li>I was able to find 2 types that work well with my face and one that was just OK.</li>
            <li>Alot cheaper than the top disposable razors.</li>
            <li>Just started using the blades and have not found a favorite yet.</li>
            <li>I took the time to rate each blade so I can make a more informed &amp;#34;final&amp;#34; purchase decision once all have been tried.</li>
            <li>If you want to try different blades till you find the best one for your razor and your face</li>
            <li>Love these blades.</li>
            <li>still think it&#x27;s good value based on the cost and the limited experience that I had with the blades, but I would no longer recommend the sampler set except to a more experienced DE shaver.</li>
            <li>will help me find the best blade to work with my Merkur long handle razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this packet for the beginner as well as the seasoned shaver that is wondering what might be the best for him or her.</li>
            <li>I was new to shaving with a safety razor when I ordered these, and the price looked great.  </li>
            <li>The other thing is that a blade that works wonderful in one razor chops through my face in another razor.  </li>
            <li>Vender very quick shipment to Dallas.  </li>
            <li>in general, great selection for the price.</li>
            <li>But, this is the best way to check out different brands at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Good selection of blades, all in new packages.</li>
            <li>I just went double-edge a month or so ago, and bought this because the book I read (\\&quot;Gourmet Shaving\\&quot;) said that one should buy a sampler first because a blade from one manufacturer that cuts up your neighbor&#x27;s face might be perfect for yours, and vice versa - so try a bunch, the author said, and stick with whatever one actually worked for YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give an accurate review seeing how I have not tried all of the blades in the pack.</li>
            <li>This starter pack is a great way to try different DE razor blades.</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;m happy with the relative value considering the variety and number of blades included in this pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since realized that I&#x27;m most happy with another brand that costs a few bucks more.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the Merkur blades  </li>
            <li>This was a good way to test out many different brands.  </li>
            <li>the two i was most interested to try).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve purchased a safety razor and you&#x27;re not sure which blade to use, this is a good pack to sample some of the more popular blades to find a new favorite without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>I really believe now that you have to find the right match for your razor with blade to your own face.</li>
            <li>Some blades are good in certain razors and work better for different types of faces.  </li>
            <li>It provides a good sample of different blades.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been through all of them yet, but as a new wet shaver, I needed to get an idea of what I like best.</li>
            <li>So far, the Merkur blades have been the most gentle with my face and the most consistent, but YMMV, which is why the combo pack is such a great option.</li>
            <li>They are a perfect starting razor and actually came with my razor handle purchase.</li>
            <li>My face, my two cent; as they say, your milage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;Blade Ratings:&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Super Platinum  8&lt;</li>
            <li>Wow, those are hands down the sharpest and best blades on the market.  </li>
            <li>So I am new to the double edge scene, so this was a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>Nice overview of different blades.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>Long Handled Safety Razor]] and loving both.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, this item arrived a day before the earliest estimate.</li>
            <li>Totally would reccommend getting a sample pack like this if your new to wet shaving, as you will find the blade that works best for you.</li>
            <li>Bought my first DE razor</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, the only thing I wish it had was a 5 pack of Feathers for when I&#x27;m feeling brave enough.    </li>
            <li>- the name is appropriate because they are the only ones that cut me.</li>
            <li>Once these are gone, i&#x27;ll try a different sample pack for even more variety.</li>
            <li>My daily shave has become an enjoyable meditation time, instead of a chore!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update after several months:&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t ended up using many of these blades.  </li>
            <li>I am following the advice of many online reviews by using this assorted blade pack to get started.</li>
            <li>I made the switch to &#x27;real&#x27; razors ;-) and could not be happier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relatively new to shaving with double edge razors and don&#x27;t know what to look or ask for to find the blade that my face loves the most.  </li>
            <li>Decent set of blades!</li>
            <li>If anyone is purchasing a merkur or equivalent safety razor for the first time I highly recommend this sample pack.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated the options picking this up provided to me, at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price too.</li>
            <li>I get at least 4 good shaves from them.</li>
            <li>I recently went to a double edge razor and am loving it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been the first time I&#x27;ve needed new blades.</li>
            <li>I actively avoided buying another razor sampler with these in them because I have so friggin&#x27; many already.</li>
            <li>Extra Super Stainless  7</li>
            <li>I have become a true double edge razor aficionado since ordering this sample pack.</li>
            <li>Sharp&#x27;s and Merkurs are both good, mild razors that last a long time.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as advertised, no switches of a major brand which others often do.  </li>
            <li>OK pack, had some crappy blades in with the premiums but it is worth it to try out a few different brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and feel like the variety in this set</li>
            <li>If you want to try a new blaze or are new to shaving with a de</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used merkur blades since I started wet shaving, and they do the job nicely &amp; last more than one shave.  </li>
            <li>Mine had exactly what was listed, and was in a big box with bubble wrap all in a ziplock.     </li>
            <li>It would take considerable effort to cut yourself with one.</li>
            <li>If you have thicker hair and sensitive skin you can probably pass on this sampler and use a BIC or Personna razor and go sharper (Feather and Kai) or milder (Wilkinson) from there.</li>
            <li>I have been surprised with the varied performance between the blades.</li>
            <li>Do not buy any old brand of DE blades and put them in your razor and be done with it.  </li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t believe how much of a difference the different blades make.</li>
            <li>The choice of blade is highly personal and buying a variety pack such as this one is a simple way to compare blades over several weeks to find your favorite.</li>
            <li>WOW.....</li>
            <li>If there are some I really like or don&#x27;t like, I&#x27;ll come back and update this review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are new to DE razor like I am would highly recommend a sample either this one or a similar one.</li>
            <li>They got dull very quickly and started to snag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite so far is the Shark narrowly edging out the Merkurs and Sharp.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased these blades to go with my new razor and Omega shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only had a chance to try the merkur, bic &amp; derby brand blades.  </li>
            <li>Without knowing what the general characteristics of these other blades are supposed to be, I simply haven&#x27;t been interested in taking the time to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have not used all the brands yet, but I really like the Sharp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used 2 different brands from the bunch so far</li>
            <li>Not much to say, just interested in a variety pack,  so far tried the BIC, which was Bad for me, Merkur, is ok.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Reasonably priced, the only thing I wish it had was a 5 pack of Feathers for when I&#x27;m feeling brave enough.    </li>
            <li> - the name is appropriate because they are the only ones that cut me.</li>
            <li> Once these are gone, i&#x27;ll try a different sample pack for even more variety.</li>
            <li> My daily shave has become an enjoyable meditation time, instead of a chore!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update after several months:&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t ended up using many of these blades.  </li>
            <li> I am following the advice of many online reviews by using this assorted blade pack to get started.</li>
            <li> I made the switch to &#x27;real&#x27; razors ;-) and could not be happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to shaving with double edge razors and don&#x27;t know what to look or ask for to find the blade that my face loves the most.  </li>
            <li> Decent set of blades!</li>
            <li> If anyone is purchasing a merkur or equivalent safety razor for the first time I highly recommend this sample pack.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated the options picking this up provided to me, at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> I get at least 4 good shaves from them.</li>
            <li> I recently went to a double edge razor and am loving it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been the first time I&#x27;ve needed new blades.</li>
            <li> I actively avoided buying another razor sampler with these in them because I have so friggin&#x27; many already.</li>
            <li> Extra Super Stainless  7</li>
            <li> I have become a true double edge razor aficionado since ordering this sample pack.</li>
            <li> Sharp&#x27;s and Merkurs are both good, mild razors that last a long time.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as advertised, no switches of a major brand which others often do.  </li>
            <li> OK pack, had some crappy blades in with the premiums but it is worth it to try out a few different brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and feel like the variety in this set</li>
            <li> If you want to try a new blaze or are new to shaving with a de</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used merkur blades since I started wet shaving, and they do the job nicely &amp; last more than one shave.  </li>
            <li> Mine had exactly what was listed, and was in a big box with bubble wrap all in a ziplock.     </li>
            <li> It would take considerable effort to cut yourself with one.</li>
            <li> If you have thicker hair and sensitive skin you can probably pass on this sampler and use a BIC or Personna razor and go sharper (Feather and Kai) or milder (Wilkinson) from there.</li>
            <li> I have been surprised with the varied performance between the blades.</li>
            <li> Do not buy any old brand of DE blades and put them in your razor and be done with it.  </li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t believe how much of a difference the different blades make.</li>
            <li> The choice of blade is highly personal and buying a variety pack such as this one is a simple way to compare blades over several weeks to find your favorite.</li>
            <li> WOW.....</li>
            <li> If there are some I really like or don&#x27;t like, I&#x27;ll come back and update this review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are new to DE razor like I am would highly recommend a sample either this one or a similar one.</li>
            <li> They got dull very quickly and started to snag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite so far is the Shark narrowly edging out the Merkurs and Sharp.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased these blades to go with my new razor and Omega shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only had a chance to try the merkur, bic &amp; derby brand blades.  </li>
            <li> Without knowing what the general characteristics of these other blades are supposed to be, I simply haven&#x27;t been interested in taking the time to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have not used all the brands yet, but I really like the Sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 2 different brands from the bunch so far</li>
            <li> Not much to say, just interested in a variety pack,  so far tried the BIC, which was Bad for me, Merkur, is ok.  </li>
            <li> So far I have only used four types of blades, Sharp, Merkur, Shark, and Bic.  </li>
            <li> These will last me a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Relying on a single blade review just doesn&#x27;t work as everyones beards and shaving techniques are different.</li>
            <li> Some brands are in packs of ten while the remainder are either in packs of 5 or just 5 each loose blades (wax paper wrapped).</li>

            <li> The only additional thing I&#x27;d like to see is a little description about the characteristics of the various blades.  </li>
            <li> IF you shave regularly this should last for at least 9 months.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a shave of attrition and you will likely not enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I started with the sharp brand.  </li>
            <li> I will update as I use other blades.</li>
            <li> you aren&#x27;t looking for ultra sharp blades, then give this pack a shot.</li>
            <li> The Shark&#x27;s are a little rough if you have thick hair</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I received my order as pictured.  This seems like a great way to decide what brand of blades I like the best without having a bunch laying around if I don&#x27;t like a brand.  I&#x27;ve been using them with a [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] and loving both. I wont comment on the brands because apparently different beards like different blades.</li>
            <li> I feel the variety is nice, so you can choose a blade that works the best with your skin. None of the blades were bad. I like the Merkers. By the way ever since I started shaving this way, my skin has not had razor burn.</li>
            <li> Decent set of blades! Bought my first DE razor ( [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] ) and wanted to get a variety pack of blades to try. Mine had exactly what was listed, and was in a big box with bubble wrap all in a ziplock.     This was the only one i could find that had Merkur and Derby blades (the two i was most interested to try). Also the Shark and sharps i&#x27;ve heard good things about as well.    Reasonably priced, the only thing I wish it had was a 5 pack of Feathers for when I&#x27;m feeling brave enough.    Either way, great price and a GREAT set of blades to get you started.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as advertised, no switches of a major brand which others often do.  So far I&#x27;ve only had a chance to try the merkur, bic &amp; derby brand blades.  I&#x27;ve used merkur blades since I started wet shaving, and they do the job nicely &amp; last more than one shave.  The bic brand was dissapointing for me, as I have really thick hair, I had a hard time getting through that shave.  The Derby brand was a pleasant suprise, lasts about 3 to 4 shaves, gets a real nice close shave &amp; doesnt leave me with any razor burn.  I have 3 more brands to try yet, and am looking forward to it.  Totally would reccommend getting a sample pack like this if your new to wet shaving, as you will find the blade that works best for you.</li>
            <li> I just went double-edge a month or so ago, and bought this because the book I read (\\&quot;Gourmet Shaving\\&quot;) said that one should buy a sampler first because a blade from one manufacturer that cuts up your neighbor&#x27;s face might be perfect for yours, and vice versa - so try a bunch, the author said, and stick with whatever one actually worked for YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good sample of a variety of manufacturers and styles of blades, and at a good price. It seemed to be the best when I studying the sampler packs on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It provides a good sample of different blades. The Derby blades weren&#x27;t very good, but the others were great!</li>
            <li> I returned this unopened because it was not as shown. The picture and description indicates 6 packages of premium brand blades. The actual product shipped contained 3 of the brands shown and 3 packages of brands I have never heard of. A big disappointment and a big waste of time.</li>
            <li> Ordered this set on a Sunday evening. Had it in-hand by Thursday. I received 40 blades - the same six labels that are pictured in the description. No substitutes. I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and feel like the variety in this set will help me find the best blade to work with my Merkur long handle razor.</li>
            <li> This sample is great.  I decided to get this after looking around amazon and decided that it would be a good idea to find the razors that would work best for me.  Item came in excellent condition just as described.  It looks just like pic in a ziploc bag.  Going thru them now to see which will work best for me.  If you are new to DE razor like I am would highly recommend a sample either this one or a similar one.</li>
            <li> So I am new to the double edge scene, so this was a great purchase.  Get to try out multiple brands to find the blade that works best for me.  Probably take a while to try all the blades, but the ones I have tried work great.</li>
            <li> Some of these are great blades, some I could have done without. The BIC&#x27;s are the sharpest of the pack and seem to be the highest quality. They are also forgiving for being the sharpest. The Shark&#x27;s are a little rough if you have thick hair - the name is appropriate because they are the only ones that cut me. Sharp&#x27;s and Merkurs are both good, mild razors that last a long time. The Dorcos are easily the worst and cheapest blades and I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use these after two attempts. Derby... these are ubiquitous, dull, and resilient. They are a perfect starting razor and actually came with my razor handle purchase. It would take considerable effort to cut yourself with one. The problem is with thick hair it&#x27;s a shave of attrition and you will likely not enjoy it. I actively avoided buying another razor sampler with these in them because I have so friggin&#x27; many already. If you have thicker hair and sensitive skin you can probably pass on this sampler and use a BIC or Personna razor and go sharper (Feather and Kai) or milder (Wilkinson) from there.</li>
            <li> If anyone is purchasing a merkur or equivalent safety razor for the first time I highly recommend this sample pack. All razor blades, like all faces, are not created equal. For myself the Derby and Dorco worked best.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give an accurate review seeing how I have not tried all of the blades in the pack. If you&#x27;re just starting out in the safety razor world this is a good pack to start with.</li>
            <li> Vender very quick shipment to Dallas.  Not much to say, just interested in a variety pack,  so far tried the BIC, which was Bad for me, Merkur, is ok.  Would order from FGP again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Hit or miss with this mix of this blade sample.</li>
            <li> The package is a great way to test a variety of razor blades. The package came as advertised and had a good mix of blades; some brands had 5 blades and others had 10 blades like the Merkur. I have been surprised with the varied performance between the blades. But, this is the best way to check out different brands at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Gives a good idea about what you may prefer in a razor blade.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these blades to go with my new razor and Omega shaving cream.  Probably the sample pack of 40 will last a year, for me. I&#x27;m happy with the two brands I&#x27;ve tried and look forward to sampling others.</li>
            <li> Do not buy any old brand of DE blades and put them in your razor and be done with it.  There are aggressive razors, aggressive blades, super sharp blades, ridiculously sharp blades (Feather), dull blades, and others.  The other thing is that a blade that works wonderful in one razor chops through my face in another razor.  Some blades are good in certain razors and work better for different types of faces.  Buying the sample pack is essential to trying different blades out and seeing how they work for your face. Every brand of razor advertised in the pack came as stated.  Once these are gone, i&#x27;ll try a different sample pack for even more variety.</li>
            <li> This razor pack came just a shown. This starter pack is a great way to try different DE razor blades. I made the switch to &#x27;real&#x27; razors ;-) and could not be happier. My daily shave has become an enjoyable meditation time, instead of a chore!&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how much of a difference the different blades make. I really believe now that you have to find the right match for your razor with blade to your own face. I got the [[ASIN:B000QYEK88 Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C]]. Once you learn how to use it, you will never wish to go back to the cartridge face / wallet killers! For me, I ended up liking the Merkur blades the most.</li>
            <li> Mostly good choices but a dog or two in the mix</li>
            <li> Good way to find the blades that best suit your skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I started using a safety razor a few months ago and it&#x27;s been the first time I&#x27;ve needed new blades. This pack will help me find the razor blade that I like the best and it&#x27;ll last me about a year!!</li>
            <li> Nice selection, great price.</li>
            <li> I have become a true double edge razor aficionado since ordering this sample pack. Relying on a single blade review just doesn&#x27;t work as everyones beards and shaving techniques are different. The choice of blade is highly personal and buying a variety pack such as this one is a simple way to compare blades over several weeks to find your favorite. They have included some of the most popular choices and I have since fell in love with the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> Very nice package to find your favorite blades! I have been trying one from each pack, then going back to them to compare. Believe I will buy another sampler just to have the variety.</li>
            <li> OK pack, had some crappy blades in with the premiums but it is worth it to try out a few different brands. I was able to find 2 types that work well with my face and one that was just OK. The Merkur is a 10 pack and all the others are 5 packs.</li>
            <li> The pack came in excellent condition. I&#x27;ve only used 2 different brands from the bunch so far and they work great. All razors are in great condition with no cosmetic problems. These will last me a LONG time.</li>
            <li> A great sample pack or razors to find the razors that work best for you. Alot cheaper than the top disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I have just begun to use the blade.  I started with the sharp brand.  They work great.  I get at least 4 good shaves from them. I will update as I use other blades.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, this item arrived a day before the earliest estimate. Contained everything that was described as well as a few samples of aftershave/balm. I 100% recommend this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Just started using the blades and have not found a favorite yet.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as pictured.  The only additional thing I&#x27;d like to see is a little description about the characteristics of the various blades.  I&#x27;m relatively new to shaving with double edge razors and don&#x27;t know what to look or ask for to find the blade that my face loves the most.  That being said, I&#x27;m happy with the relative value considering the variety and number of blades included in this pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after several months:&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t ended up using many of these blades.  I was new to shaving with a safety razor when I ordered these, and the price looked great.  I&#x27;ve since realized that I&#x27;m most happy with another brand that costs a few bucks more.  Without knowing what the general characteristics of these other blades are supposed to be, I simply haven&#x27;t been interested in taking the time to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think it&#x27;s good value based on the cost and the limited experience that I had with the blades, but I would no longer recommend the sampler set except to a more experienced DE shaver.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used four types of blades, Sharp, Merkur, Shark, and Bic.  My favorite so far is the Shark narrowly edging out the Merkurs and Sharp.  However, the Bic blades were absolutely HORRIBLE!  I have shaved with safety razors for years and the Bic shave was so painful that I had to stop before finishing.  This has never happened before...never!&lt;br /&gt;  That being said; I think that buying this sample pack is the best way to find the blade combination that is best for you and your razor.  I highly recommend this packet for the beginner as well as the seasoned shaver that is wondering what might be the best for him or her.</li>
            <li> Good selection of blades, all in new packages. I really enjoy the Merkur blades  thankfully there are 10 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Just tried a Bic Blade.....WOW.....and I thought I liked the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> This was a good way to test out many different brands.  I would recommend to anyone starting out with safety razor or if you&#x27;re just looking to change blades.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated the options picking this up provided to me, at a reasonable cost. I haven&#x27;t been through all of them yet, but as a new wet shaver, I needed to get an idea of what I like best. So far, the Merkur blades have been the most gentle with my face and the most consistent, but YMMV, which is why the combo pack is such a great option. I gave it 4 stars, simply because a few of the brands really tore me up (I&#x27;m looking at you Gillette.)</li>
            <li> After using all of the blades in this pack I learned that most of them aren&#x27;t very good.  The bic&#x27;s were probably the worst!  They got dull very quickly and started to snag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this sample pack, I went and purchased feather blades.  Wow, those are hands down the sharpest and best blades on the market.  I will be sticking with them from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t looking for ultra sharp blades, then give this pack a shot.</li>
            <li> I think this was a great way to get some experience with a variety of blades without spending a lot of time or money. Some brands are in packs of ten while the remainder are either in packs of 5 or just 5 each loose blades (wax paper wrapped). I took the time to rate each blade so I can make a more informed &amp;#34;final&amp;#34; purchase decision once all have been tried. My face, my two cent; as they say, your milage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;Blade Ratings:&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Super Platinum  8&lt;br /&gt;Sharp Durablade (HI CHROMIUM)  4&lt;br /&gt;Shark  3&lt;br /&gt;BIC (Chrome Platinum)  1&lt;br /&gt;DORCO Platinum ST300  7&lt;br /&gt;DERBY Extra Super Stainless  7</li>
            <li> This is a good selection of razor blades.  IF you shave regularly this should last for at least 9 months.  FInd one that works best in your razor and you will be set to go.</li>
            <li> If you want to try different blades till you find the best one for your razor and your face this is it. I recently went to a double edge razor and am loving it. I am following the advice of many online reviews by using this assorted blade pack to get started.</li>
            <li> I bought a de for my husband but was unsure of what kind of blade he might like.  It has a good assortment of brands and blaze thickness.  If you want to try a new blaze or are new to shaving with a de this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> A good range of blade sharpness that truly assists with finding the appropriate blade for one&#x27;s beard type. Reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> Love these blades. Have not used all the brands yet, but I really like the Sharp.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve purchased a safety razor and you&#x27;re not sure which blade to use, this is a good pack to sample some of the more popular blades to find a new favorite without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not yet tried all the different brands. I don&#x27;t shave *that* often. If there are some I really like or don&#x27;t like, I&#x27;ll come back and update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in general, great selection for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice overview of different blades.</li>
