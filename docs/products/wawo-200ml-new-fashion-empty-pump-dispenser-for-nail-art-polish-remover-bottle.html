            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Recommend for anyone that does their own nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>and it was no longer able to pump any nail polish remover through.</li>
            <li>The lid weighs more than the bottle, so it&#x27;s top-heavy.  </li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than promised and in perfect shape.</li>
            <li>Seems to work better than the all plastic pumps.</li>
            <li>Have ordered 5 more to make bathroom drawers with only items i use must;  fits just perfect.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cute, everyone loves them.</li>
            <li>I put a vinyl chalkboard sticker on them to creat a cute label.</li>
            <li>The pump works fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>Dispenses accurately measured amount every time.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy doing my nails allot</li>
            <li>worked great in beginning, then a couple weeks later they started sticking and one rusted...</li>
            <li>I bought two and one never worked quite right.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for to keep nail polish remove in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>think I&#x27;ll just opt for paying a bit more next time and having a product that lasts.</li>
            <li>its not clogged and its not broken, just stopped working.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the simple yet functional dispenser is.  </li>
            <li>But these are so cheap that it wasn&#x27;t too big a deal to replace it.</li>
            <li>This obviously won&#x27;t be an issue once it&#x27;s full of polish remover, but does indicate the lack of quality.  </li>
            <li>The lid does not snap shut either, it just sets down on top of the pump.  </li>
            <li>This is very convenient ,dispenses directly on cotton ball.</li>
            <li>If ppl have trouble then they probably have to make sure that the tube is in right and that it isn&#x27;t too low of an amount of remover.</li>
            <li>Only filled it half full so it wouldn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>Yet again, but for the LAST time, ripped of by cheap Chinese crap.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I broke in the first month, maybe was only mine, but I will not buy another one.</li>
            <li>Be aware that this comes from Hong Kong, so it will take a few weeks.</li>

            <li> I bought this since my beloved Mary Kay polish remover bottle lid has finally broken after about 20 years, and they don&#x27;t make them anymore. :(  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not excited about this product, but it will probably do the job.</li>
            <li> The quality is very poor, the wait was extra long it is basically a waste of time and money...</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> i used it for 2 days and afterwards it didnt work really dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> It worked for a day and then it started to leak like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly disappointed and regret making this purchase.</li>
            <li> totally annoying considering it took forever to get here too.</li>

            <li> As promised and advertised and a great price too.</li>
            <li> received this product and it worked great for about 2 weeks. I use it to dispense ear cleaning liquid for dogs. After about 10 or so uses it now won&#x27;t pump anymore. its not clogged and its not broken, just stopped working. totally annoying considering it took forever to get here too. Wont be buying from this company again.</li>
            <li> It worked for a day and then it started to leak like crazy. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it doesn&#x27;t smell up the place and salvages  remover.  The pump works fine. If ppl have trouble then they probably have to make sure that the tube is in right and that it isn&#x27;t too low of an amount of remover. It has to be a teaspoon amount for it not to reach the tube so it&#x27;s cheating you and if that&#x27;s a problem find one that longer from another bottle.</li>
            <li> Cheap and poor quality. Feels like it was going to break. You get what you pay for with this item.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for to keep nail polish remove in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheaply made. I only used it once and the tube inside broke and it was no longer able to pump any nail polish remover through. I&#x27;m highly disappointed and regret making this purchase. I guess you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheaply made.  The lid weighs more than the bottle, so it&#x27;s top-heavy.  This obviously won&#x27;t be an issue once it&#x27;s full of polish remover, but does indicate the lack of quality.  The lid does not snap shut either, it just sets down on top of the pump.  I bought this since my beloved Mary Kay polish remover bottle lid has finally broken after about 20 years, and they don&#x27;t make them anymore. :(  I&#x27;m not excited about this product, but it will probably do the job. Be aware that this comes from Hong Kong, so it will take a few weeks. If you&#x27;re not in a hurry, then it&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> Good price, great item...already plan on buying another! Arrived earlier than promised and in perfect shape. Recommend for anyone that does their own nails.</li>
            <li> Quits working allot I&#x27;m no professional but I enjoy doing my nails allot and I spill nail polish remover allot so this helps somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;I still use it it just takes allot of pumping to get it started.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this for nail polish remover.This is very convenient ,dispenses directly on cotton ball. Dispenses accurately measured amount every time.</li>
            <li> It works fine but I had to invert it to get the solution to pump out properly which spilled all over my hand.</li>
            <li> Yet again, but for the LAST time, ripped of by cheap Chinese crap.&lt;br /&gt;This dispenser worked for two weeks. (that&#x27;s a generous estimate.)</li>
            <li> worked great in beginning, then a couple weeks later they started sticking and one rusted...</li>
            <li> I broke in the first month, maybe was only mine, but I will not buy another one.</li>
            <li> i used it for 2 days and afterwards it didnt work really dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> Seems to work better than the all plastic pumps. Plus it looks nicer! Only filled it half full so it wouldn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> Works great for the price! Just like a salon would use. Side note- nail polish will evaporate if left in the container.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the simple yet functional dispenser is.  Have ordered 5 more to make bathroom drawers with only items i use must;  fits just perfect.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> The quality is very poor, the wait was extra long it is basically a waste of time and money... however it does work.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after one use.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for what I need. They&#x27;re cute, everyone loves them. I put a vinyl chalkboard sticker on them to creat a cute label. One of the pumps stopped working as soon as I started using it. But these are so cheap that it wasn&#x27;t too big a deal to replace it.</li>
            <li> I bought two and one never worked quite right. They did last me about 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll just opt for paying a bit more next time and having a product that lasts.</li>
