            <li>It may not be the best price</li>
            <li>This balm is excellent.  </li>
            <li>However, with the balm, my lips feel wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is the best lip balm.  </li>
            <li>softens chapped lips and skin...works great!  </li>
            <li>It is an excellent lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Awesome lip balm.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this!</li>
            <li>lip balm is as good as the hand cream!</li>
            <li>It is soothing and has great healing properties.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, and the taste is good.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have it in a tube form instead of a pot.</li>
            <li>When we visited New Zealand, we found the Manuka products were the best.</li>
            <li>it sure did help with my eczema.</li>
            <li>Over and over and over, many times a day I would apply it because my lips demanded it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like most of the overly perfumed and sticky balms out there.  </li>
            <li>its ok.</li>
            <li>I have bought better lip balms than this one in the us.</li>
            <li>I would purchase again, I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Love this brand.  </li>
            <li>I use other lip balms, all popular brands with yummy flavors, but I rely on Manuka honey balm for the best results.</li>
            <li>I was super glad to see it on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought some Manuka products on a trip to New Zealand and I loved them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dry, chapped lips.</li>
            <li>ok but it was really greasy and tasted like petroleum Jelly.</li>
            <li>Fast and secure shipping!</li>
            <li>Taste good and stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li>Really good for winter dry lips!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s helping clear it all up much better than the steroid cream doctors have given me.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s worth  it to me.</li>
            <li>did not find this superior to other products I have used</li>
            <li>So when I got this I put it on right  </li>
            <li>The balm is good, but honestly it doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better or worse than regular chapsticks.</li>
            <li>For healing benefits, it works very fast.</li>
            <li>and the next day I could tell  my lips were getting better.</li>
            <li>but I will definitely  get more of this.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Is it obvious, I love the stuff?</li>
            <li>Very soothing and cooling!</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, but the staying power is no better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>It does have a nice little scent to it, and as far as &#x27;taste&#x27; goes if you accidentally taste it</li>
            <li>love some of the other Wild Ferns products and thought this might be my replacement.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this because i&#x27;ve used moisturizers from this brand before, and was looking to use something a little more natural on my lips.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this by a friend in New Zealand.  </li>
            <li>I have skin problems eczema, very sensitive skin almost anything  </li>
            <li>I wish it was all natural!</li>
            <li>its not worth it to return because it cost more to send it back.</li>
            <li>I am still trying to find a replacement for the old recipe Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Before discovering Wild Ferns Manuka Honey Lip Balm, I used Carmex lip balm--</li>
            <li>but if your wary about using chapstick or Vaseline on your lips all the time, it is good.</li>
            <li>There was a major improvement from how my lips were the day before.</li>
            <li>I use it at night before going to sleep and my lips are soft and moist the next morning.  </li>

            <li> did not find this superior to other products I have used but it is alright.  Maybe over time I will notice a benefit.  Have used it only a few days.  There is still hope.</li>
            <li> Lip issues weather related or medical, this is it. Give it a Try</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this! I have skin problems eczema, very sensitive skin almost anything  will break me out. My lips get really bad to the point it hurts to talk and move my lips. So when I got this I put it on right  away and it was instant relieve  and the next day I could tell  my lips were getting better. There was a major improvement from how my lips were the day before. I have some of the manuka honey products, the fash wash, moisturizing cream, and then the actual manuka honey. And let me tell ya it sure did help with my eczema. All the dry patches and itching it&#x27;s helping clear it all up much better than the steroid cream doctors have given me. The only thing bad I would say is the prices are a bit much for some things. I mean come on almost $7 dollars just for lip balm. It may not be the best price but I will definitely  get more of this. I don&#x27;t care about the price when it relieved the pain of my lips and the awful redness baboon looking. So it&#x27;s worth  it to me.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I get tired of using chapsticks, which only work temporarily for me. So I bought this because i&#x27;ve used moisturizers from this brand before, and was looking to use something a little more natural on my lips. The balm is good, but honestly it doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better or worse than regular chapsticks. It does have a nice little scent to it, and as far as &#x27;taste&#x27; goes if you accidentally taste it it&#x27;s basically the same as Vaseline. Considering that, it is a bit pricy but if your wary about using chapstick or Vaseline on your lips all the time, it is good. It seems as if I reapply it on my lips almost as often as any other brand, though. It would be nice to have it in a tube form instead of a pot. I might purchase it again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to find a replacement for the old recipe Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.  Since Clorox bought the company, the formulation is not very emollient, doesn&#x27;t last on the lips and leaves my lips feeling dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love some of the other Wild Ferns products and thought this might be my replacement.  It goes on nicely, but the staying power is no better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.  Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> When we visited New Zealand, we found the Manuka products were the best. I have dry skin and they replenish the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dcarlson</li>
            <li> I use the manuka honey hand cream, so I decided to try the lip balm.  I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The lip balm is as good as the hand cream!</li>
            <li> I originally bought some Manuka products on a trip to New Zealand and I loved them.  Wanted to try the lip balm.  This balm is excellent.  My lips get dry and crack with the weather and dry heat in my apartment.  However, with the balm, my lips feel wonderful.  Delivery of the product was prompt.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm.  It is soothing and has great healing properties. I will only use this for my lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Manuka honey lip balm for years. It&#x27;s great for dry, chapped lips. For healing benefits, it works very fast. It doesn&#x27;t have flavor, but I use it for how well conditioned it leaves my lips. I use other lip balms, all popular brands with yummy flavors, but I rely on Manuka honey balm for the best results. It really works!</li>
            <li> Before discovering Wild Ferns Manuka Honey Lip Balm, I used Carmex lip balm--oh, did I use it! Over and over and over, many times a day I would apply it because my lips demanded it. With Manuka Honey lip balm, I use it after brushing my teeth morning and night; if I&#x27;m going to be in the sun, I&#x27;ll apply it then, too. My lips have not chapped, they never feel dry. Is it obvious, I love the stuff?</li>
            <li> I use this every night.  It isn&#x27;t sticky or have a lot of smell or taste--I don&#x27;t like most of the overly perfumed and sticky balms out there.  I was super glad to see it on amazon.  love it!</li>
            <li> its ok. I have bought better lip balms than this one in the us. its not worth it to return because it cost more to send it back.</li>
            <li> bought as a gift for others.  The lip balm applies well and lasts all day.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to crack the lips due to dryness and keeps things moist</li>
            <li> softens chapped lips and skin...works great!  I would purchase again, I was pleased with the product. Very soothing and cooling!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin..  It is the only product I have used that keeps my lips moisturized. Helps to heal the dry skin.  Not greasy.  Threw out all of my other lip balms.</li>
            <li> I wish this didn&#x27;t have petroleum in it :(</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this by a friend in New Zealand.  When I found it on Amazon I was elated.  It is an excellent lip balm.  I use it at night before going to sleep and my lips are soft and moist the next morning.  I also keep it on my work desk to apply whenever needed.</li>
            <li> ok but it was really greasy and tasted like petroleum Jelly. I wish it was all natural!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s essential fort my dry lips. I&#x27;ve used it every night before bed for the last two years.</li>
            <li> Really good for winter dry lips!  Taste good and stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, and the taste is good. I had a minor allergic reaction initially but it wasn&#x27;t bad, likely because I hadn&#x27;t been exposed to the pollen from the area. Lips are not chapped after application and I only have to put it one once or twice a day. I&#x27;m not sure how I feel that the container uses polystyrene &lt;6&gt; plastic, as that can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> Awesome lip balm.  Love this brand.  Fast and secure shipping!</li>
