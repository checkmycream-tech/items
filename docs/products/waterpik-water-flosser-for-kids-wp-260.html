            <li>The best thing you can do for your teeth and gums is use a waterpik.  </li>
            <li>The pressure is excellent - I don&#x27;t even use the max pressure so I would worry about leaving it alone in a kid&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li>Excellent device for travel.</li>
            <li>But, this works once you figure out what is best on the &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; for you.</li>

            <li>Gone are the days of the perfect oral irrigator, ever since Waterpik split from Teldyne.  </li>
            <li>The 80&#x27;s- 90&#x27;s model was the BEST one, with its just-right-sized rectangular reservoir, and the one that lasted 10+ years</li>
            <li>Teledyne also had an excellent travel one during that time period.  </li>
            <li>very happy with the product</li>
            <li>Great purchase for the price!</li>
            <li>This was the perfect price.</li>

            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful!</li>
            <li>I never imagined that this would be so wonderful!</li>

            <li>This unit is a perfect size for a child.  </li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>The best part is that she loves using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It does a good job cleaning in and around that.  </li>
            <li>The stickers were a good beginning.</li>
            <li>I have had my Waterpik for two weeks now and it feels so good on my gums and my teeth</li>
            <li>Delighted that I bought this item.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it is a good product or not.  </li>
            <li>Bought this in March, thought it was good</li>
            <li>It works great and he can use it on his own.</li>
            <li>I ignored it because of the number of good reviews.</li>
            <li>This fits and has a good water capacity and I may fill it twice if need be.  </li>
            <li>This product worked well, and my kids loved it.  </li>

            <li>The colors are good for boys or girls.</li>

            <li>Well everything looks good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She loved the stickers and decorated it with ALL of them.&lt;br /&gt;Tube</li>
            <li>LOved it while it worked, but it broke after about 3 months of use.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t use a lot of counter space which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Good intro water-pik for kids, expecially with braces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a good job and removes all the built up gunk and food particles that they can&#x27;t get out with a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>None of them did a good job of maintaining pressure or of having quality components that didn&#x27;t break or leak.</li>
            <li>the good work.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-Speed 1 is good for kids, I use speed 2 which pulses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why didn&#x27;t I think of this before, I remember my parents using one and loved using it.</li>
            <li>good and kids seem to like having kid stuff.</li>
            <li>A good machine sturdy and efficient.</li>

            <li>Good prize for a portable unit.</li>
            <li>Good appliance</li>
            <li>This is perfect to keep them clean.  </li>
            <li>It works perfectly for getting my son&#x27;s braces clean and cleaning food from between both my children&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>Great product, but this model isn&#x27;t very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use, would buy again!</li>
            <li>Good price for the service it provides, much better than dental floss!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to be able to take the Flosser for Kids on the road, and not have to miss the one at home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this.</li>
            <li>Her dentist finds her teeth and gums very healthy.</li>

            <li>and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>very pleased w/pressure.</li>
            <li>This is a great feature because many of the battery operated piks die and you cannot fix them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>find 2 is a good setting and works quite nicely for my mouth.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, applies excellent pressure, and the parts seem to be better made.</li>
            <li>The adjustable pressure is great and he liked being able to decorate the unit with the vinyl clings.  </li>

            <li>After doing some research I decided to go with this one and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>In fact, I use it too and love it!  </li>
            <li>: Add a lid to the top!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Great size and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and attractive.</li>
            <li>This waterpik is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space, and does a great job.</li>
            <li>The pressure is great, in fact the level 3 is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice if the tip of it has some sort of color code so that we can use it for more than one kid!</li>
            <li>I have never used a water flosser before, and I was very excited to order this one!</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s both have braces and this waterpik is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has done an amazing job with the prices and products.</li>
            <li>but it is seriously AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Amazing for my daughter with braces</li>
            <li>Excelent product, nice price</li>
            <li>Nice bright color, cute touch with the stickers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice however, this does not come with a cover.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have an alternative (</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for after snacks like Wheat Thins or Oreos it flushes most of the impacted food out and makes for better brushing afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Also, it would be nice if there was a button so that you could control when it sprayed.</li>
            <li>Nice control switch for stronger water pressure so she can increase as her gums heal.  </li>
            <li>Works nicely.</li>
            <li>Adjustable pressure is nice.</li>
            <li>My child uses two tanks of warm water per cleaning.</li>
            <li>Nice to be using one again.  </li>
            <li>This is incredible, gets everything out and is fun.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.</li>
            <li>It will come in handy when he gets braces, too.</li>
            <li>They also give 3 pressure settings which is nice.    </li>
            <li>The reservoir flips over to cover the unit when not in use, a nice touch.</li>
            <li>husband liked mine and purchased one for himself.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m kind of jealous and think I may buy one for myself.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely on counter.</li>
            <li>She likes having the ability to decorate the flosser &amp; make it her own.  </li>
            <li>Works great - perfect for smaller mouths.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice size.</li>
            <li>This was like something from candid camera.</li>
            <li>Nice size</li>
            <li>so its nice that it fits well there.  </li>
            <li>My son liked that he could put stickers on it to make it his own.</li>
            <li>just the color is kind of for boy</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Works nice either way.  </li>
            <li>: you put the reservoir on top of the body and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>He is 7 and can use it on his own.</li>
            <li>Also a cover for the water reservoir would be nice as well.</li>
            <li>The water pressure is fully adjustable, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Thanks to a reviewer who pointed out this waterpik for &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34;, its perfect for adults as well.</li>
            <li>Really keeps my children&#x27;s teeth and braces looking great!</li>
            <li>This is so handy and a def.</li>
            <li>Nice not</li>
            <li>great price, great product, fast ship</li>
            <li>My Granddaughter asked for this for Christmas and was thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>My kids (8 and 5) need help filling the tank, but can otherwise waterpik their own teeth with this.  </li>
            <li>My daughter said she would need to rebrush his teeth because he would never do a good job (even with an electric/battery toothbrush) since getting the waterpik he spends more time using it than he did just flossing and brushing...</li>
            <li>Nice and compact.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses it to clean her braces and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Great for adults, too :) I just avoided putting the stickers on it, and it looks perfectly fine and not too kiddish</li>
            <li>Kids new best friend.</li>
            <li>Loved that she could personalize,and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fairly compact, so it&#x27;s easy to store out of sight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is very strong, I use this on ~2.5 out of 3 power setting.</li>
            <li>Very strong water jet.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to separate the water storage from the body, making it prone to spills.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and he is looking forward to using it at nighttime before he goes to bed.</li>
            <li>Very easy for a kid to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy for kids to use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and handle.</li>
            <li>The three water pressures and size of the water container are just perfect for an adult!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
            <li>great for braces, keeps teeth clean ad gums healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more a fordable than one for adults and works great, it has a lot of power, I use power 2 for me, easy to use and easy to clean, love it!!</li>
            <li>My kid loves it and it is also suitable for adults.</li>
            <li>My 9year old just got braces and this is the best!</li>
            <li>I bought the waterpik for my 6 year old daughter under the dentist´s recomendation and tried it myself to see how it works, it´s a great option for flossing!</li>
            <li>not as many \\&quot;girl\\&quot; ones as I would have liked though.</li>
            <li>Our daughter has a heart condition so good oral hygiene is important for her.  </li>
            <li>perfect for my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I also oil-pull (and until this, flossed) in addition to brushing but found the Waterpik to be more effective than flossing.  </li>
            <li>kiddo liked it, be better if you could snap and store picks inside cover/tank.</li>
            <li>Anytime you can have fun cleaning your teeth is a great tool.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the counter works just like an adult size</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult and the kids waterpik works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>I use as an adult, works great!</li>
            <li>However, upon receiving this product I set it up for my 9 year old son to try it out, and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>they think it&#x27;s fun to use and the product works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult, but find the settings and the size of this water flosser to be perfect for me.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my bathroom counter as I didn&#x27;t want a bulky thing on it from the adult version.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my 7 year old who just got braces.</li>
            <li>My kids can use this on their own (6 &amp; 8)</li>
            <li>It is really easy for her to use!  </li>
            <li>This thing is awesome, it&#x27;s nice and compact and holds enough water to rinse out my teeth quite well.</li>
            <li>After using it for several weeks, I can honestly report that it is perfect!</li>
            <li>The pulsating jet of water on the gums brings more blood to the guns, and therefore more oxygen, and is effective in helping to treat periodontic disease.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to used and my son enjoy flossing now!</li>
            <li>Nice clean feeling!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the color, but the size is great - holds a nice amount of water and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li>Pretty durable and a great price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>AS GOOD AS MY FULL SIZE.  </li>
            <li>Using warm water, it&#x27;s a comfortable and easy tool!</li>
            <li>compact, very easy to keep clean, good range of pressure - great for my 7 yr old and myself!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, easy to clean and according to the Ortho and Dentist, he is doing a great job.  </li>
            <li>very easy to use and good for first user.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference since I started using it (and I notice when I don&#x27;t!).</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase and would use this seller and product again.</li>
            <li>They love it</li>
            <li>Kids love to floss</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I just wished it had a top for it...</li>
            <li>he&#x27;ll use it even more as he ages and gets more used to the power.</li>
            <li>I use it myself, and it works a lot better than flossing.</li>
            <li>(so once you turn the power on you need to be sure the tip is in your mouth).&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT DOES NOT HAVE A TOP.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>not come with a top for water reservoir.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made not cheapy just cause its cute...</li>
            <li>we love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very much pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do 2 fills top and bottom</li>
            <li>The product is good and economical.</li>
            <li>To show your kids the impact of cleaning it has, be sure to have them use it after they eat popcorn and watch all the stuff that falls into the sink.</li>
            <li>My kids (ages 8 &amp; 10) love this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great an MUCH quieter...</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve gone through many additional full-sized ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The highest setting for the jet stream is more than I need.  </li>
            <li>Wish it had holders for more than one kid in the family.</li>
            <li>(more if he could take it to school).&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li>Anything can fall in the top of it.</li>
            <li>Great product, works very well.  </li>
            <li>oh, that&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>Pleased with service and product.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got the kids model.</li>
            <li>I love the color and the stickers are optional.</li>
            <li>and I was sure it would be another thing she wouldn&#x27;t touch</li>
            <li>What more could one ask for?</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love it and Amazon.</li>
            <li>They love it.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this appliance.</li>
            <li>But the kids love it</li>
            <li>Most likely the best unit I have ever owned</li>
            <li>love this water pic</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>My kids love this.</li>
            <li>I tried it out and absolutely love it as well.</li>
            <li>so I paid more than what it is on AMAZON.</li>
            <li>My kids love this water flosser.  </li>
            <li>works great for adults too, why pay double when the kids version works just as good</li>
            <li>Love this water flosser...</li>
            <li>My kids love this flosser.  </li>
            <li>I would think it would be more sanitary to have a top.  </li>
            <li>They love it</li>
            <li>and I love it knowing they are flossing.</li>
            <li>cleared junk out of my teeth/braces better than my waterpik.</li>
            <li>Our daughter is much better about doing her teeth now that she has her waterpik</li>
            <li>Also, I like the color better.</li>
            <li>It does appear to be better made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She is able to use the Waterpik herself now after we went over how to use it correctly for some time.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure, and by then she can decide what&#x27;s better for her, I will not get into the discussion about flossing vs. Waterpik,.</li>
            <li>Perfect low-tech device for dislodging stuck food from my back molars without jamming it up under my gums.  </li>
            <li>The stickers were cute, and they&#x27;re removable, coming in both girl and boy designs.  </li>
            <li>one warning though, be sure to start at the lowest setting and work up.</li>
            <li>Both kids love using it</li>
            <li>The kids love this</li>
            <li>and that is much more tolerable).</li>
            <li>and they enjoy it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to remind them to use it which means these things are working out better than I could have imagined.</li>
            <li>my lower  teeth left, I needed save them the best I could.</li>
            <li>My kids love this.  </li>
            <li>I so am glad that I ordered this product to help him have a healthy dental report. :)</li>
            <li>Kids love it.</li>
            <li>i have had 3 different types of water flossers over the many years i have used them and this has turned out the best.</li>
            <li>the waterpik brand remains one of the most reliable for durability.</li>
            <li>They love it......</li>
            <li>The counter top plug ins are a much better choice IMO.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I don&#x27;t think there is better out there</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS ONE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably better to incrementally increase the water strength before turning it on rather than after.</li>
            <li>I purchased this flosser to encourage my two boys to floss better since they both now have braces.  </li>
            <li>Their dentist and orthodontist have both remarked how much better their gums are since using this.  </li>
            <li>Am glad that the color is unisex for that reason.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>Has a potent water flow,</li>
            <li>I wish it had an on/off on the handle, but otherwise I love this.</li>
            <li>I love the compact size.</li>
            <li>My kids love it.  </li>
            <li>You are better off investing in the waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I got it</li>
            <li>The kids are getting more flossing done.</li>
            <li>I have two with braces and they love their waterpiks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought the kid&#x27;s version--</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>I feel like better brands make better products.</li>
            <li>and I love this product because it works.</li>
            <li>They love it, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I would be great if it had a shut off switch on the handle, but it still works really well.</li>
            <li>That one lasted for more than twenty years, but then the hoses began to split.</li>
            <li>bet the kids are going to love it too.</li>
            <li>one 100x more</li>
            <li>but when they&#x27;re installed soon, I believe this will work so much better than trying to thread dental floss through the wires.</li>
            <li>I love this compact unit; it travels with me when I am in this country.</li>
            <li>but glad we did.</li>
            <li>stickers are cute and are removable.  </li>
            <li>But this thing has many issues.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>But, you do not need to buy them when this one is a great quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I love *</li>
            <li>This works much better than trying to get him to floss.  </li>
            <li>I also love the compact form factor in my bathroom and the water pressure it has.</li>
            <li>compact size is excellent for limited counter space and is very easy to store.  </li>
            <li>He is twelve and has been good about brushing, but I found this online and the price was right.</li>
            <li>and so I was very excited to see this one.  </li>
            <li>It can be very powerful!</li>
            <li>They were both so excited to use it, that I bought another, so they each have their own.</li>
            <li>My dentist was very pleased with my results when I went in for my cleaning and said it is definitely helping keep my gums in great condition.</li>
            <li>leaves a nice clean feeling too..</li>
            <li>The water pressure is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses this, but mom and dad are now in the market for their own!</li>
            <li>I live in China, so I was so happy to find this dual-voltage model.</li>
            <li>We like that it is easy to use without too many settings or accessories.  </li>
            <li>I like this much better and easy to use</li>
            <li>Its easy to add water if you need more.  </li>
            <li>My dentist quickly saw an improvement in my gums, and food quit catching between my teeth when my gums healed.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and did a better job on my teeth then</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much better price and sits perfectly on pedestal sinks.</li>
            <li>so more power is available if you need more.  </li>
            <li>Because I have braces, using this is very convenient and it&#x27;s much cheaper than the adults&#x27; one.&lt;br /&gt;Efficient and great!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li>This Waterpik is the perfect size for a single person.  </li>
            <li>Great size for my 7 year old Granddaughter!</li>
            <li>the hygienist said she was amazed at how clean my teeth were!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it would work just fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and encourages the kids to clean their teeth better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Construction looks sturdy and it&#x27;s very easy to clean, and the \\&quot;customization\\&quot; with stickers is a nice touch, right away</li>
            <li>and I am sure it will make a huge difference in my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>that allows the user to turn the stream of water on and off, or pause it really, to be more accurate.  </li>
            <li>This kid-size waterpik is great for kids and also mature travelers.  </li>
            <li>Read the great reviews about this water pik and so far she loves it and uses it.</li>
            <li>Worked great for about 3-4 months and then completely died.</li>
            <li>They brush and waterfloss on their own now and love showing off their much cleaner teeth!  </li>
            <li>And for under $30.00 it was a fantastic deal ....... :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important all the time, but discolored teeth can occur if you don&#x27;t stay on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I use this as an adult, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Cheaper than the adult, but works just as great.</li>
            <li>works great as far as i can tell.</li>
            <li>works great for my 11 year old daughter with her braces.</li>
            <li>I use an adult version of the product and have great dental visits.  </li>
            <li>esp considering how much you save price wise.</li>
            <li>and she loved it came with removable stickers she can switch out whenever she wants.  </li>
            <li>It is compact so it does not take up a lot of space and is still powerful and gets the teeth very clean!</li>
            <li>resevoir is the perfect size, and it&#x27;s super easy for her to fill and use by herself, and the pressure settings are simple to adjust.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 5 year old and he absolutely love this!!  </li>
            <li>There are three power settings available, I use the second  most powerful setting which is just perfect for</li>
            <li>its a smaller device, which fit perfect in my bathroom sink and the best perk (for me) is the green color match with my bathroom decorations...  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it is the perfect tool for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>The pressure is super strong!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and has plenty of power.  </li>
            <li>It also packs away easily to store.</li>
            <li>The lowest setting is very mild and the highest setting is so strong</li>
            <li>Not an easy task for a kid.</li>
            <li>It is more compact and cheaper and from what I read just as good as the adult version.</li>
            <li>Easy peasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and they can do it all by themselves.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size for her to use with her braces to make sure there aren&#x27;t any food particles trapped between her teeth and the hardware.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik Waterflosser is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to set and use with easy instructions to follow.</li>
            <li>Also, I was happy that the picks from the my old one fit this one</li>
            <li>Easy to use and store.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have easily given it five stars.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and set up too.</li>
            <li>the water container is easy to lift and fill.</li>
            <li>the switches for on/off and power are all easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>to use, easy water holder connection, easy to turn on, set speed etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is still easy to use.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a cover, but no cover just means flipping over the top and covering up the unit (to keep the water bin clean).</li>
            <li>Easy and convenient to travel with.  </li>
            <li>I bought this so that my 6th grade daughter could clean her teeth and braces better.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use by children.</li>
            <li>The tip is easily exchanged, so it&#x27;s easy to use it for both kids.  </li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles, just something easy to use and which would do the job.</li>
            <li>with the easy wand button feature.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It is easy for her to use.</li>
            <li>It was so strong I made my gums sore.</li>
            <li>Water pressure is a bit strong for tonsil and &amp;#34;back of throat&amp;#34; cleansing.  </li>
            <li>so you may choose how strong you would like the water</li>
            <li>It does a good job, but he complains the water pressure is too high and hurts his teeth even at the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter was coming to visit just after having braces applied, so we wanted to be certain she coud take good care to clean around them.  </li>
            <li>using the Waterpik I like to use about 1/4 hydrogen peroxide (you could also use a mouthwash if you want, just check that it doesn&#x27;t have bleach or iodine) and fill the rest with warm to hot tap water.</li>
            <li>Like better than full size model.  </li>
            <li>In doing my research I realized that I did not need the full size Water Pik because I don&#x27;t have that many teeth that requires a water reservoir for 90 seconds of watering picking.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even do it at first because I was so used to my handy dandy nicer waterpik</li>
            <li>/&gt;Water Pik also offers orthodontic tips to attach to it which also work great for getting the metal of the braces clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this to get my 3 year old more excited about taking care of her teeth, and also to give it a try for myself as I&#x27;ve heard good things about Waterpik vs. dental floss.  </li>
            <li>The machine works well, does it&#x27;s job just fine.</li>
            <li>Just bring in towels for the floor and faces and everyone will be fine.</li>
            <li>The water capacity is fine.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and that its small and compact it&#x27;s perfect for me</li>
            <li>Everything seems fine.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li>This works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Works fine for a child&#x27;s waterpik...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just as good for adults and the small size is great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for adults.</li>
            <li>and I like it just fine.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Worked just fine for about 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>No need to put the decals on…does a good job without taking up much counter space as full size waterpik does.</li>
            <li>Those reviews are what sold me on this purchase and I am super pleased.  </li>
            <li>This looked super cute</li>
            <li>This device was tremendously helpful!</li>
            <li>And, if you really do, well then, you just add more water!  </li>
            <li>but it is easy to use and a great addition to your daily brushing routine.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>This little baby is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Works fine, but not as good as my old water pik.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and kid friendly buttons.  </li>
            <li>If you have huge hands (or a huge mouth?)</li>
            <li>I even traveled with it for 2 weeks and it fit into my carryon tote with no problem.  </li>
            <li>I have the regular version and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Our 5 kids ranging from 3-14 use this every night and enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Shame products are so cheap nowadays.</li>
            <li>For the money I think this product is made rather cheap.  </li>
            <li>This Waterpik works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>This Waterpik Waterflosser makes it fun for my grand children to brush and floss their teeth.  </li>
            <li>Relatively compact and works great for adults, and the stickers are optional.</li>
            <li>Cleans fantastic.  </li>
            <li>They sent us a replacement spigot for free.</li>
            <li>My kids use it and my wife liked it so much she bought another one for herself.</li>
            <li>For a kid that doesn&#x27;t like brushing his teeth, he sure does have fun with this water flosser.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re 11 and 9 and this is what they&#x27;ve told me; LIKES-easy to switch picks, easy to fill and clean, it feels like it&#x27;s cleaning and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it and they use it without being constantly reminded about flossing.</li>
            <li>They did enjoy putting stickers on it and declaring whose flosser stays in the caddy and which one stays connected.</li>
            <li>This works great and is much smaller.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the Sturdy Storage with Replacement Tips and everyone in the family can enjoy using it now.</li>
            <li>so dust gets in the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, oral health is extremely important to me.</li>
            <li>However Amazon is great at returns and I&#x27;m getting my money back.</li>
            <li>But all in all its worth the money, the kids will love it.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews and determined it was worth the chance that the &#x27;kid&#x27; version of Waterpik would work for me</li>
            <li>I think both are great for their individual needs.</li>
            <li>and I was worried about the waterpik being more of a toy than useful.  </li>
            <li>We added the water and a capful of his favorite mouthwash to give his breath and gums that minty fresh, feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After quite a few practice sessions to figure out the best way to use this</li>
            <li>Cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>So, a great addition to future models will be that.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s colorful and cute.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>The top needs a lid.very colorful.</li>
            <li>the machine does feel a bit cheap, but they have a warranty and it does work well.</li>
            <li>word, however: do what you must to prevent your child from using the most powerful setting.</li>
            <li>I contacted Waterpik and they replaced item for free.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It has encouraged a healthy smile.  </li>
            <li>The only real difference is the size of the reservoir, but filling it twice works perfectly well.</li>
            <li>it works good even for adult</li>
            <li>Fantastic Powerful unit would buy another one fore sure .</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Not thrilled or impressed but way better than the con air brand u got myself and husband</li>
            <li>: Fairly compact; no lid on reservoir; pressure settings are adequate for normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>I just used this thing, and full blast is REALLY full blast!  </li>
            <li>I am also better about cleaning my teeth right before bed.</li>
            <li>Her swollen gums quickly went down after using w/ warm water for two weeks!!!</li>
            <li>Love, this is good for an older person or when you don&#x27;t have much counter space.</li>
            <li>I ordered this hoping it was as good as the adult one, and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>She absolutely LOVES it!!!  </li>
            <li>daughter reports she had her first successful check up AND that her new hobby is Dental Hygiene!  </li>
            <li>The rep. said not to be fooled by the \\&quot;kids\\&quot; aspect of the model since it is still very powerful</li>
            <li>(it runs out at my high pressure setting and the methodical pausing between each tooth) and it lacks one very good feature of my old one, and that was the ability to turn the nozzle in the holder as I was using it in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>So easy and portable that I&#x27;m using it every day vs. the old water pik that mostly gathered dust !</li>
            <li>Made a huge difference in keeping his mouth clean</li>
            <li>The ease of use as well as the stickers that she can put on to personalize it make her actually enjoy using it and keeping her braces clean.  </li>
            <li>It is super easy for kids to use.</li>
            <li>When they&#x27;re older, do you think they&#x27;re going to keep on flossing on their own?</li>
            <li>mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quick and easy to set up.</li>
            <li>While it works great to remove large items and its even good enough for adults (trust me, the highest setting on this thing is the highest anyone would really want to go), i found on each occassion, if i flossed afterwards, there was still residue that the floss got that the pik did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is smaller, which is great for limited counter space, and the power/size is great for her.</li>
            <li>With this little adjustment, this would be the absolutely best product, as it has helped my daughter&#x27;s dental hygiene tremendously.</li>
            <li>enjoyed decorating the unit, and is thrilled to have her own little &amp;#34;dentist toy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The stickers are a really fun bonus!</li>
            <li>It is very challenging to get a three year old to brush her teeth twice a day.</li>
            <li>But that is fun for her!</li>
            <li>but this thing is fun to use, I wish this counted as brushing too!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this Waterpik for myself because of its size and color (my favorite!), and because many reviewers wrote that it works equally as well for adults as children.</li>
            <li>I am not deleting what I originally wrote but I am adding an update.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:  </li>
            <li>We love the compact size and it works very well!</li>
            <li>Child friendly.  </li>
            <li>He was excited he doesnt like to floss he loves it</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally looking at the Ultra + Travel combo package (priced at just under $100), but decided to buy the Aquarius and this &amp;#34;Kids&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better deal b/c it ends up being cheaper, and you get to upgrade to the smaller (and more visually appealing) Aquarius.  </li>
            <li>We bought this originally for my daughter who had the pleasure of wearing a palatal expander.  </li>
            <li>the size is perfect for a small footprint.</li>
            <li>This one was significantly cheaper</li>
            <li>: When first using the water pik, make sure to have a towel laying around.</li>
            <li>I still miss the original Waterpik by Teledyne (pictured), which lasted a couple decades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>at first i was not for sure.</li>
            <li>but this one its kid friendly.</li>
            <li>I already had the original waterflosser (ultra?</li>
            <li>My first try was hilarious.  </li>
            <li>With our small bathroom this size water flosser is perfect.  </li>
            <li>With a fine stream, it feels better on the gums and not as much water ends up flowing out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>honestly think this is the exact same model as the Traveler Water Flosser, which is priced at almost $100 more!  </li>
            <li>My son was not getting his teeth as clean as his dentist and orthodontist would like after getting braces.  </li>
            <li>so we purchased this to help her keep her mouth/teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>She likes to use it and said it makes her teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>After each use we run vinegar through it to clean it out.</li>
            <li>My dentist gives me a clean bill of health, as well.</li>
            <li>He was about to get braces and she told me that it&#x27;s imperative to keep your teeth and gums clean during orthodontic treatment.</li>
            <li>He loves it and it keeps it clean.</li>
            <li>Their teeth have never been so clean.  </li>
            <li>Bought it when my son got his braces to help clean his teeth.  </li>
            <li>BUT IF IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ONE I HAD  POW TO CLEAN</li>
            <li>IT HAS NOW IM 60 AND LIKE A CLEAN MOUTH  </li>
            <li>My husband broke his jaw and had to get wired, doctor said to get a water pik to help keep his teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Every time she goes to the orthodontist they tell her how clean her teeth are.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this unit to help clean in and around her palate expander.</li>
            <li>One of the orthodontic tips offers a brush at the top of it to help to make sure plaque removal is a breeze!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We got this to help the kids keep their braces clean.  </li>
            <li>Even though they label it for &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34;  it is great for anyone with limited space.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty loud but otherwise the quality and size is perfect for a 12 year old.</li>
            <li>I originally had a full sized water pik</li>
            <li>Water makes everything more fun, right?</li>
            <li>However, I find that sometimes it is too easy to toggle the nozzle release since it is right under your thumb while you are using the machine.</li>
            <li>It has 3 speeds, speed 3 is too strong for me; 2 is just right.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why the other one even takes that much counter-space, but this one is the perfect size, and it works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It is just the right size!</li>
            <li>This is such an efficient way to clean around all of that hardware in conjunction with good brushing techniques.</li>
            <li>This items worked great for my 5 &amp; 7 yr old daughters to floss their teeth without fear of the normal tape floss.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference.perfect size and fun color</li>
            <li>We had bought a full size waterpik waterflosser for Mom and Dad and the kids wanted one as well.</li>
            <li>My 5 years old kid can use this water flosser on his own.</li>
            <li>I found that to be true.</li>
            <li>I love mine so much that I purchased another</li>
            <li>I love mine so much that I purchased another</li>
            <li>the stickers are really a clingfilm so you can change them, the butterfly, dragonfly and turtle are cute,</li>
            <li>There are 3 different setting for water pressure and he said the lower one would be good for babies.</li>
            <li>Everything the reviews say are true.</li>
            <li>not only good for kinds but fits adults well, too.</li>
            <li>but I bought this product thinking it will be a good help to my son&#x27;s teeth daily cleaning</li>
            <li>it gets used more than any string thing, works well and seems to do the job and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space...</li>
            <li>Works very well, abouth to order one more.</li>
            <li>Because even though my gums are in good health I have had problems with chunks of food getting pressed under the gum line on my uppermost back teeth.</li>
            <li>The spray was more gentle for him.</li>
            <li>Our kids use the second one with good results.  </li>
            <li>So, after going to the dentist the next day for his teeth cleaning, the report was \\&quot;His teeth and gums look good and keep doing what you are</li>
            <li>Even if you are being very thorough, you will have more than sufficient water for 1 person.</li>
            <li>There are instructions that come with the unit that teach you how to start using this as you can&#x27;t just start off using this full blast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really bother me, just sayin&#x27; :)</li>
            <li>This is the least costly and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>Dentist recommended and I really find it works for me much better than floss.</li>
            <li>But this thing really does help him get out the food that gets stuck between the retainer and the top of his mouth.</li>
            <li>Device is easy to use for children and does an excellent job on cleaning their teeth, behind teeth and in between their teeth.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and exactly as designed.</li>
            <li>Works great and has just enough capacity to clean my whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>I originally thought that the lack of a lid on the tub part of the flosser wouldn&#x27;t be great, but you can store it upside down and snap it onto the bottom part of the flosser</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more compact than some of the markets, plus the bright color and the stickers</li>
            <li>It is really great - the size is so manageable and it works just as well as the other Waterpik flossers I have had over the years (3).</li>
            <li>I admit that I bought this particular waterflosser because of the cool lime green color, but it not only looks good, it is perfect for my needs.  </li>
            <li>it makes it fun not a chore to clean my daughters braces..</li>
            <li>It makes it fun to clean his mouth.</li>
            <li>Best price around, local stores like Walmart wanted $50 for this same item and wouldn&#x27;t price match amazon.</li>
            <li>More than enough for most adults&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough for her to operate, and really does a good job at getting her teeth</li>
            <li>Great investment, good quality and not too expensive.  </li>
            <li>This kids model is much cheaper than similar travel version and works great for me on the road.</li>
            <li>my daughter felt it was her own toy to play with, a fun way to get your kids into taking care of their mouth from an early age.</li>
            <li>After 2 tries he was able to use on his own.</li>
            <li>A very strong jet of water is produced, possibly strong enough to be painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This unit is very strong, a far cry from the battery powered models.</li>
            <li>We have had a couple orthodontist visits for tightening and one normal dentist visit after buying the Waterpik and both commented his gums line and between teeth are much better.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of using this, they returned to normal healthy gums.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty thorough flosser, so I filled the tank 2 times for one flossing session.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought this item and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>No big deal, very cute</li>
            <li>I loved the small footprint of this unit, much better than the full sized Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>Our Waterpik is certainly too strong for her and too \\&quot;adult\\&quot; for her looks, so we decided to purchase this kids model</li>
            <li>She has been loving this waterpik and using it several times a day, as she find this to be an easier way to keep her braces clean than all the accessories provided by the orthodontist.  </li>
            <li>The intensity setting seems very high though, but it is easily adjusted.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even been able to use the high setting because it&#x27;s so powerful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily, my kids, 9 and 11, don&#x27;t seem to mind that the new device doesn&#x27;t come with stickers or that the new device has more settings, more features, comes with a lid for the tank, etc...</li>
            <li>The Kids versions it great for adults and half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter really needs this, and it&#x27;s so easy to tell which one is hers.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very kid-friendly and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, kid sized, she can do it by herself (which makes my life easier), and her oral hygiene is much improved.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to do the job effectively, easy to operate and maintainance free.  </li>
            <li>The water stream is strong, but not as fine as the old water pik.  </li>
            <li>They also seem to enjoy using it, so that&#x27;s another positive thing to say about the product.  </li>
            <li>In this case, simple really is better!</li>
            <li>Works great, doesn&#x27;t make a mess if you keep over the sink -</li>
            <li>They both are much more willing to floss as this is fun and much easier than flossing with thread.</li>
            <li>A younger child wouldn&#x27;t be able to control it as easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, fun, and gentle.  </li>
            <li>She needed something effective that was easy to use and that took minimal counter space in her apartment bathroom.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She just loves it, she is always looking forward to her pre-bed routine of using her Waterpik, and she started doing a great job with it after the second or third use, my fear of water mess and pieces of chewed food stuck to the mirror or counter were unfounded, this model is very easy to use and gentle on the gums, while it gives my daughter the cleaning she needs much more easier and effective than with</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the adult version, but this one works fine for me!</li>
            <li>I have no use for the orthodontic tip, but regular tip works fine for me, and the pressure is just as strong as the pricey deluxe adult models.  </li>
            <li>I spotted the KID model with 60 second reservoir which was perfect and smaller size works great in my small bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>The stickers and color make my daughter interested in using this to clean her orthodontic appliances.</li>
            <li>If you plan to let your kids operate the device on their own, be sure to give them explicit instructions on not making a mess, not bumping the tank, cleaning up afterwards, etc...</li>
            <li>Great little water flosser for my granddaughter who will be getting braces.  </li>
            <li>This little flosser works great.</li>
            <li>the stickers are the plastic kind (with no glue on them at all) that you can put on and remove easily - give them to your kids to put on their other toys or put them on a mirror -</li>
            <li>I wanted a light stream and even the lower setting on this is too much for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is unlike the huge adult version that won&#x27;t fit on my dinky sink vanity.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It also came with an orthodontic tip and colorful stickers.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>My water pic was to powerful, but this one has a power adjustment for her to use.  </li>
            <li>The water coming out is way to powerful.  </li>
            <li>The only additional feature that I would of liked on this model is the pause button so he can pause the spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely plenty to get the job done and the set-up is nice and compact</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless of the sprayed walls and mirrors, if this will help maintain my daughter&#x27;s dental health, it&#x27;s all worth it.</li>
            <li>We had much fun with water spraying everywhere while trying to learn to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Update-</li>
            <li>My seven year old sneaks away to use it :)</li>
            <li>It is just like I remember, cleans between teeth &amp; braces, plus, it&#x27;s fun</li>
            <li>and I appreciate it far more than flossing itself.  </li>
            <li>I have used water pics for over 20 years and have found them extremely effective not only in cleaning the teeth and any pockets in the gums but also in massaging the guns with it&#x27;s pulsating  jet of water.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure the adult one doesn&#x27;t do anything that this one doesn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li>Powerful water flow which you can adjust for strength.</li>
            <li>So make sure you have it on a level surface &amp; near the sink in case it falls.</li>
            <li>Works as expected and my 7 year old daughter loved being able to the included stickers.</li>
            <li>She, also, says it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>but it makes me smile.</li>
            <li>My kids (4 and 7) have fun using it.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>IT UP AND FLOSS AWAY TO  FRESH BREATH  </li>
            <li>A POWERFUL WATER GUN  DONT POINT IT AT EYES</li>
            <li>While okay for a battery powered device, the Panasonic has nowhere near the power of one that works on the mains.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik for kids is powerful, compact, and works on both 220 and 110 volts.</li>
            <li>When she gives a garbled thumbs up - I turn it off and we place to pik towards the drain and turn it back on to drain the tubing effectively.  </li>
            <li>It have helped my gums and periodontal disease and is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>it is a nice product, very compact, has everything we needed for an adult to use.</li>
            <li>Its also fun to use</li>
            <li>Powerful, and too powerful if you use highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is POWERFUL.</li>
            <li>t holds a decent amount of water and s easy to fill and use.</li>
            <li>it is worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>Great cheaper and smaller alternative compared to the adult waterpik.</li>
            <li>Still absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>Ok, so i thought that this thing would be better than flossing like the advertisements describe, but not really.</li>
            <li>No matter what you do, water will inevitably end up on your mirror if you&#x27;re trying to do your kids teeth and even your own (you have to manual</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for a full size unit that died after several years but we are happy with this one and would not go back to the full size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be nice if Amazon advertised the product and its different tips and features together.  </li>
            <li>It works great, in my opinion the water reservoir is ample, even though it is smaller than the adult size.</li>
            <li>(smile)</li>
            <li>Once the reservoir is turned over, the whole device easily fits in carry-on luggage, yet it&#x27;s practically as large as the full size Waterpik once set up.</li>
            <li>Powerful water force, I use it daily for flossing, particularly with my back teeth holding food and bacteria, wonderful instrument.</li>
            <li>Great price and much cheaper than other stores.  </li>
            <li>The packaged arrived quickly, however, after the first use, it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Main reason this would not be a good choice for kids, especially younger ones.</li>
            <li>It works just as good as the other one.</li>
            <li>(I have braces right now.)  </li>
            <li>Water leaks out unless it is emptied right after use.</li>
            <li>He uses it on the lowest setting, but I use it on the highest and it is just right.</li>
            <li>GROWN UPS RIGHT MAKES</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s corded and plugs right into the wall socket</li>
            <li>Reservoir is just the right</li>
            <li>Great unit, better for your teeth than flossing, fun for kids to use so increases compliance, and smaller footprint than the blue adult one.dult one.</li>
            <li>this style for kids has been a huge benefit for me as i have gotton older and need things easier to use for hand grasp and flexibility.</li>
            <li>Really helps her clean her teeth with braces on.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re ready to clean again you just release the button.  </li>
            <li>At first I had to supervise and explain how to use it properly but they have done the rest on their own.</li>
            <li>be put off by the fact that it&#x27;s for kids, the smaller size is perfect for the average bathroom.</li>
            <li>Works great for little kids with braces!</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s very easy to set up, and although it is smaller than I had anticipated, I like that it is so compact and fits well on my sink.</li>
            <li>Close to being more powerful than the large adult water pic.  </li>
            <li>Does an excellent job of promoting dental hygiene for&lt;br /&gt;much less expense than the larger units.</li>
            <li>Regular tips fit it so it is easy to get the parts.  </li>
            <li>It is really easy to use, not too loud, and the stickers are fun.  </li>
            <li>Great compact waterpik for a small bathroom.</li>
            <li>Several reviews said their kids loved it and spent more time cleaning their teeth.  </li>
            <li>Great flossed for a small space.</li>
            <li>As long as you find a way to encourage your child to use this produst, it is an effective tool to rid their braces of residue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit is not quit as strong (water pressure) as the full sized adult unit, but it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s water basin is larger, it has a lid which holds all of the vaioius attachments it came with, and best of all it has a little button on the handheld part,</li>
            <li>This is a good buy, probably the same as an adult version, so buy this as its cheaper, very powerful, SIMPLE, easy to use, for adults or kids.</li>
            <li>Now, for pulsating water shooting fiercely and going everywhere- even when you have it already in the child&#x27;s mouth, it would be a far more logical and convenient design to be able to stop the water by turning it on or off from the actual water projection wand already in hand</li>
            <li>Smart idea to include them, vendor!  </li>
            <li>As far as the reviews that say these break easily, maybe kids are a lot tougher on these things than I am.</li>
            <li>Easy to use...great for my 9 yr old</li>
            <li>I love how it doesn&#x27;t take up as much room as the adult models do.</li>
            <li>is plenty good enough for an adult and will save you some bucks, but just beware the handle is meant for kid hands and</li>
            <li>Definitely not a replacement for good old fashioned flossing.</li>
            <li>Broke super fast.  </li>
            <li>BTW, you can buy an individual carrying case on its own, anyways, if you really want</li>
            <li>It is also good enough for an adult to use.</li>
            <li>overall a great and simple product for the kids with braces.</li>
            <li>(im an adult) level three is way to easy to make the gums bleed etc.</li>
            <li>If you use this daily, you and your dental hygienist/dentist will be amazed at your next appointment how great your gums will be.  </li>
            <li>She found it easy to use- 8 years old</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a waterflosser, and it was easy to use and left my mouth feeling clean and rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>My wife and I use it, and it works just fine for our adult mouths.</li>
            <li>The water basin is a fine size for an adult.</li>
            <li>This is true in most respects, the pressure is just as good and the basin is plenty big enough to hold enough water for one person&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li>My only regret is that the tips don&#x27;t come in different colors so that each member of the family could easily recognize their own.</li>
            <li>I hope it keeps my new implant clean as well.</li>
            <li>It holds more that enough water for me to floss</li>
            <li>Again, the powerful jet is much appreciated by my implants, but the rest is too rickety.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this for me when I couldn&#x27;t find an available adult one for purchase.</li>
            <li>But she is willing to use this waterpik and enjoys using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This water flosser is compact enough for travel and certainly better than the battery operated one I have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dealing with the small capacity reservoir by filling it to the top from a glass when it is mounted on the pump and adding more as I irrigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent for kids with braces who are not able to floss regularly.</li>
            <li>got this for myself as I wanted something more than just standard flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;To cover it on the counter, as I have cats that like to get up and investigate open things, I put a shower cap over the top of the water container and the spray head.</li>
            <li>My husband wants some changeable heads now, not that I can blame him!</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m 70</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>So much better than regular flossing</li>
            <li>- therefore you constantly have to wash it out before each use instead of filling it up and using it more then once.  </li>
            <li>(he really wanted it!).</li>
            <li>DO NOT USE THE HIGHER POWER SETTINGS.....</li>
            <li>I oil-pull first, then brush my teeth, and then use the Waterpik flosser.  </li>
            <li>At first, it took a bit of getting used to operating the handle because I have severe rheumatoid arthritis in my hands</li>
            <li>DISLIKES- have to put the floor in your mouth first</li>
            <li>The first time my son used it, you would not believe the stuff that came out of his braces.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how well it works, especially since she rushes through cleaning her teeth, but something is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>My son uses it daily - his orthodontist are pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I read reviews and bought these for everyone instead of spending a fortune on a larger one.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that most of the time I have to refill the water container</li>
            <li>It is very efficient and when you are finished it gives you a fresh feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the product.</li>
            <li>I have my fingers crossed that the next unit will work well without problems, since my kids will need this for a couple more years.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as needed.</li>
            <li>one an orthodontic tip which is exactly what we needed it for.</li>
            <li>Very impressed with small size which delivers big power.  </li>
            <li>I bought this waterpik for me .It is my first .</li>
            <li>It has 3 strength settings and the first time I used it I put it on highest setting because I thought if it is for kids</li>
            <li>I only wish there was a lid on the top of the tank.</li>
            <li>The first time she used it, she said there was a noticable difference, and she now uses the waterflosser twice a day without even being asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it said it does.</li>
            <li>So much better than regular flossing.  </li>
            <li>and we have more than enough for two people.</li>
            <li>She uses it faithfully and it really works to get food out!</li>
            <li>Would recommend this pic to anyone using for the first time.</li>
            <li>They were so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s time for a replacement, so I&#x27;m glad I had bought a back-up of the same model.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a Waterpik</li>
            <li>I had to order more attachments because the inside of the one turned completely white.</li>
            <li>too much water pressure does the job!</li>
            <li>And if it isn&#x27;t, you can just simply fill it up some more.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I got my first Waterpik 35 years ago when I had braces.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish it had was a cover for the top where the water goes.  </li>
            <li>Amazon had it at a better price than WalMart at the date of my purchase, and I had 2 extra piks delivered as well since I&#x27;ll be sharing with hubby and one kid.</li>
            <li>My wife and I use it daily and love it.</li>
            <li>I first thought the button on the front of the handle was like a stop/start feature; it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li>Which is actually exactly what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>Seems to get the hardest spots pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Cute on the outside, junk on the inside.</li>
            <li>thought the smaller one would work for me and it is ok.  </li>
            <li>The larger the hole the more water comes out.</li>
            <li>There are several piks that cost more.</li>
            <li>My daughter has retainers crooked teeth and has a bi lateral cleft lip way better to use than the bristle brushes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect, small enough that you can take it with you when you travel.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll be trying to take good care of it, since our son will be going through braces in a few years himself.  </li>
            <li>but once I messed around with it and became familiar with holding it in different ways, it has turned out to be a great little device.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was very excited about actually getting my kids to floss with a water-flosser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:  I was able to install my old holder with the rotating tip using my remaining new tubing.  </li>
            <li>Great water pressure, holds plenty of water, and takes up less space then the adult Waterpik.</li>
            <li>she cannot really tell the difference, but I spotted this flaw right away.</li>
            <li>You can turn it over but it is so much easier to just keep it right side up.</li>
            <li>Can be used with different voltages and not only for kids very suitable.</li>
            <li>Anyway this little Waterpik is just fine - it has 3 settings and it works great just like the bigger adult one and it cost less and looks good on the counter.</li>
            <li>Its kind of loud and may scare younger ones at first, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>(I see the link to other products, but products need to be compatible; would be nice if somehow you could tell if they are all compatible.)</li>
            <li>strong power and has same effect as the large size home style.&lt;br /&gt;Not just for kids!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the pressure would be strong enough but level 3 is definitely more than enough.</li>
            <li>It makes flossing fun, and is particularly helpful when things get stuck in all the mouth gear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kids styled and cute, also amazing after they have brushed their teeth to see all that&#x27;s left behind that the flosser gets out of their teeth after they thought they had done a good job of brushing.</li>
            <li>I needed to replace my Waterpik and decided to try this one because it is smaller and doesn&#x27;t take up as much space on the counter top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never used a waterpik before, and wasn&#x27;t convinced they were effective enough to invest in an adult version.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of the waterpik now as it makes my teeth feel super clean, moreso than just brushing, flossing, &amp; using mouth wash.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and just seems really junky compared to the nicer big ones with lids, also I worry about more germs getting into the basin since it doesn&#x27;t have a lid.</li>
            <li>She is able to turn the product on and off herself and enjoys it so much that she asks to use it multiple times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus it has really helped in getting her teeth and gums clean- better than she did flossing conventionally.  </li>
            <li>Finally getting him to clean his teeth!</li>
            <li>Where it differs is that it only has two tips, one regular and one orthodontic (which may be fine for most people any way), it doesn&#x27;t have a lid on the basin, and it doesn&#x27;t have a button on the handle to stop and start the water flow</li>
            <li>This unit is perfect for a small bathroom, or for those with limited storage space.  </li>
            <li>The other setting are good for an adult.</li>
            <li>Way too powerful on normal setting.</li>
            <li>Or put them on and tell the world to f-off because you&#x27;re an adult and if you want to put cool stickers on your stuff, you&#x27;ll do just that.</li>
            <li>it might feel small for you, but I still think it&#x27;s a good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As it seems the hose and handle are not replaceable, I will be ordering a new new one soon as we find it indispensable..</li>
            <li>Like a push down jet is on and let go, jet is off kind of thing.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I think the stickers encouraged her to accept this new gadget as something fun to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy enough to get used to.</li>
            <li>reservoir does come off and is easy to move from sink back to unit</li>
            <li>Its size makes it easy to use and store in my tiny bathroom, it is a breeze to travel with, and it has plenty of power.</li>
            <li>Then 2 months after we bought it, we went on vacation for 2 weeks, making sure to leave it dry - without water in it.  </li>
            <li>is simple and easy operation model.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up half my sink and fits nicely in the corner.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The pics are fragile and ware out easily (3 mo).</li>
            <li>In addition, you get all kinds of tips for it pretty much everywhere, which is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I have limited space and yet wanted one of these as I&#x27;m getting up there in years and want to prevent avoidable heart problems, so I took a chance on this, and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>The difference between this model and the full flosser is that it only goes to a strength of three -- more than enough for both my wife and me.</li>
            <li>but rather I will try the adult version - the orthodontist highly recommends this type of machine to clean her braces, as flossing, brushing, etc., just don&#x27;t fully do the trick.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m the only one in the house who uses it, the one pick is fine.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if this product is ideal but it was a waste of money since my child will not use it because it is not user friendly.</li>
            <li>This is definitely not one the kids can use on their own without a HUGE mess.</li>
            <li>This is really a great idea and Waterpik is a leader in this field.&lt;br /&gt;However, sadly this is very cheaply made and lasted only about 7mos before dying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can get a little messy but over all this is a great way to teach him the importance of flossing!</li>
            <li>Then I have to press the reservoir down firmly onto the base--something I never had to do with the perfect older version.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Works for whole family.</li>
            <li>I really wish it was on the jet-device itself.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and we had not problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works really well.</li>
            <li>and this is making her life so much easier and cleaner.</li>
            <li>This one works very well, but I miss the ability to twist the pick as I use it.</li>
            <li>The one that I bought this time is meant for children, but I like to use it when I travel as it is dual voltage and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>It does not take up much space in the suitcase.  </li>
            <li>It delivers water stream as powerful as the adult model does.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>the braces b/c it takes so much time.</li>
            <li>and it was too cumbersome and took up too much counter space for my liking.  </li>
            <li>but once you get to be a pro at using it, you don&#x27;t really need that much water to do the job.  </li>
            <li>and I really notice</li>
            <li>That being said, the controls should really be on the flosser itself.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not taking as much space when you&#x27;re not using it.</li>
            <li>(they are really static-cling decals) might encourage her to use it as often as she should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simply fill the tank with water, adjust the dial, and it&#x27;s all ready for use.</li>
            <li>This unit really did it&#x27;s job for about a year.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Used this twice a day for three weeks, and my gums are much improved.  </li>
            <li>absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Much easier with the Waterpik Water Flosser.</li>
            <li>He had plaque buildup that is now gone and his teeth look much whiter.</li>
            <li>He was comfortable with the 3rd, the stronger setting.</li>
            <li>Expected more from a Waterpik product.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel fantastic after using this and almost feels like you&#x27;ve brushed as well.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, it really takes seconds to set up and then 1 minute to floss.</li>
            <li>Thanks everyone else for your reviews as it caused me to get this one.</li>
            <li>Otherwise could be used as a high powered squirt gun in the bathroom!</li>
            <li>and it was very helpful for cleaning her braces.  </li>
            <li>The waterpik designed for adults has the setting up to 10, that would have been too much for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Waterpik!</li>
            <li>My 7yo daughter absolutely puts up a fight about brushing her teeth and flossing.  </li>
            <li>but it took up too much space.</li>
            <li>Much &amp;#34;messier&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really wanted something with power.</li>
            <li>Works well and doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter-top space.</li>
            <li>she doesn&#x27;t use this as much.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re now marking them as dual-voltage capable.</li>
            <li>ones and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>but she seems to have adjusted to it very well.  </li>
            <li>My kids are 14 and 10, and both really like it.</li>
            <li>I genuinely don&#x27;t understand how this product can be used in a sensible manner- especially by a child!!!</li>
            <li>My wife can handle it on &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; but I use the lowest &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting otherwise there&#x27;s too much gore in the sink.</li>
            <li>my choice was &amp;#34;spray all over the bathroom for a week clean&amp;#34;  or &amp;#34;pointlessly let water gently pour into my</li>
            <li>My husband has a bridge in his mouth and he&#x27;s always amazed how much stuff gets flushed out even after flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li>My son uses the brush part and really likes it, it seems to be helping his teeth too.  </li>
            <li>I do follow up and assist her with flossing her teeth, but it has become much easier now.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast with prime.</li>
            <li>It cleans teeth and gums very well.</li>
            <li>It gets their teeth so much cleaner</li>
            <li>and it has worked very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Waterpik!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My kids teeth are much cleaner.</li>
            <li>My 10-year-old has braces and flossing can be a real challenge.</li>
            <li>This Waterpik is much gentler than the one I used to have.  </li>
            <li>Travels and stores really well</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable as well.</li>
            <li>It cleans his teeth very well</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it and the price was very competitive.</li>
            <li>This machine clears out so much gunk from my child&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>haha....</li>
            <li>My daughter has braces and we have found this to be very helpful.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks for showing me this possibility.</li>
            <li>tank is very small.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was trying to get away with something a bit cheaper for my son, but I really shouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>Mine is SO much easier to use than this kid&#x27;s waterpik!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This was really tricky to get used to.  </li>
            <li>Nice green color.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, they were ready for their own.  </li>
            <li>Actually liked this product but it broke within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to save a few dollars here and there.</li>
            <li>He has become as addicted as I; and his breath is all the more better for it.  </li>
            <li>He has become as addicted as I; and his breath is all the more better for it.  </li>
            <li>Is a bit messy to operate, but it really gets the job done nicely.  </li>
            <li>Works the same as the adult one, it&#x27;s just much more compact.</li>
            <li>Sent it back and got the better Adult Version.</li>
            <li>It holds just enough water for one &amp;#34;lap.&amp;#34; If you have more intricate work to cover, like dental or orthodontic appliances, get the adult version.</li>
            <li>While the water pressure is good - one negative about it is that there isn&#x27;t a lid or cover on it</li>
            <li>I love this as an adult user only.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would be nice is if the on/off switch was actually on the handle.  </li>
            <li>Many waterpiks ago I was able to buy a small one, loved it, but  was unable to find another once it expired.  </li>
            <li>A kids&#x27; machine out to be just simple and user friendly.</li>
            <li>I was wary with the pressure of water going into their mouths because they all gag at the dentist, but they have LOVED this!</li>
            <li>Other than that, we love them.</li>
            <li>But things can get  wet, until my children knew how to use it, they sprayed water all over the place! :)</li>
            <li>I use it more than the other one I have, and I like it</li>
            <li>Very powerful and strong enough for an adult to use with the different settings.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would be small enough to take when traveling, and it&#x27;s going to work great.  </li>
            <li>My granddaughter just had braces put on, she is only nine, and needs all the help she can get keeping her teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>My daughter uses this Waterpik about 5 times per week to clean her orthodontic device - an upper pallete spreader.  </li>
            <li>it was full inside of black junk and no way to clean out the spigot.</li>
            <li>This unit holds enough water to clean for one minute.</li>
            <li>He was having difficulties using the flossers he was given, and I was starting to worry that he&#x27;d give up trying to clean between his braces.</li>
            <li>Just like the big one but small and great for travel.</li>
            <li>Nice little flosser for kids!</li>
            <li>First off, the hose is formed pre-coiled, so that it bounces right back into that coiled up shape</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little loud, but the 2 different attachments work great for my 2 kids, one with braces, one without.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough for an adult to use as well.</li>
            <li>Water Pik his assistant said it might not be strong enough to do the job for an adult.</li>
            <li>And I was pleasanly surprised when I set it up the first time.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s loud, but the kids are the first ones to bed</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re an adult, just throw away the stickers. ;)</li>
            <li>We did not buy this through Amazon, but my family gave this exact unit to my Petite 90 year old Mom.  </li>
            <li>This Kids Waterpik works just the same as the big ones and doesn&#x27;t take up as much space on the counter top.  </li>
            <li>My 8 year old really likes using the Waterpik for kids!  </li>
            <li>then pours it into the water chamber as needed (and this is fun also apparently...</li>
            <li>Not enough reservoir for full mouth cleaning,</li>
            <li>What is cool is that it actually gets used.  </li>
            <li>Nice small profile in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>This definitely takes some learning and assistance, and there&#x27;s lots of spraying all around the bathroom (accidental and intentional), but overall has helped to clean teeth, improve breath, and helps him be more independent in oral care.  </li>
            <li>When my children attempted to use the pik there was more water on the mirror or down their chins than in their mouth.  </li>
            <li>The reservoir is still large enough to clean 2 adult mouths, so capacity isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, doesn&#x27;t take up much room, it&#x27;s just as powerful as the adult version, I like the cute decals</li>
            <li>The water pressure is certainly more than enough - I usually use setting 2, setting 1 for more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be shopping for new tips soon because the rest of my family wants to try it too...</li>
            <li>I bought this for a 15 year old girl with braces, and it works really well to deep clean before or after brushing.  </li>
            <li>She is able to get to areas she previously could not.</li>
            <li>Getting my child to floss has not been easy, and I knew it&#x27;d be even harder when we started orthodontia, so we wanted to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>Love the smaller size, holding enough water to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>My old one was a pain in the butter, because I had to manually try and wrap it up neatly so it would fit back in place, which it never did.  </li>
            <li>The sticker on the main unit says it was made in China.</li>
            <li>Only thing I would recommend for future models of this is to put a lid on top of water tank.  </li>
            <li>But that just goes to show that this model not only has longevity, but is rugged enough to appeal to the men in the crowd as well! :)</li>
            <li>Better to just buy the more expensive one from Waterpik.</li>
            <li>not only good for kids, but for some disabled people.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t let them dissuade you for use with an older child.</li>
            <li>The main problem is that the on/off switch is on the machine-</li>
            <li>At some point as I grew older it fell by the wayside</li>
            <li>Most standard waterpiks would take up the entire counter.  </li>
            <li>The water tank fits over the main case when traveling, and it works with 110V and 220V.</li>
            <li>and it really has some good power behind it.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated: Just as powerful as the adult version coupled with a small footprint made this a great purchase.</li>
            <li>Very loud !  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very loud!  </li>
            <li>It was a great price and small, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try rather than buy the adult version after reading several reviews for this model.  </li>
            <li>I like it and my toddler likes it too though she makes a mess :)</li>
            <li>Small footprint, simple, effective, and fun to use.</li>
            <li>Then I have to press the reservoir down firmly onto the base--something I never had to do with the perfect older version.cannot see to line up the tiny circle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this waterpik for both kids AND adults.</li>
            <li>This one is smaller and more attractive than the others, but the reservoir has no lid on it, and the only way to stop the stream of water is to turn off the unit which is difficult to do when you have the pic in your hand.</li>
            <li>She has high functioning Autism</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this waterpik if your child has braces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone of any age.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll have to check with my father-in-law and see how high the pressure is on his model...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for children with any orthodontic work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for kids.</li>
            <li>This little hummer functions so much better.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a variety of cute little stickers, but I opted to leave it sticker-free.</li>
            <li>and I feel more than a little gaggy trying to get them out of there.</li>
            <li>I love this little Waterpik.</li>
            <li>Compact, very easy to use with little to no mess.  </li>
            <li>But I was surprised at how much water pressure there was.  </li>
            <li>My daughter LOVES it, which has made flossing SOOOO much easier as far as attitudes go.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old daughter used this the whole time she wore braces, it works well.</li>
            <li>He also states that his patients who use a waterpik have consistently healthier teeth, gums and mouth in general than his hard-core</li>
            <li>Nothing is malfunctioning, no leaks and no broken parts, just an extremely loud motor.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 10 year old to help him with his retainers and he readily took to it.</li>
            <li>wow thanks</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s designed for kids, it&#x27;s powerful enough for adults.</li>
            <li>It would just eliminate contamination from normal lint, dust, germs in the air.</li>
            <li>For your average, healthy mouth, even an adult is well-equipped with this.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much &#x27;debris&#x27; comes out of my mouth after brushing first, then following up with this.  </li>
            <li>Liked it for the short time that we had it, but it is inexcusable to last only 6 months...</li>
            <li>kids love it and use it everyday</li>
            <li>Different pressure settings are useful as well for my son who is learning to use a waterpik.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty loud (hence one star off), although I&#x27;ve heard that almost all models of waterpiks are loud anyways.  </li>
            <li>so when using the tip of the flosser has to be in your tightly closed mouth with one hand on the on/off switch ready to turn it off when your mouth is full of water to spit.  </li>
            <li>I normally use floss</li>
            <li>This is so powerful, I can&#x27;t go to the 3rd speed because my gums would probably feel sore.</li>
            <li>I checked on the waterpik website and found out that the pressure is the same as their adult ones, they only offer one model with more pressure.</li>
            <li>Also I like the green color better.  </li>
            <li>Perfectly powerful smaller Pik.  </li>
            <li>It is also powerful enough for me to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely powerful enough to do the job too.</li>
            <li>Bought it for a small bathroom where it does the same good job</li>
            <li>I bought a different one for my daughter and it was way too powerful for her with no adjustment to pressure, so</li>
            <li>This Waterpik is not only fun to decorate but works excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li>The water power is strong enough and you can gradually increase the pressure from low to high as needed</li>
            <li>Also, it costs less! :)</li>
            <li>It works very well for my 9 year old with new braces.</li>
            <li>It makes my newly &amp;#34;brace-d&amp;#34; kids want to brush and floss- total success.</li>
            <li>It is not as powerful, doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long, and does not hold much water.  </li>
            <li>While the item description says that it was designed especially for kids 6 to 12, I think it&#x27;s strong enough for adults to use as well and even though the description also says that it&#x27;s  colourful</li>
            <li>This one is a nice small size and does the job!</li>
            <li>It works fine so far, same water pressure as my old &#x27;adult&#x27; WaterPik.</li>
            <li>Much to my child&#x27;s delight, our first attempt to use it became an impromptu run-through-the-sprinkler-like experience (this actually isn&#x27;t much of a con, just be aware it might take a little getting used to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oil pulling is very effective for dislodging food debris but even after oil-pulling and brushing, I have found the Waterpik still gets out remaining difficult to budge food bits.</li>
            <li>Even with 31 adult teeth, I don&#x27;t need anywhere near the whole reservoir of water, and I doubt children need nearly that much water.</li>
            <li>However, the unit itself loo&lt;br /&gt;ked fine to me, just a smaller version of my standard unit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is just fine, much smaller, and the only downside is refilling the water to finish.  </li>
            <li>Once a month I run a half of a cap full of bleach mixed in with water to help keep it clean.</li>
            <li>Not very kid friendly.</li>
            <li>The Waterflosser for Kids seems to be the same high quality I remember from my first Waterpik.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 11 and loves her new waterpick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s brand new.</li>
            <li>Would like to try a new one but can no longer return or exchange.</li>
            <li>you can live without those features this kid waterpik</li>
            <li>It is a nuisance I will live with since, after reading some reviews here about premature failures, there is a possibility I might be exercising the two-year warranty anyway</li>
            <li>As a bonus, I&#x27;d just missed my window to return my new paper</li>
            <li>THIS IS A NEW VERSION</li>
            <li>but new i need to do somthing becouse</li>
            <li>I have also found that for some reason the children&#x27;s unit generates a more powerful jet of water than any of their other units, including their most expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Bought for 6 year old son who is very resistant to brushing and sensitive to toothpaste tastes.  </li>
            <li>I owned the adult sized classic version before this</li>
            <li>Smaller version of adult size(better price) and just as powerful.</li>
            <li>Adults may have to reload the water supply 2x, but it is the same powerful unit as the adult versions.....</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that it does not hold that much water</li>
            <li>then I might need the high setting for my adult teeth.</li>
            <li>She has appliances from the orthodontist and was having trouble keeping them clean!</li>
            <li>It clearly says right on the charger 110V/60HZ only.  </li>
            <li>My 9 year old daughter is starting ortho treatment and has an expander right now.</li>
            <li>The tank seems a bit smaller than the adult units but seems just right for us.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and small enough it does not take up too much space.</li>
            <li>Being a teenager, he was a little leery of using a &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; waterpik, but found that using both tips very helpful in keeping his braces clean.  </li>
            <li>My dentist suggested that I get a Waterpik ..and told me to get the most basic model, no bells or whistles as they only added to the cost and weren&#x27;t really necessary.  </li>
            <li>First setting is enough for them.</li>
            <li>Product is pretty low quality and water drips out everywhere.  </li>
            <li>My other Waterpik didn&#x27;t last more then 6 months so hoping this does.</li>
            <li>It piks the same as the other Waterpiks.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t get as many accessories which you don&#x27;t use but cost extra.&lt;br</li>
            <li>sadly it is no longer with me as my former roommate claimed custody of it when he moved out</li>
            <li>My only wish is that the water holder had a lid to keep out dust, other than that I am pleased.</li>
            <li>First there is no way to control the amount of water that comes to your mouth you only have three speeds for pressure but not a way to on and off as needed.</li>
            <li>We just didn&#x27;t put on the stickers it comes with and voila - adult waterpik!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need the larger one taking up precious space in the bathroom, and I don&#x27;t need all the other attachments.</li>
            <li>The footprint is smaller than the other counter-top/plug-in models, which many people like.  </li>
            <li>I will take healthy teeth and gums over messy though!</li>
            <li>I love its small size.</li>
            <li>Adult supervision is necessary because 1) to avoid level 3 because it&#x27;s too hard for the children and 2) avoid water going everywhere but the sink since it&#x27;s easy to have fun and spray the whole counter.</li>
            <li>Would enjoy seeing this offered in other colors, although the green is fine.  </li>
            <li>Easily five stars if the price were just a little lower.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s used it for a few days and it really helps getting his teeth clean and his gums are improving too.  </li>
            <li>The reservoir is just the right size for my small mouth and the settings are adequate for my sensitive gums</li>
            <li>Less space needed on the countertop which was important to me as well.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for children who are not good at or want to use regular dental floss.</li>
            <li>And i bet if my daughter was 8, not 6, she could probably do it on her own; however, given that I still have to floss her teeth and my teeth even after using this, its pointless to actually have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes a huge mess.  </li>
            <li>She learned to live with this handicap fast enough, and having no experience with a rotating head</li>
            <li>Although the handle seemed a bit small at first, I quickly acclimated.  </li>
            <li>Another question I kept having was if the water power would be strong enough and if there were only three settings or if incremental adjustments were possible.</li>
            <li>has High &amp; Low - high hurts even me</li>
            <li>My daughters orthodontist was concerned that her inability to adequately clean her gums was causing them to swell and grow down over her braces.</li>
            <li>The handle might feel smaller in a large adult hand, but I got used to it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to use and after a little instruction she was able to operate it herself.  </li>
            <li>and they were EXTREMELY helpful and quick.</li>
            <li>but when it arrived it clearly stated that it must have 110 60Hz power.....</li>
            <li>The only thing is the whole product line has gotten a lot &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; made than the old ones.</li>
            <li>I have a 10 and 13 year old, both with braces.</li>
            <li>I recommend not trying to save $16 or so and buying this instead of the adult version.</li>
            <li>My last one lasted over a decade, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $60 for another, especially since I only use the most basic functions.</li>
            <li>need to close the mouth completely else</li>
            <li>I need to upgrade to an adult model.</li>
            <li>The adult Waterpik does and also has a dial to turn up the water pressure.</li>
            <li>Very helpful with the daily routine of flossing; brushing with braces.  </li>
            <li>The Flosser for Kids are cheaper than the adult&#x27;s Travel size.  </li>
            <li>I like to use the adult one at home around 7 or 8, sometimes 9</li>
            <li>I am a busy mom</li>
            <li>Our adult version of the Waterpik broke (the hose part) and after reading the reviews on this children&#x27;s version we decided to go with this instead.</li>
            <li>Water flow is too harsh for me to feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>My beau has the adult version, but given the price difference I opted for this one instead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really just enough time to cover both side of your gums once over.</li>
            <li>Got this for my 12 year old daughter who has braces.</li>
            <li>As a disclaimer, I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li>(Kids size) one for my ADULT son for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>(Kids size) one for my ADULT son for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Bought for an adult, not a child after reading reviews.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the look of the blue ones</li>
            <li>Say goodbye to old fashioned flossing.  </li>
            <li>My seven year old daughter has braces (severe crossbite</li>
            <li>, they caught it early) and the orthodontist recommended a waterpick for her, so after doing some research, I decided on this one.</li>
            <li>That surprised me because it would sit on the counter in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old does not like the messiness of this product.</li>
            <li>This thing is still alive and kicking.</li>
            <li>I have purchased two of the water flosser for kids, even though I am an adult.</li>
            <li>both my husband and myself and the size is very convenient for travelling and the smaller footprint.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult who just got braces.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old son said to leave 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 9 year old son who wears an expander and continues to get food stuck in it.  </li>
            <li>So far I have not.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li>Btw, as I wrote below, this thing is extremely LOUD.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace the adult water pik</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I saw no reason to order the adult product to replace the one I had.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my 9 year old son.  </li>
            <li>I have the adult version and purchased this for my girls.  </li>
            <li>Some say it is loud,</li>
            <li>We use an adult Waterpik</li>
            <li>I bought this for my five year old grandson.  </li>
            <li>I even use it and my last dentist appointment went very well - no accusatory question from the dental assistant, &amp;#34;Are</li>
            <li>Gift to my 7 year old granddaughter</li>
            <li>I purchased this one instead of the adult version to save some money.</li>
            <li>Not as well designed as the adult version that does not require emptying after each use.</li>
            <li>We bought this for our 9 year old who just got a herbst dental appliance.</li>
            <li>but with it being a tad loud, you can here that it is on and that they are using it</li>
            <li>but it has irritated my gums in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>My old water pick died.  </li>
            <li>I got this item for myself based on reviews that said it would also work for an adult.  </li>
            <li>Written by a 13 year old and kid recommended.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old son loves using his Waterpik every night before bed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We bought the adult waterpik for ourselves</li>
            <li>B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] and this one for our almost 8 year old girl.</li>
            <li>hindsight, I would buy this unit for myself as well over the adult unit.</li>
            <li>The reason being is that it is smaller and doesn&#x27;t take up as much room on the counter.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really have the space for a larger one.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for our 7 year old grandson for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Even though I am an adult, I do have a child, so I decided to buy this kids product with the intention of everyone using it.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves using this and says it is far easier that flossing</li>
            <li>We bought this for our 10 year old that just got braces.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old needs it for braces and says &amp;</li>
            <li>I called Waterpik directly</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this company&#x27;s response to my complaint.  </li>
            <li>Second, there really needs to be a button on the handle that controls the flow of water.  </li>
            <li>Five year old likes using it.</li>
            <li>Three settings are available, but the first one is pretty lame.  </li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t so loud</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it at least once a day since I received it 3 weeks ago, and continue to be amazed how many food particles that brushing alone misses.  </li>
            <li>I have been using one of these gadgets for going on 40 plus years and have so far avoided gum disease.  </li>
            <li>I am an adult</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my adult self.</li>
            <li>it has sufficient options for an adult.</li>
            <li>My 12 yr old got braces</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 8 year old when he got a palatal expander.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li>7-yr old daughter just got a spaciator installed in her mouth</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s used it several times and really enjoys it.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a adult, myself.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading reviews to compare the Kids and the Adult version of the Waterpik.</li>
            <li>9 year old operates it on her own.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>As an adult, I like this model when it works because it&#x27;s compact and has PLENTY of power, even when set below maximum pressure.  </li>
            <li>My 12 year old just got braces.</li>
            <li>purchased this product for my 8 yr old son and he loves it.</li>
            <li>Gimmacky - get the adult version -</li>
            <li>Just leave the stickers off if you&#x27;re an adult.</li>
            <li>- I am an adult</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>Works well for an adult, too.</li>
            <li>Purchased this item for my 8 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this product, and my kid likes it and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worked to keep my daughter into her teeth- as soon as she&#x27;s done eating, she wants to spray her teeth.</li>
            <li>So much so that in learning to use it on low I accidentally hit my tonsils and popped out a tonsil stone!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Net-net, stick with an adult oral irrigator with an adjustable pressure.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my 8 yr old grandson.</li>
            <li>My 10yo son just got a fixed palate expander, and I was dubious when our doc said get a WaterPik.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this item for my 90 year old mother-in-law.</li>
            <li>Purchase for seven year old grandson</li>
            <li>8 year old child uses it well after a bit of training with it.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old daughter just LOVES this</li>
            <li>It just has a different color scheme and no travel case, but a much lower price tag.</li>
            <li>Powerful enough for an adult.&lt;br /&gt;The stickers are included, so you can leave the unit blank.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal since you get fresh water each time but still allows dust or whatever to fall into open container.....</li>
            <li>just as powerful as the regular one, and with a smaller footprint.</li>
            <li>green part is open on top</li>
            <li>I owned a number of these Waterpik devices over the years and hate to be without one: Waterpik makes for happy gums and teeth!</li>
            <li>An unexpected bonus is that you can turn the water chamber upside down and it fits easily over the lower container making it an even smaller appliance out on the counter.</li>
            <li>the meantime, I&#x27;ve moved on to greener pastures and purchased a new &amp;#34;Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser.&amp;#34; Hopefully the new water-flosser will last longer.</li>
            <li>small and unobtrusive- easily packed for travel or stowed under a cabinet if needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only wish is that it would have been available in other colors, but that&#x27;s just me, probably.</li>
            <li>it is small and I can travel easily with it.  </li>
            <li>We like that it is small, easy to care for and store on bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s true that the basin holds less water (it&#x27;s for kids,</li>
            <li>i already have the bigger Waterpik system for my older son, but needed another one for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>The water pressure is strong on all settings, and I like that the tank is smaller and takes up less space the the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; ones.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough to be comfortable for a small child on 1.</li>
            <li>I use somewhere around the second setting (you can use it in between, it&#x27;s not three hard and fast settings) and that is plenty strong.</li>
            <li>I love that it is smaller and takes less space than the larger ones, yet has all the power I need.  </li>
            <li>Most of the virtues of the more expensive &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; water picks, at half the price.  </li>
            <li>Lucky I snagged this for less than $30.</li>
            <li>I choose this because its not blue and seemed to be more compact (I have a small bathroom).  </li>
            <li>It provides just enough spray for me, an older person.</li>
            <li>Will order 2 more for other my other grandkids for Christmas.</li>
            <li>First, the white tubing is about a foot or so too short for taller children or ones standing on a stool.  </li>
            <li>Works just as well as my older larger waterpik!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even imagine how a little kid gets a mouth full of squirting water without gagging.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone with gum-disease issues who needs every bit of extra cleaning.</li>
            <li>It does have a wide range though so it can be very gentle as well.</li>
            <li>only difficulty is not being able to stop water flow at the handle (instead having to use the switch on the side of the tank), which can sometimes lead to not having enough hands - one to hold the wand in your mouth, one to switch the machine off and a third to hold the lighweight (nearly empty) unit still</li>
            <li>The color may not be my favorite, and I certainly had no use for the decals, but the smaller size takes up half the counter-top and storage space, and the variable pressure control is the same as on the more expensive full-size models by WaterPik.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a short time but thus far &#x27;really&#x27; like it.  </li>
            <li>The water reservoir is big enough for me and the waterjet powerful enough with the three settings.</li>
            <li>Like other people said, it would be better with the on/off on the actual pik handle, but its not SUCH a big deal to have to turn it off on the unit.  </li>
            <li>only caution is that the green container doesn&#x27;t have a lid, so you use it, rinse it, and then flip it over on the white stand ... not terribly hygienic/sterile.</li>
            <li>Bought this Waterpik unit for my son who recently got braces- its small enough for him to handle comfortably and powerful enough to do the trick.</li>
            <li>Be careful if you are a first time user.  </li>
            <li>It gets the gunk from between my crown and my next tooth that have always been a tight fit for floss.</li>
            <li>I already have a lot of stuff, all in his space, so this little guy is a real treat: it really saves up space.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect much out of this little thing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen that myself, but I can get my daughter to use it, if only briefly.  </li>
            <li>it was supposed to have two tips it only had one, so I had to order another set or send the whole unit back to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The only negative for me is that there is no cover for the top where the water goes.  </li>
            <li>Our family dentist suggested buying this specific water-pik for our son who got braces and said this would be a good substitution for flossing which is difficult to do with braces.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the nozzle handle stays put in it&#x27;s holder (you guessed it; my old one, due to the errant tube, wouldn&#x27;t sit right, ever).  </li>
            <li>My wife and I have been Waterpik users for over 3 years now, and it has improved our dental health exponentially, needless to say we feel no regrets and has no complains about our other more advanced Waterpik product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recently took a trip and the small size works out better than the larger one.  </li>
            <li>The small water tank is adequate for any adult to get around their teeth twice inside and out.</li>
            <li>And costs a third less than the full size.  </li>
            <li>Although even without the pause,  my 7 year old is able to use this water pik with little mess.</li>
            <li>My old one had a switch that you had to apply pressure to, causing the whole unit to slide away unless you held it in place with your other hand : |&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The water spray on even the lowest level is just a little too powerful.  </li>
            <li>I have not gone past the middle point of pressure and it seems fine there.  </li>
            <li>Very small footprint and easy to pack for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, this comes with an exceptionally bright green color scheme (green is definitely brighter in person than in the picture, btw) and doesn&#x27;t have a handy-dandy carrying case for other flossing heads, but the unit looks exactly the same and has the same features.  </li>
            <li>Only the most powerful setting had any actual pressure, and even that felt very weak, not like it would actually do any cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All other aspects are positive.</li>
            <li>Since I generally used one setting</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough, so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter space, but also powerful enough to remove the plaque.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 8 year old who recently got braces.  </li>
            <li>It works as well as the adult version but its smaller and cheaper.</li>
            <li>The regular adult size (for home use) has a dial from 1 to 10.  </li>
            <li>and this one exceeded my expectations as it was even smaller than my old one.</li>
            <li>My 7year old son uses this water pik daily.</li>
            <li>It performs as well as my old unit (and even though the description says it only has three speeds, it actually has continuously variable speed just like my old one did)</li>
            <li>My 10 yr old daughter tried it for a second and didn&#x27;t like it to use for her braces care.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the open tub, and I can wash it frequently...</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t put the decals on it, and you&#x27;ve got a smaller, adult version</li>
            <li>I got my old waterpik out of the closet only to discover it</li>
            <li>The only thing I do not like is it seems sort of loud</li>
            <li>I have a 6yr old son, so I thought I could give it to him if I needed something bigger for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And, oh yeah, this kids flosser is cheaper than the adult model in the same size.</li>
            <li>I wished I had purchased the adult one which has a button to press to hold back the water.</li>
            <li>bought this for my 7 year old daughter who just recently got braces.  </li>
            <li>But I do recommend this product, no regrets.</li>
            <li>But I do recommend this product, no regrets</li>
            <li>I think it has the same motor as the adult models...</li>
            <li>you prefer to put your kid in a headlock and use regular old floss, keep that up.</li>
            <li>and I wanted a Waterpik but didn&#x27;t want the big adult version taking up the counter space.  </li>
            <li>and though it does spray all over the place if you are not careful-</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it&#x27;s really loud -</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 9 year old son that recently got braces on his bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told this version is the same as the adult, so I bought this kids&#x27; one instead.  </li>
            <li>It does the same job as well as the adult versions, though the water container is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it has a lot smaller container than the adult version which no one seemed to say before I bought it.</li>
            <li>I am an adult and this is the third waterpik I have bought.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this waterpik for adult use, as I noticed the adult versions are much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>some one said there is no top to this true</li>
            <li>/&gt;While its is fun to use and see the junk flow out into the sink, its too much trouble.</li>
            <li>Only problem was learning NOT to try to adjust water flow on handle like previous version ~ that control dislodges the clear tip which allows water to spray all over!&lt;br /&gt;;-)</li>
            <li>It works great for her with less complicated controls.  </li>
            <li>It has just as much power as the adult size one, but takes up much less space on the counter and in my luggage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to use than the adult unit that finally died, smaller so takes up less room, capacity is just right</li>
            <li>I always brush first to eliminate washing any other food or plaque in my mouth back into my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The water flow is too much for a kid at 6 (even for me) - we get pretty wet; and in my opinion - does not clean teeth well.</li>
            <li>and I bought this in knowing she would need a waterpik to help clean those minute spaces in which a toothbrush has a hard time reaching.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I really like my Waterpik.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a big one with lots of settings, but it wasn&#x27;t as powerful as this little fellow.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned after reading reviews that this model might not be powerful enough.  </li>
            <li>This little machine is very very powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 9 year old has braces and really has trouble brushing around the brackets.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to last enough for me (35 yr. old).</li>
            <li>, the handler is smaller too so for adult users who have used the regular version, you will need to get used to this as well.</li>
            <li>but as good as and less expensive than the adult version.</li>
            <li>The odd-shaped adult one no longer fits in a corner, has multiple attachments, and uses an oval massive reservoir built for three.  </li>
            <li>The water reservoir is big enough for an adult mouth.  </li>
            <li>Its more difficult for a child to angle the stream than adult oral irrigators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied, having used it a few times a day for a few months.</li>
            <li>I hold my head right over the sink to allow the water to run down the drain and try to remember to keep my mouth just open enough to let the water run (not spray out).</li>
            <li>I do prefer the old style press down button to turn the machine on rather than the turning switch of the new style.</li>
            <li>but I tried it myself and it is really hard to clean the teeth with the constant flow of water then</li>
            <li>Another reviewer gave the advice that this children&#x27;s unit was essentially the same as the adult or family units except for smaller size.  </li>
            <li>After first few times of getting used to it, she loves it.  </li>
            <li>First few times, I ran the wand in her mouth so she would know what to do.  </li>
            <li>--fairly powerful, small convenient size.</li>
            <li>I really like how you can turn the water container upside down to use it for storage.</li>
            <li>works OK, a little too small container</li>
            <li>and it made a tremendous difference in the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>The three pressure settings are really powerful for such a small appliance.</li>
            <li>It is a little messy unless I assist them, but better than the crying I used to endure trying to get them to floss the normal way.  </li>
            <li>7 year old daughter was always curious about using it, and we tried to get her into flossing with very limited success, not only their adult teeth are all scattered around her mouth and mixed with baby teeth, but her mouth is rather small</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a happy camper with happy gums:-)</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> Loved the stickers too.</li>
            <li> girls loved putting the stickers on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning in and around that.  </li>
            <li> The stickers were a good beginning.</li>
            <li> I have had my Waterpik for two weeks now and it feels so good on my gums and my teeth</li>
            <li> Delighted that I bought this item.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it is a good product or not.  </li>
            <li> Bought this in March, thought it was good</li>
            <li> It works great and he can use it on his own.</li>
            <li> I ignored it because of the number of good reviews.</li>
            <li> This fits and has a good water capacity and I may fill it twice if need be.  </li>
            <li> This product worked well, and my kids loved it.  </li>
            <li> It is a good buy.</li>
            <li> The colors are good for boys or girls.</li>
            <li> But neither of those things get in the way of it doing a good job.  </li>
            <li> It does what it needs to do with good pressure.</li>
            <li> good usefull works with 220 V</li>

            <li> I personally loved using it</li>
            <li> The grip size is good for children.</li>

            <li> THAT GOOD  </li>
            <li> WITCH WILL BE GOOD WHEN YOU GET YOURS BESIDES</li>
            <li> And the price is good.</li>
            <li> Settings available 1 - 2 - 3, found 1 1/2 works best for me.</li>
            <li> Well everything looks good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She loved the stickers and decorated it with ALL of them.&lt;br /&gt;Tube</li>
            <li> LOved it while it worked, but it broke after about 3 months of use.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t use a lot of counter space which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Good intro water-pik for kids, expecially with braces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a good job and removes all the built up gunk and food particles that they can&#x27;t get out with a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> None of them did a good job of maintaining pressure or of having quality components that didn&#x27;t break or leak.</li>
            <li> the good work.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Speed 1 is good for kids, I use speed 2 which pulses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I think of this before, I remember my parents using one and loved using it.</li>
            <li> good and kids seem to like having kid stuff.</li>
            <li> A good machine sturdy and efficient.</li>
            <li> good.</li>
            <li> Good prize for a portable unit.</li>
            <li> Good appliance</li>
            <li> This is perfect to keep them clean.  </li>
            <li> It works perfectly for getting my son&#x27;s braces clean and cleaning food from between both my children&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> Great product, but this model isn&#x27;t very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use, would buy again!</li>
            <li> Good price for the service it provides, much better than dental floss!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to be able to take the Flosser for Kids on the road, and not have to miss the one at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this.</li>
            <li> Her dentist finds her teeth and gums very healthy.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product.  </li>

            <li> Works great and kids love it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Attractive (and cute with the interchangeable stickers).&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> very pleased w/pressure.</li>
            <li> This is a great feature because many of the battery operated piks die and you cannot fix them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> find 2 is a good setting and works quite nicely for my mouth.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, applies excellent pressure, and the parts seem to be better made.</li>
            <li> The adjustable pressure is great and he liked being able to decorate the unit with the vinyl clings.  </li>
            <li> Great Waterpik for both kids and adults~ bought one for me and one for our 5 year old grandson who manages it perfectly!</li>

            <li> This waterpik is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space, and does a great job.</li>
            <li> The pressure is great, in fact the level 3 is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> Would be nice if the tip of it has some sort of color code so that we can use it for more than one kid!</li>
            <li> I have never used a water flosser before, and I was very excited to order this one!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s both have braces and this waterpik is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has done an amazing job with the prices and products.</li>
            <li> but it is seriously AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Amazing for my daughter with braces</li>
            <li> Excelent product, nice price</li>
            <li> Nice bright color, cute touch with the stickers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice however, this does not come with a cover.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to have an alternative (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for after snacks like Wheat Thins or Oreos it flushes most of the impacted food out and makes for better brushing afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Also, it would be nice if there was a button so that you could control when it sprayed.</li>
            <li> Nice control switch for stronger water pressure so she can increase as her gums heal.  </li>
            <li> Works nicely.</li>
            <li> Adjustable pressure is nice.</li>
            <li> My child uses two tanks of warm water per cleaning.</li>
            <li> Nice to be using one again.  </li>
            <li> This is incredible, gets everything out and is fun.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.</li>
            <li> It will come in handy when he gets braces, too.</li>
            <li> They also give 3 pressure settings which is nice.    </li>
            <li> The reservoir flips over to cover the unit when not in use, a nice touch.</li>
            <li> husband liked mine and purchased one for himself.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m kind of jealous and think I may buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely on counter.</li>
            <li> She likes having the ability to decorate the flosser &amp; make it her own.  </li>
            <li> Works great - perfect for smaller mouths.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice size.</li>
            <li> This was like something from candid camera.</li>
            <li> Nice size</li>
            <li> so its nice that it fits well there.  </li>
            <li> My son liked that he could put stickers on it to make it his own.</li>
            <li> just the color is kind of for boy</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Works nice either way.  </li>
            <li> : you put the reservoir on top of the body and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> He is 7 and can use it on his own.</li>
            <li> Also a cover for the water reservoir would be nice as well.</li>
            <li> The water pressure is fully adjustable, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a reviewer who pointed out this waterpik for &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34;, its perfect for adults as well.</li>
            <li> Really keeps my children&#x27;s teeth and braces looking great!</li>
            <li> This is so handy and a def.</li>
            <li> Nice not</li>
            <li> great price, great product, fast ship</li>
            <li> My Granddaughter asked for this for Christmas and was thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> My kids (8 and 5) need help filling the tank, but can otherwise waterpik their own teeth with this.  </li>
            <li> My daughter said she would need to rebrush his teeth because he would never do a good job (even with an electric/battery toothbrush) since getting the waterpik he spends more time using it than he did just flossing and brushing...</li>
            <li> Nice and compact.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it to clean her braces and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Great for adults, too :) I just avoided putting the stickers on it, and it looks perfectly fine and not too kiddish</li>
            <li> Kids new best friend.</li>
            <li> Loved that she could personalize,and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fairly compact, so it&#x27;s easy to store out of sight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is very strong, I use this on ~2.5 out of 3 power setting.</li>
            <li> Very strong water jet.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to separate the water storage from the body, making it prone to spills.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and he is looking forward to using it at nighttime before he goes to bed.</li>
            <li> Very easy for a kid to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy for kids to use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and handle.</li>
            <li> The three water pressures and size of the water container are just perfect for an adult!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
            <li> great for braces, keeps teeth clean ad gums healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more a fordable than one for adults and works great, it has a lot of power, I use power 2 for me, easy to use and easy to clean, love it!!</li>
            <li> My kid loves it and it is also suitable for adults.</li>
            <li> My 9year old just got braces and this is the best!</li>
            <li> I bought the waterpik for my 6 year old daughter under the dentist´s recomendation and tried it myself to see how it works, it´s a great option for flossing!</li>
            <li> not as many \\&quot;girl\\&quot; ones as I would have liked though.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has a heart condition so good oral hygiene is important for her.  </li>
            <li> perfect for my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I also oil-pull (and until this, flossed) in addition to brushing but found the Waterpik to be more effective than flossing.  </li>
            <li> kiddo liked it, be better if you could snap and store picks inside cover/tank.</li>
            <li> Anytime you can have fun cleaning your teeth is a great tool.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the counter works just like an adult size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult and the kids waterpik works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> I use as an adult, works great!</li>
            <li> However, upon receiving this product I set it up for my 9 year old son to try it out, and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> they think it&#x27;s fun to use and the product works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult, but find the settings and the size of this water flosser to be perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my bathroom counter as I didn&#x27;t want a bulky thing on it from the adult version.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 7 year old who just got braces.</li>
            <li> My kids can use this on their own (6 &amp; 8)</li>
            <li> It is really easy for her to use!  </li>
            <li> This thing is awesome, it&#x27;s nice and compact and holds enough water to rinse out my teeth quite well.</li>
            <li> After using it for several weeks, I can honestly report that it is perfect!</li>
            <li> The pulsating jet of water on the gums brings more blood to the guns, and therefore more oxygen, and is effective in helping to treat periodontic disease.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to used and my son enjoy flossing now!</li>
            <li> Nice clean feeling!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the color, but the size is great - holds a nice amount of water and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li> Pretty durable and a great price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> AS GOOD AS MY FULL SIZE.  </li>
            <li> Using warm water, it&#x27;s a comfortable and easy tool!</li>
            <li> compact, very easy to keep clean, good range of pressure - great for my 7 yr old and myself!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, easy to clean and according to the Ortho and Dentist, he is doing a great job.  </li>
            <li> very easy to use and good for first user.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference since I started using it (and I notice when I don&#x27;t!).</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase and would use this seller and product again.</li>
            <li> They love it</li>
            <li> Kids love to floss</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I just wished it had a top for it...</li>
            <li> he&#x27;ll use it even more as he ages and gets more used to the power.</li>
            <li> I use it myself, and it works a lot better than flossing.</li>
            <li> (so once you turn the power on you need to be sure the tip is in your mouth).&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT HAVE A TOP.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> not come with a top for water reservoir.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made not cheapy just cause its cute...</li>
            <li> we love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very much pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do 2 fills top and bottom</li>
            <li> The product is good and economical.</li>
            <li> To show your kids the impact of cleaning it has, be sure to have them use it after they eat popcorn and watch all the stuff that falls into the sink.</li>
            <li> My kids (ages 8 &amp; 10) love this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great an MUCH quieter...</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve gone through many additional full-sized ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The highest setting for the jet stream is more than I need.  </li>
            <li> Wish it had holders for more than one kid in the family.</li>
            <li> (more if he could take it to school).&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li> Anything can fall in the top of it.</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well.  </li>
            <li> oh, that&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> Pleased with service and product.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got the kids model.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the stickers are optional.</li>
            <li> and I was sure it would be another thing she wouldn&#x27;t touch</li>
            <li> What more could one ask for?</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love it and Amazon.</li>
            <li> They love it.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this appliance.</li>
            <li> But the kids love it</li>
            <li> Most likely the best unit I have ever owned</li>

            <li> works great for adults too, why pay double when the kids version works just as good</li>
            <li> Love this water flosser...</li>
            <li> My kids love this flosser.  </li>
            <li> I would think it would be more sanitary to have a top.  </li>
            <li> They love it</li>
            <li> and I love it knowing they are flossing.</li>
            <li> cleared junk out of my teeth/braces better than my waterpik.</li>
            <li> Our daughter is much better about doing her teeth now that she has her waterpik</li>
            <li> Also, I like the color better.</li>
            <li> It does appear to be better made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She is able to use the Waterpik herself now after we went over how to use it correctly for some time.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure, and by then she can decide what&#x27;s better for her, I will not get into the discussion about flossing vs. Waterpik,.</li>
            <li> Perfect low-tech device for dislodging stuck food from my back molars without jamming it up under my gums.  </li>
            <li> The stickers were cute, and they&#x27;re removable, coming in both girl and boy designs.  </li>
            <li> one warning though, be sure to start at the lowest setting and work up.</li>
            <li> Both kids love using it</li>
            <li> The kids love this</li>
            <li> and that is much more tolerable).</li>
            <li> and they enjoy it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to remind them to use it which means these things are working out better than I could have imagined.</li>
            <li> my lower  teeth left, I needed save them the best I could.</li>
            <li> My kids love this.  </li>
            <li> I so am glad that I ordered this product to help him have a healthy dental report. :)</li>
            <li> Kids love it.</li>
            <li> i have had 3 different types of water flossers over the many years i have used them and this has turned out the best.</li>
            <li> the waterpik brand remains one of the most reliable for durability.</li>
            <li> They love it......</li>
            <li> The counter top plug ins are a much better choice IMO.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I don&#x27;t think there is better out there</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ONE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably better to incrementally increase the water strength before turning it on rather than after.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flosser to encourage my two boys to floss better since they both now have braces.  </li>
            <li> Their dentist and orthodontist have both remarked how much better their gums are since using this.  </li>
            <li> Am glad that the color is unisex for that reason.</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> Has a potent water flow,</li>
            <li> I wish it had an on/off on the handle, but otherwise I love this.</li>
            <li> I love the compact size.</li>
            <li> My kids love it.  </li>
            <li> You are better off investing in the waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I got it</li>
            <li> The kids are getting more flossing done.</li>
            <li> I have two with braces and they love their waterpiks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought the kid&#x27;s version--</li>
            <li> It is ok.</li>
            <li> I feel like better brands make better products.</li>
            <li> and I love this product because it works.</li>
            <li> They love it, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I would be great if it had a shut off switch on the handle, but it still works really well.</li>
            <li> That one lasted for more than twenty years, but then the hoses began to split.</li>
            <li> bet the kids are going to love it too.</li>
            <li> one 100x more</li>
            <li> but when they&#x27;re installed soon, I believe this will work so much better than trying to thread dental floss through the wires.</li>
            <li> I love this compact unit; it travels with me when I am in this country.</li>
            <li> but glad we did.</li>
            <li> stickers are cute and are removable.  </li>
            <li> But this thing has many issues.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> But, you do not need to buy them when this one is a great quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love *</li>
            <li> This works much better than trying to get him to floss.  </li>
            <li> I also love the compact form factor in my bathroom and the water pressure it has.</li>
            <li> compact size is excellent for limited counter space and is very easy to store.  </li>
            <li> He is twelve and has been good about brushing, but I found this online and the price was right.</li>
            <li> and so I was very excited to see this one.  </li>
            <li> It can be very powerful!</li>
            <li> They were both so excited to use it, that I bought another, so they each have their own.</li>
            <li> My dentist was very pleased with my results when I went in for my cleaning and said it is definitely helping keep my gums in great condition.</li>
            <li> leaves a nice clean feeling too..</li>
            <li> The water pressure is pretty good.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses this, but mom and dad are now in the market for their own!</li>
            <li> I live in China, so I was so happy to find this dual-voltage model.</li>
            <li> We like that it is easy to use without too many settings or accessories.  </li>
            <li> I like this much better and easy to use</li>
            <li> Its easy to add water if you need more.  </li>
            <li> My dentist quickly saw an improvement in my gums, and food quit catching between my teeth when my gums healed.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and did a better job on my teeth then</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much better price and sits perfectly on pedestal sinks.</li>
            <li> so more power is available if you need more.  </li>
            <li> Because I have braces, using this is very convenient and it&#x27;s much cheaper than the adults&#x27; one.&lt;br /&gt;Efficient and great!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is the perfect size for a single person.  </li>
            <li> Great size for my 7 year old Granddaughter!</li>
            <li> the hygienist said she was amazed at how clean my teeth were!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it would work just fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and encourages the kids to clean their teeth better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Construction looks sturdy and it&#x27;s very easy to clean, and the \\&quot;customization\\&quot; with stickers is a nice touch, right away</li>
            <li> and I am sure it will make a huge difference in my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> that allows the user to turn the stream of water on and off, or pause it really, to be more accurate.  </li>
            <li> This kid-size waterpik is great for kids and also mature travelers.  </li>
            <li> Read the great reviews about this water pik and so far she loves it and uses it.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 3-4 months and then completely died.</li>
            <li> They brush and waterfloss on their own now and love showing off their much cleaner teeth!  </li>
            <li> And for under $30.00 it was a fantastic deal ....... :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important all the time, but discolored teeth can occur if you don&#x27;t stay on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I use this as an adult, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper than the adult, but works just as great.</li>
            <li> works great as far as i can tell.</li>
            <li> works great for my 11 year old daughter with her braces.</li>
            <li> I use an adult version of the product and have great dental visits.  </li>
            <li> esp considering how much you save price wise.</li>
            <li> and she loved it came with removable stickers she can switch out whenever she wants.  </li>
            <li> It is compact so it does not take up a lot of space and is still powerful and gets the teeth very clean!</li>
            <li> resevoir is the perfect size, and it&#x27;s super easy for her to fill and use by herself, and the pressure settings are simple to adjust.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 year old and he absolutely love this!!  </li>
            <li> There are three power settings available, I use the second  most powerful setting which is just perfect for</li>
            <li> its a smaller device, which fit perfect in my bathroom sink and the best perk (for me) is the green color match with my bathroom decorations...  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it is the perfect tool for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> The pressure is super strong!  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and has plenty of power.  </li>
            <li> It also packs away easily to store.</li>
            <li> The lowest setting is very mild and the highest setting is so strong</li>
            <li> Not an easy task for a kid.</li>
            <li> It is more compact and cheaper and from what I read just as good as the adult version.</li>
            <li> Easy peasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and they can do it all by themselves.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size for her to use with her braces to make sure there aren&#x27;t any food particles trapped between her teeth and the hardware.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Waterflosser is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to set and use with easy instructions to follow.</li>
            <li> Also, I was happy that the picks from the my old one fit this one</li>
            <li> Easy to use and store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have easily given it five stars.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and set up too.</li>
            <li> the water container is easy to lift and fill.</li>
            <li> the switches for on/off and power are all easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> to use, easy water holder connection, easy to turn on, set speed etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is still easy to use.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a cover, but no cover just means flipping over the top and covering up the unit (to keep the water bin clean).</li>
            <li> Easy and convenient to travel with.  </li>
            <li> I bought this so that my 6th grade daughter could clean her teeth and braces better.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use by children.</li>
            <li> The tip is easily exchanged, so it&#x27;s easy to use it for both kids.  </li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles, just something easy to use and which would do the job.</li>
            <li> with the easy wand button feature.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It is easy for her to use.</li>
            <li> It was so strong I made my gums sore.</li>
            <li> Water pressure is a bit strong for tonsil and &amp;#34;back of throat&amp;#34; cleansing.  </li>
            <li> so you may choose how strong you would like the water</li>
            <li> It does a good job, but he complains the water pressure is too high and hurts his teeth even at the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter was coming to visit just after having braces applied, so we wanted to be certain she coud take good care to clean around them.  </li>
            <li> using the Waterpik I like to use about 1/4 hydrogen peroxide (you could also use a mouthwash if you want, just check that it doesn&#x27;t have bleach or iodine) and fill the rest with warm to hot tap water.</li>
            <li> Like better than full size model.  </li>
            <li> In doing my research I realized that I did not need the full size Water Pik because I don&#x27;t have that many teeth that requires a water reservoir for 90 seconds of watering picking.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even do it at first because I was so used to my handy dandy nicer waterpik</li>
            <li> /&gt;Water Pik also offers orthodontic tips to attach to it which also work great for getting the metal of the braces clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get my 3 year old more excited about taking care of her teeth, and also to give it a try for myself as I&#x27;ve heard good things about Waterpik vs. dental floss.  </li>
            <li> The machine works well, does it&#x27;s job just fine.</li>
            <li> Just bring in towels for the floor and faces and everyone will be fine.</li>
            <li> The water capacity is fine.  </li>
            <li> I love the color and that its small and compact it&#x27;s perfect for me</li>
            <li> Everything seems fine.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> This works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Works fine for a child&#x27;s waterpik...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just as good for adults and the small size is great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for adults.</li>
            <li> and I like it just fine.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Worked just fine for about 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> No need to put the decals on…does a good job without taking up much counter space as full size waterpik does.</li>
            <li> Those reviews are what sold me on this purchase and I am super pleased.  </li>
            <li> This looked super cute</li>
            <li> This device was tremendously helpful!</li>
            <li> And, if you really do, well then, you just add more water!  </li>
            <li> but it is easy to use and a great addition to your daily brushing routine.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> This little baby is awesome!  </li>
            <li> Works fine, but not as good as my old water pik.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and kid friendly buttons.  </li>
            <li> If you have huge hands (or a huge mouth?)</li>
            <li> I even traveled with it for 2 weeks and it fit into my carryon tote with no problem.  </li>
            <li> I have the regular version and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Our 5 kids ranging from 3-14 use this every night and enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Shame products are so cheap nowadays.</li>
            <li> For the money I think this product is made rather cheap.  </li>
            <li> This Waterpik works fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> This Waterpik Waterflosser makes it fun for my grand children to brush and floss their teeth.  </li>
            <li> Relatively compact and works great for adults, and the stickers are optional.</li>
            <li> Cleans fantastic.  </li>
            <li> They sent us a replacement spigot for free.</li>
            <li> My kids use it and my wife liked it so much she bought another one for herself.</li>
            <li> For a kid that doesn&#x27;t like brushing his teeth, he sure does have fun with this water flosser.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re 11 and 9 and this is what they&#x27;ve told me; LIKES-easy to switch picks, easy to fill and clean, it feels like it&#x27;s cleaning and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it and they use it without being constantly reminded about flossing.</li>
            <li> They did enjoy putting stickers on it and declaring whose flosser stays in the caddy and which one stays connected.</li>
            <li> This works great and is much smaller.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the Sturdy Storage with Replacement Tips and everyone in the family can enjoy using it now.</li>
            <li> so dust gets in the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, oral health is extremely important to me.</li>
            <li> However Amazon is great at returns and I&#x27;m getting my money back.</li>
            <li> But all in all its worth the money, the kids will love it.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and determined it was worth the chance that the &#x27;kid&#x27; version of Waterpik would work for me</li>
            <li> I think both are great for their individual needs.</li>
            <li> and I was worried about the waterpik being more of a toy than useful.  </li>
            <li> We added the water and a capful of his favorite mouthwash to give his breath and gums that minty fresh, feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After quite a few practice sessions to figure out the best way to use this</li>
            <li> Cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> So, a great addition to future models will be that.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s colorful and cute.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> The top needs a lid.very colorful.</li>
            <li> the machine does feel a bit cheap, but they have a warranty and it does work well.</li>
            <li> word, however: do what you must to prevent your child from using the most powerful setting.</li>
            <li> I contacted Waterpik and they replaced item for free.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It has encouraged a healthy smile.  </li>
            <li> The only real difference is the size of the reservoir, but filling it twice works perfectly well.</li>
            <li> it works good even for adult</li>
            <li> Fantastic Powerful unit would buy another one fore sure .</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled or impressed but way better than the con air brand u got myself and husband</li>
            <li> : Fairly compact; no lid on reservoir; pressure settings are adequate for normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li> I just used this thing, and full blast is REALLY full blast!  </li>
            <li> I am also better about cleaning my teeth right before bed.</li>
            <li> Her swollen gums quickly went down after using w/ warm water for two weeks!!!</li>
            <li> Love, this is good for an older person or when you don&#x27;t have much counter space.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping it was as good as the adult one, and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> She absolutely LOVES it!!!  </li>
            <li> daughter reports she had her first successful check up AND that her new hobby is Dental Hygiene!  </li>
            <li> The rep. said not to be fooled by the \\&quot;kids\\&quot; aspect of the model since it is still very powerful</li>
            <li> (it runs out at my high pressure setting and the methodical pausing between each tooth) and it lacks one very good feature of my old one, and that was the ability to turn the nozzle in the holder as I was using it in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> So easy and portable that I&#x27;m using it every day vs. the old water pik that mostly gathered dust !</li>
            <li> Made a huge difference in keeping his mouth clean</li>
            <li> The ease of use as well as the stickers that she can put on to personalize it make her actually enjoy using it and keeping her braces clean.  </li>
            <li> It is super easy for kids to use.</li>
            <li> When they&#x27;re older, do you think they&#x27;re going to keep on flossing on their own?</li>
            <li> mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quick and easy to set up.</li>
            <li> While it works great to remove large items and its even good enough for adults (trust me, the highest setting on this thing is the highest anyone would really want to go), i found on each occassion, if i flossed afterwards, there was still residue that the floss got that the pik did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is smaller, which is great for limited counter space, and the power/size is great for her.</li>
            <li> With this little adjustment, this would be the absolutely best product, as it has helped my daughter&#x27;s dental hygiene tremendously.</li>
            <li> enjoyed decorating the unit, and is thrilled to have her own little &amp;#34;dentist toy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The stickers are a really fun bonus!</li>
            <li> It is very challenging to get a three year old to brush her teeth twice a day.</li>
            <li> But that is fun for her!</li>
            <li> but this thing is fun to use, I wish this counted as brushing too!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this Waterpik for myself because of its size and color (my favorite!), and because many reviewers wrote that it works equally as well for adults as children.</li>
            <li> I am not deleting what I originally wrote but I am adding an update.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW:  </li>
            <li> We love the compact size and it works very well!</li>
            <li> Child friendly.  </li>
            <li> He was excited he doesnt like to floss he loves it</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally looking at the Ultra + Travel combo package (priced at just under $100), but decided to buy the Aquarius and this &amp;#34;Kids&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better deal b/c it ends up being cheaper, and you get to upgrade to the smaller (and more visually appealing) Aquarius.  </li>
            <li> We bought this originally for my daughter who had the pleasure of wearing a palatal expander.  </li>
            <li> the size is perfect for a small footprint.</li>
            <li> This one was significantly cheaper</li>
            <li> : When first using the water pik, make sure to have a towel laying around.</li>
            <li> I still miss the original Waterpik by Teledyne (pictured), which lasted a couple decades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> at first i was not for sure.</li>
            <li> but this one its kid friendly.</li>
            <li> I already had the original waterflosser (ultra?</li>
            <li> My first try was hilarious.  </li>
            <li> With our small bathroom this size water flosser is perfect.  </li>
            <li> With a fine stream, it feels better on the gums and not as much water ends up flowing out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> honestly think this is the exact same model as the Traveler Water Flosser, which is priced at almost $100 more!  </li>
            <li> My son was not getting his teeth as clean as his dentist and orthodontist would like after getting braces.  </li>
            <li> so we purchased this to help her keep her mouth/teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> She likes to use it and said it makes her teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li> After each use we run vinegar through it to clean it out.</li>
            <li> My dentist gives me a clean bill of health, as well.</li>
            <li> He was about to get braces and she told me that it&#x27;s imperative to keep your teeth and gums clean during orthodontic treatment.</li>
            <li> He loves it and it keeps it clean.</li>
            <li> Their teeth have never been so clean.  </li>
            <li> Bought it when my son got his braces to help clean his teeth.  </li>
            <li> BUT IF IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ONE I HAD  POW TO CLEAN</li>
            <li> IT HAS NOW IM 60 AND LIKE A CLEAN MOUTH  </li>
            <li> My husband broke his jaw and had to get wired, doctor said to get a water pik to help keep his teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> Every time she goes to the orthodontist they tell her how clean her teeth are.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this unit to help clean in and around her palate expander.</li>
            <li> One of the orthodontic tips offers a brush at the top of it to help to make sure plaque removal is a breeze!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We got this to help the kids keep their braces clean.  </li>
            <li> Even though they label it for &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34;  it is great for anyone with limited space.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty loud but otherwise the quality and size is perfect for a 12 year old.</li>
            <li> I originally had a full sized water pik</li>
            <li> Water makes everything more fun, right?</li>
            <li> However, I find that sometimes it is too easy to toggle the nozzle release since it is right under your thumb while you are using the machine.</li>
            <li> It has 3 speeds, speed 3 is too strong for me; 2 is just right.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why the other one even takes that much counter-space, but this one is the perfect size, and it works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It is just the right size!</li>
            <li> This is such an efficient way to clean around all of that hardware in conjunction with good brushing techniques.</li>
            <li> This items worked great for my 5 &amp; 7 yr old daughters to floss their teeth without fear of the normal tape floss.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference.perfect size and fun color</li>
            <li> We had bought a full size waterpik waterflosser for Mom and Dad and the kids wanted one as well.</li>
            <li> My 5 years old kid can use this water flosser on his own.</li>
            <li> I found that to be true.</li>
            <li> I love mine so much that I purchased another</li>
            <li> I love mine so much that I purchased another</li>
            <li> the stickers are really a clingfilm so you can change them, the butterfly, dragonfly and turtle are cute,</li>
            <li> There are 3 different setting for water pressure and he said the lower one would be good for babies.</li>
            <li> Everything the reviews say are true.</li>
            <li> not only good for kinds but fits adults well, too.</li>
            <li> but I bought this product thinking it will be a good help to my son&#x27;s teeth daily cleaning</li>
            <li> it gets used more than any string thing, works well and seems to do the job and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space...</li>
            <li> Works very well, abouth to order one more.</li>
            <li> Because even though my gums are in good health I have had problems with chunks of food getting pressed under the gum line on my uppermost back teeth.</li>
            <li> The spray was more gentle for him.</li>
            <li> Our kids use the second one with good results.  </li>
            <li> So, after going to the dentist the next day for his teeth cleaning, the report was \\&quot;His teeth and gums look good and keep doing what you are</li>
            <li> Even if you are being very thorough, you will have more than sufficient water for 1 person.</li>
            <li> There are instructions that come with the unit that teach you how to start using this as you can&#x27;t just start off using this full blast.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really bother me, just sayin&#x27; :)</li>
            <li> This is the least costly and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended and I really find it works for me much better than floss.</li>
            <li> But this thing really does help him get out the food that gets stuck between the retainer and the top of his mouth.</li>
            <li> Device is easy to use for children and does an excellent job on cleaning their teeth, behind teeth and in between their teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and exactly as designed.</li>
            <li> Works great and has just enough capacity to clean my whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> I originally thought that the lack of a lid on the tub part of the flosser wouldn&#x27;t be great, but you can store it upside down and snap it onto the bottom part of the flosser</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more compact than some of the markets, plus the bright color and the stickers</li>
            <li> It is really great - the size is so manageable and it works just as well as the other Waterpik flossers I have had over the years (3).</li>
            <li> I admit that I bought this particular waterflosser because of the cool lime green color, but it not only looks good, it is perfect for my needs.  </li>
            <li> it makes it fun not a chore to clean my daughters braces..</li>
            <li> It makes it fun to clean his mouth.</li>
            <li> Best price around, local stores like Walmart wanted $50 for this same item and wouldn&#x27;t price match amazon.</li>
            <li> More than enough for most adults&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough for her to operate, and really does a good job at getting her teeth</li>
            <li> Great investment, good quality and not too expensive.  </li>
            <li> This kids model is much cheaper than similar travel version and works great for me on the road.</li>
            <li> my daughter felt it was her own toy to play with, a fun way to get your kids into taking care of their mouth from an early age.</li>
            <li> After 2 tries he was able to use on his own.</li>
            <li> A very strong jet of water is produced, possibly strong enough to be painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This unit is very strong, a far cry from the battery powered models.</li>
            <li> We have had a couple orthodontist visits for tightening and one normal dentist visit after buying the Waterpik and both commented his gums line and between teeth are much better.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of using this, they returned to normal healthy gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty thorough flosser, so I filled the tank 2 times for one flossing session.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought this item and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> No big deal, very cute</li>
            <li> I loved the small footprint of this unit, much better than the full sized Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> Our Waterpik is certainly too strong for her and too \\&quot;adult\\&quot; for her looks, so we decided to purchase this kids model</li>
            <li> She has been loving this waterpik and using it several times a day, as she find this to be an easier way to keep her braces clean than all the accessories provided by the orthodontist.  </li>
            <li> The intensity setting seems very high though, but it is easily adjusted.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even been able to use the high setting because it&#x27;s so powerful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily, my kids, 9 and 11, don&#x27;t seem to mind that the new device doesn&#x27;t come with stickers or that the new device has more settings, more features, comes with a lid for the tank, etc...</li>
            <li> The Kids versions it great for adults and half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter really needs this, and it&#x27;s so easy to tell which one is hers.</li>
            <li> It works very well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very kid-friendly and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, kid sized, she can do it by herself (which makes my life easier), and her oral hygiene is much improved.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough to do the job effectively, easy to operate and maintainance free.  </li>
            <li> The water stream is strong, but not as fine as the old water pik.  </li>
            <li> They also seem to enjoy using it, so that&#x27;s another positive thing to say about the product.  </li>
            <li> In this case, simple really is better!</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t make a mess if you keep over the sink -</li>
            <li> They both are much more willing to floss as this is fun and much easier than flossing with thread.</li>
            <li> A younger child wouldn&#x27;t be able to control it as easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, fun, and gentle.  </li>
            <li> She needed something effective that was easy to use and that took minimal counter space in her apartment bathroom.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She just loves it, she is always looking forward to her pre-bed routine of using her Waterpik, and she started doing a great job with it after the second or third use, my fear of water mess and pieces of chewed food stuck to the mirror or counter were unfounded, this model is very easy to use and gentle on the gums, while it gives my daughter the cleaning she needs much more easier and effective than with</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the adult version, but this one works fine for me!</li>
            <li> I have no use for the orthodontic tip, but regular tip works fine for me, and the pressure is just as strong as the pricey deluxe adult models.  </li>
            <li> I spotted the KID model with 60 second reservoir which was perfect and smaller size works great in my small bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> The stickers and color make my daughter interested in using this to clean her orthodontic appliances.</li>
            <li> If you plan to let your kids operate the device on their own, be sure to give them explicit instructions on not making a mess, not bumping the tank, cleaning up afterwards, etc...</li>
            <li> Great little water flosser for my granddaughter who will be getting braces.  </li>
            <li> This little flosser works great.</li>
            <li> the stickers are the plastic kind (with no glue on them at all) that you can put on and remove easily - give them to your kids to put on their other toys or put them on a mirror -</li>
            <li> I wanted a light stream and even the lower setting on this is too much for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is unlike the huge adult version that won&#x27;t fit on my dinky sink vanity.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It also came with an orthodontic tip and colorful stickers.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> My water pic was to powerful, but this one has a power adjustment for her to use.  </li>
            <li> The water coming out is way to powerful.  </li>
            <li> The only additional feature that I would of liked on this model is the pause button so he can pause the spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely plenty to get the job done and the set-up is nice and compact</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless of the sprayed walls and mirrors, if this will help maintain my daughter&#x27;s dental health, it&#x27;s all worth it.</li>
            <li> We had much fun with water spraying everywhere while trying to learn to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Update-</li>
            <li> My seven year old sneaks away to use it :)</li>
            <li> It is just like I remember, cleans between teeth &amp; braces, plus, it&#x27;s fun</li>
            <li> and I appreciate it far more than flossing itself.  </li>
            <li> I have used water pics for over 20 years and have found them extremely effective not only in cleaning the teeth and any pockets in the gums but also in massaging the guns with it&#x27;s pulsating  jet of water.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure the adult one doesn&#x27;t do anything that this one doesn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li> Powerful water flow which you can adjust for strength.</li>
            <li> So make sure you have it on a level surface &amp; near the sink in case it falls.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and my 7 year old daughter loved being able to the included stickers.</li>
            <li> She, also, says it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> but it makes me smile.</li>
            <li> My kids (4 and 7) have fun using it.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> IT UP AND FLOSS AWAY TO  FRESH BREATH  </li>
            <li> A POWERFUL WATER GUN  DONT POINT IT AT EYES</li>
            <li> While okay for a battery powered device, the Panasonic has nowhere near the power of one that works on the mains.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik for kids is powerful, compact, and works on both 220 and 110 volts.</li>
            <li> When she gives a garbled thumbs up - I turn it off and we place to pik towards the drain and turn it back on to drain the tubing effectively.  </li>
            <li> It have helped my gums and periodontal disease and is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> it is a nice product, very compact, has everything we needed for an adult to use.</li>
            <li> Its also fun to use</li>
            <li> Powerful, and too powerful if you use highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is POWERFUL.</li>
            <li> t holds a decent amount of water and s easy to fill and use.</li>
            <li> it is worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Great cheaper and smaller alternative compared to the adult waterpik.</li>
            <li> Still absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> Ok, so i thought that this thing would be better than flossing like the advertisements describe, but not really.</li>
            <li> No matter what you do, water will inevitably end up on your mirror if you&#x27;re trying to do your kids teeth and even your own (you have to manual</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a full size unit that died after several years but we are happy with this one and would not go back to the full size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be nice if Amazon advertised the product and its different tips and features together.  </li>
            <li> It works great, in my opinion the water reservoir is ample, even though it is smaller than the adult size.</li>
            <li> (smile)</li>
            <li> Once the reservoir is turned over, the whole device easily fits in carry-on luggage, yet it&#x27;s practically as large as the full size Waterpik once set up.</li>
            <li> Powerful water force, I use it daily for flossing, particularly with my back teeth holding food and bacteria, wonderful instrument.</li>
            <li> Great price and much cheaper than other stores.  </li>
            <li> The packaged arrived quickly, however, after the first use, it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Main reason this would not be a good choice for kids, especially younger ones.</li>
            <li> It works just as good as the other one.</li>
            <li> (I have braces right now.)  </li>
            <li> Water leaks out unless it is emptied right after use.</li>
            <li> He uses it on the lowest setting, but I use it on the highest and it is just right.</li>
            <li> GROWN UPS RIGHT MAKES</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s corded and plugs right into the wall socket</li>
            <li> Reservoir is just the right</li>
            <li> Great unit, better for your teeth than flossing, fun for kids to use so increases compliance, and smaller footprint than the blue adult one.dult one.</li>
            <li> this style for kids has been a huge benefit for me as i have gotton older and need things easier to use for hand grasp and flexibility.</li>
            <li> Really helps her clean her teeth with braces on.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re ready to clean again you just release the button.  </li>
            <li> At first I had to supervise and explain how to use it properly but they have done the rest on their own.</li>
            <li> be put off by the fact that it&#x27;s for kids, the smaller size is perfect for the average bathroom.</li>
            <li> Works great for little kids with braces!</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s very easy to set up, and although it is smaller than I had anticipated, I like that it is so compact and fits well on my sink.</li>
            <li> Close to being more powerful than the large adult water pic.  </li>
            <li> Does an excellent job of promoting dental hygiene for&lt;br /&gt;much less expense than the larger units.</li>
            <li> Regular tips fit it so it is easy to get the parts.  </li>
            <li> It is really easy to use, not too loud, and the stickers are fun.  </li>
            <li> Great compact waterpik for a small bathroom.</li>
            <li> Several reviews said their kids loved it and spent more time cleaning their teeth.  </li>
            <li> Great flossed for a small space.</li>
            <li> As long as you find a way to encourage your child to use this produst, it is an effective tool to rid their braces of residue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit is not quit as strong (water pressure) as the full sized adult unit, but it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s water basin is larger, it has a lid which holds all of the vaioius attachments it came with, and best of all it has a little button on the handheld part,</li>
            <li> This is a good buy, probably the same as an adult version, so buy this as its cheaper, very powerful, SIMPLE, easy to use, for adults or kids.</li>
            <li> Now, for pulsating water shooting fiercely and going everywhere- even when you have it already in the child&#x27;s mouth, it would be a far more logical and convenient design to be able to stop the water by turning it on or off from the actual water projection wand already in hand</li>
            <li> Smart idea to include them, vendor!  </li>
            <li> As far as the reviews that say these break easily, maybe kids are a lot tougher on these things than I am.</li>
            <li> Easy to use...great for my 9 yr old</li>
            <li> I love how it doesn&#x27;t take up as much room as the adult models do.</li>
            <li> is plenty good enough for an adult and will save you some bucks, but just beware the handle is meant for kid hands and</li>
            <li> Definitely not a replacement for good old fashioned flossing.</li>
            <li> Broke super fast.  </li>
            <li> BTW, you can buy an individual carrying case on its own, anyways, if you really want</li>
            <li> It is also good enough for an adult to use.</li>
            <li> overall a great and simple product for the kids with braces.</li>
            <li> (im an adult) level three is way to easy to make the gums bleed etc.</li>
            <li> If you use this daily, you and your dental hygienist/dentist will be amazed at your next appointment how great your gums will be.  </li>
            <li> She found it easy to use- 8 years old</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a waterflosser, and it was easy to use and left my mouth feeling clean and rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use it, and it works just fine for our adult mouths.</li>
            <li> The water basin is a fine size for an adult.</li>
            <li> This is true in most respects, the pressure is just as good and the basin is plenty big enough to hold enough water for one person&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that the tips don&#x27;t come in different colors so that each member of the family could easily recognize their own.</li>
            <li> I hope it keeps my new implant clean as well.</li>
            <li> It holds more that enough water for me to floss</li>
            <li> Again, the powerful jet is much appreciated by my implants, but the rest is too rickety.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this for me when I couldn&#x27;t find an available adult one for purchase.</li>
            <li> But she is willing to use this waterpik and enjoys using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This water flosser is compact enough for travel and certainly better than the battery operated one I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dealing with the small capacity reservoir by filling it to the top from a glass when it is mounted on the pump and adding more as I irrigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent for kids with braces who are not able to floss regularly.</li>
            <li> got this for myself as I wanted something more than just standard flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;To cover it on the counter, as I have cats that like to get up and investigate open things, I put a shower cap over the top of the water container and the spray head.</li>
            <li> My husband wants some changeable heads now, not that I can blame him!</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m 70</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> So much better than regular flossing</li>
            <li> - therefore you constantly have to wash it out before each use instead of filling it up and using it more then once.  </li>
            <li> (he really wanted it!).</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THE HIGHER POWER SETTINGS.....</li>
            <li> I oil-pull first, then brush my teeth, and then use the Waterpik flosser.  </li>
            <li> At first, it took a bit of getting used to operating the handle because I have severe rheumatoid arthritis in my hands</li>
            <li> DISLIKES- have to put the floor in your mouth first</li>
            <li> The first time my son used it, you would not believe the stuff that came out of his braces.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how well it works, especially since she rushes through cleaning her teeth, but something is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> My son uses it daily - his orthodontist are pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I read reviews and bought these for everyone instead of spending a fortune on a larger one.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that most of the time I have to refill the water container</li>
            <li> It is very efficient and when you are finished it gives you a fresh feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love the product.</li>
            <li> I have my fingers crossed that the next unit will work well without problems, since my kids will need this for a couple more years.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as needed.</li>
            <li> one an orthodontic tip which is exactly what we needed it for.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with small size which delivers big power.  </li>
            <li> I bought this waterpik for me .It is my first .</li>
            <li> It has 3 strength settings and the first time I used it I put it on highest setting because I thought if it is for kids</li>
            <li> I only wish there was a lid on the top of the tank.</li>
            <li> The first time she used it, she said there was a noticable difference, and she now uses the waterflosser twice a day without even being asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it said it does.</li>
            <li> So much better than regular flossing.  </li>
            <li> and we have more than enough for two people.</li>
            <li> She uses it faithfully and it really works to get food out!</li>
            <li> Would recommend this pic to anyone using for the first time.</li>
            <li> They were so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time for a replacement, so I&#x27;m glad I had bought a back-up of the same model.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a Waterpik</li>
            <li> I had to order more attachments because the inside of the one turned completely white.</li>
            <li> too much water pressure does the job!</li>
            <li> And if it isn&#x27;t, you can just simply fill it up some more.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I got my first Waterpik 35 years ago when I had braces.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish it had was a cover for the top where the water goes.  </li>
            <li> Amazon had it at a better price than WalMart at the date of my purchase, and I had 2 extra piks delivered as well since I&#x27;ll be sharing with hubby and one kid.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use it daily and love it.</li>
            <li> I first thought the button on the front of the handle was like a stop/start feature; it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> Which is actually exactly what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Seems to get the hardest spots pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Cute on the outside, junk on the inside.</li>
            <li> thought the smaller one would work for me and it is ok.  </li>
            <li> The larger the hole the more water comes out.</li>
            <li> There are several piks that cost more.</li>
            <li> My daughter has retainers crooked teeth and has a bi lateral cleft lip way better to use than the bristle brushes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect, small enough that you can take it with you when you travel.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll be trying to take good care of it, since our son will be going through braces in a few years himself.  </li>
            <li> but once I messed around with it and became familiar with holding it in different ways, it has turned out to be a great little device.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was very excited about actually getting my kids to floss with a water-flosser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:  I was able to install my old holder with the rotating tip using my remaining new tubing.  </li>
            <li> Great water pressure, holds plenty of water, and takes up less space then the adult Waterpik.</li>
            <li> she cannot really tell the difference, but I spotted this flaw right away.</li>
            <li> You can turn it over but it is so much easier to just keep it right side up.</li>
            <li> Can be used with different voltages and not only for kids very suitable.</li>
            <li> Anyway this little Waterpik is just fine - it has 3 settings and it works great just like the bigger adult one and it cost less and looks good on the counter.</li>
            <li> Its kind of loud and may scare younger ones at first, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> (I see the link to other products, but products need to be compatible; would be nice if somehow you could tell if they are all compatible.)</li>
            <li> strong power and has same effect as the large size home style.&lt;br /&gt;Not just for kids!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the pressure would be strong enough but level 3 is definitely more than enough.</li>
            <li> It makes flossing fun, and is particularly helpful when things get stuck in all the mouth gear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kids styled and cute, also amazing after they have brushed their teeth to see all that&#x27;s left behind that the flosser gets out of their teeth after they thought they had done a good job of brushing.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my Waterpik and decided to try this one because it is smaller and doesn&#x27;t take up as much space on the counter top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a waterpik before, and wasn&#x27;t convinced they were effective enough to invest in an adult version.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the waterpik now as it makes my teeth feel super clean, moreso than just brushing, flossing, &amp; using mouth wash.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and just seems really junky compared to the nicer big ones with lids, also I worry about more germs getting into the basin since it doesn&#x27;t have a lid.</li>
            <li> She is able to turn the product on and off herself and enjoys it so much that she asks to use it multiple times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus it has really helped in getting her teeth and gums clean- better than she did flossing conventionally.  </li>
            <li> Finally getting him to clean his teeth!</li>
            <li> Where it differs is that it only has two tips, one regular and one orthodontic (which may be fine for most people any way), it doesn&#x27;t have a lid on the basin, and it doesn&#x27;t have a button on the handle to stop and start the water flow</li>
            <li> This unit is perfect for a small bathroom, or for those with limited storage space.  </li>
            <li> The other setting are good for an adult.</li>
            <li> Way too powerful on normal setting.</li>
            <li> Or put them on and tell the world to f-off because you&#x27;re an adult and if you want to put cool stickers on your stuff, you&#x27;ll do just that.</li>
            <li> it might feel small for you, but I still think it&#x27;s a good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it seems the hose and handle are not replaceable, I will be ordering a new new one soon as we find it indispensable..</li>
            <li> Like a push down jet is on and let go, jet is off kind of thing.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I think the stickers encouraged her to accept this new gadget as something fun to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy enough to get used to.</li>
            <li> reservoir does come off and is easy to move from sink back to unit</li>
            <li> Its size makes it easy to use and store in my tiny bathroom, it is a breeze to travel with, and it has plenty of power.</li>
            <li> Then 2 months after we bought it, we went on vacation for 2 weeks, making sure to leave it dry - without water in it.  </li>
            <li> is simple and easy operation model.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up half my sink and fits nicely in the corner.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The pics are fragile and ware out easily (3 mo).</li>
            <li> In addition, you get all kinds of tips for it pretty much everywhere, which is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I have limited space and yet wanted one of these as I&#x27;m getting up there in years and want to prevent avoidable heart problems, so I took a chance on this, and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> The difference between this model and the full flosser is that it only goes to a strength of three -- more than enough for both my wife and me.</li>
            <li> but rather I will try the adult version - the orthodontist highly recommends this type of machine to clean her braces, as flossing, brushing, etc., just don&#x27;t fully do the trick.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m the only one in the house who uses it, the one pick is fine.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product is ideal but it was a waste of money since my child will not use it because it is not user friendly.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not one the kids can use on their own without a HUGE mess.</li>
            <li> This is really a great idea and Waterpik is a leader in this field.&lt;br /&gt;However, sadly this is very cheaply made and lasted only about 7mos before dying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can get a little messy but over all this is a great way to teach him the importance of flossing!</li>
            <li> Then I have to press the reservoir down firmly onto the base--something I never had to do with the perfect older version.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Works for whole family.</li>
            <li> I really wish it was on the jet-device itself.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and we had not problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works really well.</li>
            <li> and this is making her life so much easier and cleaner.</li>
            <li> This one works very well, but I miss the ability to twist the pick as I use it.</li>
            <li> The one that I bought this time is meant for children, but I like to use it when I travel as it is dual voltage and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> It does not take up much space in the suitcase.  </li>
            <li> It delivers water stream as powerful as the adult model does.</li>
            <li> VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> the braces b/c it takes so much time.</li>
            <li> and it was too cumbersome and took up too much counter space for my liking.  </li>
            <li> but once you get to be a pro at using it, you don&#x27;t really need that much water to do the job.  </li>
            <li> and I really notice</li>
            <li> That being said, the controls should really be on the flosser itself.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not taking as much space when you&#x27;re not using it.</li>
            <li> (they are really static-cling decals) might encourage her to use it as often as she should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simply fill the tank with water, adjust the dial, and it&#x27;s all ready for use.</li>
            <li> This unit really did it&#x27;s job for about a year.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Used this twice a day for three weeks, and my gums are much improved.  </li>
            <li> absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Much easier with the Waterpik Water Flosser.</li>
            <li> He had plaque buildup that is now gone and his teeth look much whiter.</li>
            <li> He was comfortable with the 3rd, the stronger setting.</li>
            <li> Expected more from a Waterpik product.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel fantastic after using this and almost feels like you&#x27;ve brushed as well.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, it really takes seconds to set up and then 1 minute to floss.</li>
            <li> Thanks everyone else for your reviews as it caused me to get this one.</li>
            <li> Otherwise could be used as a high powered squirt gun in the bathroom!</li>
            <li> and it was very helpful for cleaning her braces.  </li>
            <li> The waterpik designed for adults has the setting up to 10, that would have been too much for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Waterpik!</li>
            <li> My 7yo daughter absolutely puts up a fight about brushing her teeth and flossing.  </li>
            <li> but it took up too much space.</li>
            <li> Much &amp;#34;messier&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really wanted something with power.</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter-top space.</li>
            <li> she doesn&#x27;t use this as much.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re now marking them as dual-voltage capable.</li>
            <li> ones and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> but she seems to have adjusted to it very well.  </li>
            <li> My kids are 14 and 10, and both really like it.</li>
            <li> I genuinely don&#x27;t understand how this product can be used in a sensible manner- especially by a child!!!</li>
            <li> My wife can handle it on &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; but I use the lowest &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting otherwise there&#x27;s too much gore in the sink.</li>
            <li> my choice was &amp;#34;spray all over the bathroom for a week clean&amp;#34;  or &amp;#34;pointlessly let water gently pour into my</li>
            <li> My husband has a bridge in his mouth and he&#x27;s always amazed how much stuff gets flushed out even after flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li> My son uses the brush part and really likes it, it seems to be helping his teeth too.  </li>
            <li> I do follow up and assist her with flossing her teeth, but it has become much easier now.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast with prime.</li>
            <li> It cleans teeth and gums very well.</li>
            <li> It gets their teeth so much cleaner</li>
            <li> and it has worked very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks Waterpik!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My kids teeth are much cleaner.</li>
            <li> My 10-year-old has braces and flossing can be a real challenge.</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is much gentler than the one I used to have.  </li>
            <li> Travels and stores really well</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> It cleans his teeth very well</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and the price was very competitive.</li>
            <li> This machine clears out so much gunk from my child&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> haha....</li>
            <li> My daughter has braces and we have found this to be very helpful.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks for showing me this possibility.</li>
            <li> tank is very small.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was trying to get away with something a bit cheaper for my son, but I really shouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> Mine is SO much easier to use than this kid&#x27;s waterpik!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This was really tricky to get used to.  </li>
            <li> Nice green color.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, they were ready for their own.  </li>
            <li> Actually liked this product but it broke within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to save a few dollars here and there.</li>
            <li> He has become as addicted as I; and his breath is all the more better for it.  </li>
            <li> He has become as addicted as I; and his breath is all the more better for it.  </li>
            <li> Is a bit messy to operate, but it really gets the job done nicely.  </li>
            <li> Works the same as the adult one, it&#x27;s just much more compact.</li>
            <li> Sent it back and got the better Adult Version.</li>
            <li> It holds just enough water for one &amp;#34;lap.&amp;#34; If you have more intricate work to cover, like dental or orthodontic appliances, get the adult version.</li>
            <li> While the water pressure is good - one negative about it is that there isn&#x27;t a lid or cover on it</li>
            <li> I love this as an adult user only.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would be nice is if the on/off switch was actually on the handle.  </li>
            <li> Many waterpiks ago I was able to buy a small one, loved it, but  was unable to find another once it expired.  </li>
            <li> A kids&#x27; machine out to be just simple and user friendly.</li>
            <li> I was wary with the pressure of water going into their mouths because they all gag at the dentist, but they have LOVED this!</li>
            <li> Other than that, we love them.</li>
            <li> But things can get  wet, until my children knew how to use it, they sprayed water all over the place! :)</li>
            <li> I use it more than the other one I have, and I like it</li>
            <li> Very powerful and strong enough for an adult to use with the different settings.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be small enough to take when traveling, and it&#x27;s going to work great.  </li>
            <li> My granddaughter just had braces put on, she is only nine, and needs all the help she can get keeping her teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> My daughter uses this Waterpik about 5 times per week to clean her orthodontic device - an upper pallete spreader.  </li>
            <li> it was full inside of black junk and no way to clean out the spigot.</li>
            <li> This unit holds enough water to clean for one minute.</li>
            <li> He was having difficulties using the flossers he was given, and I was starting to worry that he&#x27;d give up trying to clean between his braces.</li>
            <li> Just like the big one but small and great for travel.</li>
            <li> Nice little flosser for kids!</li>
            <li> First off, the hose is formed pre-coiled, so that it bounces right back into that coiled up shape</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud, but the 2 different attachments work great for my 2 kids, one with braces, one without.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough for an adult to use as well.</li>
            <li> Water Pik his assistant said it might not be strong enough to do the job for an adult.</li>
            <li> And I was pleasanly surprised when I set it up the first time.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s loud, but the kids are the first ones to bed</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an adult, just throw away the stickers. ;)</li>
            <li> We did not buy this through Amazon, but my family gave this exact unit to my Petite 90 year old Mom.  </li>
            <li> This Kids Waterpik works just the same as the big ones and doesn&#x27;t take up as much space on the counter top.  </li>
            <li> My 8 year old really likes using the Waterpik for kids!  </li>
            <li> then pours it into the water chamber as needed (and this is fun also apparently...</li>
            <li> Not enough reservoir for full mouth cleaning,</li>
            <li> What is cool is that it actually gets used.  </li>
            <li> Nice small profile in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> This definitely takes some learning and assistance, and there&#x27;s lots of spraying all around the bathroom (accidental and intentional), but overall has helped to clean teeth, improve breath, and helps him be more independent in oral care.  </li>
            <li> When my children attempted to use the pik there was more water on the mirror or down their chins than in their mouth.  </li>
            <li> The reservoir is still large enough to clean 2 adult mouths, so capacity isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, doesn&#x27;t take up much room, it&#x27;s just as powerful as the adult version, I like the cute decals</li>
            <li> The water pressure is certainly more than enough - I usually use setting 2, setting 1 for more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be shopping for new tips soon because the rest of my family wants to try it too...</li>
            <li> I bought this for a 15 year old girl with braces, and it works really well to deep clean before or after brushing.  </li>
            <li> She is able to get to areas she previously could not.</li>
            <li> Getting my child to floss has not been easy, and I knew it&#x27;d be even harder when we started orthodontia, so we wanted to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> Love the smaller size, holding enough water to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> My old one was a pain in the butter, because I had to manually try and wrap it up neatly so it would fit back in place, which it never did.  </li>
            <li> The sticker on the main unit says it was made in China.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would recommend for future models of this is to put a lid on top of water tank.  </li>
            <li> But that just goes to show that this model not only has longevity, but is rugged enough to appeal to the men in the crowd as well! :)</li>
            <li> Better to just buy the more expensive one from Waterpik.</li>
            <li> not only good for kids, but for some disabled people.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t let them dissuade you for use with an older child.</li>
            <li> The main problem is that the on/off switch is on the machine-</li>
            <li> At some point as I grew older it fell by the wayside</li>
            <li> Most standard waterpiks would take up the entire counter.  </li>
            <li> The water tank fits over the main case when traveling, and it works with 110V and 220V.</li>
            <li> and it really has some good power behind it.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated: Just as powerful as the adult version coupled with a small footprint made this a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Very loud !  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very loud!  </li>
            <li> It was a great price and small, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try rather than buy the adult version after reading several reviews for this model.  </li>
            <li> I like it and my toddler likes it too though she makes a mess :)</li>
            <li> Small footprint, simple, effective, and fun to use.</li>
            <li> Then I have to press the reservoir down firmly onto the base--something I never had to do with the perfect older version.cannot see to line up the tiny circle.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this waterpik for both kids AND adults.</li>
            <li> This one is smaller and more attractive than the others, but the reservoir has no lid on it, and the only way to stop the stream of water is to turn off the unit which is difficult to do when you have the pic in your hand.</li>
            <li> She has high functioning Autism</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this waterpik if your child has braces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone of any age.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll have to check with my father-in-law and see how high the pressure is on his model...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for children with any orthodontic work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for kids.</li>
            <li> This little hummer functions so much better.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a variety of cute little stickers, but I opted to leave it sticker-free.</li>
            <li> and I feel more than a little gaggy trying to get them out of there.</li>
            <li> I love this little Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Compact, very easy to use with little to no mess.  </li>
            <li> But I was surprised at how much water pressure there was.  </li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES it, which has made flossing SOOOO much easier as far as attitudes go.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter used this the whole time she wore braces, it works well.</li>
            <li> He also states that his patients who use a waterpik have consistently healthier teeth, gums and mouth in general than his hard-core</li>
            <li> Nothing is malfunctioning, no leaks and no broken parts, just an extremely loud motor.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 year old to help him with his retainers and he readily took to it.</li>
            <li> wow thanks</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s designed for kids, it&#x27;s powerful enough for adults.</li>
            <li> It would just eliminate contamination from normal lint, dust, germs in the air.</li>
            <li> For your average, healthy mouth, even an adult is well-equipped with this.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much &#x27;debris&#x27; comes out of my mouth after brushing first, then following up with this.  </li>
            <li> Liked it for the short time that we had it, but it is inexcusable to last only 6 months...</li>
            <li> kids love it and use it everyday</li>
            <li> Different pressure settings are useful as well for my son who is learning to use a waterpik.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty loud (hence one star off), although I&#x27;ve heard that almost all models of waterpiks are loud anyways.  </li>
            <li> so when using the tip of the flosser has to be in your tightly closed mouth with one hand on the on/off switch ready to turn it off when your mouth is full of water to spit.  </li>
            <li> I normally use floss</li>
            <li> This is so powerful, I can&#x27;t go to the 3rd speed because my gums would probably feel sore.</li>
            <li> I checked on the waterpik website and found out that the pressure is the same as their adult ones, they only offer one model with more pressure.</li>
            <li> Also I like the green color better.  </li>
            <li> Perfectly powerful smaller Pik.  </li>
            <li> It is also powerful enough for me to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely powerful enough to do the job too.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a small bathroom where it does the same good job</li>
            <li> I bought a different one for my daughter and it was way too powerful for her with no adjustment to pressure, so</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is not only fun to decorate but works excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li> The water power is strong enough and you can gradually increase the pressure from low to high as needed</li>
            <li> Also, it costs less! :)</li>
            <li> It works very well for my 9 year old with new braces.</li>
            <li> It makes my newly &amp;#34;brace-d&amp;#34; kids want to brush and floss- total success.</li>
            <li> It is not as powerful, doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long, and does not hold much water.  </li>
            <li> While the item description says that it was designed especially for kids 6 to 12, I think it&#x27;s strong enough for adults to use as well and even though the description also says that it&#x27;s  colourful</li>
            <li> This one is a nice small size and does the job!</li>
            <li> It works fine so far, same water pressure as my old &#x27;adult&#x27; WaterPik.</li>
            <li> Much to my child&#x27;s delight, our first attempt to use it became an impromptu run-through-the-sprinkler-like experience (this actually isn&#x27;t much of a con, just be aware it might take a little getting used to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oil pulling is very effective for dislodging food debris but even after oil-pulling and brushing, I have found the Waterpik still gets out remaining difficult to budge food bits.</li>
            <li> Even with 31 adult teeth, I don&#x27;t need anywhere near the whole reservoir of water, and I doubt children need nearly that much water.</li>
            <li> However, the unit itself loo&lt;br /&gt;ked fine to me, just a smaller version of my standard unit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is just fine, much smaller, and the only downside is refilling the water to finish.  </li>
            <li> Once a month I run a half of a cap full of bleach mixed in with water to help keep it clean.</li>
            <li> Not very kid friendly.</li>
            <li> The Waterflosser for Kids seems to be the same high quality I remember from my first Waterpik.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 11 and loves her new waterpick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s brand new.</li>
            <li> Would like to try a new one but can no longer return or exchange.</li>
            <li> you can live without those features this kid waterpik</li>
            <li> It is a nuisance I will live with since, after reading some reviews here about premature failures, there is a possibility I might be exercising the two-year warranty anyway</li>
            <li> As a bonus, I&#x27;d just missed my window to return my new paper</li>
            <li> THIS IS A NEW VERSION</li>
            <li> but new i need to do somthing becouse</li>
            <li> I have also found that for some reason the children&#x27;s unit generates a more powerful jet of water than any of their other units, including their most expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Bought for 6 year old son who is very resistant to brushing and sensitive to toothpaste tastes.  </li>
            <li> I owned the adult sized classic version before this</li>
            <li> Smaller version of adult size(better price) and just as powerful.</li>
            <li> Adults may have to reload the water supply 2x, but it is the same powerful unit as the adult versions.....</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that it does not hold that much water</li>
            <li> then I might need the high setting for my adult teeth.</li>
            <li> She has appliances from the orthodontist and was having trouble keeping them clean!</li>
            <li> It clearly says right on the charger 110V/60HZ only.  </li>
            <li> My 9 year old daughter is starting ortho treatment and has an expander right now.</li>
            <li> The tank seems a bit smaller than the adult units but seems just right for us.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and small enough it does not take up too much space.</li>
            <li> Being a teenager, he was a little leery of using a &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; waterpik, but found that using both tips very helpful in keeping his braces clean.  </li>
            <li> My dentist suggested that I get a Waterpik ..and told me to get the most basic model, no bells or whistles as they only added to the cost and weren&#x27;t really necessary.  </li>
            <li> First setting is enough for them.</li>
            <li> Product is pretty low quality and water drips out everywhere.  </li>
            <li> My other Waterpik didn&#x27;t last more then 6 months so hoping this does.</li>
            <li> It piks the same as the other Waterpiks.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t get as many accessories which you don&#x27;t use but cost extra.&lt;br</li>
            <li> sadly it is no longer with me as my former roommate claimed custody of it when he moved out</li>
            <li> My only wish is that the water holder had a lid to keep out dust, other than that I am pleased.</li>
            <li> First there is no way to control the amount of water that comes to your mouth you only have three speeds for pressure but not a way to on and off as needed.</li>
            <li> We just didn&#x27;t put on the stickers it comes with and voila - adult waterpik!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need the larger one taking up precious space in the bathroom, and I don&#x27;t need all the other attachments.</li>
            <li> The footprint is smaller than the other counter-top/plug-in models, which many people like.  </li>
            <li> I will take healthy teeth and gums over messy though!</li>
            <li> I love its small size.</li>
            <li> Adult supervision is necessary because 1) to avoid level 3 because it&#x27;s too hard for the children and 2) avoid water going everywhere but the sink since it&#x27;s easy to have fun and spray the whole counter.</li>
            <li> Would enjoy seeing this offered in other colors, although the green is fine.  </li>
            <li> Easily five stars if the price were just a little lower.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s used it for a few days and it really helps getting his teeth clean and his gums are improving too.  </li>
            <li> The reservoir is just the right size for my small mouth and the settings are adequate for my sensitive gums</li>
            <li> Less space needed on the countertop which was important to me as well.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for children who are not good at or want to use regular dental floss.</li>
            <li> And i bet if my daughter was 8, not 6, she could probably do it on her own; however, given that I still have to floss her teeth and my teeth even after using this, its pointless to actually have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes a huge mess.  </li>
            <li> She learned to live with this handicap fast enough, and having no experience with a rotating head</li>
            <li> Although the handle seemed a bit small at first, I quickly acclimated.  </li>
            <li> Another question I kept having was if the water power would be strong enough and if there were only three settings or if incremental adjustments were possible.</li>
            <li> has High &amp; Low - high hurts even me</li>
            <li> My daughters orthodontist was concerned that her inability to adequately clean her gums was causing them to swell and grow down over her braces.</li>
            <li> The handle might feel smaller in a large adult hand, but I got used to it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use and after a little instruction she was able to operate it herself.  </li>
            <li> and they were EXTREMELY helpful and quick.</li>
            <li> but when it arrived it clearly stated that it must have 110 60Hz power.....</li>
            <li> The only thing is the whole product line has gotten a lot &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; made than the old ones.</li>
            <li> I have a 10 and 13 year old, both with braces.</li>
            <li> I recommend not trying to save $16 or so and buying this instead of the adult version.</li>
            <li> My last one lasted over a decade, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $60 for another, especially since I only use the most basic functions.</li>
            <li> need to close the mouth completely else</li>
            <li> I need to upgrade to an adult model.</li>
            <li> The adult Waterpik does and also has a dial to turn up the water pressure.</li>
            <li> Very helpful with the daily routine of flossing; brushing with braces.  </li>
            <li> The Flosser for Kids are cheaper than the adult&#x27;s Travel size.  </li>
            <li> I like to use the adult one at home around 7 or 8, sometimes 9</li>
            <li> I am a busy mom</li>
            <li> Our adult version of the Waterpik broke (the hose part) and after reading the reviews on this children&#x27;s version we decided to go with this instead.</li>
            <li> Water flow is too harsh for me to feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> My beau has the adult version, but given the price difference I opted for this one instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just enough time to cover both side of your gums once over.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 12 year old daughter who has braces.</li>
            <li> As a disclaimer, I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li> (Kids size) one for my ADULT son for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> (Kids size) one for my ADULT son for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Bought for an adult, not a child after reading reviews.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the look of the blue ones</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to old fashioned flossing.  </li>
            <li> My seven year old daughter has braces (severe crossbite</li>
            <li> , they caught it early) and the orthodontist recommended a waterpick for her, so after doing some research, I decided on this one.</li>
            <li> That surprised me because it would sit on the counter in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old does not like the messiness of this product.</li>
            <li> This thing is still alive and kicking.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of the water flosser for kids, even though I am an adult.</li>
            <li> both my husband and myself and the size is very convenient for travelling and the smaller footprint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult who just got braces.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old son said to leave 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old son who wears an expander and continues to get food stuck in it.  </li>
            <li> So far I have not.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li> Btw, as I wrote below, this thing is extremely LOUD.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace the adult water pik</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I saw no reason to order the adult product to replace the one I had.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 9 year old son.  </li>
            <li> I have the adult version and purchased this for my girls.  </li>
            <li> Some say it is loud,</li>
            <li> We use an adult Waterpik</li>
            <li> I bought this for my five year old grandson.  </li>
            <li> I even use it and my last dentist appointment went very well - no accusatory question from the dental assistant, &amp;#34;Are</li>
            <li> Gift to my 7 year old granddaughter</li>
            <li> I purchased this one instead of the adult version to save some money.</li>
            <li> Not as well designed as the adult version that does not require emptying after each use.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 9 year old who just got a herbst dental appliance.</li>
            <li> but with it being a tad loud, you can here that it is on and that they are using it</li>
            <li> but it has irritated my gums in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> My old water pick died.  </li>
            <li> I got this item for myself based on reviews that said it would also work for an adult.  </li>
            <li> Written by a 13 year old and kid recommended.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old son loves using his Waterpik every night before bed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We bought the adult waterpik for ourselves</li>
            <li> B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] and this one for our almost 8 year old girl.</li>
            <li> hindsight, I would buy this unit for myself as well over the adult unit.</li>
            <li> The reason being is that it is smaller and doesn&#x27;t take up as much room on the counter.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really have the space for a larger one.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for our 7 year old grandson for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Even though I am an adult, I do have a child, so I decided to buy this kids product with the intention of everyone using it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves using this and says it is far easier that flossing</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 10 year old that just got braces.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old needs it for braces and says &amp;</li>
            <li> I called Waterpik directly</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this company&#x27;s response to my complaint.  </li>
            <li> Second, there really needs to be a button on the handle that controls the flow of water.  </li>
            <li> Five year old likes using it.</li>
            <li> Three settings are available, but the first one is pretty lame.  </li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t so loud</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it at least once a day since I received it 3 weeks ago, and continue to be amazed how many food particles that brushing alone misses.  </li>
            <li> I have been using one of these gadgets for going on 40 plus years and have so far avoided gum disease.  </li>
            <li> I am an adult</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my adult self.</li>
            <li> it has sufficient options for an adult.</li>
            <li> My 12 yr old got braces</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 8 year old when he got a palatal expander.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li> 7-yr old daughter just got a spaciator installed in her mouth</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s used it several times and really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a adult, myself.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews to compare the Kids and the Adult version of the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> 9 year old operates it on her own.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> As an adult, I like this model when it works because it&#x27;s compact and has PLENTY of power, even when set below maximum pressure.  </li>
            <li> My 12 year old just got braces.</li>
            <li> purchased this product for my 8 yr old son and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Gimmacky - get the adult version -</li>
            <li> Just leave the stickers off if you&#x27;re an adult.</li>
            <li> - I am an adult</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> Works well for an adult, too.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my 8 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this product, and my kid likes it and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worked to keep my daughter into her teeth- as soon as she&#x27;s done eating, she wants to spray her teeth.</li>
            <li> So much so that in learning to use it on low I accidentally hit my tonsils and popped out a tonsil stone!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Net-net, stick with an adult oral irrigator with an adjustable pressure.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my 8 yr old grandson.</li>
            <li> My 10yo son just got a fixed palate expander, and I was dubious when our doc said get a WaterPik.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my 90 year old mother-in-law.</li>
            <li> Purchase for seven year old grandson</li>
            <li> 8 year old child uses it well after a bit of training with it.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter just LOVES this</li>
            <li> It just has a different color scheme and no travel case, but a much lower price tag.</li>
            <li> Powerful enough for an adult.&lt;br /&gt;The stickers are included, so you can leave the unit blank.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal since you get fresh water each time but still allows dust or whatever to fall into open container.....</li>
            <li> just as powerful as the regular one, and with a smaller footprint.</li>
            <li> green part is open on top</li>
            <li> I owned a number of these Waterpik devices over the years and hate to be without one: Waterpik makes for happy gums and teeth!</li>
            <li> An unexpected bonus is that you can turn the water chamber upside down and it fits easily over the lower container making it an even smaller appliance out on the counter.</li>
            <li> the meantime, I&#x27;ve moved on to greener pastures and purchased a new &amp;#34;Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser.&amp;#34; Hopefully the new water-flosser will last longer.</li>
            <li> small and unobtrusive- easily packed for travel or stowed under a cabinet if needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only wish is that it would have been available in other colors, but that&#x27;s just me, probably.</li>
            <li> it is small and I can travel easily with it.  </li>
            <li> We like that it is small, easy to care for and store on bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s true that the basin holds less water (it&#x27;s for kids,</li>
            <li> i already have the bigger Waterpik system for my older son, but needed another one for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> The water pressure is strong on all settings, and I like that the tank is smaller and takes up less space the the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; ones.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough to be comfortable for a small child on 1.</li>
            <li> I use somewhere around the second setting (you can use it in between, it&#x27;s not three hard and fast settings) and that is plenty strong.</li>
            <li> I love that it is smaller and takes less space than the larger ones, yet has all the power I need.  </li>
            <li> Most of the virtues of the more expensive &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; water picks, at half the price.  </li>
            <li> Lucky I snagged this for less than $30.</li>
            <li> I choose this because its not blue and seemed to be more compact (I have a small bathroom).  </li>
            <li> It provides just enough spray for me, an older person.</li>
            <li> Will order 2 more for other my other grandkids for Christmas.</li>
            <li> First, the white tubing is about a foot or so too short for taller children or ones standing on a stool.  </li>
            <li> Works just as well as my older larger waterpik!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even imagine how a little kid gets a mouth full of squirting water without gagging.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone with gum-disease issues who needs every bit of extra cleaning.</li>
            <li> It does have a wide range though so it can be very gentle as well.</li>
            <li> only difficulty is not being able to stop water flow at the handle (instead having to use the switch on the side of the tank), which can sometimes lead to not having enough hands - one to hold the wand in your mouth, one to switch the machine off and a third to hold the lighweight (nearly empty) unit still</li>
            <li> The color may not be my favorite, and I certainly had no use for the decals, but the smaller size takes up half the counter-top and storage space, and the variable pressure control is the same as on the more expensive full-size models by WaterPik.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a short time but thus far &#x27;really&#x27; like it.  </li>
            <li> The water reservoir is big enough for me and the waterjet powerful enough with the three settings.</li>
            <li> Like other people said, it would be better with the on/off on the actual pik handle, but its not SUCH a big deal to have to turn it off on the unit.  </li>
            <li> only caution is that the green container doesn&#x27;t have a lid, so you use it, rinse it, and then flip it over on the white stand ... not terribly hygienic/sterile.</li>
            <li> Bought this Waterpik unit for my son who recently got braces- its small enough for him to handle comfortably and powerful enough to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you are a first time user.  </li>
            <li> It gets the gunk from between my crown and my next tooth that have always been a tight fit for floss.</li>
            <li> I already have a lot of stuff, all in his space, so this little guy is a real treat: it really saves up space.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much out of this little thing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen that myself, but I can get my daughter to use it, if only briefly.  </li>
            <li> it was supposed to have two tips it only had one, so I had to order another set or send the whole unit back to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The only negative for me is that there is no cover for the top where the water goes.  </li>
            <li> Our family dentist suggested buying this specific water-pik for our son who got braces and said this would be a good substitution for flossing which is difficult to do with braces.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the nozzle handle stays put in it&#x27;s holder (you guessed it; my old one, due to the errant tube, wouldn&#x27;t sit right, ever).  </li>
            <li> My wife and I have been Waterpik users for over 3 years now, and it has improved our dental health exponentially, needless to say we feel no regrets and has no complains about our other more advanced Waterpik product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently took a trip and the small size works out better than the larger one.  </li>
            <li> The small water tank is adequate for any adult to get around their teeth twice inside and out.</li>
            <li> And costs a third less than the full size.  </li>
            <li> Although even without the pause,  my 7 year old is able to use this water pik with little mess.</li>
            <li> My old one had a switch that you had to apply pressure to, causing the whole unit to slide away unless you held it in place with your other hand : |&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The water spray on even the lowest level is just a little too powerful.  </li>
            <li> I have not gone past the middle point of pressure and it seems fine there.  </li>
            <li> Very small footprint and easy to pack for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, this comes with an exceptionally bright green color scheme (green is definitely brighter in person than in the picture, btw) and doesn&#x27;t have a handy-dandy carrying case for other flossing heads, but the unit looks exactly the same and has the same features.  </li>
            <li> Only the most powerful setting had any actual pressure, and even that felt very weak, not like it would actually do any cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All other aspects are positive.</li>
            <li> Since I generally used one setting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough, so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter space, but also powerful enough to remove the plaque.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 8 year old who recently got braces.  </li>
            <li> It works as well as the adult version but its smaller and cheaper.</li>
            <li> The regular adult size (for home use) has a dial from 1 to 10.  </li>
            <li> and this one exceeded my expectations as it was even smaller than my old one.</li>
            <li> My 7year old son uses this water pik daily.</li>
            <li> It performs as well as my old unit (and even though the description says it only has three speeds, it actually has continuously variable speed just like my old one did)</li>
            <li> My 10 yr old daughter tried it for a second and didn&#x27;t like it to use for her braces care.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the open tub, and I can wash it frequently...</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put the decals on it, and you&#x27;ve got a smaller, adult version</li>
            <li> I got my old waterpik out of the closet only to discover it</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like is it seems sort of loud</li>
            <li> I have a 6yr old son, so I thought I could give it to him if I needed something bigger for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And, oh yeah, this kids flosser is cheaper than the adult model in the same size.</li>
            <li> I wished I had purchased the adult one which has a button to press to hold back the water.</li>
            <li> bought this for my 7 year old daughter who just recently got braces.  </li>
            <li> But I do recommend this product, no regrets.</li>
            <li> But I do recommend this product, no regrets</li>
            <li> I think it has the same motor as the adult models...</li>
            <li> you prefer to put your kid in a headlock and use regular old floss, keep that up.</li>
            <li> and I wanted a Waterpik but didn&#x27;t want the big adult version taking up the counter space.  </li>
            <li> and though it does spray all over the place if you are not careful-</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it&#x27;s really loud -</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old son that recently got braces on his bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told this version is the same as the adult, so I bought this kids&#x27; one instead.  </li>
            <li> It does the same job as well as the adult versions, though the water container is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it has a lot smaller container than the adult version which no one seemed to say before I bought it.</li>
            <li> I am an adult and this is the third waterpik I have bought.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this waterpik for adult use, as I noticed the adult versions are much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> some one said there is no top to this true</li>
            <li> /&gt;While its is fun to use and see the junk flow out into the sink, its too much trouble.</li>
            <li> Only problem was learning NOT to try to adjust water flow on handle like previous version ~ that control dislodges the clear tip which allows water to spray all over!&lt;br /&gt;;-)</li>
            <li> It works great for her with less complicated controls.  </li>
            <li> It has just as much power as the adult size one, but takes up much less space on the counter and in my luggage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to use than the adult unit that finally died, smaller so takes up less room, capacity is just right</li>
            <li> I always brush first to eliminate washing any other food or plaque in my mouth back into my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The water flow is too much for a kid at 6 (even for me) - we get pretty wet; and in my opinion - does not clean teeth well.</li>
            <li> and I bought this in knowing she would need a waterpik to help clean those minute spaces in which a toothbrush has a hard time reaching.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I really like my Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a big one with lots of settings, but it wasn&#x27;t as powerful as this little fellow.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned after reading reviews that this model might not be powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> This little machine is very very powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 9 year old has braces and really has trouble brushing around the brackets.  </li>
            <li> but it seems to last enough for me (35 yr. old).</li>
            <li> , the handler is smaller too so for adult users who have used the regular version, you will need to get used to this as well.</li>
            <li> but as good as and less expensive than the adult version.</li>
            <li> The odd-shaped adult one no longer fits in a corner, has multiple attachments, and uses an oval massive reservoir built for three.  </li>
            <li> The water reservoir is big enough for an adult mouth.  </li>
            <li> Its more difficult for a child to angle the stream than adult oral irrigators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied, having used it a few times a day for a few months.</li>
            <li> I hold my head right over the sink to allow the water to run down the drain and try to remember to keep my mouth just open enough to let the water run (not spray out).</li>
            <li> I do prefer the old style press down button to turn the machine on rather than the turning switch of the new style.</li>
            <li> but I tried it myself and it is really hard to clean the teeth with the constant flow of water then</li>
            <li> Another reviewer gave the advice that this children&#x27;s unit was essentially the same as the adult or family units except for smaller size.  </li>
            <li> After first few times of getting used to it, she loves it.  </li>
            <li> First few times, I ran the wand in her mouth so she would know what to do.  </li>
            <li> --fairly powerful, small convenient size.</li>
            <li> I really like how you can turn the water container upside down to use it for storage.</li>
            <li> works OK, a little too small container</li>
            <li> and it made a tremendous difference in the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> The three pressure settings are really powerful for such a small appliance.</li>
            <li> It is a little messy unless I assist them, but better than the crying I used to endure trying to get them to floss the normal way.  </li>
            <li> 7 year old daughter was always curious about using it, and we tried to get her into flossing with very limited success, not only their adult teeth are all scattered around her mouth and mixed with baby teeth, but her mouth is rather small</li>
            <li> It does make a mess, but at least her teeth are clean!</li>
            <li> and I bought this for myself to use because other reviews said it worked the same as the adult version, and was smaller.  </li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve bought a couple other brands of irrigators, including the current adult Waterpik.</li>
            <li> The other bonus is it is $20 cheaper than the 1st adult model.</li>
            <li> Same features, same quality, same water pressure as the adult model, for half the price.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews, this item seemed to be similar enough to the adult model, but half the price, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is a compact water pick that I bought to replace my old one that finally limed up too much (we have horribly hard water!).</li>
            <li> Helps my son get really clean behind braces.</li>
            <li> Initially my 6 year old made a giant mess in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth, and this is just right.</li>
            <li> It holds just enough water and is small enough to fit on a small sink counter</li>
            <li> I previously used the cordless handheld waterpik, and setting #3 on this table-top version is stronger than the highest setting on the hand-held (I actually had to turn it down to #2 for some sensitive areas near the far-back molars.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were both pretty rough with the dental floss (sometimes cutting their gums in an effort to clean them)</li>
            <li> The only con is that the motor is a little loud, but I&#x27;ll deal with that instead of flossing!</li>
            <li> Other than that I highly recommended if you want same performance with a better value, because this is less expensive</li>
            <li> I fill it twice (once for upper and once for lower teeth) to equate capacity of previous adult product.  </li>
            <li> As for power - it is not recommended to use the adult models over half power &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; anyway, so that shouldn&#x27;t be a big concern.</li>
            <li> He states that flossing can drag the crud and bacteria deeper into the gums if not done properly (with a new section of floss for each tooth and not going back down after going up).</li>
            <li> It is small so the footprint does not take too much sink area.</li>
            <li> We like it because it is small and doesn&#x27;t take up too  much room</li>
            <li> only issue is this- be prepared for a wet bathroom the first few times your kids use it!</li>
            <li> It did not take him long to learn how to use it after the initial instruction.</li>
            <li> how long we would actually need it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a second one to take on long work trips.</li>
            <li> , I will see how long this second one lasts!</li>
            <li> The only change I would suggest is the little button on the &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34; like on the adult version.  </li>
            <li> My 9 year old has braces and was really having a tough time flossing.</li>
            <li> I am an adult and have used the \\&quot;adult\\&quot; water pic previously.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a low-cost replacement for my over 30-year-old made in America WaterPik unit that recently got very noisy and then started leaking from the pump seal inside (really!--I used it at least once a day since the 1980s</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking into a water flosser for yourself as an adult, I would suggest that you consider the Kids Flosser, rather than the &#x27;adult&#x27; version, if for nothing else that it&#x27;s easier to store, takes up less space, and costs less to boot.r flosser will take care of.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking into a water flosser for yourself as an adult, I would suggest that you consider the Kids Flosser, rather than the &#x27;adult&#x27; version, if for nothing else that it&#x27;s easier to store, takes up less space, and costs less to boot.</li>
            <li> Enough air room to let the container dry out</li>
            <li> I got myself the kids version because I prefer the kid green over the adult blue.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one because it looks smaller &amp; we have limited space.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other flossing heads, like the plaque-seeker heads and the pocket-pik are compatible, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about being limited to the regular and the &amp;#34;braces&amp;#34; heads included in the package.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself, an adult, because this model is cheaper, takes up less counter space than the adult version, and is green.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a personal matter and whatever thrust you have in your dentist recommending one method above the other.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a personal matter and whatever thrust you have in your dentist recommending one method above the other.</li>
            <li> I debated on whether to get this or the adult sized Waterpik and due to limited finances and limited counter space, I opted to try the Waterflosser for Kids even though I am over 50.</li>
            <li> My little one loves it and it is teaching her to floss at an early age.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and was a little concerned that the pressure might be too soft since it&#x27;s for kids.  </li>
            <li> For the past year (year 4 of use), the squirt pressure on high would peter out to a drip.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even really recommend it for children – the design is just a bit shoddy.</li>
            <li> This is an inconvenient flaw, but still, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Head on the hand unit does not rotate, which makes it awkward to reach inside top teeth.</li>
            <li> When a product has frequent reviews basically saying the same thing, I usually take notice and go on my gut not to buy.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old son finally gets it done everyday!</li>
            <li> I spent only $30 via Amazon</li>
            <li> I have used a waterpik for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Without the decals, it&#x27;s just a green &amp; white waterflosser instead of blue &amp; white.  </li>
            <li> My 7yr old son loves to use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power on 2 for everyday use for an adult.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a minor detail.</li>
            <li> Third there is no way you can help him use because you can&#x27;t see where are you cleaning unless you are prepared for getting all wet.</li>
            <li> The only complain I have is that the head doesn&#x27;t rotate like in our model, so the hose carrying the water under pressure tends to tangle and make my daughter&#x27;s job  a bit harder.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a minor thing, not a deal breaker by any means</li>
            <li> , if the decals aren&#x27;t added, it&#x27;s not loud or childish-looking at all.</li>
            <li> start to life long oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m curious to see what the dentist says on their next visit!</li>
            <li> It gets down deeper into the gumline and in between the teeth, especially around the back teeth.  </li>
            <li> Tired of bulky regular size waterpick  getting bigger and bigger every time they have a new model.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It has 3 settings on it, from very soft to mildly hard (she can use as she grows, currently using setting 1)</li>
            <li> small, takes up very little room on the counter, and the tank can be stored over the motor so no worries about dust.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with a regular tip and one that is like a very tiny brush (I think it&#x27;s for braces) and both really work to remove gunk</li>
            <li> One pic is a standard jet pic, the other has toothbrush like bristles</li>
            <li> container capacity is smaller than other models.</li>
            <li> I usually fill the basin twice per use, but that  takes only an extra second or two.</li>
            <li> little unit is terrific for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;Kids</li>
            <li> The only difference is that the pick does not rotate and the handle is a little bit smaller.  </li>
            <li> You can also purchase others so that other family members can use the same machine.  </li>
            <li> My daughter with the braces uses the orthodontic head and my other daughter uses the regular head.  </li>
            <li> The kids waterpik has plenty of power and is HALF the cost of the other adult models.</li>
            <li> I like that it has 3 different water settings, soft - medium and hard.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my periodontist, and at less than half the cost of the adult version!</li>
            <li> It is a SMALL footprint on our SMALL sink and from time to time my 4 yr old even &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; the mirror for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be a bit messy the first week everyone is learning.</li>
            <li> Even after brushing and flossing with standard floss, you might be surprised at what else is left behind that this water flosser will take care of.  </li>
            <li> It is very messy to use, kids will wet all the bathroom using it and is very loud.</li>
            <li> as well that works fine, but 1 month until failure is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> The Flosser for Kids hold enough water for one use, and the water reservoir fits upside down for packing.  </li>
            <li> Wash the water tank and turn upside down to cover unit.&lt;br /&gt;Small enough for kids</li>
            <li> Sometimes turning the pressure dial down and back up would temporarily increase the pressure.  </li>
            <li> It could have been half the size, is my only complaint/wish.</li>
            <li> This is simply a smaller version of the $50 unit and of course for less cost.  </li>
            <li> After seeing black specs come out of my Mother&#x27;s mouth and then even larger particles</li>
            <li> Keep it empty and dry between uses so that you don&#x27;t wind up with bacteria or odor.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as a smaller less costly replacement for my WP-100.</li>
            <li> A few days ago the hose of the last flosser I purchased in May 2014  started leaking, it was a small hole in the hose, near the handle.</li>
            <li> tried it, and made a giant water mess all over the place</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weak, too much water at once</li>
            <li> We noticed her gum color has changed from dark red (not a good color to have) to a dark pink (much healthier).  </li>
            <li> A little too loud but the little one loves it</li>
            <li> Three years later and this little beauty is still running like a champ...</li>
            <li> small footprint is a major &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; for me.  </li>
            <li> I purchased for my daughter since she has a palate expander put in and is constantly getting little bits of food stuck.  </li>
            <li> old son who wears braces.&lt;br /&gt;Flossing has always been a challenge because his teeth are hard to get to with the braces.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> I bought this for my seven year old granddaughter who was getting bad reviews from her dentist no matter how much she brushed and did not drink soda or eat candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product is okay in my opinion but it is SOOOOOOOO  ugly.</li>
            <li> Neither of which I use (well, the football and peace-sign stickers add some charm/character), but for the price, they could throw in a pink flamingo for all I care.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an innocuous green and white device without them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rheostat, and you can select anywhere along a wide range of pressures.</li>
            <li> It would prevent a lot of tears and wet</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t apply them, the flosser is simply green and white.  </li>
            <li> and I only had to replace the hose a few times.  </li>
            <li> (Any smaller version of anything is always cuter!), and I happen to like green.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only shot the walls with water a few times.  </li>
            <li> Does the job expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I give it three stars is because it went kaput after only a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> Think carefully before buying.</li>
            <li> If I forget to empty it, within 1/2 hour</li>
            <li> Done the job expected.</li>
            <li> The green receptacle holds enough water for two people to use the machine.  </li>
            <li> (Though my dentist told me I should still floss so now I only floss every few days</li>
            <li> I have been fitted for a partial denture and my dentist suggested the Water Pik.</li>
            <li> This KIDS MODEL is the same as the NANO travel model with a few differences.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it can be messy.  </li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t even get the sink or mirror wet.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not certain why.  </li>
            <li> Pressure was like sharp needle painful on healthy gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands and Waterpik models and settled on the current kiddy version, which I&#x27;ve been using for about a year.  </li>
            <li> We rinse it out and let it dry upside down</li>
            <li> Have to return, and get another one from other seller</li>
            <li> so you will need to order additional pics for other family members.</li>
            <li> The only downside I can gather would be the small cup size.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Comes with two water pics which can be exchange out for each other.</li>
            <li> She has a spinning toothbrush, but her mouth is too small for us to floss her properly w/o a dental chair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item because other reviewers said that it is 220V compatible.  </li>
            <li> Other models have an option on the handle that stops the machine so you can spit out water.</li>
            <li> i wonder if there have been any other customer complaints of problems with the hose.</li>
            <li> Just as other customers wrote, this Waterpik is not just for kids.  </li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom with an even smaller shelf area.  </li>
            <li> Other than this feature</li>
            <li> other problem was the pressure level.  </li>
            <li> However, my teenage son (who has braces)said the water chamber would be too small for him and would need to be refilled during use.</li>
            <li> Small enough for a crowded bathroom.</li>
            <li> hopefully it will have pink one!</li>
            <li> Like it because it comes with two different heads and has a small footprint.  </li>
            <li> And no, I am not married to a dentist nor do I know anyone at Waterpik.</li>
            <li> One other note -</li>
            <li> Looked all over and ended up buying this due to price -v-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extra spot for one other pik&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> has ability for one other pik - we are a family of 4&lt;br</li>
            <li> i looked at other piks.</li>
            <li> he thinks its \\&quot;cool\\&quot; i on the other hand am greatful he likes doing this.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> We got this model also because other reviews said that it&#x27;s dual voltage, ie it can be used in Europe, but we havent tested it yet.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, if you don&#x27;t detach the tank after each use, dry it out and put it away inverted, you risk letting dead skin cells and other particulates fall into the tank.</li>
            <li> I guess a waterpick has a learning curve in general, but small kids might need a few days to get used</li>
            <li> My 7 &amp; 9 year olds can operate it with minimal mess.</li>
            <li> She has braces on some of her teeth now, and can&#x27;t use conventional string floss, so I got her this.  </li>
            <li> My youngest has a hard enough time keeping the waterpik head in her mouth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the water reservoir doesn&#x27;t come with a lid.  </li>
            <li> if you are a man or have long fingers you may find it too small.  </li>
            <li> Only negative.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that you cannot leave water in it for extended periods.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same product as the &#x27;adult&#x27; model it seems, just a marketing experiment I suppose; but if you like the green color, go for it, just leave off the silly stickers.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this would be that it doesn&#x27;t have a lid</li>
            <li> The only negative is when I opened it up</li>
            <li> only complaint with this device and</li>
            <li> I already bought a back-up for when mine breaks, but hopefully I&#x27;ll get at least another year out of my current one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She complained of it hurting and was freaked out by occasional bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate most dental floss and with the waterflosser, it gets everything.</li>
            <li> It would be much better if the on/off switch was on the handle portion of the flosser rather than the base, however...</li>
            <li> , so much water sprays out at a time that its impossible to aim it so that the water drips into the sink, instead it bounced off my teeth/mouth and sprayed back out again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went in there after she was done and it looks like she sprayed the bathroom down with a hose.</li>
            <li> Parents, start your kids on this and avoid dental problems down the road.</li>
            <li> Tracking down Waterpik now for a replacement.</li>
            <li> do like the fact that the water basin can be turned upside down when not in use--</li>
            <li> Daughter puts head down towards sink with pik inserted.  </li>
            <li> and you will get water splashed in yoru face and down your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I pushed the lid firmly down, it worked.</li>
            <li> I agree with a lot of the other reviews about water pressure - this thing packs a punch!</li>
            <li> decided to save a little money and see what I thought of this after reading reviews by other adults using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one issue we&#x27;ve had with our daughter is that she has a hard time pressing the water chamber down tight enough on the unit for it to seal.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s annoying that I must use at least so many words!</li>
            <li> i bought this device based on other reviwes and it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This also prevents the tube from getting mold (I think because I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the black mold that others mentioned.)</li>
            <li> It takes up less counter space and performs just as well as the full-size unit.  </li>
            <li> Cost less than anything I could find in a department store.  </li>
            <li> The problem is what looks like BLACK MOLD is coming out of it.</li>
            <li> Got home and flushed boiling water and vinegar through it and all this black mold like stuff came through the spigot.  </li>
            <li> This option takes up less counter space and has an orthodontic head.</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it takes up a lot less space.</li>
            <li> Makes it easier to find all the hidden food.  </li>
            <li> Works as well, but takes up less space and cost less.</li>
            <li> I had the one for adults previously and the hose cracked.  </li>
            <li> I would say this is slightly louder than the handheld cordless version because it may vibrate slightly on the counter, or the pieces themselves may vibrate a bit when on (as supposed to your hand preventing anything from rattling/vibrating when holding the handheld cordless</li>
            <li> speeds are enough, though low is kinda useless</li>
            <li> a previous review, someone mentioned trying to increase the strength without his daughter noticing.</li>
            <li> She is seven and half.</li>
            <li> Not as noisy as some previous reviews have described.</li>
            <li> The previous ones were the ultra ones for adults.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used it to see how it works and even made a mess myself.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Truth be told the &amp;#34;no lid&amp;#34; thing worried me out of the gate as my kids can be liberal with a mess.</li>
            <li> mine make a mess....</li>
            <li> My Daughter (10) just got braces and this does the trick without any mess.</li>
            <li> It does tend to make a mess, but if my kids have a cleaner mouth</li>
            <li> The coiled cord is too tightly wound</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud and the wire connecting the flosser and the base can&#x27;t stretch very far.</li>
            <li> and it does not clean my kids teeth as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> Flip the water reservoir upside down when done and it should fit over the base for storage.  </li>
            <li> If this is black mold or any kind of mold an elderly person could get very sick from this or small child.  </li>
            <li> You do get used to working around this little inconvenience though.</li>
            <li> After a couple practice runs I don&#x27;t have much trouble with making a mess, but I could see it taking a kiddo longer to figure out.</li>
            <li> Those little childrens&#x27; pictures you see on the photo must be applied on the flosser by you, the user.  </li>
            <li> well maybe a little but who cares,</li>
            <li> Based on all the reviews i read i opted to buy this little jewel.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s using it three times a day with water and a little mouthwash in the reservoir.</li>
            <li> We solved this by keeping a little plastic cup in the bathroom</li>
            <li> i use it usually at a little over 2</li>
            <li> and she had a very hard time handling the dental floss or doing a proper job.</li>
            <li> Not very pleased with design.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep your hand from getting wet ...</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it did not work because when I had water in the lid, I did not press down hard enough on the lid when I attached it to the base.</li>
            <li> Honestly not that big of a deal for me, because I would have to refill the cordless handheld flosser at least 4 times for one flossing</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m childish, but I don&#x27;t want to advertise that</li>
            <li> She no longer has trouble getting at food that is stuck &amp;#34;somewhere&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It can get quite messy when you have to reach over to stop the flow and, in the meantime she&#x27;s either spraying everywhere or choking on the water.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look as childish as the picture shows--</li>
            <li> Just a piece of cheap plastic crap soon to fill a landfill.</li>
            <li> I use it and am, well that&#x27;s not important.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> We use this everyday.</li>
            <li> A waste.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s totally dead now.</li>
            <li> I thought he was just being messy with it</li>
            <li> are impatient and want to be done cleaning teeth asap.</li>
            <li> In addition, it doesn&#x27;t have a lid with a compartment in it for a bunch of useless attachments (as the adult one does).</li>
            <li> so I purchased the green one.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, kids can be messy.</li>
            <li> I agree it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I find that it work just grate , And the green tank looks grate.</li>
            <li> Works well,but is messy</li>
            <li> Kids is green color/stickers.</li>
            <li> It is small and the water cup (green on this model) actually flips over and covers the base so it can travel pretty compactly.  </li>
            <li> The green color already matched colors I have in my bathroom</li>
            <li> have not had any trouble with it all</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t put it to a long-term test yet, but we&#x27;ve had it a few weeks, and the hardware seems rugged.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s missing</li>
            <li> she loves using it and cleaning her teeth is so much less stressful!</li>
            <li> And for sanitary reasons I think that&#x27;s odd!</li>
            <li> Regarding pressure, its plenty for me at just past half.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately I have discovered that, just like my old WaterPik finally did after thirty years, this new unit appears to leak from under the base.  </li>
            <li> beats lots of other products designed with complicated (but usually unnecessary) functions and high prices.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thehand-held wand does feel a little small.  </li>
            <li> Be prepared to have a mess in the bathroom though!  </li>
            <li> I have found that the children&#x27;s unit has the same motor as the traveling unit and is a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> works and is less expensive than the regular size!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit is small and doesn&#x27;t appear heavy duty, but it does it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> I eventually learned to snap the full reservoir onto the base without a spill.  </li>
            <li> On the lowest setting, it simply poured out in a sad little stream.  </li>
            <li> This little guy isn&#x27;t just for kids!</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose little hard to control.</li>
            <li> Takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> bought this to replace a battery operator flosser which broke down and would not recharge  this little machine has some power behind it  </li>
            <li> Got this for my lazy son so he can get the food out of his braces.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a flosser with a small footprint</li>
            <li> so hygiene has been a challenge for her in the past.</li>
            <li> No more picks or flossers</li>
            <li> Small footprint.</li>
            <li> Smaller size yet sufficient, none of the useless attachments.</li>
            <li> I have filed a warranty claim and am not sure what will happen.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> she was getting small cavites.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son&#x27;s bathroom and it doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of room on his small counter area.</li>
            <li> NOT OK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space.  </li>
            <li> the one I have been using for the past three years.</li>
            <li> She loves to floss everyday and thinks it is &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> It  has a small footprint</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened there</li>
            <li> I can barely go past 2.5 (the dial is continuous, like a dining room dimmer).  </li>
            <li> Cheaper than the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; ones I&#x27;ve bought in years past.  </li>
            <li> the stickers are pointless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure a kid could handle it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So am not completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> my* waterpik, which is a different model (I&#x27;m sorry I bought it elsewhere and don&#x27;t remember the name of the model)</li>
            <li> this is SO small.  </li>
            <li> Then in the final three months of the fourth year of use, the base began to leak.  </li>
            <li> It fits pretty well onto the protrusion on the base, too.  </li>
            <li> I found this a bit odd and wish i did have a top.&lt;br /&gt;Green, while not the worse color</li>
            <li> After a couple of days, the kids had a method for using the pik over the sink which greatly decreased the mess.</li>
            <li> so they aren&#x27;t 3 hard settings.</li>
            <li> but the dial is hard to turn with one hand, it feels like I&#x27;m drooling and water gets everywhere</li>
            <li> the on/off switch is hard to turn off.</li>
            <li> I used a waxed Oral B floss at least once a day before getting this, but this flushes food particles out from between my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Downside is that I have to refill it at least once.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the pik doesn&#x27;t swivel so it is a bit awkward until you get used to it and position in properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a fanatic for flossing, and</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything fancy but at least a cover.  </li>
            <li> it was clumsy &amp; leaked water.</li>
            <li> Read the negative reviews and note the frequency of those reporting it died, then decide whether you want to risk buying this.</li>
            <li> It calls for using cold water (regular temp)</li>
            <li> but I found that using regular temp water turned out to be too chilly for my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately it does not work as I expected.</li>
            <li> This appears to be a common issue.  </li>
            <li> If I could change one thing, it would be the fact that the &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; switch is on the unit itself, not on the handle itself, but that is the biggest complaint I have.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too late to return this, so I am out my money.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, at least it does the job.  </li>
            <li> The reservoir is difficult to attach securely to the base.  </li>
            <li> or else it pulls the whole base with it.</li>
            <li> When it was up all the way it made my daughter&#x27;s gums bleed so we are working her up slowly.  </li>
            <li> only way to turn the stream of water on and off is at the base, which means my son has to put the water pick in his mouth, with one hand, use his other hand to turn it on and then turn it off without moving the waterpik out of his mouth.  </li>
            <li> The only problem she has is that it keeps falling on her &amp; makes her mad.  </li>
            <li> You know what I mean if you ever tried to teach a kid how to floss.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the jet does not swivel on this unit like it does on other waperpik products.</li>
            <li> This is very small and neat.</li>
            <li> but I bought it for myself because it&#x27;s much less expensive than the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The biggest being the kids model is a lot less expensive than the nano.  </li>
            <li> We bought this because it was less expensive than the others</li>
            <li> The only way to turn off the jet is to find the ergonomic ally small switch on the base and turn it.</li>
            <li> It has a very small footprint approximately 5x6 inches.  </li>
            <li> (flossing with braces is hard!)</li>
            <li> The only negative, in my opinion, is the necessity to turn it on and off at the base instead of at the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed in the smaller reservoir</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and since the orthodontist hasn&#x27;t complained once about his flossing or gums, yay!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately our bathroom is small</li>
            <li> Second the mess you make is horrible, spills everywhere in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> After my dentist said my gums were unhealthy, I bought one of these.</li>
            <li> Definitely get this if you hate flossing.</li>
            <li> although one of the parts was broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First time we used this we had water all over the place and were laughing hysterically at the whole mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Poor design.  </li>
            <li> so it ends up back on the base after it dries.</li>
            <li> I tried to share my water flosser with my son, but he needs a different pressure, and I hate swapping picks for him.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m mad that I wasted the money.</li>
            <li> The tube always splits either at the base or at the handle long before any reservoir or motor malfunction has a chance to occur.</li>
            <li> before her expander my daughter hated flossing and after hated it even more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I assume the base got wet and the electronics fried, but I didn&#x27;t disassemble the thing to check.</li>
            <li> For my grandson who has braces and having a hard time flossing--he loves it!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is quite flawed.</li>
            <li> If this is for a child you can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong.  </li>
            <li> Jakob has become almost obsessed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong at first!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I WAS WRONG</li>
            <li> I am so sorry</li>
            <li> Nothing visibly wrong, not user-serviceable.  </li>
            <li> Sad to see.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I purchased mine</li>
            <li> Those silly stickers are optional.</li>
            <li> Even though the stickers make it difficult to wash.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Boy was she wrong.</li>
            <li> Sad it broke and will be looking into the 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the motor stopped working after 9 months.  </li>
            <li> Very poor design.  </li>
            <li> The worst 60 bucks i&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> You have to reach over to the machine to turn it off every time you need to spit out water, this makes it  especially hard for a child to use.</li>
            <li> Makes for awkward maneuvering.</li>
            <li> It is bad without any quality controls.</li>
            <li> And return policy is bad too.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed mom &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was sadly disappointed, however, in the NOISE</li>
            <li> I was disappointed but called Waterpik&#x27;s customer service</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> think if you have money to spend and have the time, you wont be disappointed with the machine.</li>
            <li> BUT I am upset that I DID NOT RECEIVE MY STICKERS! :(</li>
            <li> I actually hate brushing my teeth (hence the dental work)</li>
            <li> You cannot stop the water flow from the handler, instead you must use the on and off switch that is located on the base</li>
            <li> I was an idiot for not saving the box and receipt.  </li>
            <li> I hate to floss, so this makes things easier</li>
            <li> the minute you turn on the base unit water starts shooting out of the pik.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use very bad to use, kids, very unpleasant shopping experience</li>
            <li> Real disappointing.</li>
            <li> purchased in April of this year  and by end of June it no longer works - very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I WAS WRONG!!!  </li>
            <li> It is the terrible product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s great. Good quality.</li>
            <li> This unit is perfect for a small bathroom, or for those with limited storage space.  It has a very small footprint approximately 5x6 inches.  Even though they label it for &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34;  it is great for anyone with limited space.  It is easy to use and has plenty of power.  It also packs away easily to store.</li>
            <li> Got this for my lazy son so he can get the food out of his braces. He just loves it. Finally getting him to clean his teeth!</li>
            <li> I purchased this waterpik for adult use, as I noticed the adult versions are much more expensive.  I made a very good choice!  The reservoir is just the right size for my small mouth and the settings are adequate for my sensitive gums/teeth.  There are three power settings available, I use the second  most powerful setting which is just perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compact size is excellent for limited counter space and is very easy to store.  I highly recommend this waterpik for both kids AND adults.</li>
            <li> Great water flosser for the kids. I have a 10 and 13 year old, both with braces. They were both so excited to use it, that I bought another, so they each have their own. It&#x27;s small enough, so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter space, but also powerful enough to remove the plaque. The price was reasonable. I would definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> Excelent product, nice price</li>
            <li> My daughter is 11 and loves her new waterpick. Very easy to use and keep clean. Loved the stickers too.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested that I get a Waterpik ..and told me to get the most basic model, no bells or whistles as they only added to the cost and weren&#x27;t really necessary.  So I finally decided on this model, after asking questions on this site.  I have been using it twice a day for over a month and I LOVE it.  I even traveled with it for 2 weeks and it fit into my carryon tote with no problem.  It holds more that enough water for me to floss and I don&#x27;t have to refill it.  Don&#x27;t let the size and lack of features fool you... it does the job and does it well.</li>
            <li> I recommend not trying to save $16 or so and buying this instead of the adult version. It&#x27;s not worth it. I have the regular version and it&#x27;s great. This one is flimsy and there&#x27;s no lid for the water tank area. It tipped over a lot. Great product, but this model isn&#x27;t very easy to use. I wouldn&#x27;t even really recommend it for children – the design is just a bit shoddy.</li>
            <li> it works for two days, and stops working. Have to return, and get another one from other seller</li>
            <li> Great price and much cheaper than other stores.  My little one loves it and it is teaching her to floss at an early age.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to used and my son enjoy flossing now!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My daughter really needs this, and it&#x27;s so easy to tell which one is hers. The stickers are a really fun bonus!</li>
            <li> Perfect solution for my tween daughter with braces.  Only complaint is that the water reservoir doesn&#x27;t come with a lid.  So we have to keep an eye on our pets.</li>
            <li> This was recommended for a child that has braces. It works well for her. A younger child wouldn&#x27;t be able to control it as easily. Water gets everywhere when our 8 year old tries to use it.</li>
            <li> Works well for me and my kids. First setting is enough for them. The other setting are good for an adult. We have multiple tips, so we share it. Works for whole family.</li>
            <li> Nice bright color, cute touch with the stickers. Like the fact we can inverse the watcher container for storage. One thing. The only way to turn off the jet is to find the ergonomic ally small switch on the base and turn it. I really wish it was on the jet-device itself. Like a push down jet is on and let go, jet is off kind of thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Waterpiks since my parents bought one back in the 70&#x27;s. My last one lasted over a decade, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $60 for another, especially since I only use the most basic functions. When this model went on sale, I figured I would try it out. Nice green color. Lower price. And I was pleasanly surprised when I set it up the first time. Same features, same quality, same water pressure as the adult model, for half the price. I am quite satisfied, having used it a few times a day for a few months. As far as the reviews that say these break easily, maybe kids are a lot tougher on these things than I am. I don&#x27;t fully disassemble it after each use. I just leave it snapped together, and use a dedicated cup to refill the reservoir. Lucky I snagged this for less than $30. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I spent only $30 via Amazon and I totally regret wasting my time on the rechargeable.  Although the handle seemed a bit small at first, I quickly acclimated.  It also came with an orthodontic tip and colorful stickers.  Neither of which I use (well, the football and peace-sign stickers add some charm/character), but for the price, they could throw in a pink flamingo for all I care.</li>
            <li> Our 5 kids ranging from 3-14 use this every night and enjoy it.  It works very well and is easy to use.  I just wish it had a cover for when you are not using it so nothing floats in the reservoir. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have limited space and yet wanted one of these as I&#x27;m getting up there in years and want to prevent avoidable heart problems, so I took a chance on this, and I&#x27;m satisfied. Rest assured, the decorations are just stickers, and you needn&#x27;t apply them. It&#x27;s an innocuous green and white device without them. It could have been half the size, is my only complaint/wish. Even with 31 adult teeth, I don&#x27;t need anywhere near the whole reservoir of water, and I doubt children need nearly that much water. The seeming three-setting dial shouldn&#x27;t fool you.It&#x27;s a rheostat, and you can select anywhere along a wide range of pressures. The lowest setting is very mild and the highest setting is so strong I suspect you could pressure wash your driveway with it, if so inclined. It does take a moment to figure out how to use it without spritzing water all over. (For children, I&#x27;m assuming, expect a couple days of needing to mop up after them). Had it for two months now, and it&#x27;s still working like it&#x27;s brand new.</li>
            <li> I had been letting our grandchildren use our waterpik.  After a few weeks, they were ready for their own.  This was cheaper than buying at the local WalMart or Target.  Delivery was fast and we had not problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girls loved putting the stickers on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have to help them, but we&#x27;re using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is not quit as strong (water pressure) as the full sized adult unit, but it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase and would use this seller and product again.</li>
            <li> Easy to use...great for my 9 yr old</li>
            <li> We had bought a full size waterpik waterflosser for Mom and Dad and the kids wanted one as well. They love it they use the pic the tongue cleaner and the toothbrush. The problem now is getting them out of the bathroom!!!</li>
            <li> My son was not getting his teeth as clean as his dentist and orthodontist would like after getting braces.  We have had a couple orthodontist visits for tightening and one normal dentist visit after buying the Waterpik and both commented his gums line and between teeth are much better.  So, he likes using it, and it is working, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> great for braces, keeps teeth clean ad gums healthy.</li>
            <li> Kids love to floss now they have this item. Easy to use and exactly as designed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 and I purchased this waterpik specifically for my ceramic braces. I absolutely love this product.  Although it&#x27;s designed for kids, it&#x27;s powerful enough for adults. Once a month I run a half of a cap full of bleach mixed in with water to help keep it clean.</li>
            <li> For my grandson who has braces and having a hard time flossing--he loves it!!</li>
            <li> Great for kids. Powerful enough for an adult.&lt;br /&gt;The stickers are included, so you can leave the unit blank.</li>
            <li> need to close the mouth completely else the water will spray every where</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s loud, but the kids are the first ones to bed so it hasn&#x27;t mattered.  It&#x27;s very kid-friendly and easy to use.  I wish it was easier to order individual replacement heads...</li>
            <li> Actually liked this product but it broke within a few weeks.  Water pours out of the bottom of the handle leaving no water pressure to &amp;#34;pic&amp;#34; with. It&#x27;s a Shame products are so cheap nowadays. Would like to try a new one but can no longer return or exchange.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more a fordable than one for adults and works great, it has a lot of power, I use power 2 for me, easy to use and easy to clean, love it!!</li>
            <li> For the money I think this product is made rather cheap.  It does the job, but it seems like it will break/crack any minute.</li>
            <li> I Love it! I just wished it had a top for it...</li>
            <li> Perfect for my son with braces. He enjoys using it every night.</li>
            <li> The machine works well, does it&#x27;s job just fine. However, I find that sometimes it is too easy to toggle the nozzle release since it is right under your thumb while you are using the machine. You do get used to working around this little inconvenience though. I do prefer the old style press down button to turn the machine on rather than the turning switch of the new style. Easy enough to get used to.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who just had a pallete expander put in.  It does a good job cleaning in and around that.  Now that we have all figured out how to use it without getting soaked, my husband and I use it regularly as well.</li>
            <li> Great machine just got braces and it worked out great</li>
            <li> Living overseas we are always looking for dual voltage items. This product works really well. It had 3 \\&quot;settings\\&quot; of pressure but it changes while you change the dial so they aren&#x27;t 3 hard settings. It only comes with one pic and another brushing type of pic so you will need to order additional pics for other family members. The resivoir is smaller since it is a kids model but it seems to last enough for me (35 yr. old). As mentioned at the onset of the review... this is a dual voltage unit (110-220v 50/60Hz). I called waterpik prior to purchasing to ask if they had any dual voltage units and they told me this is their only compatible model. The rep. said not to be fooled by the \\&quot;kids\\&quot; aspect of the model since it is still very powerful and I will attest to that.    The bottom of the unit does say 110v and mentions nothing of it&#x27;s dual voltage capability but I called Waterpik again and verified that regardless of the label it is in fact dual voltage.</li>
            <li> My kid loves it and it is also suitable for adults.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be small enough to take when traveling, and it&#x27;s going to work great.  Once the reservoir is turned over, the whole device easily fits in carry-on luggage, yet it&#x27;s practically as large as the full size Waterpik once set up.</li>
            <li> Powerful water force, I use it daily for flossing, particularly with my back teeth holding food and bacteria, wonderful instrument.</li>
            <li> This Waterpik works fantastic.  My daughter just had a palate expander installed and this is making her life so much easier and cleaner.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a 15 year old girl with braces, and it works really well to deep clean before or after brushing.  It&#x27;s a bit on the noisy side, but it only takes a couple of minutes for the water to run out.  My only suggestion would be to have a cover so dust and stuff doesn&#x27;t get into it, since it&#x27;s an open container.</li>
            <li> Bought for 6 year old son who is very resistant to brushing and sensitive to toothpaste tastes.  This definitely takes some learning and assistance, and there&#x27;s lots of spraying all around the bathroom (accidental and intentional), but overall has helped to clean teeth, improve breath, and helps him be more independent in oral care.  Figure he&#x27;ll use it even more as he ages and gets more used to the power.</li>
            <li> I love this water flosser! I usually use it on the first or second setting and it has done wonders for my gums. After my dentist said my gums were unhealthy, I bought one of these. I used this for about 8 or 9 days and the dentist saw noticeable improvement in only a short amount of time. I used a waxed Oral B floss at least once a day before getting this, but this flushes food particles out from between my teeth and gums. I am also better about cleaning my teeth right before bed. Sometimes I put a tiny bit of the amber listerine that another reviewer recommended in the water. This also prevents the tube from getting mold (I think because I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the black mold that others mentioned.) I have no desire to get the more expensive and bigger ones. This one is a nice small size and does the job!</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is the perfect size for a single person.  It takes up less counter space and performs just as well as the full-size unit.  Highly recommended for anyone with gum-disease issues who needs every bit of extra cleaning.</li>
            <li> My daughter got braces this year so we purchased this to help her keep her mouth/teeth clean.  It works great and she enjoys using it.  It&#x27;s a great tool for kids with braces or anyone who enjoys this method for cleaning their teeth!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004Y99EO6 Waterpik Waterflosser for Kids, White]]  This unit is very strong, a far cry from the battery powered models. Unfortunately it is quite flawed. When I place it on \\&quot;stop\\&quot; it keeps dripping (I expect this is specific to my unit). The coiled cord is too tightly wound and therefore it has no usable extension or else it pulls the whole base with it. There is no cover for the reservoir.  I need to upgrade to an adult model. Again, the powerful jet is much appreciated by my implants, but the rest is too rickety. A kids&#x27; machine out to be just simple and user friendly.</li>
            <li> As long as you find a way to encourage your child to use this produst, it is an effective tool to rid their braces of residue.  The stickers were a good beginning.</li>
            <li> Works great and the kids like it.  Would be helpful to have an on/off switch on the handle itself.</li>
            <li> Fantastic gadget!!  My daughter has braces and an expander and this is perfect for her to use.  My water pic was to powerful, but this one has a power adjustment for her to use.  Soo happy I bought this for her.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I lived without this thing.  Got it for the kids, and they seem to like using it.  I use it myself, and it works a lot better than flossing.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this for me when I couldn&#x27;t find an available adult one for purchase. It&#x27;s a much better price and sits perfectly on pedestal sinks.</li>
            <li> I bought it for its color. I am an adult and have used the \\&quot;adult\\&quot; water pic previously. This one works very well, but I miss the ability to twist the pick as I use it. Makes for awkward maneuvering. Kids don&#x27;t have that problem? Otherwise it works great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 8 year old who recently got braces.  It took a week for her to get used to the constant spray but she is a pro now. There is only a switch to turning the water flow and adjust the strength of the flow. I wish there was a button to pause the flow in the handle. It would prevent a lot of tears and wet clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is no lid for the tank. It doesn&#x27;t affect the operation of the unit but I kinda feel ewww about the tank being exposed like that. Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had a great checkup and her gums look great so I can&#x27;t complain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Mom</li>
            <li> works OK, a little too small container</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever, because this product is so awesome!! My 9year old just got braces and this is the best! she loves using it and cleaning her teeth is so much less stressful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice however, this does not come with a cover. The adult Waterpik does and also has a dial to turn up the water pressure.</li>
            <li> Very helpful with the daily routine of flossing; brushing with braces.  Best price around, local stores like Walmart wanted $50 for this same item and wouldn&#x27;t price match amazon.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Cost less than anything I could find in a department store.  Braces cost me enough.  It&#x27;s nice to save a few dollars here and there.</li>
            <li> You should get this. It works as well as the adult version but its smaller and cheaper.</li>
            <li> The water coming out is way to powerful.  When my children attempted to use the pik there was more water on the mirror or down their chins than in their mouth.  We will be going back to dental floss.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!  our son loves his very own waterpik!  :)</li>
            <li> We are Waterpik fans.  Kids love it!  Nice and compact.</li>
            <li> This works as well as any larger unit, with lots of power.  Does an excellent job of promoting dental hygiene for&lt;br /&gt;much less expense than the larger units.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping it was as good as the adult one, and was not disappointed. I haven&#x27;t even been able to use the high setting because it&#x27;s so powerful. It does have a wide range though so it can be very gentle as well. I love how it doesn&#x27;t take up as much room as the adult models do. Downside is that I have to refill it at least once. That really not a big deal though, esp considering how much you save price wise.</li>
            <li> I saw the travel size sold as a set with regular Waterpik at store.  Then, wondered, if the Flosser for Kids are the same size as the Travel size, and has the same power as the one for adults.  So, here&#x27;s my opinion:  The Flosser for Kids are cheaper than the adult&#x27;s Travel size.  The Flosser for Kids hold enough water for one use, and the water reservoir fits upside down for packing.  The dials are different:  The regular adult size (for home use) has a dial from 1 to 10.  I like to use the adult one at home around 7 or 8, sometimes 9 (I have braces right now.)  The Floosser for Kids only have 3 lines on the dial, but the second one or some where between the second and the 3rd line was about the same as around 8 in the Adults.  I&#x27;m happy to be able to take the Flosser for Kids on the road, and not have to miss the one at home.</li>
            <li> It is very challenging to get a three year old to brush her teeth twice a day. But she is willing to use this waterpik and enjoys using it. However, she will be totally soaked after she uses it. But that is fun for her!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I have used a waterpik for a long time.  The one that I bought this time is meant for children, but I like to use it when I travel as it is dual voltage and doesn&#x27;t take up much space. The water reservoir is big enough for me and the waterjet powerful enough with the three settings.</li>
            <li> I have had my Waterpik for two weeks now and it feels so good on my gums and my teeth already look cleaner. I am a busy mom and I bought this because I just wasn&#x27;t flossing like I should, so it&#x27;s nice to have an alternative (plus I&#x27;ve never said &amp;#34;Hey I just flossed and my gums feel great now&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is small and doesn&#x27;t appear heavy duty, but it does it&#x27;s job well. I use somewhere around the second setting (you can use it in between, it&#x27;s not three hard and fast settings) and that is plenty strong. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of counterspace (maybe about 4x6 inches or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the Waterpik I like to use about 1/4 hydrogen peroxide (you could also use a mouthwash if you want, just check that it doesn&#x27;t have bleach or iodine) and fill the rest with warm to hot tap water. I hold my head right over the sink to allow the water to run down the drain and try to remember to keep my mouth just open enough to let the water run (not spray out). After a couple practice runs I don&#x27;t have much trouble with making a mess, but I could see it taking a kiddo longer to figure out.</li>
            <li> This one is smaller and more attractive than the others, but the reservoir has no lid on it, and the only way to stop the stream of water is to turn off the unit which is difficult to do when you have the pic in your hand. So then water ends up squirting everywhere while you&#x27;re trying to find the power switch. Not an easy task for a kid.</li>
            <li> This kid-size waterpik is great for kids and also mature travelers.  It does not take up much space in the suitcase.  It delivers water stream as powerful as the adult model does.</li>
            <li> Our adult version of the Waterpik broke (the hose part) and after reading the reviews on this children&#x27;s version we decided to go with this instead. It is more compact and cheaper and from what I read just as good as the adult version. This is true in most respects, the pressure is just as good and the basin is plenty big enough to hold enough water for one person&#x27;s needs. Where it differs is that it only has two tips, one regular and one orthodontic (which may be fine for most people any way), it doesn&#x27;t have a lid on the basin, and it doesn&#x27;t have a button on the handle to stop and start the water flow (so once you turn the power on you need to be sure the tip is in your mouth).&lt;br /&gt;If you can live without those features this kid waterpik is plenty good enough for an adult and will save you some bucks, but just beware the handle is meant for kid hands and if you are a man or have long fingers you may find it too small.  If this is for a child you can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I&#x27;ve had a big one with lots of settings, but it wasn&#x27;t as powerful as this little fellow.</li>
            <li> Water flow is too harsh for me to feel comfortable using it. I wanted a light stream and even the lower setting on this is too much for me</li>
            <li> I was looking for a flosser with a small footprint and this one exceeded my expectations as it was even smaller than my old one. It has a variable setting ranging from 1-3 for pressure. For me, it worked best on 2 but I would go lower for children. The small water tank is adequate for any adult to get around their teeth twice inside and out. My only complaint is that the pik doesn&#x27;t swivel so it is a bit awkward until you get used to it and position in properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This water flosser is compact enough for travel and certainly better than the battery operated one I have. I am thinking of buying a second one just for travel.</li>
            <li> My 7year old son uses this water pik daily. It&#x27;s great for after snacks like Wheat Thins or Oreos it flushes most of the impacted food out and makes for better brushing afterwards.  The only additional feature that I would of liked on this model is the pause button so he can pause the spray. Although even without the pause,  my 7 year old is able to use this water pik with little mess.</li>
            <li> My 5 years old kid can use this water flosser on his own. Work well! We like it and it&#x27;s compact enough for the space we have.</li>
            <li> My beau has the adult version, but given the price difference I opted for this one instead. not much difference in pressure, though it&#x27;s marked differently. The only real difference is the size of the reservoir, but filling it twice works perfectly well.</li>
            <li> My daughter just got her braces and this is perfect for her.  Easy to use and clean and she loved it came with removable stickers she can switch out whenever she wants.  Just as described.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandchildren for Christmas.  My granddaughter just had braces put on, she is only nine, and needs all the help she can get keeping her teeth clean.  This Waterpik Waterflosser makes it fun for my grand children to brush and floss their teeth.  It&#x27;s kids styled and cute, also amazing after they have brushed their teeth to see all that&#x27;s left behind that the flosser gets out of their teeth after they thought they had done a good job of brushing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I travel internationally and Waterpik&#x27;s Waterflosser for Kids can be used internationally with only an adaptor plug for the country of travel.  Those little childrens&#x27; pictures you see on the photo must be applied on the flosser by you, the user.  If you don&#x27;t apply them, the flosser is simply green and white.  Delighted that I bought this item.  The three water pressures and size of the water container are just perfect for an adult!</li>
            <li> I shopped for a waterpik in the store and online. This was the best buy for the money. It is for me not any children but I don&#x27;t care about the color. It came in a timely manner and not complaints about shipping.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for kids. Must have.</li>
            <li> I understand the value of marketing towards kids (including those with braces), but don&#x27;t be discouraged.  This is simply a smaller version of the $50 unit and of course for less cost.  Never had a need for the tongue cleaner.  I had the larger model for 5 years before the tubing collapsed inside the handle, basically making the button that was to stop the output spray, to being the only button that would make it spray at a very low volume.  In any case, this is a great product!  The highest level has ample strength.  The only downside I can gather would be the small cup size.  Only holds 16 oz, to which they claim is used within 60 seconds.  It&#x27;s really just enough time to cover both side of your gums once over.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a low-cost replacement for my over 30-year-old made in America WaterPik unit that recently got very noisy and then started leaking from the pump seal inside (really!--I used it at least once a day since the 1980s and I only had to replace the hose a few times.  Back then I telephoned the supplier for the hose that Teledyne customer service in Colorado referred me and a guy sent me about 15 feet for no charge!)  Another reviewer gave the advice that this children&#x27;s unit was essentially the same as the adult or family units except for smaller size.  I found that to be true. It performs as well as my old unit (and even though the description says it only has three speeds, it actually has continuously variable speed just like my old one did) but I am disappointed in the smaller reservoir (it runs out at my high pressure setting and the methodical pausing between each tooth) and it lacks one very good feature of my old one, and that was the ability to turn the nozzle in the holder as I was using it in my mouth.  This one locks the position and I have to twist the holder in something of a contorted way when I move about the teeth on each side.  I&#x27;m dealing with the small capacity reservoir by filling it to the top from a glass when it is mounted on the pump and adding more as I irrigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I was able to install my old holder with the rotating tip using my remaining new tubing.  It fits pretty well onto the protrusion on the base, too.  But unfortunately I have discovered that, just like my old WaterPik finally did after thirty years, this new unit appears to leak from under the base.  Even before I switched the holder I noticed a puddle of water when I lift the unit up after each use.  It is a nuisance I will live with since, after reading some reviews here about premature failures, there is a possibility I might be exercising the two-year warranty anyway and I&#x27;ll have to pay for return shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought the waterpik for my 6 year old daughter under the dentist´s recomendation and tried it myself to see how it works, it´s a great option for flossing! Will definitley buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> WORKS VERY WELL. AS GOOD AS MY FULL SIZE.  IT DOES NOT HAVE A TOP.</li>
            <li> Excellent for kids with braces who are not able to floss regularly. Gets all the gunk out!</li>
            <li> Kids love it!  Helps my son get really clean behind braces.</li>
            <li> My daughter just got braces. She has high functioning Autism so hygiene has been a challenge for her in the past. This is great. Easy to use, kid sized, she can do it by herself (which makes my life easier), and her oral hygiene is much improved. Love this product.</li>
            <li> The Kids versions it great for adults and half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for myself as I wanted something more than just standard flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Stickers shows in amazon image are not affixed to the unit so you can just toss them aside.&lt;br /&gt;Pump is very strong, I use this on ~2.5 out of 3 power setting. More than enough for most adults&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir does come off and is easy to move from sink back to unit&lt;br /&gt;Comes with two water pics which can be exchange out for each other. One pic is a standard jet pic, the other has toothbrush like bristles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not come with a top for water reservoir. I found this a bit odd and wish i did have a top.&lt;br /&gt;Green, while not the worse color it is also not the best.</li>
            <li> The size of this unit is perfect to keep on my bathroom counter.  Also, I use it to irrigate my nasal passages and it perfect for that.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has a crown and hates flossing.  The water spray on even the lowest level is just a little too powerful.  It makes a huge mess.  Also, it would be nice if there was a button so that you could control when it sprayed.</li>
            <li> Very good water pik.  Love the smaller size, holding enough water to get the job done.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made not cheapy just cause its cute...it makes it fun not a chore to clean my daughters braces..&lt;br /&gt;and so she does so twice daily religiously...we love it</li>
            <li> My kids cried every night we would floss. We tried a variety of floss, flossers, holders, etc.&lt;br /&gt;They loves this. I was wary with the pressure of water going into their mouths because they all gag at the dentist, but they have LOVED this! It is a SMALL footprint on our SMALL sink and from time to time my 4 yr old even &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; the mirror for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be a bit messy the first week everyone is learning. Just bring in towels for the floor and faces and everyone will be fine.</li>
            <li> This works great for improving the health of your gums.  My daughters orthodontist was concerned that her inability to adequately clean her gums was causing them to swell and grow down over her braces. After a couple of weeks of using this, they returned to normal healthy gums.</li>
            <li> Product is pretty low quality and water drips out everywhere.  Not very kid friendly.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 12 year old daughter who has braces. Dentist has been complaining about her gums being swollen b/c she&#x27;s not flossing. She hates flossing w/the braces b/c it takes so much time. Read the great reviews about this water pik and so far she loves it and uses it. Nice control switch for stronger water pressure so she can increase as her gums heal.  2 attachments and 1 is specifically to use with braces. The only thing I would change is to have a cover over the water reservoir. Not a big deal since you get fresh water each time but still allows dust or whatever to fall into open container.....otherwise great product!</li>
            <li> Works great for little kids with braces!</li>
            <li> As a disclaimer, I&#x27;m an adult and I purchased this for myself, so my review is based on the perspective of a grown up using the Waterpik Water Flosser For Kids (WP-260).  I owned the adult sized classic version before this and it was too cumbersome and took up too much counter space for my liking.  Plus, the spray nozzle button quit working after a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comes the Flosser for Kids!  Smaller, cuter (Any smaller version of anything is always cuter!), and I happen to like green.  This little hummer functions so much better.  First off, the hose is formed pre-coiled, so that it bounces right back into that coiled up shape you see in the picture when you&#x27;re done, and fits perfectly into the area provided to contain it.  My old one was a pain in the butter, because I had to manually try and wrap it up neatly so it would fit back in place, which it never did.  Secondly, the nozzle handle stays put in it&#x27;s holder (you guessed it; my old one, due to the errant tube, wouldn&#x27;t sit right, ever).  I like the on/off dial that you just turn.  My old one had a switch that you had to apply pressure to, causing the whole unit to slide away unless you held it in place with your other hand : |&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it&#x27;s true that the basin holds less water (it&#x27;s for kids, c&#x27;mon), but once you get to be a pro at using it, you don&#x27;t really need that much water to do the job.  And, if you really do, well then, you just add more water!  Easy peasy.  The spray pressure is adjustable, and you can temporarily stop the flow of the spray with the button on the nozzle.  Plus, there&#x27;s an additional attachment with bristles, although I&#x27;ve never used it. It comes with a variety of cute little stickers, but I opted to leave it sticker-free. (I&#x27;m childish, but I don&#x27;t want to advertise that fact.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fanatic for flossing, and this is a great tool to add to your dental hygiene regime.  Even after brushing and flossing with standard floss, you might be surprised at what else is left behind that this water flosser will take care of.  I love mine so much that I purchased another (Kids size) one for my ADULT son for Christmas.  He has become as addicted as I; and his breath is all the more better for it.  If you&#x27;re looking into a water flosser for yourself as an adult, I would suggest that you consider the Kids Flosser, rather than the &#x27;adult&#x27; version, if for nothing else that it&#x27;s easier to store, takes up less space, and costs less to boot.r flosser will take care of.

            <li> Used 2 or 3 times a week for 5 months and quit.  You can&#x27;t return it after 30 days.  I took a voltmeter to the internals and found that the AC/DC converter that drives the pump motor with a 12 volt DC signal has no output.  It has a sticker saying it was made in China.  The sticker on the main unit says it was made in China.</li>
            <li> Relatively compact and works great for adults, and the stickers are optional.</li>
            <li> Bought for an adult, not a child after reading reviews. This thing is awesome, it&#x27;s nice and compact and holds enough water to rinse out my teeth quite well. I&#x27;m very much pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To cover it on the counter, as I have cats that like to get up and investigate open things, I put a shower cap over the top of the water container and the spray head. Works nicely. Just remove to use and then place back on afterward. Enough air room to let the container dry out so no mold will form, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find 2 is a good setting and works quite nicely for my mouth. It gets the gunk from between my crown and my next tooth that have always been a tight fit for floss. My husband wants some changeable heads now, not that I can blame him! May be ordering those soon enough.</li>
            <li> Is a bit messy to operate, but it really gets the job done nicely.  The stickers and color make my daughter interested in using this to clean her orthodontic appliances.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a kid, but I needed a waterpik because I have some dental work.  I choose this because its not blue and seemed to be more compact (I have a small bathroom).  Like other people said, it would be better with the on/off on the actual pik handle, but its not SUCH a big deal to have to turn it off on the unit.  I really don&#x27;t like the look of the blue ones, this is cuter and I&#x27;m happy with it.  I have not gone past the middle point of pressure and it seems fine there.  I actually hate brushing my teeth (hence the dental work) but this thing is fun to use, I wish this counted as brushing too!  I do 2 fills top and bottom and I really notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note* the stickers are really a clingfilm so you can change them, the butterfly, dragonfly and turtle are cute, not as many \\&quot;girl\\&quot; ones as I would have liked though.</li>
            <li> Great compact waterpik for a small bathroom.</li>
            <li> Cleans fantastic.  Granddaughter has braces and she loves it!  Good price for the service it provides, much better than dental floss!</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and was a little concerned that the pressure might be too soft since it&#x27;s for kids.  But I was surprised at how much water pressure there was.  It&#x27;s definitely plenty to get the job done and the set-up is nice and compact so I can leave it on the counter.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this.</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to old fashioned flossing.  This little baby is awesome!  Last cleaning at the dentist the hygienist said she was amazed at how clean my teeth were!</li>
            <li> It works very well for my 9 year old with new braces. She no longer has trouble getting at food that is stuck &amp;#34;somewhere&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The product is good and economical. My daughter LOVES it, which has made flossing SOOOO much easier as far as attitudes go. That being said, the controls should really be on the flosser itself. It can get quite messy when you have to reach over to stop the flow and, in the meantime she&#x27;s either spraying everywhere or choking on the water. With this little adjustment, this would be the absolutely best product, as it has helped my daughter&#x27;s dental hygiene tremendously.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has a heart condition so good oral hygiene is important for her.  She has a spinning toothbrush, but her mouth is too small for us to floss her properly w/o a dental chair.  She does not like to floss either.  When we saw the kids waterpik and read some reviews we thought we would give it a try.  After first few times of getting used to it, she loves it.  First few times, I ran the wand in her mouth so she would know what to do.  She likes to use it and said it makes her teeth feel clean.  We noticed her gum color has changed from dark red (not a good color to have) to a dark pink (much healthier).  We are still coaching her to use it on the inside of her teeth.  We&#x27;ve only shot the walls with water a few times.  It has 3 settings and she still prefers the lowest setting.  She knows when I try to sneak to the second setting.  To show your kids the impact of cleaning it has, be sure to have them use it after they eat popcorn and watch all the stuff that falls into the sink.</li>
            <li> A little too loud but the little one loves it</li>
            <li> purchased in April of this year  and by end of June it no longer works - very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works the same as the adult one, it&#x27;s just much more compact. I originally thought that the lack of a lid on the tub part of the flosser wouldn&#x27;t be great, but you can store it upside down and snap it onto the bottom part of the flosser so it&#x27;s not taking as much space when you&#x27;re not using it. The stickers don&#x27;t come on the product so it doesn&#x27;t look as childish as the picture shows--great product for adults too!</li>
            <li> This is a great value. If you&#x27;re an adult, just throw away the stickers. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caution is that the green container doesn&#x27;t have a lid, so you use it, rinse it, and then flip it over on the white stand ... not terribly hygienic/sterile.</li>
            <li> My kids (ages 8 &amp; 10) love this and it has encouraged them to floss. It&#x27;s easy to use and they can do it all by themselves.</li>
            <li> My seven year old daughter has braces (severe crossbite, they caught it early) and the orthodontist recommended a waterpick for her, so after doing some research, I decided on this one. It&#x27;s a little more compact than some of the markets, plus the bright color and the stickers (they are really static-cling decals) might encourage her to use it as often as she should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply fill the tank with water, adjust the dial, and it&#x27;s all ready for use. It&#x27;s easy enough for her to operate, and really does a good job at getting her teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is this- be prepared for a wet bathroom the first few times your kids use it! I went in there after she was done and it looks like she sprayed the bathroom down with a hose. I guess a waterpick has a learning curve in general, but small kids might need a few days to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the sprayed walls and mirrors, if this will help maintain my daughter&#x27;s dental health, it&#x27;s all worth it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and kid friendly buttons.  Does the job expected.</li>
            <li> My son loves this water flosser!  It&#x27;s just what he needs for his braces.  We like that it is easy to use without too many settings or accessories.  In this case, simple really is better!</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself, an adult, because this model is cheaper, takes up less counter space than the adult version, and is green. The reservoir is still large enough to clean 2 adult mouths, so capacity isn&#x27;t an issue. I wish a way to turn off the water on the handle in addition to the switch on the side of the unit. Adjustable pressure is nice. Comes with 2 attachments so you can share with someone else.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this Waterpik about 5 times per week to clean her orthodontic device - an upper pallete spreader.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has children 7-12 tasked with cleaning around braces or pallet spreading devices.  It is strong enough to do the job effectively, easy to operate and maintainance free.  The spray heads are interchangeable for multiple users.  My child uses two tanks of warm water per cleaning.</li>
            <li> We did not buy this through Amazon, but my family gave this exact unit to my Petite 90 year old Mom.  This unit really did it&#x27;s job for about a year.  Yes it is noisy, so noisy my Mother can&#x27;t hear anything else when using it, but that is not problematic for us.  The problem is what looks like BLACK MOLD is coming out of it. After seeing black specs come out of my Mother&#x27;s mouth and then even larger particles I got alarmed. Took her to the dentist and ENT Drs. Nothing wrong.  Got home and flushed boiling water and vinegar through it and all this black mold like stuff came through the spigot.  Looking into the spigot it was full inside of black junk and no way to clean out the spigot. Very poor design.  Trash time. If this is black mold or any kind of mold an elderly person could get very sick from this or small child.  I would not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up:  we called the manufacturer.  They sent us a replacement spigot for free. After each use we run vinegar through it to clean it out. We then shake the hand set repeatedly to get any water out. I watch this thing like a hawk for the mold to return. It does a great job for gingivitis, but someone needs to fix the design.</li>
            <li> it works good even for adult</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Waterpiks for years and they do a very good job of cleaning debris out and keeping my gums in good condition.  This Kids Waterpik works just the same as the big ones and doesn&#x27;t take up as much space on the counter top.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Way too powerful on normal setting. Pressure was like sharp needle painful on healthy gums. My 10 yr old daughter tried it for a second and didn&#x27;t like it to use for her braces care. No thumb or finger control on tip to stop water flow. Very loud !  Sent it back and got the better Adult Version. It&#x27;s great an MUCH quieter...tip has control to turn water on and off.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m 70 and I&#x27;ve been through plenty of waterpiks, the sole user in our home.  Many waterpiks ago I was able to buy a small one, loved it, but  was unable to find another once it expired.  So I&#x27;ve gone through many additional full-sized ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model has been in operation here for only a month.  The smaller space it occupies is welcomed.  The water capacity is fine.  The highest setting for the jet stream is more than I need.  The handle might feel smaller in a large adult hand, but I got used to it.  I passed on decorating it with the stickers supplied by the manufacturer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the connection at the two ends of the tubing lasts longer than it does on the family size models.  That&#x27;s the Achilles heel of waterpiks.  The tube always splits either at the base or at the handle long before any reservoir or motor malfunction has a chance to occur.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because other reviewers said that it is 220V compatible.  The item that I received was not.  It clearly says right on the charger 110V/60HZ only.  I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it is a good product or not.  I had to return it.</li>
            <li> It works for me, a retiree.  Who can tell me this device is operable both on 120V and 240V?  I inquired, but never got the answer from Waterpik, the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for me because my water pick died only after two years. This time I decided I didn&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars for one and so I was very excited to see this one.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything fancy but at least a cover.  Well,  it doesn&#x27;t have a cover nor a pause  button. I can&#x27;t even imagine how a little kid gets a mouth full of squirting water without gagging.</li>
            <li> I do not like how once this is turned on there is no on/off option on the handle. You have to reach over to the machine to turn it off every time you need to spit out water, this makes it  especially hard for a child to use. Other models have an option on the handle that stops the machine so you can spit out water.</li>
            <li> Wish it had holders for more than one kid in the family.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Shipped on time.</li>
            <li> I have not been a kid for some 60 years, but this Waterpik kid&#x27;s model works great for me.  Dentist told me I had to strengthen my gums before he could do bonding repair.  Used this twice a day for three weeks, and my gums are much improved.  So much better than regular flossing - wish I&#x27;d used this years ago.  I have no use for the orthodontic tip, but regular tip works fine for me, and the pressure is just as strong as the pricey deluxe adult models.  Without the decals, it&#x27;s just a green &amp; white waterflosser instead of blue &amp; white.  Parents, start your kids on this and avoid dental problems down the road.</li>
            <li> This works great for her braces. She is 7 and can use this by herself with great results.</li>
            <li> Bought this in March, thought it was good--fairly powerful, small convenient size. Last week it just stopped working. Period. No problems with plug or wires. Just a piece of cheap plastic crap soon to fill a landfill. Ugh.</li>
            <li> perfect for my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it ! Stickers added to personalize</li>
            <li> This is a great water pick for my daughter who is 8. She has appliances from the orthodontist and was having trouble keeping them clean! Great cost!</li>
            <li> No lid for the water? That surprised me because it would sit on the counter in the bathroom. My 6 year old does not like the messiness of this product. A friend recommended a water floss product for my child since she had some dental work and to keep up with cavity prone teeth. I am not sure if this product is ideal but it was a waste of money since my child will not use it because it is not user friendly. Disappointed mom &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 yr. old son who wears braces.&lt;br /&gt;Flossing has always been a challenge because his teeth are hard to get to with the braces.&lt;br /&gt;However since this purchase, he uses it twice a day (more if he could take it to school).&lt;br /&gt;He absolutely loves it. The waterpik gets rid of food between the teeth &amp; braces.</li>
            <li> Great water pressure, holds plenty of water, and takes up less space then the adult Waterpik. My other Waterpik didn&#x27;t last more then 6 months so hoping this does. I add a cap of Listerine Zero to the water and follow with brushing. Nice clean feeling!</li>
            <li> Works great and not just for kids. My kids use it and my wife liked it so much she bought another one for herself.</li>
            <li> Works great!!!! Totally will recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Did not take it with us on vacation and noticed a difference in cleaning teeth with braces.  Much easier with the Waterpik Water Flosser.</li>
            <li> Nice to be using one again.  The mouth is cleaner as a result.  And it&#x27;s annoying that I must use at least so many words!</li>
            <li> My 7yr old son loves to use this everyday. Very powerful and strong enough for an adult to use with the different settings.</li>
            <li> Smaller version of adult size(better price) and just as powerful.Handle is smaller but easier to work and use in my mouth.. I had hand held chargeable but they don&#x27;t  last.I like this much better and easy to use</li>
            <li> I ordered this one and returned it because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast with the regular version: Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The &amp;#34;for kids&amp;#34; version has no cover to cover the water cup. I think Waterpik should design all their water flosser to include a cover for the water cup.&lt;br /&gt;2. You cannot stop the water flow from the handler, instead you must use the on and off switch that is located on the base unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the handler is smaller too so for adult users who have used the regular version, you will need to get used to this as well.</li>
            <li> This items worked great for my 5 &amp; 7 yr old daughters to floss their teeth without fear of the normal tape floss.  It is a little messy unless I assist them, but better than the crying I used to endure trying to get them to floss the normal way.  Only thing I would recommend for future models of this is to put a lid on top of water tank.  It would just eliminate contamination from normal lint, dust, germs in the air.</li>
            <li> Nice little flosser for kids! However, the things I don&#x27;t like about it, is that it doesn&#x27;t have a lid to it. So, you have to wash it out every time you use it because there could be a lot of bathroom bacteria inside the cup that you don&#x27;t want in your child&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this and she&#x27;s 5.  I use it and am, well that&#x27;s not important.  It has three power settings and 3 hurts!  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is you have to have it in your mouth before turning it on, there should be a switch to activate it on the handle.  We had much fun with water spraying everywhere while trying to learn to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Update- 10/03/2017 This thing is still alive and kicking. My daughter is 9 and still uses it. Her dentist finds her teeth and gums very healthy. My dentist gives me a clean bill of health, as well.</li>
            <li> I wish this had a lid.  Anything can fall in the top of it.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I highly recommend this waterpik if your child has braces. My daughter uses this waterpik twice a day and it made a tremendous difference in the hard to reach areas. Her swollen gums quickly went down after using w/ warm water for two weeks!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well.  No more picks or flossers this is it</li>
            <li> Small footprint. Plenty of power on 2 for everyday use for an adult. Gentle enough to be comfortable for a small child on 1. Take a deep breath before you use 3. For your average, healthy mouth, even an adult is well-equipped with this. It holds just enough water for one &amp;#34;lap.&amp;#34; If you have more intricate work to cover, like dental or orthodontic appliances, get the adult version. You will save yourself the hassle of refilling mid-run.</li>
            <li> Great for adults, too :) I just avoided putting the stickers on it, and it looks perfectly fine and not too kiddish The water pressure is strong on all settings, and I like that the tank is smaller and takes up less space the the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; ones.  Also, it costs less! :)</li>
            <li> before her expander my daughter hated flossing and after hated it even more. This is incredible, gets everything out and is fun. My seven year old sneaks away to use it :)</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of the water flosser for kids, even though I am an adult. Works perfectly for both my husband and myself and the size is very convenient for travelling and the smaller footprint. A few days ago the hose of the last flosser I purchased in May 2014  started leaking, it was a small hole in the hose, near the handle. I covered it with a waterproof tape and it work for a while, as the pinhole turn into a larger crack. As it seems the hose and handle are not replaceable, I will be ordering a new new one soon as we find it indispensable.. i wonder if there have been any other customer complaints of problems with the hose. i still  give this product a five star rating.</li>
            <li> It works great for her with less complicated controls.  I recommend it for the elderly.  Throw out the stickers and she won&#x27;t know the difference.</li>
            <li> It is the terrible product.  I receive it, try to use it, the water is leaking everywhere.  It is bad without any quality controls. And return policy is bad too.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had one as a kid (mom still has it 40 years later &amp; it still works!) It is just like I remember, cleans between teeth &amp; braces, plus, it&#x27;s fun and my bathroom mirror gets washed every day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult who just got braces. This option takes up less counter space and has an orthodontic head. Love it!! Could to be happier!</li>
            <li> While the water pressure is good - one negative about it is that there isn&#x27;t a lid or cover on it - therefore you constantly have to wash it out before each use instead of filling it up and using it more then once.  Only negative.  All other aspects are positive.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old has braces and really has trouble brushing around the brackets.  I have a Waterpik and this one for kids is perfect.  He&#x27;s used it for a few days and it really helps getting his teeth clean and his gums are improving too.  I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great size and easy to use. We bought thirteen my daughter started getting orthodontic appliances. It is so helpful dislodging various debris stuck under her palate expanders.</li>
            <li> Great waterpik for my daughter. Really helps her clean her teeth with braces on.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 3-4 months and then completely died. No way to fix or return. Real disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love this! I don&#x27;t regret getting the smaller one at all. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference since I started using it (and I notice when I don&#x27;t!). My only complaint (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that you cannot leave water in it for extended periods. Someone mentioned a lack of lid and I thought, oh, that&#x27;s okay, I don&#x27;t mind the open tub, and I can wash it frequently...but if you leave water after using, it will leak out the bottom...all of it! I have to keep it on a towel on the off-chance I forget to dump it afterward. This is an inconvenient flaw, but still, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Pleased with service and product.</li>
            <li> We were looking for a waterflosser that we could travel with and a friend told us about this model. It is not advertised as dual voltage, but it works in both the UK and AU/NZ with an adapter. The difference between this model and the full flosser is that it only goes to a strength of three -- more than enough for both my wife and me. Just leave the stickers off and you wouldn&#x27;t know that this is a child&#x27;s model. Or put them on and tell the world to f-off because you&#x27;re an adult and if you want to put cool stickers on your stuff, you&#x27;ll do just that.</li>
            <li> We use this everyday. Works great!</li>
            <li> My 10 year old son said to leave 5 stars. For a kid that doesn&#x27;t like brushing his teeth, he sure does have fun with this water flosser. He had plaque buildup that is now gone and his teeth look much whiter. There are 3 different setting for water pressure and he said the lower one would be good for babies. He was comfortable with the 3rd, the stronger setting.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got the kids model. It provides just enough spray for me, an older person.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. My kids and I like to use it and it really has some good power behind it.</li>
            <li> It piks the same as the other Waterpiks.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t get as many accessories which you don&#x27;t use but cost extra.&lt;br /&gt;The container capacity is smaller than other models.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old son who wears an expander and continues to get food stuck in it.  It works great and he can use it on his own. Easy to use and I would recommend it. It will come in handy when he gets braces, too.</li>
            <li> Works great our son loves it</li>
            <li> My daughter recently got an arch expander. All kinds of foods get stuck under it and I feel more than a little gaggy trying to get them out of there. Waterpik &#x3D; problem solved!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my grandchild who will soon have braces.  Grandchild tried it out without being told and loved it!  It is just the right size!</li>
            <li> Jakob has become almost obsessed with this product.  It makes it fun to clean his mouth.This is a great way to teach good health habits.</li>
            <li> This product has met all my expectations.  I cannot believe how much &#x27;debris&#x27; comes out of my mouth after brushing first, then following up with this.  I love that it is smaller and takes less space than the larger ones, yet has all the power I need.  Just don&#x27;t put the decals on it, and you&#x27;ve got a smaller, adult version</li>
            <li> I purchased this Waterpik for myself because of its size and color (my favorite!), and because many reviewers wrote that it works equally as well for adults as children. After using it for several weeks, I can honestly report that it is perfect! Its size makes it easy to use and store in my tiny bathroom, it is a breeze to travel with, and it has plenty of power. I usually fill the basin twice per use, but that  takes only an extra second or two. And, the orthodontic pic attachment (included) is terrific for cleaning the permanent retainer on my bottom teeth. Overall, I love this product and highly recommend it.  UPDATE 4/25/17: Three years later and this little beauty is still running like a champ...sadly it is no longer with me as my former roommate claimed custody of it when he moved out (he really wanted it!). But that just goes to show that this model not only has longevity, but is rugged enough to appeal to the men in the crowd as well! :)</li>
            <li> Why make it so you can&#x27;t stop the water flow when its turned on?  That feature was not the one to skimp on!!!  You have to TURN IT OFF to stop the water flow.  Better to just buy the more expensive one from Waterpik.</li>
            <li> This is the coolest thing I have bought in a while.  I use it for travel since it is compact and dual-voltage.  I love this little Waterpik.</li>
            <li> We bought this on the recommendation of our dental hygienist. It makes my newly &amp;#34;brace-d&amp;#34; kids want to brush and floss- total success.</li>
            <li> It works fine so far, same water pressure as my old &#x27;adult&#x27; WaterPik. I&#x27;m no kid, and the only thing about this that makes it for kids is that it comes with a sheet of stickers to put on it. It&#x27;s the same product as the &#x27;adult&#x27; model it seems, just a marketing experiment I suppose; but if you like the green color, go for it, just leave off the silly stickers.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product.  I bought it for my daughter who just had braces put on and was having issues getting the food out of her brackets.  It was wonderful and did the job just like I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give it three stars is because it went kaput after only a few months of use.  I was very disappointed. Expected more from a Waterpik product.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for me.  Its easy to add water if you need more.  So far I have not.  There are 3 power choices.  I use the middle one so more power is available if you need more.  I love the color and the stickers are optional.</li>
            <li> Great for adults!  Smaller size yet sufficient, none of the useless attachments. Close to being more powerful than the large adult water pic.  Noisier, but not a problem.  And costs a third less than the full size.  My $60+ water pic gave out after 2 years tho it was under 3 year warranty.....it was clumsy &amp; leaked water.</li>
            <li> The dentist advised me to use a waterpik on my last visit.  I got my old waterpik out of the closet only to discover it was no longer working.  I got on amazon and compared all the waterpik models (including this kids version).  I was a little concerned after reading reviews that this model might not be powerful enough.  PAY NO ATTENTION TO THOSE REVIEWS.  The kids waterpik has plenty of power and is HALF the cost of the other adult models.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter used this the whole time she wore braces, it works well. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this as an adult user only. I hate most dental floss and with the waterflosser, it gets everything. My teeth feel fantastic after using this and almost feels like you&#x27;ve brushed as well. Definitely get this if you hate flossing. Once you get the hang of it, it really takes seconds to set up and then 1 minute to floss. I like that you can put the water cup over the unit with the tip you&#x27;ve used and store it on the counter for sanitary reasons. Thanks everyone else for your reviews as it caused me to get this one.</li>
            <li> PLEASE READ EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please read entire review.  I was wrong at first!!!&lt;br /&gt;I called Waterpik Cust Service and was told that this unit could be used for 220 v , 50 Hz, electric power......since I needed a unit for overseas use....but when it arrived it clearly stated that it must have 110 60Hz power.....so I had to send it back....However, the unit itself loo&lt;br /&gt;ked fine to me, just a smaller version of my standard unit.  I only gave it 3 stars because I was told it could be used overseas and it could not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT EDIT EDIT  I WAS WRONG I WAS WRONG!!!  I REORDERED THIS UNIT AND USED IT OVERSEAS....IT WORKS GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I re-ordered this unit.  I used it overseas and it was fine!!!  Adults may have to reload the water supply 2x, but it is the same powerful unit as the adult versions.....WARNING FOR KIDS:  DO NOT USE THE HIGHER POWER SETTINGS.....This little machine is very very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;Great machine. would buy again n a heart beat!!!</li>
            <li> I love this!  We did not put the stickers on it but my kids love!  One suggestion, don&#x27;t turn on until in your hand and pointing to the sink.  Otherwise could be used as a high powered squirt gun in the bathroom!</li>
            <li> The orthodontist recommended this for my daughter when she got braces and I was sure it would be another thing she wouldn&#x27;t touch but she loves it! It does make a mess, but at least her teeth are clean!</li>
            <li> This started off great - my child loved it and it was very helpful for cleaning her braces.  Then 2 months after we bought it, we went on vacation for 2 weeks, making sure to leave it dry - without water in it.  When we got back, it sputtered once or twice, and then..........nothing.  It has not worked at all since then, in the last month+.&lt;br /&gt;So I will not buy this again, but rather I will try the adult version - the orthodontist highly recommends this type of machine to clean her braces, as flossing, brushing, etc., just don&#x27;t fully do the trick.</li>
            <li> I love the color and that its small and compact it&#x27;s perfect for me and I&#x27;m an adult I just didn&#x27;t use the stickers</li>
            <li> Great little water flosser for my granddaughter who will be getting braces.  Great transaction</li>
            <li> My son uses this for his braces to get the extras out.  Seems to work well</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Think carefully before buying. Read the negative reviews and note the frequency of those reporting it died, then decide whether you want to risk buying this. I am not deleting what I originally wrote but I am adding an update. After 3 months, my Waterpik died last night. No reason. Everything seems fine. What irks me is that I only had one month to return this rather than buying it at a local store where I could have still returned it and exchanged it or obtained a refund. Think about that when you consider buying this. I regret not listening to the number of repeat complaints that this stopped working. I ignored it because of the number of good reviews. When a product has frequent reviews basically saying the same thing, I usually take notice and go on my gut not to buy. I ignored that this time around and look what happened. It died just as those reviews reported. I regret buying this because I am now out $$ which I no longer have to get another. A waste.  Btw, as I wrote below, this thing is extremely LOUD. It can be heard on the 2nd floor story of a two story home. When it worked, it did great at removing debris.    ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I debated on whether to get this or the adult sized Waterpik and due to limited finances and limited counter space, I opted to try the Waterflosser for Kids even though I am over 50. I have only been using it for a short time but thus far &#x27;really&#x27; like it.  It is a bit noisy but heck, who cares?!  I also oil-pull (and until this, flossed) in addition to brushing but found the Waterpik to be more effective than flossing.  I oil-pull first, then brush my teeth, and then use the Waterpik flosser.  Oil pulling is very effective for dislodging food debris but even after oil-pulling and brushing, I have found the Waterpik still gets out remaining difficult to budge food bits. I have been amazed at the tiny, tiny bits of food that end up in the sink after water-flossing. This has been a great water flosser and I appreciate it far more than flossing itself.  It calls for using cold water (regular temp) but I found that using regular temp water turned out to be too chilly for my teeth and gums.  Instead, I use tepid (lukewarm) water which works out wonderful! They also give 3 pressure settings which is nice.    At first, it took a bit of getting used to operating the handle because I have severe rheumatoid arthritis in my hands but once I messed around with it and became familiar with holding it in different ways, it has turned out to be a great little device.  Would enjoy seeing this offered in other colors, although the green is fine.  Great investment, good quality and not too expensive.  What more could one ask for?</li>
            <li> Tired of bulky regular size waterpick  getting bigger and bigger every time they have a new model.&lt;br /&gt;This is simple and easy operation model.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product. I use it for myself even though it is for kids and only has pressure setting to #3. The waterpik designed for adults has the setting up to 10, that would have been too much for me. My only wish is that the water holder had a lid to keep out dust, other than that I am pleased. My teeth are cleaner using this flossing system than using traditional floss. As time goes on I and if setting #3 does not feel like it is enough for me I might upgrade but for now it is enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> This is really a great idea and Waterpik is a leader in this field.&lt;br /&gt;However, sadly this is very cheaply made and lasted only about 7mos before dying.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s totally dead now. I have filed a warranty claim and am not sure what will happen.&lt;br /&gt;Will update this.I would not buy again. Especially if I had a choice.</li>
            <li> Kids new best friend.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I bought this to use myself and I love it! Everything the reviews say are true. It&#x27;s small, doesn&#x27;t take up much room, it&#x27;s just as powerful as the adult version, I like the cute decals (after all, there&#x27;s a child inside all of us). Works great, doesn&#x27;t make a mess if you keep over the sink - but I agree, I wish it had an on/off switch on the handle but that&#x27;s a minor detail. I bought it to replace the adult water pik I used to have. Love it !! So easy and portable that I&#x27;m using it every day vs. the old water pik that mostly gathered dust ! I highly recommend it to anyone of any age.</li>
            <li> I do not like it, neither does my son. It should have been designed with a pause/stop button on the wand. The water flow is too much for a kid at 6 (even for me) - we get pretty wet; and in my opinion - does not clean teeth well. Back to floss without water.</li>
            <li> not only good for kids, but for some disabled people.</li>
            <li> 2 grandkids just got braces.  I ordered one for each of them.  It has made a difference in how they care for their teeth.  Great tool for kids with braces.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated: Just as powerful as the adult version coupled with a small footprint made this a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a different water flosser and my kids wanted to try one. They were both pretty rough with the dental floss (sometimes cutting their gums in an effort to clean them) so this was a safer option. They&#x27;re 11 and 9 and this is what they&#x27;ve told me; LIKES-easy to switch picks, easy to fill and clean, it feels like it&#x27;s cleaning and it doesn&#x27;t hurt. DISLIKES- have to put the floor in your mouth first but the dial is hard to turn with one hand, it feels like I&#x27;m drooling and water gets everywhere, I have to floss by guesswork because I can&#x27;t look in the mirror to do it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it and they use it without being constantly reminded about flossing. They did enjoy putting stickers on it and declaring whose flosser stays in the caddy and which one stays connected.</li>
            <li> My teenaged daughter asked me to get this for her. It&#x27;s the perfect size for her to use with her braces to make sure there aren&#x27;t any food particles trapped between her teeth and the hardware. I&#x27;d definitely recommend getting this if your child has braces or will be getting them shortly.</li>
            <li> very good product. simple. serve the purpose well. beats lots of other products designed with complicated (but usually unnecessary) functions and high prices. very satisfied. not only good for kinds but fits adults well, too.</li>
            <li> I have used water pics for over 20 years and have found them extremely effective not only in cleaning the teeth and any pockets in the gums but also in massaging the guns with it&#x27;s pulsating  jet of water. The pulsating jet of water on the gums brings more blood to the guns, and therefore more oxygen, and is effective in helping to treat periodontic disease. I have found that the children&#x27;s unit has the same motor as the traveling unit and is a lot less expensive. I have also found that for some reason the children&#x27;s unit generates a more powerful jet of water than any of their other units, including their most expensive ones.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I saw no reason to order the adult product to replace the one I had.  THis one works just as well and I like the fact that it takes up a lot less space.</li>
            <li> grandson uses every day</li>
            <li> Bought these for both of my girls. They are 8 &amp; 9. They recently had appliances put in their mouth.  This is perfect to keep them clean.  The only thing that would be nice is if the on/off switch was actually on the handle.  My bathroom has been soaked several times because they take the wand out of their mouth without turning it off.  Other than that, we love them.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly for getting my son&#x27;s braces clean and cleaning food from between both my children&#x27;s teeth. I can even use it too!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 9 year old son.  The water gets everywhere because there is no stop button on the wand.  It looks like there is but that button just ejects the head attachment.  I thought he was just being messy with it but I tried it myself and it is really hard to clean the teeth with the constant flow of water then reach to turn it off while it&#x27;s still in your mouth.  I&#x27;m just going to buy another one like my husband and I have.  It&#x27;s much easier to use.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect tool for kids with braces.  Makes it easier to find all the hidden food.  Definitely not a replacement for good old fashioned flossing.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Waterflosser is so easy to use.  I gave each grandson one for Christmas along with the Sonic electric toothbrush for kids.  They brush and waterfloss on their own now and love showing off their much cleaner teeth!  They really liked decorating it with the enclosed stickers as well!</li>
            <li> Just as other customers wrote, this Waterpik is not just for kids.  Those reviews are what sold me on this purchase and I am super pleased.  I have a small bathroom with an even smaller shelf area.  This fits and has a good water capacity and I may fill it twice if need be.  Very strong water jet.  Love it and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Powerful unit would buy another one fore sure . And for under $30.00 it was a fantastic deal ....... :)</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my Waterpik and decided to try this one because it is smaller and doesn&#x27;t take up as much space on the counter top. The stickers are not necessary - I didn&#x27;t put any on mine - the stickers are the plastic kind (with no glue on them at all) that you can put on and remove easily - give them to your kids to put on their other toys or put them on a mirror - Anyway this little Waterpik is just fine - it has 3 settings and it works great just like the bigger adult one and it cost less and looks good on the counter. It&#x27;s noisy but so is the regular sized one. This is not that much smaller in water holding capacity. I highly recommend this Waterpik! I love it!</li>
            <li> I am so sorry but I bought this product thinking it will be a good help to my son&#x27;s teeth daily cleaning but unfortunately it does not work as I expected. First there is no way to control the amount of water that comes to your mouth you only have three speeds for pressure but not a way to on and off as needed. Second the mess you make is horrible, spills everywhere in the bathroom. You have to always let the water run and you can&#x27;t control it. Third there is no way you can help him use because you can&#x27;t see where are you cleaning unless you are prepared for getting all wet.So disappointed.</li>
            <li> This replaced my second Waterpik rechargable I use for travel. This kids model is much cheaper than similar travel version and works great for me on the road. Grandkids got the stickers for their flosser.</li>
            <li> I have the adult version and purchased this for my girls.  They love it.  The only change I would suggest is the little button on the &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34; like on the adult version.  When the kids have to spit the water out, they need to turn the unit off.  On my unit, you just have to press a button on the wand and the water pauses.  When you&#x27;re ready to clean again you just release the button.  This feature would be awesome on this.  Sometimes they forget to turn the unit off and water is shot all over the place.  Other than this feature, I would have given it 5 stars.  Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My son recently got braces and it was suggested that I get a waterpick for him. He is twelve and has been good about brushing, but I found this online and the price was right. I am so glad that I bought it. The first time my son used it, you would not believe the stuff that came out of his braces. Easy to use and a great price! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great except it doesn&#x27;t come with a lid... And for sanitary reasons I think that&#x27;s odd!</li>
            <li> kiddo liked it, be better if you could snap and store picks inside cover/tank.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my child who has braces.  She has been loving this waterpik and using it several times a day, as she find this to be an easier way to keep her braces clean than all the accessories provided by the orthodontist.  I tried this out myself and have to say that I had a &amp;#34;dentist-clean&amp;#34; feeling at the end.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and since the orthodontist hasn&#x27;t complained once about his flossing or gums, yay! Some say it is loud, well maybe a little but who cares, its only for a moment and my son loves it!!!</li>
            <li> My 7yo daughter absolutely puts up a fight about brushing her teeth and flossing.  She has braces on some of her teeth now, and can&#x27;t use conventional string floss, so I got her this.  Several reviews said their kids loved it and spent more time cleaning their teeth.  I haven&#x27;t really seen that myself, but I can get my daughter to use it, if only briefly.  I can&#x27;t say how well it works, especially since she rushes through cleaning her teeth, but something is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this appliance. It says for kids, but I&#x27;m an honest-to-goodness grownup. It&#x27;s easier to use than the adult unit that finally died, smaller so takes up less room, capacity is just right, it&#x27;s perfect. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> bought this to replace a battery operator flosser which broke down and would not recharge  this little machine has some power behind it  some one said there is no top to this true but i just took off water holder flipped it over machine covers it well  the price is rite</li>
            <li> This product worked well, and my kids loved it.  However, about a month after receiving it, it stopped working.  It&#x27;s a pump with a switch on it and it didn&#x27;t last a month.  Nothing visibly wrong, not user-serviceable.  We use an adult Waterpik as well that works fine, but 1 month until failure is ridiculous.  Tracking down Waterpik now for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I originally had a full sized water pik but it took up too much space. This works great and is much smaller. The only thing is the whole product line has gotten a lot &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; made than the old ones. Sad to see.</li>
            <li> compact, very easy to keep clean, good range of pressure - great for my 7 yr old and myself!</li>
            <li> Bought the unit in February, broke in August.  Liked it for the short time that we had it, but it is inexcusable to last only 6 months...This appears to be a common issue.  I guess you get what you pay for and they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used too!!</li>
            <li> It has just as much power as the adult size one, but takes up much less space on the counter and in my luggage. Easier to take on trips.</li>
            <li> No in off switch. Much &amp;#34;messier&amp;#34; than I thought it would be. But the kids love it</li>
            <li> We love the compact size and it works very well!</li>
            <li> My 8 year old really likes using the Waterpik for kids!  Great price too.</li>
            <li> Based on all the reviews i read i opted to buy this little jewel. I really wanted something with power. It has delivered. It is small so the footprint does not take too much sink area. The reservoir flips over to cover the unit when not in use, a nice touch. I would buy this unit again and i will when this one dies. Most likely the best unit I have ever owned and I have had plenty.</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter-top space. My 7 &amp; 9 year olds can operate it with minimal mess.</li>
            <li> It is a good buy. My gum specialist recommended it! It is easy to set and use with easy instructions to follow.</li>
            <li> It does the job and is sturdy for kids. The colors are good for boys or girls. There are optional stickers to decorate.</li>
            <li> Compact, very easy to use with little to no mess.  Will order 2 more for other my other grandkids for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my five year old grandson.  He loves it and looks forward to using it.  I was happy to find a child version of what I use.</li>
            <li> Great product. I purchased it recently from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids love it and use it everyday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this to all parents</li>
            <li> This looked super cute and I&#x27;m sure it would work just fine but I decided to send it back.</li>
            <li> Child friendly.  encourages children to use waterpik</li>
            <li> Our family dentist suggested buying this specific water-pik for our son who got braces and said this would be a good substitution for flossing which is difficult to do with braces. My son uses it daily - his orthodontist are pleased with the results. I even use it and my last dentist appointment went very well - no accusatory question from the dental assistant, &amp;#34;Are you flossing daily?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My daughter has mastered this item with her palate expander but once we got braces on, we ended up buying an electric toothbrush and a waterpik brand battery operated flosser.so she doesn&#x27;t use this as much.</li>
            <li> Most of the virtues of the more expensive &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; water picks, at half the price.  Just leave off the decals and nothing shows it was meant for children (actually, I decided to use two of the &amp;#34;aquatic&amp;#34; decals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small footprint is a major &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; for me.  The only negative, in my opinion, is the necessity to turn it on and off at the base instead of at the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband liked mine and purchased one for himself.  My dentist quickly saw an improvement in my gums, and food quit catching between my teeth when my gums healed.</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is perfect for my kids with braces. I also purchased the Sturdy Storage with Replacement Tips and everyone in the family can enjoy using it now. This has met our needs perfectly!</li>
            <li> this is the second one i have purchased ..... i  use it so i did not purchase for a child.....love this water pic</li>
            <li> I love it.  It is actually for me.  I have a very small mouth, and this is just right.</li>
            <li> Got it for my grandson  8 th birthday.  He was excited he doesnt like to floss he loves it qnd uses it every nite</li>
            <li> Love it ! Use it all the time</li>
            <li> My kids love this. I never have to remind them to floss anymore.</li>
            <li> although one of the parts was broken.</li>
            <li> Great size for my 7 year old Granddaughter!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my elderly mother. She needed something effective that was easy to use and that took minimal counter space in her apartment bathroom. She has been happy with it and I am considering buying one for myself for its compact size.</li>
            <li> As advertised, prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> The one I received on 8/28/14 came with a UL sticker on the bottom saying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Model WP-260W / WP-300W&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100-240VAC 50/60Hz, 18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So they&#x27;re now marking them as dual-voltage capable.</li>
            <li> Gift to my 7 year old granddaughter and she loves using it.  Anytime you can have fun cleaning your teeth is a great tool.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy, probably the same as an adult version, so buy this as its cheaper, very powerful, SIMPLE, easy to use, for adults or kids.</li>
            <li> Like better than full size model.  Works as well, but takes up less space and cost less.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this would be that it doesn&#x27;t have a lid so dust gets in the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, oral health is extremely important to me. I know it says it&#x27;s for kids but I bought it for myself because it&#x27;s much less expensive than the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; ones and it works very well for me. I don&#x27;t know what the differences between them are but I&#x27;m sure the adult one doesn&#x27;t do anything that this one doesn&#x27;t do so I don&#x27;t see the need to spend the extra money. It has adjustments on the side for water pressure and I am able to adjust it perfectly for me and my teeth/gums feel amazing after I use it. My dentist was very pleased with my results when I went in for my cleaning and said it is definitely helping keep my gums in great condition.</li>
            <li> I purchased a WaterPik for my son to use on a recommendation from his dental hygienist. He was about to get braces and she told me that it&#x27;s imperative to keep your teeth and gums clean during orthodontic treatment. It&#x27;s important all the time, but discolored teeth can occur if you don&#x27;t stay on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;This little unit is terrific for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;Kids are impatient and want to be done cleaning teeth asap. This unit holds enough water to clean for one minute. One and done!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small and unobtrusive- easily packed for travel or stowed under a cabinet if needed.&lt;br /&gt;Not too noisy.&lt;br /&gt;Simple as can be to operate.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fu n departure from dental floss- he likes it! Shocking.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m kind of jealous and think I may buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this in conjunction with proper dental hygiene.  After brushing, she flosses.  As a final step, she uses this waterpik.  She loves it.  I haven&#x27;t even bothered to try it but she seems to have adjusted to it very well.  It is part of her nightly routine.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fits nicely on counter. It has a great flow. I&#x27;m glad I read reviews and bought these for everyone instead of spending a fortune on a larger one. It does what we need...</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it,she has spacers, expecting her to use when she gets braces. Loved that she could personalize,and easy to use. Wish it had brush.</li>
            <li> I had the one for adults previously and the hose cracked.  My son has braces &amp; I use it also.  I purchased this one because it looks smaller &amp; we have limited space.  We are both please with it.  It works just as good as the other one. The only difference is that the pick does not rotate and the handle is a little bit smaller.  But neither of those things get in the way of it doing a good job.  Also, I was happy that the picks from the my old one fit this one so we have extra picks.</li>
            <li> Bought this Waterpik unit for my son who recently got braces- its small enough for him to handle comfortably and powerful enough to do the trick. Doesn&#x27;t take a lot of counter space either- which was important.&lt;br /&gt;He is still using the lowest setting- so we have room to grow with it.&lt;br /&gt;Stickers on the water tank are optional- so don&#x27;t let them dissuade you for use with an older child.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one instead of the adult version to save some money. It does what it needs to do with good pressure. The only thing is that most of the time I have to refill the water container but that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> Works great for my son with braces!</li>
            <li> Perfect for kids and teens - compact and easy to store in bathroom - well made. Powerful water flow which you can adjust for strength.</li>
            <li> Waterpik Waterflosser for Kids, White&lt;br /&gt;it works and suits my needs.</li>
            <li> I bought this fr my daughter who just got braces.  She likes having the ability to decorate the flosser &amp; make it her own.  It is really easy for her to use!  She keeps a cup of water nearby to refill as needed.  The only problem she has is that it keeps falling on her &amp; makes her mad.  So make sure you have it on a level surface &amp; near the sink in case it falls.</li>
            <li> Broke super fast.  We didn&#x27;t save all the info so didn&#x27;t try to get it replaced.  Def wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I was an idiot for not saving the box and receipt.  Ours broke within a month and we weren&#x27;t even using it every day.  It&#x27;s junk and I&#x27;m mad that I wasted the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud, but the 2 different attachments work great for my 2 kids, one with braces, one without. My kids are 14 and 10, and both really like it. To help with the noise, we just set it on a folded up towel.</li>
            <li> good usefull works with 220 V</li>
            <li> Works great - perfect for smaller mouths.  I got this for Christmas and have been using it every night since.  Works great and has just enough capacity to clean my whole mouth.  Different pressure settings are useful as well for my son who is learning to use a waterpik.</li>
            <li> Great product. We bought it for my daughter becuase she was getting small cavites.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews, this item seemed to be similar enough to the adult model, but half the price, so I decided to give it a try. This is my first experience with a waterflosser, and it was easy to use and left my mouth feeling clean and rejuvenated.  Plenty of variety in water pressure settings.</li>
            <li> Prefect for my son!  He just had braces put on and this helping greatly with brushing.  He loves the way it blast the food from between his braces.</li>
            <li> Not very pleased with design. Water leaks out unless it is emptied right after use. Not as well designed as the adult version that does not require emptying after each use. If I forget to empty it, within 1/2 hour it leaks a puddle out under it.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 9 year old who just got a herbst dental appliance. He loves it and it keeps it clean. I tried it out and absolutely love it as well. He uses it on the lowest setting, but I use it on the highest and it is just right. The only con is that the motor is a little loud, but I&#x27;ll deal with that instead of flossing!</li>
            <li> I use this as an adult, and it works great.  I previously used the cordless handheld waterpik, and setting #3 on this table-top version is stronger than the highest setting on the hand-held (I actually had to turn it down to #2 for some sensitive areas near the far-back molars.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty loud (hence one star off), although I&#x27;ve heard that almost all models of waterpiks are loud anyways.  I would say this is slightly louder than the handheld cordless version because it may vibrate slightly on the counter, or the pieces themselves may vibrate a bit when on (as supposed to your hand preventing anything from rattling/vibrating when holding the handheld cordless type.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly think this is the exact same model as the Traveler Water Flosser, which is priced at almost $100 more!  Yeah, this comes with an exceptionally bright green color scheme (green is definitely brighter in person than in the picture, btw) and doesn&#x27;t have a handy-dandy carrying case for other flossing heads, but the unit looks exactly the same and has the same features.  BTW, you can buy an individual carrying case on its own, anyways, if you really want that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally looking at the Ultra + Travel combo package (priced at just under $100), but decided to buy the Aquarius and this &amp;#34;Kids&amp;#34; flosser separately.  It&#x27;s a better deal b/c it ends up being cheaper, and you get to upgrade to the smaller (and more visually appealing) Aquarius.  The Aquarius is my parents&#x27; Christmas present, so I don&#x27;t have any reviews for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the fact that the water basin can be turned upside down when not in use-- it makes for a visually cleaner countertop.  Plus, it&#x27;s smaller than the Ultra and the Aquarius.  I&#x27;m a pretty thorough flosser, so I filled the tank 2 times for one flossing session.  Honestly not that big of a deal for me, because I would have to refill the cordless handheld flosser at least 4 times for one flossing session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thehand-held wand does feel a little small.  If you have huge hands (or a huge mouth?) it might feel small for you, but I still think it&#x27;s a good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other flossing heads, like the plaque-seeker heads and the pocket-pik are compatible, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about being limited to the regular and the &amp;#34;braces&amp;#34; heads included in the package.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice size. I bought it for my son&#x27;s bathroom and it doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of room on his small counter area. It is also good enough for an adult to use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my kids because the dentist had suggested this as an easier way to floss their teeth. It said it was for kids so I didn&#x27;t bother reading anything about but just ordered it. The main problem is that the on/off switch is on the machine- NOT on the water pick handle. Now, for pulsating water shooting fiercely and going everywhere- even when you have it already in the child&#x27;s mouth, it would be a far more logical and convenient design to be able to stop the water by turning it on or off from the actual water projection wand already in hand but you are scrambling for the box while water shoots everywhere and the child gets soaked. NOT OK. This was like something from candid camera. A total joke! I genuinely don&#x27;t understand how this product can be used in a sensible manner- especially by a child!!! However Amazon is great at returns and I&#x27;m getting my money back.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son to use with his braces. It is super easy for kids to use. I believe it is the only way to go with braces because kids will not brush enough when they have braces. They just fill to the line and pik until the water runs out. This unit I purchased for a friend because I convinced them to get it for their daughter who now has braces as well. Unfortunately I purchased mine thought my dentist so I paid more than what it is on AMAZON. The only thing I do not like is it seems sort of loud but with it being a tad loud, you can here that it is on and that they are using it I suppose. overall a great and simple product for the kids with braces.</li>
            <li> This little guy isn&#x27;t just for kids! My wife and I use it, and it works just fine for our adult mouths. I agree with a lot of the other reviews about water pressure - this thing packs a punch! My wife can handle it on &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; but I use the lowest &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting otherwise there&#x27;s too much gore in the sink. Nice &amp; compact, fits great in our bathroom. We just didn&#x27;t put on the stickers it comes with and voila - adult waterpik!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.  It is an excellent complement for the oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> it gets used more than any string thing, works well and seems to do the job and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space...what else is needed?</li>
            <li> My son loves to use this and makes me happy.</li>
            <li> My two children use it and it works for us. Adult supervision is necessary because 1) to avoid level 3 because it&#x27;s too hard for the children and 2) avoid water going everywhere but the sink since it&#x27;s easy to have fun and spray the whole counter.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> Needs a lid for the water reservoir</li>
            <li> My kids love this water flosser.  Be prepared to have a mess in the bathroom though!  I used it to see how it works and even made a mess myself.  The on/off switch is on the actually body of the machine so when using the tip of the flosser has to be in your tightly closed mouth with one hand on the on/off switch ready to turn it off when your mouth is full of water to spit.  It would be much better if the on/off switch was on the handle portion of the flosser rather than the base, however... The water pressure is good.  When it was up all the way it made my daughter&#x27;s gums bleed so we are working her up slowly.  It&#x27;s small and compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space.  It&#x27;s cute and encourages the kids to clean their teeth better.  Overall I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I owned a number of these Waterpik devices over the years and hate to be without one: Waterpik makes for happy gums and teeth! I got myself the kids version because I prefer the kid green over the adult blue. And yes, I did put on a couple of the silly stickers. :)</li>
            <li> works great for adults too, why pay double when the kids version works just as good</li>
            <li> My granddaughter was coming to visit just after having braces applied, so we wanted to be certain she coud take good care to clean around them.  I think the stickers encouraged her to accept this new gadget as something fun to use.  Smart idea to include them, vendor!  She&#x27;s using it three times a day with water and a little mouthwash in the reservoir.</li>
            <li> just as powerful as the regular one, and with a smaller footprint.</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen.  I normally use floss but it has irritated my gums in sensitive areas.  My old water pick died.  Since I generally used one setting I decided to get the child&#x27;s version, and this has been my best choice.  The pick has worked wonderfully and fills my need.  Recently took a trip and the small size works out better than the larger one.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the counter works just like an adult size</li>
            <li> This works great for my daughter and she uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> This item works great for my son with braces. He was having difficulties using the flossers he was given, and I was starting to worry that he&#x27;d give up trying to clean between his braces. The Waterpik has done a great job cleaning his teeth, and we have no complaints from his orthodontist.</li>
            <li> I got this item for myself based on reviews that said it would also work for an adult.  I have a 6yr old son, so I thought I could give it to him if I needed something bigger for me.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it, and made a giant water mess all over the place, so much water sprays out at a time that its impossible to aim it so that the water drips into the sink, instead it bounced off my teeth/mouth and sprayed back out again.&lt;br /&gt;The other problem was the pressure level.  On the lowest setting, it simply poured out in a sad little stream.  Only the most powerful setting had any actual pressure, and even that felt very weak, not like it would actually do any cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my choice was &amp;#34;spray all over the bathroom for a week clean&amp;#34;  or &amp;#34;pointlessly let water gently pour into my mouth&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent it back.</li>
            <li> Love this water flosser... Great compact size that works as well as a full-size one. Leave the stickers off and no one can tell it&#x27;s for kids. This is so powerful, I can&#x27;t go to the 3rd speed because my gums would probably feel sore. My husband has a bridge in his mouth and he&#x27;s always amazed how much stuff gets flushed out even after flossing and brushing. Everyone should get one of these... And, oh yeah, this kids flosser is cheaper than the adult model in the same size.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Waterflosser is the ideal waterflosser. I use it to polish my teeth, get rid of morsels of food, and get rid of plaque. It is very easy to separate the water storage from the body, making it prone to spills. I myself have spilled countless times. There are 3 settings, I prefer the lowest one. It is very efficient and when you are finished it gives you a fresh feeling in your mouth. It&#x27;s very loud and the wire connecting the flosser and the base can&#x27;t stretch very far. Other than that, it is the perfect tool for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> The design and color are great and the food just flies out of your kids braces!  Written by a 13 year old and kid recommended.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old son loves using his Waterpik every night before bed. It did not take him long to learn how to use it after the initial instruction. It is strong enough for an adult to use as well. I am thinking about buying additional heads for the rest off the family.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the adult, but works just as great. Those silly stickers are optional.</li>
            <li> Works very well, abouth to order one more.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!!  My kids love this flosser.  The only negative is when I opened it up it was supposed to have two tips it only had one, so I had to order another set or send the whole unit back to Amazon.  It does get the kids to floss and eager to do it.  Nice size so it fits on the counter of the sink, we don&#x27;t have a lot of room so its nice that it fits well there.  The only negative for me is that there is no cover for the top where the water goes.  I would think it would be more sanitary to have a top.  But all in all its worth the money, the kids will love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent water flosser for the kids. They love it and I love it knowing they are flossing.</li>
            <li> I used a waterpik for years as a kid and I remember thinking it was great then. I had braces and nothing cleared junk out of my teeth/braces better than my waterpik. At some point as I grew older it fell by the wayside and I forgot all about them until our dentist recommended it over flossing. He states that flossing can drag the crud and bacteria deeper into the gums if not done properly (with a new section of floss for each tooth and not going back down after going up). He also states that his patients who use a waterpik have consistently healthier teeth, gums and mouth in general than his hard-core flossers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought the adult waterpik for ourselves [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] and this one for our almost 8 year old girl. We all love them! Our daughter is much better about doing her teeth now that she has her waterpik because it&#x27;s \\&quot;fun\\&quot;. Plus her teeth/gums end up way cleaner than when she was trying to do floss and brush before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In hindsight, I would buy this unit for myself as well over the adult unit. The reason being is that it is smaller and doesn&#x27;t take up as much room on the counter. In addition, it doesn&#x27;t have a lid with a compartment in it for a bunch of useless attachments (as the adult one does). The problem with that lid is it can be a hassle to get on and off because it can pop open. Also, I like the color better. It comes with stickers which, obviously, you don&#x27;t have to use, so it doesn&#x27;t look like a kids unit otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue we&#x27;ve had with our daughter is that she has a hard time pressing the water chamber down tight enough on the unit for it to seal. We solved this by keeping a little plastic cup in the bathroom and so she just fills the cup with water then pours it into the water chamber as needed (and this is fun also apparently...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Great unit, better for your teeth than flossing, fun for kids to use so increases compliance, and smaller footprint than the blue adult one.dult one.</li>
            <li> The  I don&#x27;t care for the color of the blue ones so I purchased the green one. I checked on the waterpik website and found out that the pressure is the same as their adult ones, they only offer one model with more pressure. Regarding pressure, its plenty for me at just past half. Anything stronger feels like its going to pop my teeth out. Note: the settings are not 1-2-3, its variable between the 3 marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did a purchase a waterpik? Because even though my gums are in good health I have had problems with chunks of food getting pressed under the gum line on my uppermost back teeth. I would have to go to the dentist to resolve the issue. With regular use I don&#x27;t have that problem but if I happen to slack off and get an infection I just use the waterpik to wash the debris out. The best thing is seeing the chunks of stuff that comes out from my teeth. I always brush first to eliminate washing any other food or plaque in my mouth back into my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it had a slightly larger reservoir but I don&#x27;t really have the space for a larger one. I didn&#x27;t want the one that stores the attachments in the lid because it looks like the attachments drain back into the reservoir, ick.</li>
            <li> We bought this originally for my daughter who had the pleasure of wearing a palatal expander.  This worked well for her to get the food out.</li>
            <li> This has 2 different heads that come with it, a pic and a brush.  My son uses the brush part and really likes it, it seems to be helping his teeth too.  The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that it does not hold that much water so I have to refill it a couple times before he is finished. I like that it has 3 different water settings, soft - medium and hard.  My son liked that he could put stickers on it to make it his own.</li>
            <li> Love it!  No longer have to remind my kid to floss</li>
            <li> This was a gift for our 7 year old grandson for Christmas. The spray was more gentle for him.He told us he loved it.</li>
            <li> Took the waterpik on vacation. It was easy to use and did a better job on my teeth then the one I have been using for the past three years.</li>
            <li> The water spills everywhere. I wished I had purchased the adult one which has a button to press to hold back the water.</li>
            <li> bought this for my 7 year old daughter who just recently got braces.  She absolutely LOVES it!!!  The ease of use as well as the stickers that she can put on to personalize it make her actually enjoy using it and keeping her braces clean.  Great purchase and the price was perfect.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a couple weeks</li>
            <li> At first, I was very excited about actually getting my kids to floss with a water-flosser. The device worked great for about 4 months, then died. As a bonus, I&#x27;d just missed my window to return my new paper weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assume the base got wet and the electronics fried, but I didn&#x27;t disassemble the thing to check. Nonetheless, this wouldn&#x27;t surprise me as the device doesn&#x27;t come with a lid for the water tank and it was prone to spills. Let&#x27;s face it, kids can be messy. Furthermore, if you don&#x27;t detach the tank after each use, dry it out and put it away inverted, you risk letting dead skin cells and other particulates fall into the tank. Unless you cover it with a mini tarp or something similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I&#x27;ve moved on to greener pastures and purchased a new &amp;#34;Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser.&amp;#34; Hopefully the new water-flosser will last longer. It does appear to be better made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, my kids, 9 and 11, don&#x27;t seem to mind that the new device doesn&#x27;t come with stickers or that the new device has more settings, more features, comes with a lid for the tank, etc... All for only about $17 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth be told the &amp;#34;no lid&amp;#34; thing worried me out of the gate as my kids can be liberal with a mess. Regardless, everything had a way of working out, except for the fact that I&#x27;m out my initial investment of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final analysis: Buyer beware. If you plan to let your kids operate the device on their own, be sure to give them explicit instructions on not making a mess, not bumping the tank, cleaning up afterwards, etc...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the color, but the size is great - holds a nice amount of water and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li> I have never used a water flosser before, and I was very excited to order this one! Even though I am an adult, I do have a child, so I decided to buy this kids product with the intention of everyone using it. I personally loved using it, It&#x27;s very easy to set up, and although it is smaller than I had anticipated, I like that it is so compact and fits well on my sink. Overall, I love the product. If I could change one thing, it would be the fact that the &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; switch is on the unit itself, not on the handle itself, but that is the biggest complaint I have.  The intensity setting seems very high though, but it is easily adjusted.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and my 7 year old daughter loved being able to the included stickers. She is able to use the Waterpik herself now after we went over how to use it correctly for some time. My daughter loves using this and says it is far easier that flossing and she feels like a big girl when she uses it. I do follow up and assist her with flossing her teeth, but it has become much easier now.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and determined it was worth the chance that the &#x27;kid&#x27; version of Waterpik would work for me and indeed it does. Love it.  Enough power for anyone unless you are an elephant and I&#x27;ve only watered the mirror once (or twice maybe). Less space needed on the countertop which was important to me as well. No hassles with opening and closing lid and i didn&#x27;t need the extras anyway. I&#x27;m a happy camper with happy gums:-)</li>
            <li> i already have the bigger Waterpik system for my older son, but needed another one for my 11 year old daughter. This one is smaller, which is great for limited counter space, and the power/size is great for her. However, my teenage son (who has braces)said the water chamber would be too small for him and would need to be refilled during use. I think both are great for their individual needs.</li>
            <li> Bought it when our oldest got braces - pump just stopped working after a month.  I agree it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My daughter is only 7 and I was worried about the waterpik being more of a toy than useful.  She&#x27;s able to use this correctly and loves using it! Great product, easy to use, would buy again!</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter who has an appliance installed. It works in getting all that food is stuck in her hooks and springs.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been Waterpik users for over 3 years now, and it has improved our dental health exponentially, needless to say we feel no regrets and has no complains about our other more advanced Waterpik product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 7 year old daughter was always curious about using it, and we tried to get her into flossing with very limited success, not only their adult teeth are all scattered around her mouth and mixed with baby teeth, but her mouth is rather small and she had a very hard time handling the dental floss or doing a proper job. You know what I mean if you ever tried to teach a kid how to floss. Our Waterpik is certainly too strong for her and too \\&quot;adult\\&quot; for her looks, so we decided to purchase this kids model&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She just loves it, she is always looking forward to her pre-bed routine of using her Waterpik, and she started doing a great job with it after the second or third use, my fear of water mess and pieces of chewed food stuck to the mirror or counter were unfounded, this model is very easy to use and gentle on the gums, while it gives my daughter the cleaning she needs much more easier and effective than with the flossing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction looks sturdy and it&#x27;s very easy to clean, and the \\&quot;customization\\&quot; with stickers is a nice touch, right away my daughter felt it was her own toy to play with, a fun way to get your kids into taking care of their mouth from an early age. The only complain I have is that the head doesn&#x27;t rotate like in our model, so the hose carrying the water under pressure tends to tangle and make my daughter&#x27;s job  a bit harder. She learned to live with this handicap fast enough, and having no experience with a rotating head she cannot really tell the difference, but I spotted this flaw right away. But it&#x27;s a minor thing, not a deal breaker by any means&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning proper flossing will come later I&#x27;m sure, and by then she can decide what&#x27;s better for her, I will not get into the discussion about flossing vs. Waterpik,. That&#x27;s a personal matter and whatever thrust you have in your dentist recommending one method above the other. But I do recommend this product, no regrets. Waterpik,. That&#x27;s a personal matter and whatever thrust you have in your dentist recommending one method above the other. But I do recommend this product, no regrets</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s both have braces and this waterpik is amazing.  Their teeth have never been so clean.  It is really easy to use, not too loud, and the stickers are fun.  Even though the stickers make it difficult to wash.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with this device and the reason I deducted 1 star off is because you cannot turn the device on or off with the handle.</li>
            <li> Bought it when my son got his braces to help clean his teeth.  He uses it every night.  It is easy to use, easy to clean and according to the Ortho and Dentist, he is doing a great job.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I chose this for my granddaughter for her 7th birthday.  She has some issues with her teeth and this seems to be helping.  She, also, says it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult and the kids waterpik works perfectly for me. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 10 year old that just got braces. She loves it! Would recommend...</li>
            <li> works great as far as i can tell. i use it usually at a little over 2 (im an adult) level three is way to easy to make the gums bleed etc. I think it has the same motor as the adult models... i&#x27;ll have to check with my father-in-law and see how high the pressure is on his model...</li>
            <li> This waterpik is great.  Easy to use and store.  My 14 year old needs it for braces and says &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t suck&amp;#34; which is code for &amp;#34;it&#x27;s good&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note of caution: the highest setting can strip paint off of steel.  It hurt my fingers - I can only imagine what it can do to your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note: the cat does not appreciate the highest setting either but it makes me smile.</li>
            <li> works great for my 11 year old daughter with her braces. I have noticed a huge difference.perfect size and fun color</li>
            <li> Perfect low-tech device for dislodging stuck food from my back molars without jamming it up under my gums.  Small enough for a crowded bathroom. Not enough reservoir for full mouth cleaning, but I use floss for that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in June.  It was used for 2 months and just stopped working.  It&#x27;s too late to return this, so I am out my money.  This is junk.  Update on 9/17/14- I called Waterpik directly and they will be replacing the unit at no charge to me.  I am pleased with this company&#x27;s response to my complaint.  I have my fingers crossed that the next unit will work well without problems, since my kids will need this for a couple more years.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter as she is having dental issues and she loves using it.  Adaptable to when the &amp;#34;braces&amp;#34; come along in the future</li>
            <li> My grandson loves it.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and good for first user. just the color is kind of for boy hopefully it will have pink one!</li>
            <li> Done the job expected. The grip size is good for children. Pressure is sufficient. My kids (4 and 7) have fun using it.&lt;br /&gt;You can use it in Europe because the range is 120 - 220V, GREAT! You only need a plug adapter.</li>
            <li> The waterpik seems to do a good job but it has a couple of flaws.  First, the white tubing is about a foot or so too short for taller children or ones standing on a stool.  Second, there really needs to be a button on the handle that controls the flow of water.  My youngest has a hard enough time keeping the waterpik head in her mouth let alone trying to keep it in her mouth while trying to fiddle with the on/off dial.</li>
            <li> Good value. Five year old likes using it. Does its job.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as needed. Comes with two tips.....one an orthodontic tip which is exactly what we needed it for. Shipping was fast with prime.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with small size which delivers big power.  I fill it twice (once for upper and once for lower teeth) to equate capacity of previous adult product.  Very small footprint and easy to pack for traveling.  Only problem was learning NOT to try to adjust water flow on handle like previous version ~ that control dislodges the clear tip which allows water to spray all over!&lt;br /&gt;;-)</li>
            <li> We have just gotten braces in our home, so this was a must have for the bathroom.  I loved the small footprint of this unit, much better than the full sized Waterpik.  The green receptacle holds enough water for two people to use the machine.  The stickers were cute, and they&#x27;re removable, coming in both girl and boy designs.  I was sadly disappointed, however, in the NOISE THIS THING MAKES!  Wow!  If you think you could use this when someone is sleeping in the next room, think again.  And don&#x27;t even consider turning it on if you just got the baby to fall asleep.  This sounds like a jack hammer and I&#x27;m not certain why.  Nothing is malfunctioning, no leaks and no broken parts, just an extremely loud motor.  Oh well, at least it does the job.  Three settings are available, but the first one is pretty lame.  Our kids use the second one with good results.  There are two attachments to choose from, one for braces and one for regular teeth.  You can also purchase others so that other family members can use the same machine.  Keep it empty and dry between uses so that you don&#x27;t wind up with bacteria or odor.  Good machine for the price.  If it weren&#x27;t so loud I&#x27;d have easily given it five stars.</li>
            <li> EVEN CLEANING THE SOAP DISH BECAUSE IT WORKED THAT GOOD  NOW THIS IS A NEW VERSION BUT IF IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ONE I HAD  POW TO CLEAN IT HAS NOW IM 60 AND LIKE A CLEAN MOUTH  THIS IS JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED WELL I ORDERED IT  DONT EXPECT TO COME UP WITH ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT  PUT WATER IN IT PLUG IT IN TURN IT ON PUMP  IT UP AND FLOSS AWAY TO  FRESH BREATH  I SEE NO REASON YOU CANT ADD MOUTH WASH TO IT  IT WILL GIVE IT THAT EXTRA ZING AND THEY HAVE A ON OFF SWITCH ON IT  WITCH WILL BE GOOD WHEN YOU GET YOURS BESIDES IT BEING A KIDS MACHINE  THE MACHINE DONT KNOW ITS FOR KIDS OR GROWN UPS JUST DONT PUT THE STICKERS ON IT  THEN IT WELL BE FOR GROWN UPS RIGHT MAKES A POWERFUL WATER GUN  DONT POINT IT AT EYES TEETH YES EYES NO</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this! I do wish it came with more tips but very happy for the price</li>
            <li> Works fine, but not as good as my old water pik.  The water stream is strong, but not as fine as the old water pik.  With a fine stream, it feels better on the gums and not as much water ends up flowing out of my mouth.  There is also no way to shut off water temporarily as with my water pik. Water pik allows me to stop water flow while I remove it from my mouth.  the on/off switch is hard to turn off.</li>
            <li> I admit that I bought this particular waterflosser because of the cool lime green color, but it not only looks good, it is perfect for my needs.  I was concerned when I pulled it out of the box that the water tank wouldn&#x27;t hold enough water and I would have to fill it twice, but once again, it has worked out great.  I&#x27;ve used it at least once a day since I received it 3 weeks ago, and continue to be amazed how many food particles that brushing alone misses.  I&#x27;m gonna ace my next check up!&lt;br /&gt;Just one warning though, be sure to start at the lowest setting and work up. The jet is stronger than you think.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is a great product and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li> works and is less expensive than the regular size!  I have been using one of these gadgets for going on 40 plus years and have so far avoided gum disease.  leaves a nice clean feeling too.. I hope it keeps my new implant clean as well.</li>
            <li> Small footprint, simple, effective, and fun to use. It cleans teeth and gums very well.</li>
            <li> Purchase this when my daughter got her braces.  Like it because it comes with two different heads and has a small footprint.  My daughter with the braces uses the orthodontic head and my other daughter uses the regular head.  They both are much more willing to floss as this is fun and much easier than flossing with thread.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of them, for 3 adults, hit a home run, with all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 and 12 y/o kids. One has braces and the regular dentist recommended. Both kids love using it and I can ask them to &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; with it twice a day without them putting up a battle. It will be 5 weeks before we go back for another exam, so I won&#x27;t know results until then, but I it can&#x27;t hurt.  Easy to use and set up too.</li>
            <li> This is a compact water pick that I bought to replace my old one that finally limed up too much (we have horribly hard water!). Since I&#x27;m the only one in the house who uses it, the one pick is fine. Would not work for a multi-using family.</li>
            <li> Works great and kids love it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use very bad to use, kids, very unpleasant shopping experience</li>
            <li> My husband broke his jaw and had to get wired, doctor said to get a water pik to help keep his teeth clean.  After doing some research I decided to go with this one and I am glad I did! It is compact so it does not take up a lot of space and is still powerful and gets the teeth very clean!</li>
            <li> The kids love this but beware... mine make a mess....</li>
            <li> i bought this device based on other reviwes and it was a waste of money. It&#x27;s weak, too much water at once and it does not clean my kids teeth as I thought it would.  The worst 60 bucks i&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> I am an adult and I bought this for myself to use because other reviews said it worked the same as the adult version, and was smaller.  I haven&#x27;t used the adult version, but this one works fine for me! I only have it on 2nd speed (1-3)  I don&#x27;t need the larger one taking up precious space in the bathroom, and I don&#x27;t need all the other attachments. Also I like the green color better.  (and you don&#x27;t have to put all the stickers on if you don&#x27;t want).&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve never had a waterpik before but it is easy to use and a great addition to your daily brushing routine.  I hate to floss, so this makes things easier and I don&#x27;t mind using it every day.  (Though my dentist told me I should still floss so now I only floss every few days and that is much more tolerable).</li>
            <li> I ordered this before Christmas for my son who just recently got braces and found that the floss threader was still getting caught in his brackets.  The packaged arrived quickly, however, after the first use, it stopped working.  I was disappointed but called Waterpik&#x27;s customer service and they were EXTREMELY helpful and quick. I had a replacement flosser within a week and have had no problems with it since.  It truly is the best for kids with orthodontics and those without.  It gets their teeth so much cleaner and they enjoy it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a smaller less costly replacement for my WP-100. Unfortunately, the jet does not swivel on this unit like it does on other waperpik products. Imagine a toothbrush that you cannot flip over and brush your upper teeth with, and this will help you to understand the problem.  Shame on Waterpic for saving 50 cents in the manufacturing process and loosing 50% of the functionality of the device</li>
            <li> If your kids are not big on flossing you might want to try this Waterpik Water Flosser. Water makes everything more fun, right? Their dentist says their teeth and gums look great and I don&#x27;t have to put them in a headlock to use traditional floss anymore. Win-win. At first I had to supervise and explain how to use it properly but they have done the rest on their own. Every morning and every night they water floss and it has worked very well. I don&#x27;t even have to remind them to use it which means these things are working out better than I could have imagined. Thanks Waterpik!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer to put your kid in a headlock and use regular old floss, keep that up. When they&#x27;re older, do you think they&#x27;re going to keep on flossing on their own? Or remember to buy floss? I plan on buying my kids Waterpiks for the rest of my life. And no, I am not married to a dentist nor do I know anyone at Waterpik. I just have a flossing thing since it is so closely related to heart health. Google it, people.</li>
            <li> I bought this waterpik for me .It is my first . I find that it work just grate , And the green tank looks grate.And the price is good.Give it a try . I works grate for me.</li>
            <li> I use as an adult, works great!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my adult self. Since I only have 12 of  my lower  teeth left, I needed save them the best I could. I have been fitted for a partial denture and my dentist suggested the Water Pik. In doing my research I realized that I did not need the full size Water Pik because I don&#x27;t have that many teeth that requires a water reservoir for 90 seconds of watering picking. I spotted the KID model with 60 second reservoir which was perfect and smaller size works great in my small bathroom counter. It has 3 strength settings and the first time I used it I put it on highest setting because I thought if it is for kids then I might need the high setting for my adult teeth. Boy was I wrong. It was so strong I made my gums sore. Settings available 1 - 2 - 3, found 1 1/2 works best for me. When I told my dentist I got the KID size Water Pik his assistant said it might not be strong enough to do the job for an adult. Boy was she wrong. The other bonus is it is $20 cheaper than the 1st adult model. Peace</li>
            <li> My kids love this.  My son kept seeing an add for a water flossed on his children&#x27;s channel.  After reading reviews on that device I decided not to buy it and opted for this instead.  He loves this and now flosses multiple times a day. My kids teeth are much cleaner. I only wish there was a lid on the top of the tank.</li>
            <li> Amazon has done an amazing job with the prices and products. Shipping was very fast. We did not expect this item to arrive until the next day or two. However, upon receiving this product I set it up for my 9 year old son to try it out, and it works perfectly. We added the water and a capful of his favorite mouthwash to give his breath and gums that minty fresh, feeling. He loves the the stickers for boys and decorated it himself. It is very easy to use and he is looking forward to using it at nighttime before he goes to bed. So, after going to the dentist the next day for his teeth cleaning, the report was \\&quot;His teeth and gums look good and keep doing what you are doing.\\&quot; I told the assistant about the waterpik and she said, \\&quot;Oh! Well everything looks good. See you back in six (6) months.\\&quot; I so am glad that I ordered this product to help him have a healthy dental report. :)</li>
            <li> Great gadget for kids!</li>
            <li> My 10-year-old has braces and flossing can be a real challenge. The first time she used it, she said there was a noticable difference, and she now uses the waterflosser twice a day without even being asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resevoir is the perfect size, and it&#x27;s super easy for her to fill and use by herself, and the pressure settings are simple to adjust. It&#x27;s also fairly compact, so it&#x27;s easy to store out of sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difficulty is not being able to stop water flow at the handle (instead having to use the switch on the side of the tank), which can sometimes lead to not having enough hands - one to hold the wand in your mouth, one to switch the machine off and a third to hold the lighweight (nearly empty) unit still so you can turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old has braces and was really having a tough time flossing. This device was tremendously helpful! She loves to floss everyday and thinks it is &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34;! I don&#x27;t even need to remind her to floss anymore. A must buy for kids with braces.</li>
            <li> My daughter got got an RPE and uppber braces. This is such an efficient way to clean around all of that hardware in conjunction with good brushing techniques.</li>
            <li> Good quality!  But I think it is too violet for kids under 8</li>
            <li> Works well,but is messy</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product. Every time she goes to the orthodontist they tell her how clean her teeth are. I think it&#x27;s an excellent purchase for kids with or without braces.</li>
            <li> This works just fine for me. It has three settings if you count off. It comes with a standard pic tip and then one for someone with braces. The water pressure is pretty good. The stickers are window stickers, so you can let your kids decorate your mirrors or what not with them.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does exactly what it said it does. My dentist approves of it. And not only my daughter uses it. After all,  everybody has teeth.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son when he got braces.  It does a good job, but he complains the water pressure is too high and hurts his teeth even at the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> Nice. Kids love it. Takes up very little space. Wash the water tank and turn upside down to cover unit.&lt;br /&gt;Small enough for kids mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quick and easy to set up.</li>
            <li> i have had 3 different types of water flossers over the many years i have used them and this has turned out the best. the size is perfect for a small footprint. the water container is easy to lift and fill. the switches for on/off and power are all easy to maneuver. it has sufficient options for an adult. the waterpik brand remains one of the most reliable for durability. this style for kids has been a huge benefit for me as i have gotton older and need things easier to use for hand grasp and flexibility.</li>
            <li> This is a great product - do not be put off by that it is for kids.  You do not have to use the stickers!  My 12 yr old got braces and I wanted a Waterpik but didn&#x27;t want the big adult version taking up the counter space.  This is perfect and works great.  My son is so happy that he doesn&#x27;t have to thread and floss!  In fact, I use it too and love it!  So much better than regular flossing.  It is dual voltage too (stated on the base of the product) so great for traveling overseas.  Regular tips fit it so it is easy to get the parts.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my kids to use instead of flossing since I can&#x27;t seem to get them to floss regularly. They love it......they think it&#x27;s fun to use and the product works great. Wish the water station had a lid though.</li>
            <li> i do not have any affiliations with this company.  The best thing you can do for your teeth and gums is use a waterpik.  I recommend one to all of my patients.  One of the biggest complaints I hear is people don&#x27;t have counter space or travel a lot and it&#x27;s not convenient to bring along. I tell my patients to get the Kids model or the Nano. This KIDS MODEL is the same as the NANO travel model with a few differences.  The biggest being the kids model is a lot less expensive than the nano.  It is basically the same though.  Kids is green color/stickers. There is not travel case for the kids model.  Flip the water reservoir upside down when done and it should fit over the base for storage.  The footprint is smaller than the other counter-top/plug-in models, which many people like.  As for power - it is not recommended to use the adult models over half power &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; anyway, so that shouldn&#x27;t be a big concern. You can purchase the customized tips separately.  I always recommend the pik pocket tip.  It gets down deeper into the gumline and in between the teeth, especially around the back teeth.  Use it on the lowest setting.  If you use this daily, you and your dental hygienist/dentist will be amazed at your next appointment how great your gums will be.  One other note - I do not recommend the rechargeable all-in-one unit. I had purchased one to try it.  It is not as powerful, doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long, and does not hold much water.  At Costco, they used to include this one in their waterpik package  but have since replaced it with the nano.  I think they found the all-in-one model an inferior product.  The counter top plug ins are a much better choice IMO.</li>
            <li> The water basin is a fine size for an adult. The pressure is excellent - I don&#x27;t even use the max pressure so I would worry about leaving it alone in a kid&#x27;s hands. My complaints are: 1) the cord is too short so the machine gets dragged between the plug and the sink; 2) There is holder that keeps the nozzle from getting lose and letting the water in the system leak out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I don&#x27;t think there is better out there and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;3 speeds are enough, though low is kinda useless&lt;br /&gt;easy to use, easy water holder connection, easy to turn on, set speed etc.&lt;br /&gt;CONS it has only 2 tips,  I have only one mouth ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what else one of the more expensive units would give me that this does not. LOVE THIS ONE</li>
            <li> Works as advertised! Really nice product! Can be used with different voltages and not only for kids very suitable. I would buy it again...</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is much gentler than the one I used to have.  I purchased for my daughter since she has a palate expander put in and is constantly getting little bits of food stuck.  Plus it has really helped in getting her teeth and gums clean- better than she did flossing conventionally.  It is small and the water cup (green on this model) actually flips over and covers the base so it can travel pretty compactly.  It also comes with another attachment- one that has bristles on it. Works nice either way.  She found it easy to use- 8 years old and though it does spray all over the place if you are not careful- it is still easy to use.</li>
            <li> Son just began a 2 year course orthodontic work.  Being a teenager, he was a little leery of using a &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; waterpik, but found that using both tips very helpful in keeping his braces clean.  Another advantage is that it is compact and fits on the counter without a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a waterpik before, and wasn&#x27;t convinced they were effective enough to invest in an adult version. This one was significantly cheaper &amp; I like the color, too! I am a big fan of the waterpik now as it makes my teeth feel super clean, moreso than just brushing, flossing, &amp; using mouth wash.</li>
            <li> This little flosser works great.</li>
            <li> Works great. I wish it had a cover, but no cover just means flipping over the top and covering up the unit (to keep the water bin clean). Another question I kept having was if the water power would be strong enough and if there were only three settings or if incremental adjustments were possible. The water power is strong enough and you can gradually increase the pressure from low to high as needed/preferred.&lt;br /&gt;In a previous review, someone mentioned trying to increase the strength without his daughter noticing. It&#x27;s probably better to incrementally increase the water strength before turning it on rather than after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult, but find the settings and the size of this water flosser to be perfect for me. I really like how you can turn the water container upside down to use it for storage.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give this one star is because it was working well for my children while it worked. 7 weeks after purchase, it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on one day. Initially my 6 year old made a giant mess in the bathroom. Unlike the larger units, this water flosser does not have a &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button, which increases the likelihood that your child will spew water everywhere. After a couple of days, the kids had a method for using the pik over the sink which greatly decreased the mess. Sad it broke and will be looking into the 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> Excellent device for travel. For years I have used a Panasonic travel waterflosser because I did not believe there was a device that worked on 220 volts. While okay for a battery powered device, the Panasonic has nowhere near the power of one that works on the mains. The Waterpik for kids is powerful, compact, and works on both 220 and 110 volts.</li>
            <li> Great. Lightweight and portable. I bought this for me and my husband to use and find that I can fill up the reservoir and we have more than enough for two people. Even if you are being very thorough, you will have more than sufficient water for 1 person. Travels and stores really well: you put the reservoir on top of the body and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Works fine for a child&#x27;s waterpik...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just as good for adults and the small size is great</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 5 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 year old and he absolutely love this!!  I showed him how to use it once and from there on he is doing it on his own! It can get a little messy but over all this is a great way to teach him the importance of flossing!</li>
            <li> Works great; no complaints!</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this unit to help clean in and around her palate expander.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 8 year old when he got a palatal expander. After 2 tries he was able to use on his own. Made a huge difference in keeping his mouth clean</li>
            <li> I got this to help the braced kid.  What is cool is that it actually gets used.  Only issue is that when ours arrived, kid felt too &amp;#34;kiddie&amp;#34; compared to ours.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my periodontist, and at less than half the cost of the adult version! The color may not be my favorite, and I certainly had no use for the decals, but the smaller size takes up half the counter-top and storage space, and the variable pressure control is the same as on the more expensive full-size models by WaterPik. Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
            <li> This Waterpik Waterflosser for Kids, met all my expectations.  I&#x27;m an adult but it works just as well for me as it would for a child.  It is easy to use and attractive.</li>
            <li> 7-yr old daughter just got a spaciator installed in her mouth and I bought this in knowing she would need a waterpik to help clean those minute spaces in which a toothbrush has a hard time reaching.  Looked all over and ended up buying this due to price -v- how long we would actually need it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;She loved the stickers and decorated it with ALL of them.&lt;br /&gt;Tube retracts easily&lt;br /&gt;Extra spot for one other pik&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Only has High &amp; Low - high hurts even me&lt;br /&gt;Do not let that button on the pik itself fool you - it is for pik release and not a start/stop for the actual water&lt;br /&gt;Once on - water is always on&lt;br /&gt;Only has ability for one other pik - we are a family of 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After quite a few practice sessions to figure out the best way to use this we found what works for us:  I fill up the tub with water and place it on the unit.  Daughter puts head down towards sink with pik inserted.  I start the unit. When she gives a garbled thumbs up - I turn it off and we place to pik towards the drain and turn it back on to drain the tubing effectively.  Must note - do not move your head anywhere in an upwards motion or water will get everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time we used this we had water all over the place and were laughing hysterically at the whole mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase this again - nope.  But, this works once you figure out what is best on the &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; for you.</li>
            <li> My son has a palate expander across the roof of his mouth and his orthodontist recommended we get this. It&#x27;s been great and gets all the food stuck up there that a toothbrush can&#x27;t reach. He is 7 and can use it on his own. 2 features I wish it had were a start button on the pik itself- the minute you turn on the base unit water starts shooting out of the pik. This can result in water all over the place. Also a cover for the water reservoir would be nice as well. The function of this item is great though. It is a bit noisy.</li>
            <li> LOved it while it worked, but it broke after about 3 months of use.  Cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep your hand from getting wet ... but as good as and less expensive than the adult version.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our daughter who just got braces.  She uses it faithfully and it really works to get food out!</li>
            <li> This is very small and neat. It&#x27;s corded and plugs right into the wall socket so no need for batteries, etc. The three pressure settings are really powerful for such a small appliance. While the item description says that it was designed especially for kids 6 to 12, I think it&#x27;s strong enough for adults to use as well and even though the description also says that it&#x27;s  colourful, if the decals aren&#x27;t added, it&#x27;s not loud or childish-looking at all. A great buy for either/both kids and adults.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my bathroom counter as I didn&#x27;t want a bulky thing on it from the adult version. It have helped my gums and periodontal disease and is definitely worth the investment. The green color already matched colors I have in my bathroom so it worked out great for me. I keep the pressure between 1-2 anything above makes my gums swell the next day.</li>
            <li> This is a great water flosser for kids.  Easy to use, fun, and gentle.  The price was reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> My kids have braces and we&#x27;re not getting very good feedback on their brushing. We got the water pik and now there are no complaints and they also appreciate that they can get food out of their braces.</li>
            <li> This is the second one we have purchased.  We like it because it is small and doesn&#x27;t take up too  much room and we can take it with us when we travel.  It&#x27;s fine for adults.</li>
            <li> My Daughter (10) just got braces and this does the trick without any mess. It holds just enough water and is small enough to fit on a small sink counter</li>
            <li> I bought this model to save space on the bathroom counter. I checked the specs and found it has the same pressure as the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; models. The only difference is a smaller water chamber which is not a problem. An unexpected bonus is that you can turn the water chamber upside down and it fits easily over the lower container making it an even smaller appliance out on the counter. The only thing that would identify this as a kids model is if you attached all the stickers enclosed in the packaging materials.</li>
            <li> Because I have braces, using this is very convenient and it&#x27;s much cheaper than the adults&#x27; one.&lt;br /&gt;Efficient and great!</li>
            <li> it is a nice product, very compact, has everything we needed for an adult to use. I am very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Never used one.  Easy and convenient to travel with.  Would recommend this pic to anyone using for the first time.</li>
            <li> Works great. It  has a small footprint so it doesn&#x27;t use a lot of counter space which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> My grandson likes his waterflosser.  He put every decal that came with it on the tank.  He cleans his teeth with it every night and in the mornings.  Wish that I would bought this a year or so earlier.  I recommend this waterflosser.</li>
            <li> This waterpik is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space, and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I bought this so that my 6th grade daughter could clean her teeth and braces better.  She spends a lot of time in the bathroom with this cleaning her teeth and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this after learning that our oldest daughter was going to need braces. Its kind of loud and may scare younger ones at first, but it gets the job done. It gets in between the metal and bands perfectly, and is great for getting in between teeth and along the gum line. Its also fun to use too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water Pik also offers orthodontic tips to attach to it which also work great for getting the metal of the braces clean. One of the orthodontic tips offers a brush at the top of it to help to make sure plaque removal is a breeze!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: When first using the water pik, make sure to have a towel laying around. There are instructions that come with the unit that teach you how to start using this as you can&#x27;t just start off using this full blast. It can be very powerful! But things can get  wet, until my children knew how to use it, they sprayed water all over the place! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this flosser to encourage my two boys to floss better since they both now have braces.  Their dentist and orthodontist have both remarked how much better their gums are since using this.  Pretty durable and a great price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old daughter is starting ortho treatment and has an expander right now. We were recommended to get a water pik for her. After going to Wallmart and seeing the prices, which this same brand ran $50 at Wallmart, I decided to go to the mnftrs website.  I didn&#x27;t find any coupons for the kids waterpik.  So, ended up seeing if Amazon had it. They were so much cheaper! She&#x27;s used it several times and really enjoys it. Sits off on a corner of our bathroom.  We&#x27;ll be trying to take good care of it, since our son will be going through braces in a few years himself.  Am glad that the color is unisex for that reason.</li>
            <li> Love the color. Bought this for a adult, myself. You don&#x27;t have to put the stickers on. The water pressure is fully adjustable, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a reviewer who pointed out this waterpik for &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34;, its perfect for adults as well. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase. Has a potent water flow, its a smaller device, which fit perfect in my bathroom sink and the best perk (for me) is the green color match with my bathroom decorations...  Only suggestion for the maker: the regular waterpik has the option in the handle to stop the water flowing. This has not. So, a great addition to future models will be that. Other than that I highly recommended if you want same performance with a better value, because this is less expensive that the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews to compare the Kids and the Adult version of the Waterpik. I like this one because it takes up a smaller amount of space and it&#x27;s colorful and cute. The water pressure is certainly more than enough - I usually use setting 2, setting 1 for more sensitive areas. I never use 3. The only drawback is that it&#x27;s really loud - it sounds like I&#x27;m running a jackhammer whenever I use it. Other than that, I really like my Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Good intro water-pik for kids, expecially with braces.&lt;br /&gt;My 9 year old operates it on her own.&lt;br /&gt;Good start to life long oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> Works great! I actually use one head just for ear cleaning.</li>
            <li> UPDATED REVIEW 01/2017:  For the past year (year 4 of use), the squirt pressure on high would peter out to a drip.  Sometimes turning the pressure dial down and back up would temporarily increase the pressure.  Then in the final three months of the fourth year of use, the base began to leak.  It&#x27;s time for a replacement, so I&#x27;m glad I had bought a back-up of the same model.  As an adult, I like this model when it works because it&#x27;s compact and has PLENTY of power, even when set below maximum pressure.  I eventually learned to snap the full reservoir onto the base without a spill.  I still miss the original Waterpik by Teledyne (pictured), which lasted a couple decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW 11/2012:  Gone are the days of the perfect oral irrigator, ever since Waterpik split from Teldyne.  The 80&#x27;s- 90&#x27;s model was the BEST one, with its just-right-sized rectangular reservoir, and the one that lasted 10+ years (See the attached photo of my deceased one).  Teledyne also had an excellent travel one during that time period.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands and Waterpik models and settled on the current kiddy version, which I&#x27;ve been using for about a year.  I already bought a back-up for when mine breaks, but hopefully I&#x27;ll get at least another year out of my current one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is unlike the huge adult version that won&#x27;t fit on my dinky sink vanity.  The odd-shaped adult one no longer fits in a corner, has multiple attachments, and uses an oval massive reservoir built for three.  I like the kiddy size (medium) and shape (rectangular).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PROs:&lt;br /&gt;- Attractive (and cute with the interchangeable stickers).&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t take up half my sink and fits nicely in the corner.&lt;br /&gt;- Reservoir is just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful, and too powerful if you use highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CONs:&lt;br /&gt;- It sounds like a jack hammer, and it&#x27;s gotten louder over time.  That means it will probably break soon.&lt;br /&gt;- The reservoir is difficult to attach securely to the base.  I have to attach it BEFORE adding the water or I cannot see to line up the tiny circle.  Then I have to press the reservoir down firmly onto the base--something I never had to do with the perfect older version.cannot see to line up the tiny circle.  Then I have to press the reservoir down firmly onto the base--something I never had to do with the perfect older version.</li>
            <li> at first i was not for sure. but new i need to do somthing becouse regular flossing was not working. i looked at other piks. but this one its kid friendly. have not had any trouble with it all works great (have i have 3 kids 5,7,9) my middle son likes to eat popcorn the pik his teeth. he thinks its \\&quot;cool\\&quot; i on the other hand am greatful he likes doing this.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my grandson, he has teeth problems.. he loves it and uses it twice a day.  very happy with the product</li>
            <li> Encourages oral hygiene</li>
            <li> Perfectly powerful smaller Pik.  Holds plenty of water for me.  If you don&#x27;t put the stickers on, it&#x27;s not obviously a kids model.  I like it enough I bought a second one to take on long work trips.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old son that recently got braces on his bottom teeth.  The day after this arrived we left for vacation and it was compact enough to travel with us.  The tank holds plenty of water...enough for both of my sons to floss without needing to refill.  It is also powerful enough for me to use.  Great purchase for the price!</li>
            <li> I wish it had an on/off on the handle, but otherwise I love this. and it is POWERFUL.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old just got braces. I had a handheld water pick but wanted something with a bigger capacity. This was the perfect price. I love the compact size. t holds a decent amount of water and s easy to fill and use. It is pretty loud but otherwise the quality and size is perfect for a 12 year old. It cleans his teeth very well (flossing with braces is hard!) I was worried about his oral hygiene but after getting this I can be assured that he will do great caring for his teeth with braces!</li>
            <li> Meets my needs.  I also bought one for my son.  Works as well as the larger version without taking up all of the additional space.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Works great.  My kids love it.  It is easy to use and clean.  Really keeps my children&#x27;s teeth and braces looking great!</li>
            <li> purchased this product for my 8 yr old son and he loves it. Very easy for a kid to use. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> You are better off investing in the waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  No lid no place to store extra pick if kids are sharing.  Gimmacky - get the adult version - my kids are all in my bathroom now using my waterpik until I get them the one that works!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Met all expectations. My daughter loves it and the price was very competitive. Would recommend for purchase again.</li>
            <li> Poor design.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.  Primed it properly and each time I use it, it leaks out of the bottom of the handle.  Water gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful! This machine clears out so much gunk from my child&#x27;s teeth. She has braces and - well, you know.... haha.... Works great. I recommend it... Only thing I would change: Add a lid to the top!</li>
            <li> This is so handy and a def. must have! I never imagined that this would be so wonderful! I&#x27;m so glad that I got it and I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told this version is the same as the adult, so I bought this kids&#x27; one instead.  This is my first experience with a Waterpik and I like it just fine.  The pressure is great, in fact the level 3 is too strong for me.  It lasts for about 2 minutes and it beats regular flossing any day in my opinion.</li>
            <li> For adults who value bathroom counter space!&lt;br /&gt;Without &amp;#34;stickers&amp;#34; the Kids&#x27; Waterpik&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly, conserving space on my bathroom counter!</li>
            <li> My child is happy with it. Easy to use</li>
            <li> I already had the original waterflosser (ultra? I don&#x27;t know, the fanciest version before the newest one. Sorry for not being more percise, guys), but it takes up a bunch of space and is in a different bathroom than the one I currently am in, and sharing with my boyfriend. I already have a lot of stuff, all in his space, so this little guy is a real treat: it really saves up space.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why the other one even takes that much counter-space, but this one is the perfect size, and it works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be put off by the fact that it&#x27;s for kids, the smaller size is perfect for the average bathroom. I use it more than the other one I have, and I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that it would have been available in other colors, but that&#x27;s just me, probably. It doesn&#x27;t really bother me, just sayin&#x27; :)</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and small enough it does not take up too much space. My daughter has braces and we have found this to be very helpful. She is able to get to areas she previously could not. Has been a great help to keep on top of oral hygiene while wearing braces!</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to purchase this Kids version and use it on the low setting. I have been using one of these for almost a year and I am very satisfied. Easy to use and easy to keep clean. I chose not to put the stickers on!</li>
            <li> The kids are getting more flossing done. I had to order more attachments because the inside of the one turned completely white. I&#x27;m not sure what happened there but hope it doesn&#x27;t happen with all of them. It does tend to make a mess, but if my kids have a cleaner mouth it is worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> This unit is a perfect size for a child.  It is a good product for children who are not good at or want to use regular dental floss. The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it can be messy.  I will take healthy teeth and gums over messy though!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 year old to help him with his retainers and he readily took to it. Works great!</li>
            <li> before i couldnt have the kids brush, but now they will do it just to get to flossing. wow thanks</li>
            <li> So far so good. Would be nice if the tip of it has some sort of color code so that we can use it for more than one kid!</li>
            <li> We got this to help the kids keep their braces clean.  It does a good job and removes all the built up gunk and food particles that they can&#x27;t get out with a toothbrush.  They also seem to enjoy using it, so that&#x27;s another positive thing to say about the product.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone whose kids have dental work or don&#x27;t like to floss.  Easily five stars if the price were just a little lower.</li>
            <li> Device is easy to use for children and does an excellent job on cleaning their teeth, behind teeth and in between their teeth.</li>
            <li> It is very messy to use, kids will wet all the bathroom using it and is very loud. I will recommend it for teens and up, not under 10.</li>
            <li> Great flossed for a small space. Just leave the stickers off if you&#x27;re an adult.</li>
            <li> Very easy for kids to use. I have two with braces and they love their waterpiks.</li>
            <li> A must have for those with braces.  I&#x27;m glad I bought the kid&#x27;s version--it is small and I can travel easily with it.  It&#x27;s definitely powerful enough to do the job too.</li>
            <li> Good product!  Nice not too much water pressure does the job!</li>
            <li> It is ok. I feel like better brands make better products. This is definitely not one the kids can use on their own without a HUGE mess. Not thrilled or impressed but way better than the con air brand u got myself and husband</li>
            <li> Works just as well as my older larger waterpik!!</li>
            <li> Great cheaper and smaller alternative compared to the adult waterpik. I didn&#x27;t think the pressure would be strong enough but level 3 is definitely more than enough.</li>
            <li> Have one in our motorhome where counter-top space is at a premium.  Most standard waterpiks would take up the entire counter.  Bought this one for a vacation home for similar reasons.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to use it everyday. She is seven and half.</li>
            <li> great price, great product, fast ship</li>
            <li> I am 23 and I have braces.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of/any time to brush after every meal, so I got this.  I was worried this wouldn&#x27;t work, because it is intended for kids. But let me tell you. The water reservoir is big enough for an adult mouth.  And if it isn&#x27;t, you can just simply fill it up some more.  The graduated markings help me time myself for each quadrant of the mouth.  The pressure is super strong!  I can barely go past 2.5 (the dial is continuous, like a dining room dimmer).  So no concerns there.&lt;br /&gt;TLDR - I am an adult and I love this product because it works.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for children with any orthodontic work. My daughter got an upper palette expander and she was having difficulty cleaning underneath it. Our dentist recommended the waterpik and we took a chance with the kids version but it is seriously AMAZING. The best part is that she loves using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one con- I wish the water container had a cover that you could use so it doesn&#x27;t sit open and get germy. We rinse it out and let it dry upside down but unfortunately our bathroom is small so it ends up back on the base after it dries. Still absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the least costly and does an excellent job. Cheaper than the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; ones I&#x27;ve bought in years past.  I love its small size.Thanks</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter.  She loves it and uses it daily.  It&#x27;s simple to use and after a little instruction she was able to operate it herself.  I use an adult version of the product and have great dental visits.  I wanted the same for her.  I recommend a water flosser no matter what your age!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters.  They love it, I love it.  Its a great product for the price.  I would be great if it had a shut off switch on the handle, but it still works really well.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Great product.</li>
            <li> I got my first Waterpik 35 years ago when I had braces. That one lasted for more than twenty years, but then the hoses began to split. Since then I&#x27;ve bought a couple other brands of irrigators, including the current adult Waterpik. None of them did a good job of maintaining pressure or of having quality components that didn&#x27;t break or leak. The Waterflosser for Kids seems to be the same high quality I remember from my first Waterpik. It is easy to use, applies excellent pressure, and the parts seem to be better made.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this item and have been very pleased with the results. Even though it is listed \\&quot;for kids\\&quot; I have been using it myself for a couple weeks now (I&#x27;m 35). I have never been a fan of flossing, and I get berated at every dental cleaning because they  can tell I don&#x27;t floss. Well, today I went back to the dentist for my cleaning and they said how impressed they were with my \\&quot;home maintenance.\\&quot; Not once did anyone mention that I should be flossing...they just said to \\&quot;keep up the good work.\\&quot;  Now I&#x27;m wondering why I didn&#x27;t buy one of these YEARS ago!</li>
            <li> Like smaller footprint. Works well for an adult, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a smaller, basic waterpik- their standard one is too big, and the freaky lid on the water reservoir is a nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Fairly compact; no lid on reservoir; pressure settings are adequate for normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Head on the hand unit does not rotate, which makes it awkward to reach inside top teeth. Main reason this would not be a good choice for kids, especially younger ones.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended and I really find it works for me much better than floss. I&#x27;ll be shopping for new tips soon because the rest of my family wants to try it too...bet the kids are going to love it too.</li>
            <li> It says it is for kids but I bought it for myself.  Nice small profile in the bathroom.  I passed on the stickers.</li>
            <li> Very good product for kids. The top needs a lid.very colorful. Easy to use by children. Also wish it came with couple of extra tips.</li>
            <li> Great idea, good product, it does the work, but too noisy. I hope it does last.</li>
            <li> Ok, so i thought that this thing would be better than flossing like the advertisements describe, but not really. While it works great to remove large items and its even good enough for adults (trust me, the highest setting on this thing is the highest anyone would really want to go), i found on each occassion, if i flossed afterwards, there was still residue that the floss got that the pik did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While its is fun to use and see the junk flow out into the sink, its too much trouble. No matter what you do, water will inevitably end up on your mirror if you&#x27;re trying to do your kids teeth and even your own (you have to manual turn the knob on the machine to turn it off, there is nothing on the handle to pause). Furthermore, if your child needs help using it, you will have to have their mouths open a bit so you can see where you&#x27;re at and you will get water splashed in yoru face and down your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i use it on myself, its perfect. And i bet if my daughter was 8, not 6, she could probably do it on her own; however, given that I still have to floss her teeth and my teeth even after using this, its pointless to actually have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you have money to spend and have the time, you wont be disappointed with the machine. But its not suited for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS the machine does feel a bit cheap, but they have a warranty and it does work well. I bet it would last for the value.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a great product to rid your gums of gunk!</li>
            <li> this product is okay in my opinion but it is SOOOOOOOO  ugly. the stickers are pointless. im 14 and my mom got this for me its whatever. i prefer the non kids one 100x more</li>
            <li> What a great purchase for any member of the family.  My Granddaughter asked for this for Christmas and was thrilled with it.  It is so easy to use you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my 8 year old daughter. The cord is way too short and it&#x27;s very loud!  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s meant for children, but if you can resist the urge to deploy the included stickers, no one will ever know that. It does the same job as well as the adult versions, though the water container is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word, however: do what you must to prevent your child from using the most powerful setting. A very strong jet of water is produced, possibly strong enough to be painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that caveat, I&#x27;d have no problems at all with recommending this device to parents, for their children. (Or with telling them to buy it for themselves.)</li>
            <li> This works perfectly for my son who just got braces.  The adjustable pressure is great and he liked being able to decorate the unit with the vinyl clings.  The only thing I wish it had was a cover for the top where the water goes.  Other than that, it is a great product! Highly recommend for kids.</li>
            <li> Best buy! Just like the big one but small and great for travel. strong power and has same effect as the large size home style.&lt;br /&gt;Not just for kids!</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it did not work because when I had water in the lid, I did not press down hard enough on the lid when I attached it to the base. Once I pushed the lid firmly down, it worked. If someone else tells you the waterpik did not work, maybe this could be the reason..</li>
            <li> Product works great. Not as noisy as some previous reviews have described. BUT I am upset that I DID NOT RECEIVE MY STICKERS! :(</li>
            <li> Getting my child to floss has not been easy, and I knew it&#x27;d be even harder when we started orthodontia, so we wanted to give this a try.  It&#x27;s worked out great!  It makes flossing fun, and is particularly helpful when things get stuck in all the mouth gear.  No braces experience yet, but when they&#x27;re installed soon, I believe this will work so much better than trying to thread dental floss through the wires.</li>
            <li> I just used this thing, and full blast is REALLY full blast!  I&#x27;m not sure a kid could handle it. I&#x27;ll probably use it at a 2.5 rather than a 3 setting.  It was a great price and small, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try rather than buy the adult version after reading several reviews for this model.  My first try was hilarious.  I had water going onto my glasses and the bathroom mirror.  Oops.  I gave it a go again, knowing what to expect, and a piece of popcorn hull (is that what it&#x27;s called?) came out.  I thought I&#x27;d flossed well between now, Thursday, and Tuesday, when I had the popcorn.  So it&#x27;s kinda gross that the waterpik shot that last piece out of my teeth 2 days later.  That makes me think this is the way to go.  I hope it holds up.  Amazon had it at a better price than WalMart at the date of my purchase, and I had 2 extra piks delivered as well since I&#x27;ll be sharing with hubby and one kid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior, not a kid. I love this compact unit; it travels with me when I am in this country. The color cheers me. Thanks for showing me this possibility.</li>
            <li> great product for kids!</li>
            <li> Bought it for a small bathroom where it does the same good job my regular size one does.  Opted not to affix the decals.</li>
            <li> This is not just for kids.  My wife and I use it daily and love it. The tank seems a bit smaller than the adult units but seems just right for us.  We bought this because it was less expensive than the others but glad we did. This was a replacement for a full size unit that died after several years but we are happy with this one and would not go back to the full size.</li>
            <li> Works well but it has a lot smaller container than the adult version which no one seemed to say before I bought it.</li>
            <li> Worked just fine for about 5 weeks.  Then stopped working.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my seven year old granddaughter who was getting bad reviews from her dentist no matter how much she brushed and did not drink soda or eat candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter reports she had her first successful check up AND that her new hobby is Dental Hygiene!  My granddaughter told me that she LOVES the stickers too!</li>
            <li> I bought this to get my 3 year old more excited about taking care of her teeth, and also to give it a try for myself as I&#x27;ve heard good things about Waterpik vs. dental floss.  Overall, I really like this product, and my kid likes it and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very small, takes up very little room on the counter, and the tank can be stored over the motor so no worries about dust.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with a regular tip and one that is like a very tiny brush (I think it&#x27;s for braces) and both really work to remove gunk&lt;br /&gt;-The stickers are cute and are removable.  So it can be redecorated as often as your kid likes.&lt;br /&gt;-Speed 1 is good for kids, I use speed 2 which pulses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The tank isn&#x27;t covered.&lt;br /&gt;-The tank is very small.&lt;br /&gt;-It takes some practice!!!  I first thought the button on the front of the handle was like a stop/start feature; it&#x27;s not.  The water comes and you have to be prepared.  Much to my child&#x27;s delight, our first attempt to use it became an impromptu run-through-the-sprinkler-like experience (this actually isn&#x27;t much of a con, just be aware it might take a little getting used to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and I feel that already my teeth and gums are a bit better.  It&#x27;s definitely worked to keep my daughter into her teeth- as soon as she&#x27;s done eating, she wants to spray her teeth.</li>
            <li> It is really great - the size is so manageable and it works just as well as the other Waterpik flossers I have had over the years (3). I only wish it had a lid, but that is not a deal breaker. You can turn it over but it is so much easier to just keep it right side up.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much out of this little thing. In fact, it was much smaller than I anticipated! But it packs a punch. So much so that in learning to use it on low I accidentally hit my tonsils and popped out a tonsil stone! Which is actually exactly what I bought it for. Very happy with the product and I am sure it will make a huge difference in my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> My kids (8 and 5) need help filling the tank, but can otherwise waterpik their own teeth with this.  Seems to get the hardest spots pretty well.  The tip is easily exchanged, so it&#x27;s easy to use it for both kids.  We haven&#x27;t put it to a long-term test yet, but we&#x27;ve had it a few weeks, and the hardware seems rugged.</li>
            <li> Thank Heavens! Why didn&#x27;t I think of this before, I remember my parents using one and loved using it. This is a life saver to get kids flossing! Works great, I like that it has the adjustable speeds...I bought a different one for my daughter and it was way too powerful for her with no adjustment to pressure, so I&#x27;ll be getting this one again for her. My 7 year old son finally gets it done everyday!</li>
            <li> I tried to share my water flosser with my son, but he needs a different pressure, and I hate swapping picks for him.  So I got this for him, and he is not selfsufficient. Unfortunately the motor stopped working after 9 months.  I will contact the warranty people. But this thing has many issues.  The pics are fragile and ware out easily (3 mo). Its more difficult for a child to angle the stream than adult oral irrigators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Net-net, stick with an adult oral irrigator with an adjustable pressure.  Cute on the outside, junk on the inside.</li>
            <li> Gift for granddaughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. I bought it for my 8 yr old grandson. My daughter said she would need to rebrush his teeth because he would never do a good job (even with an electric/battery toothbrush) since getting the waterpik he spends more time using it than he did just flossing and brushing...My daughter is very happy as well.</li>
            <li> My 10yo son just got a fixed palate expander, and I was dubious when our doc said get a WaterPik.  But this thing really does help him get out the food that gets stuck between the retainer and the top of his mouth.</li>
            <li> We like that it is small, easy to care for and store on bathroom counter.  Works great.  Be careful if you are a first time user.  Water pressure is a bit strong for tonsil and &amp;#34;back of throat&amp;#34; cleansing.  Great for teeth and gum cleaning.  Awesome squirt gun....Ummmm disregard......&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if Amazon advertised the product and its different tips and features together.  (I see the link to other products, but products need to be compatible; would be nice if somehow you could tell if they are all compatible.)</li>
            <li> I live in China, so I was so happy to find this dual-voltage model.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my 90 year old mother-in-law. She didn&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles, just something easy to use and which would do the job.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 7 year old who just got braces. She can operate it without any assistance from me. She doesn&#x27;t even get the sink or mirror wet. It is very easy to use and handle. Only thing it&#x27;s missing is a pause button.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this twice a day before brushing her teeth. She has braces and she says it gets all the &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; food out before she brushes her teeth. She loves it!</li>
            <li> Amazing for my daughter with braces</li>
            <li> The whole family uses this, but mom and dad are now in the market for their own! My kids can use this on their own (6 &amp; 8) and I&#x27;m curious to see what the dentist says on their next visit! It works great, in my opinion the water reservoir is ample, even though it is smaller than the adult size. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great Waterpik for both kids and adults~ bought one for me and one for our 5 year old grandson who manages it perfectly! And, of course, he loves the removable stickers! Dentist says teeth look great!</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose little hard to control.</li>
            <li> Got this for my grandson he is 9 . Asked for one for his birthday and has arrived. Very nice and good price.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT IN MAY 2014, DIED DEC 2014.    Update: I contacted Waterpik and they replaced item for free. I just sent them my invoice..customer service excellent for company, I will see how long this second one lasts!</li>
            <li> this is the same as the travel one for adults, but its a different color and commes with stickers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works good and kids seem to like having kid stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this a replacement for a regular size Waterpik that sprang a leak in the tubing.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the smaller one would work for me and it is ok.  But, it does not come with a cover for&lt;br /&gt;over the water chamber.&lt;br /&gt;I looked through the box several times for one and then realized it does not come with a cover.&lt;br /&gt;So am not completely satisfied.  Now wish I had ordered the regular size.</li>
            <li> Great for children who have braces</li>
            <li> very pleased w/pressure. would recommend</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is not only fun to decorate but works excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to set-up&lt;br /&gt;-The green part is open on top so you can fill the water to your desired level, and then dump when finished.&lt;br /&gt;-It has a varying degree of strength so you may choose how strong you would like the water stream.&lt;br /&gt;-It comes with two glass piks so you can choose the size, based on the child&#x27;s age. The larger the hole the more water comes out. I feel smaller teeth need the smaller pik.&lt;br /&gt;-Plugs in to the wall. This is a great feature because many of the battery operated piks die and you cannot fix them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great quality for the money. There are several piks that cost more. But, you do not need to buy them when this one is a great quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> A good machine sturdy and efficient. My son asks to floss now.</li>
            <li> good. Good prize for a portable unit.</li>
            <li> I bot a second one.  Good appliance</li>
            <li> Would have preferred a lid.  Purchase for seven year old grandson</li>
            <li> Love, this is good for an older person or when you don&#x27;t have much counter space.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact. Easy to clean. 8 year old child uses it well after a bit of training with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for your kids if they are not fans of flossing.  Using warm water, it&#x27;s a comfortable and easy tool!</li>
            <li> I was trying to get away with something a bit cheaper for my son, but I really shouldn&#x27;t have. I love *my* waterpik, which is a different model (I&#x27;m sorry I bought it elsewhere and don&#x27;t remember the name of the model) it&#x27;s water basin is larger, it has a lid which holds all of the vaioius attachments it came with, and best of all it has a little button on the handheld part, that allows the user to turn the stream of water on and off, or pause it really, to be more accurate.  AND I have to tell you, I would get cavities sometimes, because I am prone to them (even though I brush two to three times a day and floss) and after I started using the Waterpik every day I stopped getting cavities.  So this review is not against ALL Waterpiks, just this one. Mine is SO much easier to use than this kid&#x27;s waterpik!&lt;br /&gt;The only way to turn the stream of water on and off is at the base, which means my son has to put the water pick in his mouth, with one hand, use his other hand to turn it on and then turn it off without moving the waterpik out of his mouth.  This was really tricky to get used to.  I couldn&#x27;t even do it at first because I was so used to my handy dandy nicer waterpik with the easy wand button feature.&lt;br /&gt;Also this is SO small.  It is lightweight and just seems really junky compared to the nicer big ones with lids, also I worry about more germs getting into the basin since it doesn&#x27;t have a lid.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter just LOVES this product.&lt;br /&gt;We have had problems getting her to floss her teeth.  She complained of it hurting and was freaked out by occasional bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been awesome! It has 3 settings on it, from very soft to mildly hard (she can use as she grows, currently using setting 1) She is able to turn the product on and off herself and enjoys it so much that she asks to use it multiple times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She enjoyed decorating the unit, and is thrilled to have her own little &amp;#34;dentist toy&amp;#34;.  It has encouraged a healthy smile.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I bought this waterpik for my grandson.  This works much better than trying to get him to floss.  He loves using it!</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it to clean her braces and it works great.  Would recommend for anyone who has a child with braces.</li>
            <li> I am an adult and this is the third waterpik I have bought.  The previous ones were the ultra ones for adults.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to save a little money and see what I thought of this after reading reviews by other adults using it.&lt;br /&gt;It is just fine, much smaller, and the only downside is refilling the water to finish.  No big deal, very cute, I just&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t use the stickers on mine (smile)</li>
            <li> With our small bathroom this size water flosser is perfect.  I like it and my toddler likes it too though she makes a mess :)</li>
            <li> Get this if you planned on buying the WP-300; it&#x27;s the same product and even says so at the bottom. It just has a different color scheme and no travel case, but a much lower price tag. I also love the compact form factor in my bathroom and the water pressure it has. The water tank fits over the main case when traveling, and it works with 110V and 220V. In addition, you get all kinds of tips for it pretty much everywhere, which is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the grandkids.  I don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have a pause button on the handle, so once they start using it and take it out of their mouth it goes everywhere.</li>
            <li> This works great for my daughter who just got braces.  It is easy for her to use.</li>
            <li> Just the solution for someone who lives alone.  No need to put the decals on…does a good job without taking up much counter space as full size waterpik does.</li>
            <li> My daughter has retainers crooked teeth and has a bi lateral cleft lip way better to use than the bristle brushes</li>
            <li> We got it for our daughter when she got braces, but now everybody uses it. It&#x27;s perfect, small enough that you can take it with you when you travel. We got this model also because other reviews said that it&#x27;s dual voltage, ie it can be used in Europe, but we havent tested it yet. Also it takes standard orthodontic tips (sold for the regular model, not specifically for this kids&#x27;s one). Though it&#x27;s a model &amp;#34;for kids&amp;#34;,  it&#x27;s just great for grown ups too. It has 3 speeds, speed 3 is too strong for me; 2 is just right. My only regret is that the tips don&#x27;t come in different colors so that each member of the family could easily recognize their own. Very good product.</li>
