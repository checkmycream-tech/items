            <li>and it also came in a squirt bottle which I like much, much better.  </li>
            <li>I love Wen products but don&#x27;t like that you have to have recurrent orders and the shipping is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Like it much better than the Lavender or the Mint Almond smell.  </li>
            <li>Love Wen products.  </li>

            <li>My favorite scent is the 6/13</li>
            <li>My winter favorite is the pumpkin.</li>
            <li>I keep 3 varieties in the shower now, depending on the mood :-)</li>
            <li>However, having healthy hair from the root also helps.  </li>
            <li>I am able to put in pin curls (bobby pins) and go to sleep.  </li>
            <li>but that would be a litttle more work.  </li>
            <li>I started using Wen cleansing conditioning products about a year ago - my fine hair has never been more healthy and shiny</li>
            <li>Great product, buying it from amazon helps eliminate the over priced nightmare going through Chaz directly</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to find just the items I wanted on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I found this styling cream easy to use</li>
            <li>when I started using Wen I liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for fine hair that needs additional body.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it</li>
            <li>Bought this WEN by mistake, thought I purchased the 16 oz conditioning shampoo at a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li>This styling cream not only helps keep the curls in, it is also a great defrizzer.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have celiac disease and wen has a gluten free.  </li>
            <li>is growing for the first time in many years.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had so many people if I had done anything to it as the color is more red and shiny!  </li>
            <li>It feels good on my hair, and gives it some body and holds the shape when I blow it dry.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair and this styling creme</li>
            <li>Results with the pomegranate are great, I&#x27;m just not a huge fan of the scent- seems waxy??</li>
            <li>This is the first time&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I really like it!  </li>
            <li>Hard to find a good hair product&lt;</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply the styling creme to soaking wet hair.</li>
            <li>pump does not work - very disappointing&lt;</li>
            <li>Ty recvd fast.</li>

            <li>I had hair that grew fast.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without wen styling creme.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the one product thing,  but with my fine hair, it gets too limp &amp; greasy if I don&#x27;t use a high quality shampoo 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>This WEN product is fantastic to protect your hair from all the heat styling tools subject your hair to.</li>
            <li>In speaking with my wife she has only positive things to say about this styling creme.  </li>
            <li>I do a press with warm, not very hot irons using a little coconut oil to protect my strands.  </li>
            <li>pleasantly surprised to smell it.  </li>
            <li>(My natural color - I never died my hair</li>
            <li>It allows me to do a couple really natural things.  </li>
            <li>Wen allowed me to grow out my natural hair which is a soft as cotton.  </li>
            <li>tends to make it too soft and flat.  </li>

            <li> Since switching to Wen products a few years ago, my hair has become thicker, less frizzy, and much healthier.</li>
            <li> and I only use the cleansing donditioner and not the other products and don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming again and again.  </li>
            <li> Do not towel dry...</li>

            <li> I had tried the green tea a while back</li>
            <li> I travel extensively so the shampoo all in one would be optimal but unfortunately did not quite live up to the infomercial.</li>
            <li> i have tried other when products</li>
            <li> but I caught a couple looks the other day.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair volume and bounce and does not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I find this product to be less than desirable for my type hair.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was less and when I compared it was cheaper to</li>

            <li> Can use a little less than recommended.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about the shampoo</li>
            <li> Not to mention this product dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li> then I follow directions with the wen and once I have cleansed again I rinse for a long time with tepid and then cold water.</li>
            <li> I do a very long cold water pre wash with nothing on my hair.  </li>
            <li> when that failed I tried it was a balm for before blow drying which just left it oily and difficult to run my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced imediate results, as I did with this Styling Creme.  </li>
            <li> I began with unhealthy hair and hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I think they are the worse.  </li>

            <li> I hate the stiff and sticky feeling of a lot of the hair products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> The pomegranate fragrance isn&#x27;t good. My hair doesn&#x27;t like it either.&lt;br /&gt;Have tried the conditioner/shampoo. Hard to find a good hair product&lt;br /&gt;my hair likes.</li>
            <li> Great product... I love the Wen line of hair and skin products... It&#x27;s all I use...  Make sure you apply the styling creme to soaking wet hair. Do not towel dry...</li>
            <li> I have never experienced imediate results, as I did with this Styling Creme.  I am telling all of my friends about this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this WEN by mistake, thought I purchased the 16 oz conditioning shampoo at a fantastic price.  Product was a tad pricey, as most WEN products however I can&#x27;t complain...my hair loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I hate the stiff and sticky feeling of a lot of the hair products I&#x27;ve tried.  This takes away my frizz and makes my curly hair curlier, and leaves my hair feeling like my regular hair.  Pomegranate is the mildest of the Wen scents, so it&#x27;s my favorite.  Since switching to Wen products a few years ago, my hair has become thicker, less frizzy, and much healthier.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be out with my Wen products, the only product I use on my hair. Find my hair is a lot healthier now</li>
            <li> Works well to prep my hair for blow drying</li>
            <li> It was somewhat difficult to use and it had a not so pleasing aroma, so I returned it, it was pricey as well.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells; best of all the scents in this product line.  Can use a little less than recommended.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t as damaged from heat anymore. People tell me that my hair is so shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> i have tried other when products so i tried this and i liked it, but its too pricy, can&#x27;t affort to get it all the time</li>
            <li> I love the Wen line of cleanising conditioners and so the styling creme is a nice finish.  It gives my hair volume and bounce and does not weigh it down.  Great product.</li>

            <li> I love Wen products. This styling cream not only helps keep the curls in, it is also a great defrizzer.</li>
            <li> I started using Wen cleansing conditioning products about a year ago - my fine hair has never been more healthy and shiny&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to use a lot of product on my hair as it \\&quot;gums\\&quot; up my scalp - so just the cleansing and styling products do it for me -</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed by the Styling Creme.  I was looking forward to a product that could manage my frizzy/curly hair... but this was NOT it.  My hair remained frizzy and took out some of my curls making my hair look like a frizzy mess.  Not to mention this product dried out my hair.  I tried using the creme to air dry and when that failed I tried it was a balm for before blow drying which just left it oily and difficult to run my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> this is the best shampoo I use it on a regular basis dont even need the conditoner softens hair ggod</li>
            <li> This WEN product is fantastic to protect your hair from all the heat styling tools subject your hair to. There has been such a difference in my hair since I started using this product!</li>
            <li> What is this product supposed to do?  I use it and see no difference in my hair than if I forget to use it.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about the pomegranate styling creme.  It smells great and keeps my hair looking shiny and beautiful.  I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I was using another &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; but when I saw they had the same as the shampoo that I was using I decided to use it and it also came in a squirt bottle which I like much, much better.  It feels good on my hair, and gives it some body and holds the shape when I blow it dry.</li>
            <li> pump does not work - very disappointing&lt;br /&gt;would like a replacement please</li>
            <li> Ty recvd fast. Can&#x27;t live without wen styling creme. Pleasure to do bus with.&lt;br /&gt;Have a great day&lt;br /&gt;Lori&lt;br /&gt;Ty</li>
            <li> I find this product to be less than desirable for my type hair.  I have fine straight hair and this styling creme tends to make it too soft and flat.  I would not recommend it for fine hair that needs additional body.</li>
            <li> In speaking with my wife she has only positive things to say about this styling creme.  You do pay a premium for it, but this is one product that she uses regualarly.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to regular conditioner.  Makes hair silky and manageable.  This is the first time&lt;br /&gt;I have used the styling cream. What&#x27;s not to like!</li>
            <li> I love Wen products but don&#x27;t like that you have to have recurrent orders and the shipping is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;This product came quickly and in good condition. The shipping was less and when I compared it was cheaper to&lt;br /&gt;order from this supplier. The Pomegranate does not have gluten in it, so that is why I wanted it.  Then when I got it&lt;br /&gt;was pleasantly surprised to smell it.  It has a very light fruity aroma but not overtaking and you don&#x27;t smell it after you&lt;br /&gt;put it on.  Like it much better than the Lavender or the Mint Almond smell.  Will definitely order from this supplier again.</li>
            <li> Great product, buying it from amazon helps eliminate the over priced nightmare going through Chaz directly</li>
            <li> Love Wen products.  Nice to know that Pomegranate is Gluten Free!</li>
            <li> Gives my hair volume.  I have fine hair but a lot of it but without products it is flat and lifeless.  I found this styling cream easy to use and I love the way my hair looks after I blow it out.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product, I love all of Chaz Dean&#x27;s WEN hair products, my hair has never felt so soft and looked to great!  I&#x27;m a 60 year old woman with dark auburn hair and I&#x27;ve had so many people if I had done anything to it as the color is more red and shiny!  (My natural color - I never died my hair and I&#x27;m very fortunate not to have turned gray).</li>
            <li> works well with the cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li> Ive used various Wen products for over a year now. Basically the best conditioners ever. I&#x27;ve tried the one product thing,  but with my fine hair, it gets too limp &amp; greasy if I don&#x27;t use a high quality shampoo 2-3 times a week. Since I used to shampoo every day, I&#x27;m delighted with 3x week. I travel extensively so the shampoo all in one would be optimal but unfortunately did not quite live up to the infomercial. Results with the pomegranate are great, I&#x27;m just not a huge fan of the scent- seems waxy?? That being said I bought the styling cream LOVE it. I get 2 days out of one wash &amp; style. My favorite scent is the 6/13 and I get the best results. My hairdresser thought I was crazy but has seen the results in the condition of my hair so now she doesn&#x27;t try to get me to use the salon brands. My winter favorite is the pumpkin. I keep 3 varieties in the shower now, depending on the mood :-) really like this product.</li>
            <li> Product had great results. Only problem I found was the amount of product used for one application. Otherwise great results.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve heard from many people that Wen products are great.  I was a little unsure about the shampoo so I started with the styling cream and I really like it!  It doesn&#x27;t weight down my fine thin hair and when I use it blow drying my hair doesn&#x27;t take as long</li>
            <li> I began with unhealthy hair and hair loss.  I am using couple different things to help with hair growth, including honey and castor oil on a disappearing bald spot.  However, having healthy hair from the root also helps.  when I started using Wen I liked it very much.  Over the months It has become my crutch.  It allows me to do a couple really natural things.  I do a very long cold water pre wash with nothing on my hair.  then I follow directions with the wen and once I have cleansed again I rinse for a long time with tepid and then cold water. I am black american and I have permed my hair for years.  Wen allowed me to grow out my natural hair which is a soft as cotton.  I do a press with warm, not very hot irons using a little coconut oil to protect my strands.  I am able to put in pin curls (bobby pins) and go to sleep.  I wake up with hair that moves and my hair is growing for the first time in many years.  Now, it may be my imagination but it seems tohave stopped greying.  I am 70 with beautiful hair.  I have celiac disease and wen has a gluten free.  I had tried the green tea a while back and I did not like it as much.  I also sleep on a satin pillow.  I am not a cougar but I caught a couple looks the other day.  I threw my hair and told my husband. Try it for three or four months, try different kinds of wen and then evaluate it.  I hated perms.  I think they are the worse.  I also can wear my hair without pressing.  I could probably have curls  but that would be a litttle more work.  I like Amazon because I don&#x27;t have to have a wen subscription and I only use the cleansing donditioner and not the other products and don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming again and again.  I hope this is not a problem for the inventor. My hair is down to my shoulders after it had been short and wiry.  Growing up I had hair that grew fast.  It is back.[[ASIN:B004GAOMAO WEN by Chaz Dean Pomegranate Cleansing Conditioner 16 oz]]</li>
