            <li> I bought these and the paw prints a while ago...I used one of the lady bugs it took me about an hour to get it off the paper... and put it on my nail so I just stopped there and put the others away to hard to get off the paper:-(</li>

            <li> I though these were cute. You have to cut these out, peel the back off, and then stick them on your nails. I coated clear coat to seal onto my nail. But the small ladybugs are kind of hard to cut and peel, so that is where I dropped a star.</li>
            <li> This is such a cute accent to fingernails. Adds fun to plain nails. Order came on time &amp; of high quality.</li>
            <li> These Ladybug stickers are so delicate and small. Like all these I have bought they really hard to get off the backing paper.&lt;br /&gt; If you like ladybugs I would suggest trying these. The smallest look good on little girls</li>

            <li> Cute but you have to be very very careful pulling them off the paper.  Patience is key to these stickers.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to use and almost impossible to put it on right. I recommend u just to get normal nail stickers</li>
            <li> Have not used these yet.  Been experiementing with other creations.  I have used stickers before and liked them. Will order more.</li>
