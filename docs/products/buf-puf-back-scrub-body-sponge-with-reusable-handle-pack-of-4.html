            <li>o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to find these for YEARS -</li>
            <li>I had one of these many years ago</li>
            <li>Plan to order more for Christmas stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li>I love this for many reasons:  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s inexpensive; it&#x27;s lightweight; it works much better than a brush-style scrubber.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Buf Puf for quite awhile, and love it.</li>
            <li>love these..</li>

            <li>They do a great job and allow you to reach places that are normally a stretch.</li>
            <li>Perfect scrubber fior the single lady.</li>
            <li>They do the job well for my skin over most scrubbing products and absorb soaps well and clean and rinse easily.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use and change.</li>
            <li>Still work great for your back.</li>
            <li>This is a great exfoliating back and body scrubber.  </li>
            <li>but it does NOT look cheap at all.</li>
            <li>Leaves you skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>What else can be said about the original Buf-Pufs that everyone hasn&#x27;t already said?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it again.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, the first thing I wanted to see is the reusable handle. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even got hubby hooked on using one because it makes him feel so clean.</li>
            <li>When you are done using it, you just pull it off, dispose of it, and put a clean pad</li>
            <li>Great product even though the handle is now cheaply made would love to have my old original back.  </li>
            <li>This is really good for washing your back and exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>It has smoothed the sides of my feet very nicely, and they were really rough and peeling before using this Buf-Puf.</li>
            <li>That was over 15 years ago, and since then, I have been a loyal consumer of Buf-Puf bath products.</li>
            <li>Sponge refills are easy to find on Amazon and reasonably priced, and what else can I say?</li>
            <li>a jar opener and any single lady is good to go.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to use either side of the BufPuf but switching on the handle  is a little bit of a drawback</li>
            <li>Also, synthetic material makes it much easier to clean after each use to prevent mildew or mold growth.  </li>
            <li>Very good product for that extra dry skin and</li>
            <li>I can now easily reach my back and clean it properly. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>The handle makes it easy to reach my back, neck, legs and any other body parts that need a good, invigorating scrub.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I love the Buf~Puf small face sponges, but this larger pad on a back scrubber handle is so wonderful!  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both love Buf-Puf back scrub body sponges with handle.  </li>
            <li>Sensitive skins may want to start out light and slow, but will find the benefits are great</li>
            <li>Works OK, but the handle is a bit short.</li>
            <li>Oh, well, I guess if the first handle breaks I will have replacements.</li>
            <li>I really love the way it scrubs my back.</li>
            <li>The sponge is not as exfoliant as I would like and the handle it&#x27;s attached to is not long enough  to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>It came with the blue side out, so I tried this side first, and found it to be perfect for all the areas that needed serious buffing.</li>
            <li>Each of these packages contains one large two sided synthetic buf pufs with a two piece</li>
            <li>If you plan on buying this, don&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li>Notice I said the whole family in my title...</li>
            <li>works well and exfoliation is very thorough.</li>
            <li>The pads really hold up very well.  </li>
            <li>I like that the scrubbers have a gentle and a \\&quot;not as gentle\\&quot; side ...</li>
            <li>I have missed these so much - really ...</li>
            <li>Love how rough the sponge is.</li>
            <li>The sponge is very good for rough elbows and heels, and if you have an oily back &amp; chest like I do, mixing it with a bit of anti-bacterial soap and letting the foam sit on the skin for a few minutes so that you get the full anti bacterial effect is very helpful in preventing acne.</li>
            <li>Fits the handle and works as the original for back scrubbing.</li>
            <li>You have your choice on the two sides of this scrubber: One side is more exfoliating than the other.</li>
            <li>The sponges have two sides for -gentle or - a little more abrasive.  </li>
            <li>back and arms haven&#x27;t felt this soft and smooth in awhile.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used them for years (possibly 20 - could it be?), but always could easily purchase them at my local Pharmacy store; however,now they do not carry them.  </li>
            <li>Disposable scrub pads, so you can start new when you need to.  </li>
            <li>To me, it is the only way to clean your back.</li>
            <li>I never felt like I was able to get all those hard to reach places with this.</li>
            <li>the handle makes reaching all those areas on your back much easier.</li>
            <li>I actually use it on my whole  body</li>
            <li>It lasts pretty long, but I change once a month for sanitary reasons.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These pads work very well on your back, but you can also use them on your legs and arms.  </li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job of exfoliating and removing the dead skin.  </li>
            <li>This particular bundle comes with four individually boxed scrubber handles and pads --</li>
            <li>I am older &amp; have some arthritis issues, so I hoped this would make it easier to wash my back.</li>
            <li>handle with a curve top to hang, which is sturdy but flexible plastic and holds the flat oval sponge with small teeth.  </li>
            <li>After fighting with it to scrub my back a few times, I went back to my trusty scrubbing glove since I have more control with that.</li>
            <li>It is on a handle which is nice to reach areas on the back the girlfriend normally has to get, but it is not substantial, there is not much to hold onto, and as it wears away over time it leaves the hard plastic hooks on the hook where the pad adheres to exposed.  </li>
            <li>Those come in regular and one for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The only back scrub that really does the job for me and my entire family.</li>
            <li>I am always reading how important it is to exfoliate your skin, so I was trying to find a product long enough for me to reach down my</li>
            <li>/&gt;These Back Scrubbers are terrific - EASY to use - durable - the handle is just long enough to reach all those places on your back but not so long it&#x27;s a nuisance and not so short</li>
            <li>Very smart idea, although it is not inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;There is a long plastic stick with 2 sharp prongs on it, that gets installed inside the pad.  </li>
            <li>Blue side is pretty rough so be careful!</li>

            <li> The handle is about a foot long and provides enough reach to cover your back and shoulders.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good product for that extra dry skin and the handle makes reaching all those areas on your back much easier.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years and my current one was worn out.  I looked in stores to replace it but couldn&#x27;t find.  Therefore, I am very happy with order and now have extras on hand.  This was a really great buy.</li>
            <li> Fits the handle and works as the original for back scrubbing.</li>
            <li> You have your choice on the two sides of this scrubber: One side is more exfoliating than the other. Easy to replace on your handle, it provides an excellent way to care for your skin. Be sure to try Buf-puf for the face. Those come in regular and one for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The only back scrub that really does the job for me and my entire family.</li>
            <li> Wonderful  Too expensive though.  Why can&#x27;t we buy refills in retail stores locally like  Walgreens,etc?  When we asked in Walgreens they just looked at us as if we  were Martians1 We are not.</li>
            <li> I use my buf-puf back scrub body sponge when i take a shower. I would recamend it to anyone its great</li>
            <li> I had to replace this item due to my dog playing with it and chewing it up.  This is the best item for bathing in a tub or shower.  It makes your skin feel so smooth and soft.  I havent had to use any lotions after bathing.  its the best</li>
            <li> Just my opinion.  It is on a handle which is nice to reach areas on the back the girlfriend normally has to get, but it is not substantial, there is not much to hold onto, and as it wears away over time it leaves the hard plastic hooks on the hook where the pad adheres to exposed.  Meh, but I guess everyone else likes it...</li>
            <li> This product is basically a sponge on a too short stick.  The sponge is not as exfoliant as I would like and the handle it&#x27;s attached to is not long enough  to do a good job.  If you plan on buying this, don&#x27;t expect much.  I feel it&#x27;s not worth the purchase price and I will keep looking for a back brush which actually works well and is solidly constructed.  Unfortunately, this is not it.</li>
            <li> This works better for me than the typical brush style, or loufa but seems to be almost impossible to find at the usual outlets so save time and buy it on line.  Each of these packages contains one large two sided synthetic buf pufs with a two piece click together  handle with a curve top to hang, which is sturdy but flexible plastic and holds the flat oval sponge with small teeth.  The sponges have two sides for -gentle or - a little more abrasive.  They do the job well for my skin over most scrubbing products and absorb soaps well and clean and rinse easily.  And the handle is long enough to  almost reach the lower back. ..a good product and worth the price.  This four pack-  will last me for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Oh, this is a fabulous product!  I love the Buf~Puf small face sponges, but this larger pad on a back scrubber handle is so wonderful!  I actually use it on my whole  body so I don&#x27;t have to bend as much, and it feels soooo good!  I just love the invigorating feeling I get, like all the blood in my body is circulating better. And my skin is softer because all the dead skin cells are scrubbed off, making it easier for the skin to absorb moisturizers. The hook on the end makes hanging it in the shower very easy.</li>
            <li> I have an immense issue with dead skin cells, so I was always in the market for the B.B.D.(Bigger Better deal)when it came to body scrubbers. The search ended when I bought the Buf-Puf Body Scrubber at an Albertson&#x27;s grocery store in College Station, TX. That was over 15 years ago, and since then, I have been a loyal consumer of Buf-Puf bath products. It&#x27;s just unfortunate that this particular item is no longer sold in grocery stores or pharmacy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I wanted this back scrub to work, but it has fatal flaws in the manufacturing and some in the design. It comes apart at the handle joint no matter how hard you press that joint in and did so 3 times during my first use. The sponge itself is of good size and does the job but the handle is way too short and for some reason has a curve at the end, the function of which is yet to be determined.</li>
            <li> I like using these. They are easy to use and change. The sponges are 2 sided. One side is rougher than the other. Great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love Buf-Puf back scrub body sponges with handle.  We&#x27;ve used them for years (possibly 20 - could it be?), but always could easily purchase them at my local Pharmacy store; however,now they do not carry them.  I was delighted when I saw Amazon sells them.  My current scrub-brush needed replacing. To me, it is the only way to clean your back.</li>
            <li> Great product even though the handle is now cheaply made would love to have my old original back.  Product sponge is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Suggested by my dermatologist.  Sturdier handle than I anticipated after reading other reviews.  Blue side is pretty rough so be careful!</li>
            <li> This product is great for exfoliating your skin in the shower.  The handle is about a foot long and provides enough reach to cover your back and shoulders.  The pad is relatively course, on par with a natural sponge, but doesn&#x27;t get dull after repeated use.  Also, synthetic material makes it much easier to clean after each use to prevent mildew or mold growth.  This particular bundle comes with four individually boxed scrubber handles and pads -- so you, your spouse, and your two children can each have your own!</li>
            <li> This was one of the best products on the market for really cleaning your body ..Too bad you can no longer find it in the stores</li>
            <li> Perfect scrubber fior the single lady. The buff puff can be replaced as needed. Only objection&lt;br /&gt;was having to buy 4 to make the order, but they made handy gifts..  A back scrubber&lt;br /&gt;and a jar opener and any single lady is good to go.</li>
            <li> Notice I said the whole family in my title... That&#x27;s why I got this multi pack. One for each of us so no cooties are spread. :-) The handle makes it easy to reach my back, neck, legs and any other body parts that need a good, invigorating scrub. I&#x27;ve even got hubby hooked on using one because it makes him feel so clean. The sponge is very good for rough elbows and heels, and if you have an oily back &amp; chest like I do, mixing it with a bit of anti-bacterial soap and letting the foam sit on the skin for a few minutes so that you get the full anti bacterial effect is very helpful in preventing acne. Sensitive skins may want to start out light and slow, but will find the benefits are great and you&#x27;ll get used to it. Sponge refills are easy to find on Amazon and reasonably priced, and what else can I say? It works!</li>
            <li> After fighting with it to scrub my back a few times, I went back to my trusty scrubbing glove since I have more control with that. I never felt like I was able to get all those hard to reach places with this. Good idea but not so utilitarian.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  been using these Buf-Puf scrubbers for years. They do a great job and allow you to reach places that are normally a stretch.</li>
            <li> This is really good for washing your back and exfoliating.  I misread the description and thought i was getting the replacement sponges. I like the fact that it has 2 sides. I&#x27;ll definintely order these again.</li>
            <li> have had some acne on back which i never had before. Wanted to try this to get those hard to reach places and it does the trick. The handle is a cinch to put together as well. works well and exfoliation is very thorough. It lasts pretty long, but I change once a month for sanitary reasons.</li>
            <li> Works OK, but the handle is a bit short. Somewhat difficult to reach one area in the center of my back. I am older &amp; have some arthritis issues, so I hoped this would make it easier to wash my back. It does, but only a little bit. When I ordered it, I thought I was getting one handle &amp; 4 sponges, but what came was 4 handles each with a sponge. Oh, well, I guess if the first handle breaks I will have replacements.</li>
            <li> First quality and great price.  Loved it and loved the price.  The products all arrived timely and were well shipped.</li>
            <li> Still work great for your back. Leaves you skin feeling smooth and clean. Removes dead skin in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I am always reading how important it is to exfoliate your skin, so I was trying to find a product long enough for me to reach down my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had regular back scrubbers, but was told by my dermatologist that they carry a lot of bacteria.  The answer?  Disposable scrub pads, so you can start new when you need to.  Very smart idea, although it is not inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;There is a long plastic stick with 2 sharp prongs on it, that gets installed inside the pad.  When you are done using it, you just pull it off, dispose of it, and put a clean pad on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pads work very well on your back, but you can also use them on your legs and arms.  It does a fantastic job of exfoliating and removing the dead skin.  The pads really hold up very well.  The only downside I have seen is I think the brush could have been a but more sturdy and a couple inches longer.  None the less, I still recommend this product.</li>
            <li> What else can be said about the original Buf-Pufs that everyone hasn&#x27;t already said?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Back Scrubbers are terrific - EASY to use - durable - the handle is just long enough to reach all those places on your back but not so long it&#x27;s a nuisance and not so short you have to be some sort of contortionist to use it. I like that the scrubbers have a gentle and a \\&quot;not as gentle\\&quot; side ... To look at it before assembling the sponge to the sponge head handle(?) - you might think \\&quot;Good cripes, this thing is going to fall off a hundred times during my shower\\&quot; (that&#x27;s what I thought) - but no - hasn&#x27;t fallen off once - not one single time :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to find these for YEARS - then one day I decided to look here on Amazon and voila! Here they are!!! I have missed these so much - really ... there are substitutes out there, but nothing is as good as the original Buf-Puf.</li>
            <li> I had one of these many years ago and I have looked everywhere for it. I was so excited to find it again. This is a great exfoliating back and body scrubber.  It is just as I remembered! Plan to order more for Christmas stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, the first thing I wanted to see is the reusable handle. &#x3D;] It&#x27;s made of plastic but it does NOT look cheap at all. It is separated into two pieces. All you have to do is connect them together. It also has the hook at the end of the handle. I really love the way it scrubs my back. I can now easily reach my back and clean it properly. &#x3D;] Love how rough the sponge is. This is what I was looking for. I felt this same feeling when I was in Japan. ^^,)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD BUY! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!</li>
            <li> I love this for many reasons:  it&#x27;s inexpensive; it&#x27;s lightweight; it works much better than a brush-style scrubber.  In the winter months, it&#x27;s a great back-scratcher, too!</li>
            <li> The handle makes it easier to use the BufPuf sponge on hard to reach places like my back and feet, especially after surgery left me temporarily less flexible.  It is nice to be able to use either side of the BufPuf but switching on the handle  is a little bit of a drawback</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Buf Puf for quite awhile, and love it. I purchased them for my daughter, and daughter in law.  Can I purchase just the refills? I used to get them in my CVS, but haven&#x27;t seen them lately.</li>
            <li> great product, easy to use, nice sturdy handle and  large size and think buff puff pad, great for shower.</li>
            <li> a great body exfoliate...love these..sorry they are no longer available per subscription.</li>
            <li> Although the handle on the Buf-Puf Back Scrub appears short, it proved to be sufficiently long enough to reach all areas, including my back and the bottoms of my feet. It came with the blue side out, so I tried this side first, and found it to be perfect for all the areas that needed serious buffing. It has smoothed the sides of my feet very nicely, and they were really rough and peeling before using this Buf-Puf.</li>
            <li> I use the Buf-Puf Body Sponge to wash and remove dead cells from my back and arms.&lt;br /&gt;This product is wonderful it allows me to reach areas on my back that I can&#x27;t get to with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;My back and arms haven&#x27;t felt this soft and smooth in awhile.  Thank you.</li>
