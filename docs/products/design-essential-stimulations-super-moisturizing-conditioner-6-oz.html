            <li>also just began using straight up coconut oil as a moisturizer and a mix of castor oil and olive oil as sealants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle on scalp.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This product does not work well for me, I may have used too much because my hair felt very greasy after rinsing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for standing by your name.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it ,thumbs up!</li>

            <li>well you live and you learn!</li>
            <li>This product has as one of its main ingredients, mineral oil.</li>
            <li>I do however highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>This makes my girls natural hair very manageable.</li>
            <li>so I can imagine how my hair will be after a few more uses.</li>
            <li>I moved and my new stylist used some \\&quot;crap\\&quot; that made my hair shed a lot and balded my edges.</li>

            <li>I love this conditioner and a lot of the other design essential products.</li>

            <li>Natural and kinky living it</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft after using it.</li>
            <li>Keep hair really soft for the week.  </li>
            <li>Did not leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Natural girls dream product and</li>
            <li>I used it one time and it made the hair soft and shining.</li>
            <li>My hair is manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>I plan to stock up on a few more products from the design essential line!</li>
            <li>I went to empire bueaty school where I was first introduced to the design essential line, so when my hair started to break off due to dryness they where the first line I turned to.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and I have noticed way less breakage</li>
            <li>After one use I noticed a major difference.</li>
            <li>After this experience, I&#x27;ve decided to transition back to natural.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft but I don&#x27;t use this conditioner exclusively from one relaxer to the next.</li>
            <li>I have recently started growing out my natural hair and have been diligent about finding products to ease the \\&quot;growing pains\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It is not cheap but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for anyone with dry natural hair.  </li>
            <li>the Design Essential product line really stimulates your scalp, with a slight tingle feeling.</li>
            <li>If your scalp was burned a little during the process, this conditioner is really, really, REALLY, very soothing as well as moisturizing.</li>

            <li> If your scalp was burned a little during the process, this conditioner is really, really, REALLY, very soothing as well as moisturizing.</li>
            <li> African American hair is hard to manage without the right products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at least on the right track.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised with how thick it was, since I&#x27;ve been trying out new conditioners and the last one (Mane N&#x27; Tail)</li>
            <li> I chose five stars for this because it flat out works.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for the thin edges and bald patches so far</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long but hope it will help with my hair breakage and thinning.</li>
            <li> I use other Design Essential products as well</li>
            <li> Creamy and thick conditioner that will make your natural curl cone to life.</li>
            <li> I applied the product after my normal daily co-wash routine but it left a horrible white residue on my hair that took three rinses to finally get out of my hair completely.</li>
            <li> She has me mix it with a few other products as a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> It does work well for other people I know.</li>
            <li> I use it following my protein treatments to keep my hair from getting hard (so I use it once every 6 weeks or so).</li>
            <li> No, this stuff will stay on your palm even when you turn you hand upside down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got everything NOT recommended for black hair: Mineral Oil, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Parabens, and Urea.</li>
            <li> Its shiny and less tangled.  </li>
            <li> It brings moisture, softness and sheen to dull, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> dried the mess out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s got everything NOT recommended for black hair: Mineral Oil, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Parabens, and Urea. It&#x27;s basically a grocery store conditioner with some peppermint oil added to make your scalp tingle. Not impressed. Save your money and buy some Suave.</li>
            <li> Wow. Design essentials is like butter. This is the only place I can find stimulation without having to buy the big one. I will be using this on every wash. African American hair is hard to manage without the right products.  Natural and kinky living it</li>
            <li> Design Essentials shampoo and conditioners are great for dry hair, Period!  It brings moisture, softness and sheen to dull, dry hair.  This stimulations moisturizer stimulates your scalp, gets the blood flowing (which is good for your roots) and does what it says it&#x27;s to do.  I relax and color my hair.  I have to weekly deep condition my hair to keep it in a healthy form.  This is not a waste of time/money.  :)</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time a day or two ago. I was happily surprised with how thick it was, since I&#x27;ve been trying out new conditioners and the last one (Mane N&#x27; Tail) dried the mess out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also just began using straight up coconut oil as a moisturizer and a mix of castor oil and olive oil as sealants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I really like the nice tingly feeling it gave my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that I wish there was more conditioner in the container.</li>
            <li> i will buy this product again and again  this is a wonderful product  my hair feel so soft after&lt;br /&gt;using this product.</li>
            <li> Great product!!. Makes my hair feel so soft after using it. Second time ordering it and will continue.</li>
            <li> I used DE for about 5 years and my hair grew to the middle of my back.  I never had a problem with thin edges, breakage, shedding or anything while I used DE. I moved and my new stylist used some \\&quot;crap\\&quot; that made my hair shed a lot and balded my edges. I found a bottle of DE Stimulations Super Moisturizing conditioner and the Moisture retention shampoo in some boxes one night and used it.  I am not exxagerating, my hair instantly stopped shedding in that one wash.  I never went back to that salon ever again. I have relaxed 4a/b hair. After this experience, I&#x27;ve decided to transition back to natural.  DE is the best. I have no shedding and my hair is healthly looking again and growing. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for the thin edges and bald patches so far but we&#x27;ll see.  I figure if it stopped the shedding I&#x27;m at least on the right track.</li>
            <li> Came in great condition and I love this product! It is a wonderful conditioner.</li>
            <li> Stimulations Super Moisturizing Conditioner is excellent for relaxed Black hair. It leaves my hair feeling soft but I don&#x27;t use this conditioner exclusively from one relaxer to the next. I think this conditioner is best used for the 2 weeks or so after you get your relaxer touch up. If your scalp was burned a little during the process, this conditioner is really, really, REALLY, very soothing as well as moisturizing. I do find however that it dosen&#x27;t seem as moisturizing in the last 2 weeks before my relaxer touch up. When my hair is really kinky, then I turn to Nexxus or Keracare for more heavy-duty conditioning. I do however highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice, Locs are silky and have more life and are moisterized for a change! I will never use low end shampoos and conditioners on my babies again. Nor will buy into not washing regularly and conditioning my locs. I was just tired of my hair regimen consisting of salad bar prepping. Never again will I put unnecessary products and foodstuffs on my Locs after using this product (...Damian Walter System and no I do not know him just saw his helpful videos and took the challenge). This stuff is the truth!</li>
            <li> No lie! the Design Essential product line really stimulates your scalp, with a slight tingle feeling. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year now and it never disappoints.</li>
            <li> Keep hair really soft for the week.  Gentle on scalp. Hair smelled great. Love the container the conditioner is in</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. I use it following my protein treatments to keep my hair from getting hard (so I use it once every 6 weeks or so). I have relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone with dry natural hair.  It does what it promises, just give it a try</li>
            <li> I have damaged hair (breakage) and  purchased this product based on the reviews, I have used this product for 2 months and I have not noticed a difference in my hair. I will not repurchase. however it does leave my hair feeling silky soft, if looking for a good conditioner try this one.</li>
            <li> Love this product, feels great and I love the tingly feeling it gives:-)</li>
            <li> Great product and plan to buy more. This makes my girls natural hair very manageable.</li>
            <li> Love the tingling from the conditioner. Haven&#x27;t used it long but hope it will help with my hair breakage and thinning.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes hair leaves it soft, like the cool feeling of shampoo on scalp</li>
            <li> It works but my hair is think so I had to use a lot. Its think and creamy. Nice. m</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and a lot of the other design essential products. No complaints here!</li>
            <li> Nice Product. Keeps my hair very soft and manageable when I wash it.</li>
            <li> Did not leave my hair soft. Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> Not work the money relaxed girls. There are far better products out there.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. My stylist uses design products so I&#x27;m very familiar with this and the peppermint scent is the best. The finished product is great!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, fast delivery,  great price,  work well with my client&#x27;s hair,  very good quality. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased several tubes of this product after reading great reviews elsewehere but it was not worth the money. I have recently started growing out my natural hair and have been diligent about finding products to ease the \\&quot;growing pains\\&quot;. This product has as one of its main ingredients, mineral oil. Mineral oil is not good for my hair! I applied the product after my normal daily co-wash routine but it left a horrible white residue on my hair that took three rinses to finally get out of my hair completely. Ughh! So now I am stuck with several tubes of product I will never ever ever use again! Oh well you live and you learn!</li>
            <li> This product does not work well for me, I may have used too much because my hair felt very greasy after rinsing. My scalp started to itch after 2 days. It does work well for other people I know.</li>
            <li> I used to use this some years back. Bought it from my salon. I moved and didn&#x27;t want to spend the extra for shipping. I started experimenting with different products. My hair was in a real mess and I decided to come back and try this again. Wow!! I honestly forgot why I loved it so much in the first place but now that I&#x27;ve been reminded am sticking with it. Makes my hair strong, shiny and moisturized which is important for my sisters of color. Even my mom commented on how thick my hair looked. This is it ladies.</li>
            <li> This conditioner penetrates my scalp I love the stimulating  tingiling feeling on my scalp. I can feel my hair and scalp take in the moisture.</li>
            <li> Creamy and thick conditioner that will make your natural curl cone to life. Natural girls dream product and it smells amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> used after shampooing makes scalp feel tingly and clean. I would purchase it again and again</li>
            <li> Thanks I love this product so far it is really great. I used it one time and it made the hair soft and shining. Great buy</li>
            <li> I use most of the Design Essential products.  I love almost all of them but this one is my favorite.  It conditions my hair instantly and I have tried a bunch of products.  It is not cheap but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I simply love this product!!...I went to empire bueaty school where I was first introduced to the design essential line, so when my hair started to break off due to dryness they where the first line I turned to. After one use I noticed a major difference. My hair is super soft and I have noticed way less breakage so I can imagine how my hair will be after a few more uses. I plan to stock up on a few more products from the design essential line!</li>
            <li> Excellent product....Have used it for year !!!!</li>
            <li> service was great! I would definitely recommend this company to everyone.  Thanks for standing by your name. Keep up the excellent service.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the most powerful conditioner I have ever tried and is great for dreads.  That&#x27;s right, I condition me Dreads and it&#x27;s absolutely a fantastic product. The best part is the tingling in the scalp after a few moments. Thanks again to Damien of YouTube fame for turning me on to this incredible product</li>
            <li> Great product. I have been using Design Essentials for years. I have always been pleased with product.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and in great condtion.</li>
            <li> I chose five stars for this because it flat out works.  If you have hair that need to be hydrated, this is the conditioner for you.  Its not like the watery so-called conditioners you find in the drug store.  No, this stuff will stay on your palm even when you turn you hand upside down.  Its a thick cream that rinses out clean and leaves a wonderful and clean aroma.  Any hair type should try it, can&#x27;t go wrong with anything in the design essentials line, and oh yeah, your welcome</li>
            <li> Very nice conditioner</li>
            <li> After cleansing &amp; re-hydrating shampoo,  you get to feel the tingly sensation working on your scalp.  I saw a difference in my hair done I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I use other Design Essential products as well and this is a very good moisterizer.  it makes your scalp tingles in a good way.</li>
            <li> I love how soft  my hair feels after using this product! !  Its shiny and less tangled.  I would definitely recommend this product! !</li>
            <li> Amazing product if you have an ichy scalp, or just need a good scalp conditioner. It leaves your scalp feeling tingly and fresh! Great to have on hand and do your scalp a favor, give yourself a scalp massage once a week. If your scalp is healthy you will have long, healthy, shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It make my hair super soft and it smells good. I highly recommend it ,thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of my hair. I love the sensation on my scalp and love the peppermint smell. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this conditioner from my hairstylest before. She has me mix it with a few other products as a deep conditioning treatment. I love it mixed and by itself. I love the tingly feeling it makes on your scalp</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Design products. I usually use this after shampooing with the \\&quot;Theraputics\\&quot; shampoo. This leaves my hair so soft to the touch and full of moisture. Really good product.</li>
            <li> Great this product really keeps your hair healthy and moist.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner, along with the shampoo, keep my relaxed hair moisturized and protect from breakage. Recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells like mint and it is refreshing. It makes my hair smell so good afterwards. Put simply I just love it!</li>
            <li> By far the most dynamic conditioner for dry, weaker hair. This is head and shoulders with a deeper moisturizing twist. Your scalp and hair feel refreshed and look revived after the first use. Be sure to purchase a couple at a time as this highly rejuvenating hair product will be used quickly if you regularly maintain your hair. Strengthens hair too!!!! Design Essentials has hair care down to a science! Seller kept their end of the deal. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Perfect for the dryer type hair. Makes combing through my naps a breeze.</li>
            <li> The Design Essentials moisturizing conditioner is what the doctor ordered for my hair. Transtioning from relaxed to natural hair has definitely been easy.  My hair is easy to manage and I love the tickling sensation my scalp has during the conditioning.  My hair is manageable and soft.</li>
