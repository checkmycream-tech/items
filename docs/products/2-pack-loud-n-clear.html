            <li>Found it a great disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;Awkwardly fitted in ear, and unreliable to operate consistently.</li>
            <li>If you want quality you are going to have to spend more.</li>
            <li>It was advertised as being able to hear minute sounds.  </li>
            <li>All you can hear is static, and</li>
            <li>He thought this product would make him able to hear the words.  </li>
            <li>My intention for their use was to be able to watch tv in bed at night without bothering my wife.   </li>
            <li>and I sent a message but got no reply about it and would like to order 2 more and hope they both work.</li>
            <li>sounds better.</li>
            <li>I chose five stars because this is a great device for someone who can&#x27;t hear very well.</li>
            <li>My husband and my daughter both love them--they said they can hear a lot better.</li>
            <li>And he enjoyed using it while at home.  </li>

            <li>thanks i enjoy doing business with you all,keep up the good</li>
            <li>It does amplify sound.  </li>
            <li>It amplifies the sound for them.</li>
            <li>Plus  I don&#x27;t have to worry about replacement cost because they are so cheap..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most comfortable product but it does help me to hear, and the price is right (cheap).</li>
            <li>tried SSA Stealth Bell and Howell Listen up was the only good one with the right earphones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>You can hear directly in front of you at a louder volume but you can not here 3 to 5 feet in front of you any better.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s prescription hearing aid is far better.</li>
            <li>THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS GETTING THEM SEATED INTO MY EAR COMFORTABLY WITH THE SOUND CLEAR.  </li>
            <li>For the right application, this product may work.  </li>
            <li>RIGHT NOW!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My hearing&#x27;s fine normally</li>
            <li>Taking a walk in nature was very unusual since I started to notice sounds that had me stopping to figure out where they came from.    </li>
            <li>This is the first hearing device I ever bought and got it for my dad.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve hit a blank wall in 3 drug stores that haven&#x27;t been able to match the batteries.  </li>
            <li>I like the blue light as everyone thinks I&#x27;m on a bluetooth, even a doctor once!  </li>
            <li>Decided to try it out first and make sure it kept working since some other reviews said theirs stopped.  </li>
            <li>thanks anyway</li>
            <li>I really should have read some reviews.</li>
            <li>very poorly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they said it works very well.  </li>
            <li>We are both much happier viewing our shows together.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Also the blue light would not come on.  </li>
            <li>This works very well in that circumstance</li>
            <li>Too much feedback</li>
            <li>AND THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED ----</li>
            <li>we received our package on time, and the husband was excited to try the loud and clear.  </li>
            <li>This one is not only larger, but seems more \\&quot;plastic-ey\\&quot;, cheaper somehow.  </li>
            <li>I can still hear normally, but use this as a backup.  </li>
            <li>The new one arrived today.  </li>
            <li>When I did put new ones in, they didn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li>My dad didn&#x27;t get his yet since I&#x27;m keeping the ones I first ordered, and I&#x27;m now ordering a 2nd set for him.  </li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t filter unwanted noise such as air conditioner or furnace which is the reason for needing to turn up the volume on the tv or radio in the first place</li>
            <li>At first glance I thought it looked larger.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these Loud N Clear devices to try to alleviate the loud television in the evening and at bedtime.</li>

            <li>loud&#x27;n clear will amplifier but</li>
            <li>I would not waste your money of this product.</li>
            <li>I tried it, and it didn&#x27;t help to hear far away</li>
            <li>I mean static.  </li>
            <li>The other reviewer is right, there is no size or writing on the batteries at all.</li>
            <li>not the hype really doesn&#x27;t make the sound that much louder sorry</li>
            <li>I had my Loud N Clear for about two years but recently lost it.  </li>
            <li>but it was unuseable due to a sharp sherking sound.</li>
            <li>My old one took #312 batteries which I had ordered on line and have about 6 pkgs left.  </li>
            <li>I attend classes in a Lifelong Learning program and some of the lecturers speak very softly and don&#x27;t use a mike.</li>
            <li>So, for the price I thought it was well worth a try, for my \\&quot;hard of hearing\\&quot; dad.</li>
            <li>all the bad reviews come from people who hear good</li>

            <li> My husband is hard of hearing and does not always like to wear his hearing aids later in the day and at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I certainly do not recommend it, wasted 15 dollars.</li>
            <li> These hearing aids came with batteries that were expired a year and a half ago.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly enough, but is just not a good product.</li>

            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using mine off and on for a few weeks, testing it on walks, around the house, in stores.  </li>
            <li> use it everyday for tv, conversations saved my but for now.</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> This is an example of why the disclaimer on TV is so emphatic about the infomercial not being endorsed by the station, these are a waste of time, money and resources used in the manufacturing process.</li>
            <li> A FEW MINUTES</li>
            <li> ,t waste your time or money.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> not the hype really doesn&#x27;t make the sound that much louder sorry but this was a bad purchase thanks anyway</li>
            <li> It has such poor sound quality. I really should have read some reviews. I thought it was a good deal for $10 until I tried it out. Sorry to say it doesn&#x27;t perform well at all!!! If you want quality you are going to have to spend more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years.  It&#x27;s not the most comfortable product but it does help me to hear, and the price is right (cheap).</li>
            <li> it looks like you&#x27;re buying two of these units but they only send one and that stinks.  I&#x27;ve also gone through a pack of batteries already.  The company seems to doing false advertising with this two pack thing.  The units are not that good.  You can&#x27;t hear the low sounds.  They way they are advertising, DON&#x27;T BUY this PRODUCT under any MEANS.  PLEASE</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the sound quality.  It was advertised as being able to hear minute sounds.  All you can hear is static, and I mean static.  What a piece of junk.[[ASIN:B001PQHUKQ 2 pack Loud N Clear]]</li>
            <li> This is the first hearing device I ever bought and got it for my dad.  Decided to try it out first and make sure it kept working since some other reviews said theirs stopped.  Well, I&#x27;ve been using mine off and on for a few weeks, testing it on walks, around the house, in stores.  My hearing&#x27;s fine normally so it was only for testing purposes.  Taking a walk in nature was very unusual since I started to notice sounds that had me stopping to figure out where they came from.    All I can say is it works great.  And I didn&#x27;t mind wearing it in public since it looks like a bluetooth.  My dad didn&#x27;t get his yet since I&#x27;m keeping the ones I first ordered, and I&#x27;m now ordering a 2nd set for him.  It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought and recieved worked out of the box very poorly.&lt;br /&gt; it wistles and hurts your ears didnt use it five minutes and it messed up my hearing for an hour.&lt;br /&gt; my ears rang and hurt dont by this product its terrable i can see it makeing you deaf.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing it amplifys is the rate your going deaf.[[ASIN:B001RDJ2S0 Loud N Clear]][[ASIN:B001PQHUKQ 2 pack Loud N Clear]]</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my 80+ father who was roped in by the commercials.  He has hearing aids but cannot hear except sounds.  He thought this product would make him able to hear the words.  Not so.  I tried them out and they do work, both of them....so it works if you can already hear.  It does amplify sound.  Amazon is the best way to purchase this product as shipping is minimal.  Through the website shipping is astronomical. For the right application, this product may work.  Your expectations should be in line with a $10 product.</li>
            <li> i truly after chemo lost my hearing temporarily. but knowing how i used to hear this may pickup unwanted sounds of course it is doing it&#x27;s job. but for poor hearing like mine this picks up plenty. use it everyday for tv, conversations saved my but for now. all the bad reviews come from people who hear good i don&#x27;t so it no doubt works. tried SSA Stealth Bell and Howell Listen up was the only good one with the right earphones.</li>
            <li> O.K. Prices in Seattle range down to $9.99 (single item).  BATTERY SIZE IS NOT MENTIONED ON PACK OR DEVICE.  I&#x27;ve hit a blank wall in 3 drug stores that haven&#x27;t been able to match the batteries.  THE PROBLEM - - -IF you guess and open the wrong pack - you have to buy the pack (cost more than the ear piece).    And NO! there is no battery size or number on the batteries that come with the item.    One reviewer said Hearing aid battery #312 --- NO NO that one is too small for my \\&quot;Loud &amp; Clear\\&quot;. Error cost me $14.95 at drug store.    Maybe models have changed?</li>
            <li> I have not used the product yet, as it is a Christmas gift for my Dad.  I do know someone who has used \\&quot;loud and clear\\&quot; and they said it works very well.  So, for the price I thought it was well worth a try, for my \\&quot;hard of hearing\\&quot; dad.</li>
            <li> Useless. It amplifies sounds that drawn out hearing altogether. Found it a great disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;Awkwardly fitted in ear, and unreliable to operate consistently. I certainly do not recommend it, wasted 15 dollars.</li>
            <li> I bought it and it was a complete waste of money. I hear no difference at all. I feel as naive as a child. I believed it could work but nothing happened at all.</li>
            <li> Like others I could only hear myself.  It&#x27;s a good idea but alas doesn&#x27;t really work.  Other person&#x27;s opinion;  [...]</li>
            <li> My husband is hard of hearing and does not always like to wear his hearing aids later in the day and at bedtime. Understandably. I purchased these Loud N Clear devices to try to alleviate the loud television in the evening and at bedtime. He says that they have a little echo effect but he does say they work. We are both much happier viewing our shows together. Thanks.</li>
            <li> loud&#x27;n clear will amplifier but it won&#x27;t filter unwanted noise such as air conditioner or furnace which is the reason for needing to turn up the volume on the tv or radio in the first place</li>
            <li> This product does not work as well as stated. You can hear directly in front of you at a louder volume but you can not here 3 to 5 feet in front of you any better. It also states on the package that you can hear what people are saying across the street. that is not even close to the distance you can hear. I would not waste your money of this product. Sorry</li>
            <li> My intention for their use was to be able to watch tv in bed at night without bothering my wife.   The tv is only 8 feet away. They did not work at all, the white noise was louder than the tv and   they only amplified the tv slightly despite the fact I had one in each ear. They were a total   waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money.  The puny watch type battery doesn&#x27;t last and is VERY EXPENSIVE.  i HATE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I guess u get wat u pay for! wish I could return this junk. or get credit. it also hurts and wont stay on ur ears</li>
            <li> My husband wanted to try one after his co-worker was talking about it. I purchased the 2 pack. He gave one to his co-worker, who likes it. However, my husband did not like it. It does not work.</li>
            <li> You need a \\&quot;NO\\&quot; star rating.  This is an example of why the disclaimer on TV is so emphatic about the infomercial not being endorsed by the station, these are a waste of time, money and resources used in the manufacturing process. They are uncomfortable to wear, the sound amplification is uneven and it quit working after two days.</li>
            <li> I had my Loud N Clear for about two years but recently lost it.  I find it works well for listening to TV and for table conversation w/one to three other people.  However in a crowd, it picks up all the background conversations.  Also when I talk, I hear my voice and it seems to echo.  I ordered another one to replace the one I lost.  My old one took #312 batteries which I had ordered on line and have about 6 pkgs left.  The new one arrived today.  At first glance I thought it looked larger.  When I saw the batteries I knew they were much larger than the #312.  Also the blue light would not come on.  I like the blue light as everyone thinks I&#x27;m on a bluetooth, even a doctor once!  They must have changed the model.  This one is not only larger, but seems more \\&quot;plastic-ey\\&quot;, cheaper somehow.  I don&#x27;t know how to get the smaller model which I want because I have all the #312 batteries.  I think mine said it was made by Ontel and the company it came from was JMay Surplus out of Florida.  Maybe some company is making a knockoff model.  The other reviewer is right, there is no size or writing on the batteries at all. I can still hear normally, but use this as a backup.  I agree w/the reviewer that said it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re taking a class or listening to a lecture.  Probably because there is no background noise as everyone is quiet listening.  I am so upset with this one.  We, the consumer, are constantly being ripped off and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any recourse.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon. Everything I have ordered has been wonderful...until this. I ordered it for my dad but it was unuseable due to a sharp sherking sound. I even tried it for myself as well as changing the batteries. I laid it aside to send it back but the time lasped. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Well 1 out of the 2 worked and I sent a message but got no reply about it and would like to order 2 more and hope they both work.</li>
            <li> I tried it, and it didn&#x27;t help to hear far away sounds better. My wife&#x27;s prescription hearing aid is far better.</li>
            <li> These hearing aids came with batteries that were expired a year and a half ago.  When I did put new ones in, they didn&#x27;t work well at all. Had to return them. I did not have to pay shipping to return them.</li>
            <li> I chose five stars because this is a great device for someone who can&#x27;t hear very well. My husband and my daughter both love them--they said they can hear a lot better. It amplifies the sound for them.</li>
            <li> Cannot understand why others don&#x27;t like this. I attend classes in a Lifelong Learning program and some of the lecturers speak very softly and don&#x27;t use a mike. This works very well in that circumstance and I haven&#x27;t found the battery life to be a problem. I pop it in when I need it and take it out when I don&#x27;t. People just think I&#x27;m listening to my cell phone.</li>
            <li> we received our package on time, and the husband was excited to try the loud and clear.  And he enjoyed using it while at home.  We tried it at Appleby&#x27;s and he was overwelmed with all the noise.  When the granddaughters came to our house their running around and laughing and ect. was overwelming also.  So he only uses it when we are alone and at home.</li>
            <li> THE ITEM WORKED FOR FOUR DAYS.  I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM.  IT WAS FLIMSY AND THE BATTERIES THAT IT CAME WITH DIDNT WORK</li>
            <li> thanks i enjoy doing business with you all,keep up the good work.the iitem was in good shap, every thing was on time</li>
            <li> Too much feedback and it&#x27;s unconformable! If I could come up with another few words about this product they will be \\&quot;I WANT MY MONEY BACK RIGHT NOW!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I GOT THESE YESTERDAY AND TRIED THEM IN CHURCH TODAY.....THEY WORK!!!  THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS GETTING THEM SEATED INTO MY EAR COMFORTABLY WITH THE SOUND CLEAR.  A FEW MINUTES AND THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED ---- SO-SO.  AT LEAST I COULD HEAR CLEARLY... A BIG PLUS !!!!</li>
            <li> This product is not as good as others I have tried.  It is clumsy and does not fit the ear very well even though 3 different sized of ear plugs are furnished.  It was shipped quickly enough, but is just not a good product.</li>
            <li> Order two devices, one did not work at all, the other one worked poorly. It provided litte assistance in hearing a tv or conversation .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don,t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I have hearing aids which were prescribed by a doctor but I often worry about losing them or having them fall out - which would cost about $1500 per ear to replace.  I find this cheap alternative handy to use and quite adequate for many occasions. Plus  I don&#x27;t have to worry about replacement cost because they are so cheap..</li>
            <li> Me gusto mucho la rapidez con que llego el producto. Magnifico.Muchas gracias volvere a confiar en este vendedor. Los felicito.</li>
