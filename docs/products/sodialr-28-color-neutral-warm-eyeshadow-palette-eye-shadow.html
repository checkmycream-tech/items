            <li>and i must admit they are great</li>
            <li>The colors are great...</li>
            <li>so I ordered this palette because it offered some good neutral mattes.</li>
            <li>The pigments are really good.</li>
            <li>good amount of product, finishes and not a lot of fallout...</li>
            <li>But it is still good eye shadow.</li>
            <li>Use them all the time and they have a good shade of colors</li>
            <li>Love Love love Love!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still keep it because I need matte neutrals and the palette is handy</li>
            <li>The shadows are nice.</li>
            <li>loved the colors and they go on so smooth</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some pretty good swatches online that had pretty great pigmentation</li>
            <li>Frankly, its just ok.</li>
            <li>I guess if you&#x27;re picky about which highlight color you want to use, but to me, I wish there were just more choices.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad it came here</li>
            <li>I love the eyes shadows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this order.</li>
            <li>But the quality is great..... very pigmented....</li>
            <li>it had more browns and</li>
            <li>Even the back eyeshadow is impressive!</li>
            <li>Oh and it was packaged well. :)</li>
            <li>I actually love this lil palette...</li>
            <li>It is super cheap and the pigmentation is amazing!</li>
            <li>Pretty good price for the product you get.</li>
            <li>They contour to my eye lid easily.  </li>
            <li>&amp; they seem to blend easily.</li>
            <li>If you like matte neutrals you&#x27;d probably be fine with this palette.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m super glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I got free shipping because I bought it as an Add-On.</li>
            <li>nice in safely not broken at all.</li>
            <li>The colors are great and it worked well on African Amercian skin.</li>
            <li>This palette is very very useful.</li>
            <li>I look forward to shopping for more real soon.</li>
            <li>yeah, it was a good deal for so many colors, but i honestly next time i would rather spend a little more on a better quality palette instead.</li>
            <li>And the mailing - it came quick well at the time they said it was going to come</li>
            <li>Perfect if you are just starting out or experimenting with makeup, like I was, but once you get the basics down, invest in a higher quality palette with more pigmentation</li>
            <li>I love my new eyeshadow palette&#x27;s .</li>
            <li>But overall I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li>The colors were exactly what I needed and saw in the picture!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>So far, it is my favorite pallet.  </li>
            <li>I received the palette with a few shadows knocked out but the ones that I had were very nice and lasted all day.</li>
            <li>so it came right on time.</li>
            <li>MOST of the shadows are matte but you do indeed get a few shimmer ones which i fell inlove with even though i dont love shimmer</li>
            <li>A lot of other bloggers have reviewed it and said that it was good for beginners or if you were thinking about buying certain Mac shadows but wanted to try out their dupes first.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth that much.</li>
            <li>I love all the different color brown shade&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>C. must have gotten toss around too much during delivery</li>
            <li>I really like to use nuetral colors on my eyes since my eyes are brown and</li>
            <li>I really like how the majority of the shades have some sparkle to them as well.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to buy this palette, buy it from a seller with good reviews who is asking the least for it.</li>
            <li>i love all the different shades,which blend easily and can create several different looks.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t wear a lot of bright colors, and when I go out and buy a big palette, it&#x27;s usually half blues and greens and yellows or whatever, and I feel like I&#x27;m wasting money.</li>
            <li>It is a nice mix of matte and shimmer colors with more matte colors, a few with a little shimmer and two with lots of shimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used three different colors as of yet but the ones I used look very smooth and blend so well.</li>
            <li>Also, some bloggers have said that a lot of shades in this palette were decent dupes for some Mac shadows</li>
            <li>With this palette, not only are all the colors (with the exception of one random purple they threw in there that doesn&#x27;t really fit) neutral and soft, they&#x27;re mostly matte, which I love.</li>
            <li>also a little more pigmented...</li>
            <li>The pans are also pretty large (bigger than a quarter)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been thinking of purchasing this palette for about a year now but was a little unsure since I&#x27;ve looked up swatches of it on Google and a lot of the shades are matte and, frankly, with cheap palettes like this the mattes always tend to be pretty chalky and unusable.</li>
            <li>the quality of the eyeshadows isn&#x27;t that good, it is very sheer and the colors have very little pigment in them.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for everyday especially with it being summer for a natural matte eye with little eyeliner.</li>
            <li>For it 2 weeks early!</li>
            <li>In order to get the colors to show up I have to really pack them on with several layers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this pallette gives me plenty of different shades to combine to really make my eyes pop..</li>
            <li>but after about six months I&#x27;m extremely surprised.</li>
            <li>They are insanely pigmented and last all day with a good primer, and for the price, it can&#x27;t get much better than that.</li>
            <li>This make up bring out the beauty in me, not that I&#x27;m not beautiful already, its has all of the colors that I love.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that it has a lot of similar light colors.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that, even though I&#x27;m pretty pale, a lot of the shadows just do not show up on my skin.</li>

            <li> the shipping took almost a month but luckily the palette came in one piece and not a single broken eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 and 1 was perfect but the second one had 2 broken shadows :(</li>
            <li> This palette, like a lot of other ones sold by companies like BH and Coastal Scents are all the same palette that are mass produced in China, and these companies just slap their name on it and sell it for different prices.</li>
            <li> I had order two time from this seller and it take so long before the product get to me.</li>
            <li> Only use the dark colors, the lighter ones look chalky and powdery.</li>
            <li> Also two of the color that was damage got in the other color.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical when I bought this</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the colors go really fast</li>
            <li> Two of the color is all damage and make a mess everywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not fantastic though</li>
            <li> I use this everyday when I wear make up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette on whim because I was doing a photoshoot in a few days.</li>
            <li> They were package with extra care, so none of them were broken or out of slot.</li>
            <li> This palette is awful and very cheap and chalky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested them out on my arm all morning putting them over a white eyeliner base over some Urban Decay Primer Potion.</li>
            <li> i mean</li>
            <li> and when i opened it my case was cracked and broken</li>
            <li> Guess I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Its a bad customer service.</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed that that didn&#x27;t happen for me.</li>
            <li> All you need for this is a primer or a nyx base and they WILL POP.</li>
            <li> The colors showed and that was without a cream base.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> All you need for this is a primer or a nyx base and they WILL POP. I love it. They were very good and i must admit they are great MOST of the shadows are matte but you do indeed get a few shimmer ones which i fell inlove with even though i dont love shimmer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been thinking of purchasing this palette for about a year now but was a little unsure since I&#x27;ve looked up swatches of it on Google and a lot of the shades are matte and, frankly, with cheap palettes like this the mattes always tend to be pretty chalky and unusable. But I&#x27;ve recently started getting into matte shadows and I only have shimmery neutrals so I ordered this palette because it offered some good neutral mattes. Also, some bloggers have said that a lot of shades in this palette were decent dupes for some Mac shadows so I figured I would give it a shot. If you like matte neutrals you&#x27;d probably be fine with this palette. A lot of other bloggers have reviewed it and said that it was good for beginners or if you were thinking about buying certain Mac shadows but wanted to try out their dupes first. The pans are also pretty large (bigger than a quarter) so you get a lot. My only problem is that, even though I&#x27;m pretty pale, a lot of the shadows just do not show up on my skin. I&#x27;ve seen some pretty good swatches online that had pretty great pigmentation so I was disappointed that that didn&#x27;t happen for me. I&#x27;ve tested them out on my arm all morning putting them over a white eyeliner base over some Urban Decay Primer Potion. In order to get the colors to show up I have to really pack them on with several layers.&lt;br /&gt; In the end, I&#x27;m not heartbroken because I only paid about $7-8 for this palette and I got free shipping because I bought it as an Add-On. I&#x27;ll still keep it because I need matte neutrals and the palette is handy and I can make it work if I layer them on. It&#x27;s certainly not fantastic though and i&#x27;m not going to tell you to run out and buy it. Frankly, its just ok. If you do decide to buy this, shop around for different sellers on Amazon (just type in 28 neutral palette and all the options will come up). This palette, like a lot of other ones sold by companies like BH and Coastal Scents are all the same palette that are mass produced in China, and these companies just slap their name on it and sell it for different prices. If you&#x27;re going to buy this palette, buy it from a seller with good reviews who is asking the least for it. If I had bought this from Coastal Scents I think I would have paid about $18 and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth that much.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t wear a lot of bright colors, and when I go out and buy a big palette, it&#x27;s usually half blues and greens and yellows or whatever, and I feel like I&#x27;m wasting money. With this palette, not only are all the colors (with the exception of one random purple they threw in there that doesn&#x27;t really fit) neutral and soft, they&#x27;re mostly matte, which I love.

            <li> Best makeup purchase I&#x27;ve ever son in Amazon! This palette is very very useful. I use this everyday when I wear make up. And the mailing - it came quick well at the time they said it was going to come so HELL YEAH!</li>
            <li> its not pigmented at all for me, but you get what you pay for.. and when i opened it my case was cracked and broken and so were some of my eyeshadow :C. must have gotten toss around too much during delivery</li>
            <li> excellent quality palette. i love all the different shades,which blend easily and can create several different looks. Definitely worth a try and I would probably buy it again</li>
            <li> Bought this product for a Smokey Eye Look, Well when I received the Palette, It looks a lot lighter than it showed in the picture. I ended up giving it too my daughter. Wont buy again.</li>
            <li> Love Love love Love!!! Excellent quality, pigment and the color lasts! Can&#x27;t beat the price or quality here!</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried when I ordered this palette because it is basically no-named. But overall I&#x27;m pleased! The pigments are really good. The only complaint I have is that it has a lot of similar light colors. I guess if you&#x27;re picky about which highlight color you want to use, but to me, I wish there were just more choices. But-for the awesome price, I give this palette 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I order this on june14,2014 and revived today on July 8. Yes it did took while to get here but I&#x27;m glad it came here nice in safely not broken at all. I love the eyes shadows. I would recommend for anybody to try it. It&#x27;s a perfect pallet.</li>
            <li> This palette is awful and very cheap and chalky. Will never use. I thought that it was going to be different. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The colors were exactly what I needed and saw in the picture! I&#x27;m satisfied with this order.</li>
            <li> loved the colors and they go on so smooth</li>

            <li> Chalky. Only use the dark colors, the lighter ones look chalky and powdery.</li>
            <li> The colors are great... There is a mix of matte and sparkle... I ordered 2 and 1 was perfect but the second one had 2 broken shadows :( But the quality is great..... very pigmented....</li>
            <li> It is alright considering the price...I just wish the it had more browns and also a little more pigmented... But hey you get for what you pay</li>
            <li> I order this product on Feb. 14 and I didn&#x27;t receive the product until March 6. When I open the package the product was damage. Two of the color is all damage and make a mess everywhere. Also two of the color that was damage got in the other color. I request a return to the seller but she doesn&#x27;t answer me back. I had order two time from this seller and it take so long before the product get to me. I will not recommend this to any of my friend and family. Its a bad customer service.</li>
            <li> For it 2 weeks early! Wrapped 4 times in bubble wrap an then put in a box. The matte and sparkle both amaze me. Even the back eyeshadow is impressive! Defiantly buying again!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like to use nuetral colors on my eyes since my eyes are brown and this pallette gives me plenty of different shades to combine to really make my eyes pop.. I really like how the majority of the shades have some sparkle to them as well. I&#x27;ve only used three different colors as of yet but the ones I used look very smooth and blend so well. Overall I was a bit weary to purchase and now I&#x27;m super glad I did. Oh and it was packaged well. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette on whim because I was doing a photoshoot in a few days. I have the prime membership so it came right on time. The colors are great and it worked well on African Amercian skin. The colors showed and that was without a cream base. I totally recommend this palette.</li>
            <li> This make up bring out the beauty in me, not that I&#x27;m not beautiful already, its has all of the colors that I love.I look forward to shopping for more real soon.</li>
            <li> got here early...wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot but excellently wrapped...totally entact. I actually love this lil palette...good amount of product, finishes and not a lot of fallout...for the price I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is super cheap and the pigmentation is amazing! So far, it is my favorite pallet.  Great buy! I would deff purchase again!</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeshadow palette, I use it everyday.  Unfortunately the colors go really fast or I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Somehow, I thought this was a Coastal scents pallet. Guess I was wrong. But it is still good eye shadow. They may look one color but when you apply them, they have different undertones that come out. They contour to my eye lid easily.  &amp; they seem to blend easily. Pretty good price for the product you get.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical when I bought this but after about six months I&#x27;m extremely surprised. It is a nice mix of matte and shimmer colors with more matte colors, a few with a little shimmer and two with lots of shimmer. It is perfect for everyday especially with it being summer for a natural matte eye with little eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The shadows are nice. I received the palette with a few shadows knocked out but the ones that I had were very nice and lasted all day.</li>
            <li> Use them all the time and they have a good shade of colors</li>
            <li> Perfect if you are just starting out or experimenting with makeup, like I was, but once you get the basics down, invest in a higher quality palette with more pigmentation</li>
            <li> I love my new eyeshadow palette&#x27;s . They were package with extra care, so none of them were broken or out of slot. I love all the different color brown shade&#x27;s.</li>
