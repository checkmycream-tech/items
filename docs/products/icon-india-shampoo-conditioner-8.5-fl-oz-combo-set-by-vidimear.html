            <li> This product is changing the texture of my hair for the best.  I highlight every 6 weeks and I suffer from dry hair.  I&#x27;ve tried everything my stylists have recommended and nothing improved it and I spent tons of money!  You will see improvement after the first wash.  Love it.</li>
            <li> The ICON India Shampoo and Conditioner was delivered very quickly.  These are excellent products; my hair never looked better.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my dry, thick and curly hair, makes my hair shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> I have a lot of straight caucasian color treated dry hair - it&#x27;s thin but I have a lot of it and it tangles really easily.  I often have to condition twice to get the tangles out.  With this stuff, I just need a little bit and it cleans and untangles with one condition.  Expensive but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I do not think this is the real product. I absolutely love ICON Red but this is so different from the real one. It does not lather and it does not leave my hair soft from the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this collection!!! this product has made my hair so much healthier and LONG. I cut my hair 2 yrs ago to my chin and my hair today is just above bra length which to me is a great. My hair stylist loves the smell and honestly recognizes that this is a great product..</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner. The smell is awesome and the conditioner really lathers great!</li>
            <li> Such a fantastic product. Ordered this with a good detangling brush and can&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair after years of using the drugstore stuff. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Factor in that this is half the price you pay at the salon, and can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! This was my third order and my hair continues to improve in terms of healthiness. Before, I had to keep my hair in a shorter style to keep it from being stringy as it grew out. No longer, my shoulder length hair is soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing. I used to have to wash my hair every day and this shampoo and conditioner allows me to go 3 days. My hair is healthier and shiny. My color is lasting so much longer since using this product. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Just the smell alone is amazing! I don&#x27;t wash my hair often since it is dyed all sorts of colors, but when I do I use this stuff and get totally absorbed in the aroma, which lasts for a least a couple of days. Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I&#x27;m completely satisified with my purchase.  I will be buying more ICON shampoo &amp; conditioner in the future.</li>
            <li> Conditioner is way too thick...can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle. Shampoo turned my hair into straw. Very disappointed, product not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I came into possession of some of the ICON India Oil from a friend who received it from a Salon.  Since then I&#x27;ve done some research in an attempt to find something else in the line that has the wonderful fragrance.  So far, I&#x27;m in love with the product in general.  When my &#x27;sample&#x27; sizes run out I&#x27;ll be moving up to the full liters.</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoo and &#x27;Conditioner.  My hair had been previously damaged due to coloring and heat.  This product has performed miracles on my hair.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this from Amazon, instead at my local salon. This is the most amazing shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. I have tried over a dozen different lines of salon products. Redken, It&#x27;s a 10, Olive Oil by Regis, Designline, and BoiSilk just to name a few. Nothing can hold a candle to this product. I had THE worst hair. It was so dry and brittle. This product line not only brought my hair to a manageable state, it made it movie star worthy. I was even able to bleach my hair professionally four times in one day to go from a red head to a blonde and my hair is still silky smooth. I would recommend this to everybody!</li>
            <li> I have curly frizzy hair and this product has been amazing. The smell is very sensual and unisex - not fruity or flowery at all. I love it</li>
            <li> Nice scent, leaves hair nice, feeling moisturized without residue.</li>
            <li> Love these products! I have been using for a couple of years now and can&#x27;t live without this. Very happy to find a reasonable price and will def buy again from this seller. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Amazon and although it looked and smelled the same as the shampoo and conditioner I got from my salon, it definitely was not.  This shampoo and conditioner left my hair dry and itchy.  I think it may have been counterfeit.</li>
