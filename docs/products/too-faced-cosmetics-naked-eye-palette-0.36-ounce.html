            <li>The colors blend so perfectly &amp; the instruction cards make it so easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the colors, I find the shadow to be good quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the subscribe and save is a good discount, and the shadow lasted about 9 months.  </li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>and my sister loved it</li>
            <li>My grandaughter who is 21 loved this gift.</li>

            <li>So my package was shipped perfectly, and it arrived on time and quick.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased on this product.</li>
            <li>The colors are bright, beautiful and rich.</li>
            <li>Colors are beautiful and make up goes on easy and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>

            <li>I received this in the mail yesterday &amp; all i can say is that i absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I love the product!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeshadow set!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SET!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>pleased!</li>
            <li>I love this eye shadow palette!  </li>
            <li>This is my first Too Faced eye palette purchase and I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>Considering this set has 9 colors, it would be nice to have more than one applicator!</li>
            <li>This eyeshadow set is a very good one, if you&#x27;re willing to pay the price!</li>
            <li>The amazing thing about it is the colors are so neutral, and yet so flattering, that when you begin applying them you almost doubt that it will do anything for you at all.</li>
            <li>It is amazing eye shadow, but she can&#x27;t use the eyeliner without the brush that comes with it because she doesn&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li>this is also nice for travel.</li>
            <li>all of the colors work well together, and the three suggested looks (with instructions) are really nice too.</li>
            <li>is quite nice</li>
            <li>This is a nice quality set.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>The colors are excellent and really stay on.</li>
            <li>The palette is what I liked.  </li>
            <li>This set is really nice.</li>
            <li>They provide spectacular coverage, feel silky and glide on nicely without a lot of flaking.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin, so most of these colors work for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>(I got mine from sephora), but I always use my own brushes anyway...  </li>
            <li>The colors are set in there really nicely, so I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll crack like a lot of eye shadows tend to do.</li>
            <li>nice thing about this set is that you can wear it to the office and out at night.  </li>
            <li>They blend very easily, and apply evenly (that was the biggest problem I&#x27;d had all along with Cargo&#x27;s palette).</li>
            <li>The colors are are soft and are perfect for day, afternoon, and evening wear.</li>
            <li>Whenever I use any of the looks detailed in the (very convenient) style cards included, or a look I create on my own with this palette, people have stopped me in the street to tell me that my eyes are beautiful</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>It is natural-looking but not boring.</li>
            <li>So I guess my conclusion it that if I put in the time I could find a better deal for the look, but</li>
            <li>But I really do love the 2 colors I use.  </li>
            <li>With the exception of Satin Sheets, I love all of the colors.</li>
            <li>I love these eye shadows.</li>
            <li>and I am able to apply sufficient amount of color without a lot of work.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>..guess it was ok for the gift..got for xmas and got after 3 days of ordering it...</li>
            <li>is okay</li>
            <li>and I love, love, love the product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE my two faced.</li>
            <li>This collection is great because it gives you a nice natural look.  </li>
            <li>It makes my eyes look better than they do without eyeshadow, but without being overdone.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the box it comes in.  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Love the color combos.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this pallet.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, packaging is adorable, but not practical.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite eye shadow.</li>
            <li>Makes blue eyes pop and comes with tutorial cards to help you master the perfect technique.</li>
            <li>Love their color palettes and the quality of the products.  </li>
            <li>I love the sturdy case.</li>
            <li>It requires blending and more</li>
            <li>Something else to note:  if you&#x27;re a fan of being able to do your makeup quickly and get out the door, as I often do, this is great for that as the colors can be very applied very lightly and still make you feel put together.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love how it stays on and feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>the one hand, the first look, the one created with the colors in the top row, is really nice.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re willing to pay the money for this set, I&#x27;d say it is an excellent tool for your makeup bag if you want a versatile eye shadow set with which you can get both the natural or smokey eye look if you prefer.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I really love all the light</li>
            <li>I loved that the colors blend really well together.  </li>
            <li>This stuff lasts a while and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Someone who is more experienced with makeup can definitely make them work though!  </li>
            <li>This set offers a great range of colors (each looks fantastic on skin).  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and light green eyes (almost like the image on the front of the box) and this palette looks great..</li>
            <li>I have had the same pallet for 4 years and it STILL looks beautiful on.</li>
            <li>Too Faced, its so smooth feeling when you put it on your eyelids.</li>
            <li>, the top row, is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>More than worth the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind that too much, considering I use my own brush set anyway.  </li>
            <li>This palette is nice, the colors are all very blendable.</li>
            <li>but the colors are a bit light, so if that&#x27;s what you are looking for then</li>
            <li>This is not a drugstore product and cheap applicators are not going to work for the looks explained in the set.  </li>
            <li>This set of eye shadows really does have the perfect tones to achieve the \\&quot;naked eye\\&quot; look, as it claims to.</li>
            <li>All three looks are very natural and very, very sexy.  </li>
            <li>Super easy and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>I use the \\&quot;Day\\&quot; look most often, and it easily transitions into a smokier/evening look - by either building the intensity of the included shadows, or I&#x27;ll use NARS&#x27; Coconut Grove in the very outer \\&quot;V\\&quot; of the eyes.</li>
            <li>I have used this before and really like being able to blend the colors so easily.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant because it can be pricey, but it was well worth it!</li>
            <li>Therefore, if you are interested in purchasing this palette, I suggest you buy it at a store where you are able to check the contents yourself.</li>
            <li>It was the first Too Faced pallet I bought, and I have bought more of their products since.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s a magnet shut so that it doesn&#x27;t flop open if you DID carry it alone in your purse (with an added mirror of your own since there isn&#x27;t one in there!)</li>
            <li>we know this brand from Ulta and the condition of the makeup was fine, nice natural colors</li>
            <li>This one was the most similar and I liked the colors in this one a LOT.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the most versatile set to go from the office to anywhere!  </li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;naked,&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li>yes even the black looks good when used the way they describe!</li>
            <li>The colors are soft and neutral, so it&#x27;ll give your eyes a beautiful natural look.</li>
            <li>I wear a lot of colorful shadows, but I wanted to try something a bit more sophisticated and mature.</li>
            <li>my 14 yr old wanted in a nice sturdy case that can take the abuse of being dragged around to sleepovers with her.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I can see these colors working on any skin/eye color combination, because they are so soft and neutral.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this item I really didn&#x27;t think anything more about it except I hope I receive my item on time.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who would like some nice, natural eye looks and instructions on how to achieve them.  </li>
            <li>The pigments are vibrant and application is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love being able to alternate between the matte eye shadows, or using the shimmery ones - or sometimes both!</li>
            <li>product has quickly become my quick go-to choice for eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and will likely order another palette.  </li>
            <li>This palette gives such beautiful, soft eyeshadow looks -</li>
            <li>have a very fair complexion and these shadows do not wash me out and are dark enough to be able to apply for a nighttime look or a daytime look, depending on the colors I choose from the palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For all the rave reviews, I was pretty excited to try this shadow collection.  </li>
            <li>You can combine any of the shadows to create your own style, from day time natural to super shadow sexy to romantic.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful, you can coordinate or mix them if you want to and the little cards tell you exactly what to do with each color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see Amazon not only carries it, but offers a discount when purchasing through Subscribe and Save.   </li>
            <li>I feel like the color pickup on my brushes (I do not use brushed included with eyeshadows and opt for my own brushes which create a smoother look)</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;guides\\&quot; it comes with, which demonstrates which colors to apply in order to achieve specific \\&quot;looks\\&quot;, is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>You can go from a soft day look to a sexy soft sophisticated look.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to do smoky, since I&#x27;m bleach blonde and fair completed.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s worth mentioning since some buying might want it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this after using the natural eye palette of theirs, which I love.</li>
            <li>I still use the natural one more.</li>
            <li>I think best of all, this palette has helped me break out of my rut and start experimenting with different colors and techniques again, and not just with the colors included, but some of the palette and some other eyeshadow singles that I&#x27;ve used and put aside and forgotten about.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they look good on other women, but not me.  </li>
            <li>I really like this palette, even though I originally wanted the \\&quot;boudoir\\&quot; set.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this palette to anyone who likes a softer look, though I&#x27;m sure you could really make these colors pop by adding some liquid to the mix.</li>
            <li>right now I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Pigmented enough and suitable for daytime makeup and for the festive and evening.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s occurred to me that it might be good to tone it down some</li>
            <li>I love appearing as though I&#x27;m wearing little to no makeup, and still being able to walk the streets</li>
            <li>your own set of \\&quot;naked eye\\&quot; shadows if you really wanted to.</li>
            <li>your own set of \\&quot;naked eye\\&quot; shadows if you really wanted to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very fair blonde, and I&#x27;ve worn makeup since I was a very young teen.</li>
            <li>My first reaction is no.  </li>
            <li>I think I over-used the one color that emptied first, so</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, blends well, looks natural.</li>
            <li>I love this naked eye compact.  </li>
            <li>With Too Faced, however, you will get slightly higher quality.</li>
            <li>With Too Faced, however, you will get slightly higher quality.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be trying more Too</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first experience with Too Faced</li>
            <li>It even comes with 3 pretty flash cards with 6 looks/tutorial.</li>
            <li>Decay and Two-Faced eyeshadows more than I actually like MAC&#x27;s.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first Too Faced product and I am absolutely inlove with it!</li>
            <li>It has such a nice color soft color palette!</li>
            <li>Other than that the colors are nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with how beautifully these colors apply.t being said, there are also less expensive brands which carry very similar colors, and you could piece together</li>
            <li>This is overall a good set, I like the variety of colors offered, would get 5 stars if the eyeshadows were bigger.</li>
            <li>Pretty convenient packaging, very girly)</li>
            <li>Well worth it, will be trying the other palettes for sure.</li>
            <li>None of these shadows will give you a dark smoky look which i liked because I wasn&#x27;t looking for that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also strongly recommend practicing these looks at home so that you become proficient enough to pull them out for a girls night or date night.  </li>
            <li>I love this palette and I use every single color in it.</li>
            <li>While you can certainly go out and buy cheaper products, you will lose the combined packaging and instructions provided in all of</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got 3 nice little instruction cards.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend using the tiny brush they give (use ur own) because to me its just a cheap little brush that doesnt work very well.</li>
            <li>The Day look uses In the Buff, which is a sheer, milk-white color, Pillow Talk, a shimmery taupe, and Like A Virgin, which is a matte, light brown shade.</li>
            <li>Some of the really shimmery ones have some fallout</li>
            <li>I wear too much makeup!!!\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All of the shadows apply very well -</li>
            <li>My set did not come with the brush, but I don&#x27;t really care about that.  </li>
            <li>The price was also very competitive.</li>
            <li>I like this although I&#x27;ve not played around with it much.</li>
            <li>I am very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>Mine did not come with the brush shown which is very diasappointing.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like the look of too much makeup</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>As a result, my eyeshadows last for as long as I want it to, looking as beautiful as when I initially applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Soft and Sexy, Natural at Night, and Natural as well.  </li>
            <li>But shadow foundation which was added as a present was not bad, it&#x27;s quite pretty thing.</li>
            <li>It comes with instruction cards (3) which detail how to achieve a particular look with the eyeshadow palette, which is a nice little touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In other words, it enhances your natural beauty instead of standing out on its own.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than I usually spend on make up, so I really hoped to get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased the Too Faced Naked Eye Palette a year or so ago at a national makeup chain</li>
            <li>It really does make a huge difference in the appearance and how long the eyeshadow will remain without needing a touch-up.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the colors are just TOO DARK for my taste and there is one glittery one, I ended up with more glitter on my cheeks and nose than on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>They are all pretty shimmery, except for I have sensitive skin and it suits me.</li>
            <li>These colors are nice and powdery, very pigmented and you don&#x27;t have to work hard at all to pick up the colors.  </li>
            <li>(Satin Sheets is the main offender in this palette, but that&#x27;s the one shade I don&#x27;t particularly care for anyway), but I found blowing excess off the brush helps a bit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d invest in a high quality set of brushes.  </li>
            <li>The little cards with drawings and suggestions are adorable, but I don&#x27;t follow them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>old is jealous and wants one too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not skilled enough with make up to have chosen the colors on my own, so I appreciate this first set in the collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are a few in the set that have a shimmer to them, but I would describe it more like a pearl than \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; when applied.</li>
            <li>My favorite for the past two years has been Cargo&#x27;s Essential Eye Palette (in Cool Neutral) -</li>
            <li>This seller went above and beyond, I received my product very quickly and not only was there a very sweet note left inside the box for me but a tube of eye shadow primer from the same brand as the eye shadow I purchased (a very sweet bonus)I will definitely be buying from this seller (not just because they gave me a bonus but because they are very reliable)in the near future!</li>
            <li>You need to give yourself enough time to do this right.  </li>
            <li>I really love the shimmery yet natural look a few of these shadows give.  </li>
            <li>It is a very natural palette which I like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, you could buy a few different drug store brand eye shadows to achieve the same effects - but this set is very complete and good quality</li>
            <li>The variety of colors is nice in that you will find that you&#x27;ll use all of them, unlike some other collections wherein only one or two of the colors you end up actually</li>
            <li>I prefer to use a shadow as an eyeliner and the black color goes on smooth with no smudging or feathering.  </li>
            <li>If you only want a matte look, you won&#x27;t enjoy every single color in this box.</li>
            <li>I use brushes anyway, not the little foam thingys most makeup come with so its not a big deal</li>
            <li>The Classic look uses Birthday Suit (light mocha color), Satin Sheets (a shimmery pink), and Unmentionables (a slate grey, metallic shade).</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t flattering and they aren&#x27;t natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a busy year (added another baby) and don&#x27;t have time to go out shopping,</li>
            <li>The shadows wear very well - all day - although I always wear a primer, so I can&#x27;t say if they&#x27;d last as well without primer.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty and blend with each other well.  </li>
            <li>The shadows in this palette are so soft and blendable.</li>
            <li>I also have a cosmetology license, so I have learned how to professionally apply makeup.</li>
            <li>I really like that the set comes with instructions for three different looks.  </li>
            <li>It is my go-to natural every day look.  </li>
            <li>Complete strangers compliment me on my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I use mine everyday and love it, but it needs to come with the stuff listed as being included, especially for the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li>The pallet is worth the buy along with other too faced products.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m typically a MAC cosmetic user, but like Urban Decay and Two-Faced eyeshadows more than I actually like MAC&#x27;s.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This palette comes with three style cards, each with a different look: a Day look, a Classic look, and a Fashion look.</li>
            <li>First of all I got this pallete later than somethings which I ordered at the same time with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like the cards that show how to create different looks with the different colors.  </li>
            <li>The look is pretty and flattering, but not amazing, and I ought to be able to get the same look for a lot less.</li>
            <li>At that point one of the colors (the middle of the top row) was empty, but there was still a lot left of all the other shades.  </li>
            <li>But the finished product is not only completely natural looking, it&#x27;s downright glamorous.</li>
            <li>, it can definitely age a young face.  </li>
            <li>It smells kind of weird</li>
            <li>Between the Too Faced Naked palette &amp; the Natural palette, I&#x27;m gonna go with the naked.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have pointed out the lack of a brush, but again, these are intended for home application with a high quality set of shadow brushes.  </li>
            <li>I am a novice when it comes to more complex eyeshadow application so the guides included in Too Faced products are extremely helpful!  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t recommend this palette to the the woman, who needs something special or serious.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Aside from the colors, I find the shadow to be good quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the subscribe and save is a good discount, and the shadow lasted about 9 months.  </li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> and my sister loved it</li>
            <li> My grandaughter who is 21 loved this gift.</li>

            <li> I was very pleased on this product.</li>

            <li> I received this in the mail yesterday &amp; all i can say is that i absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I love the product!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow set!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SET!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> pleased!</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow palette!  </li>
            <li> This is my first Too Faced eye palette purchase and I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Considering this set has 9 colors, it would be nice to have more than one applicator!</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow set is a very good one, if you&#x27;re willing to pay the price!</li>
            <li> The amazing thing about it is the colors are so neutral, and yet so flattering, that when you begin applying them you almost doubt that it will do anything for you at all.</li>
            <li> It is amazing eye shadow, but she can&#x27;t use the eyeliner without the brush that comes with it because she doesn&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li> this is also nice for travel.</li>
            <li> all of the colors work well together, and the three suggested looks (with instructions) are really nice too.</li>
            <li> is quite nice</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality set.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> The colors are excellent and really stay on.</li>
            <li> The palette is what I liked.  </li>
            <li> This set is really nice.</li>
            <li> They provide spectacular coverage, feel silky and glide on nicely without a lot of flaking.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin, so most of these colors work for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> (I got mine from sephora), but I always use my own brushes anyway...  </li>
            <li> The colors are set in there really nicely, so I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll crack like a lot of eye shadows tend to do.</li>
            <li> nice thing about this set is that you can wear it to the office and out at night.  </li>
            <li> They blend very easily, and apply evenly (that was the biggest problem I&#x27;d had all along with Cargo&#x27;s palette).</li>
            <li> The colors are are soft and are perfect for day, afternoon, and evening wear.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use any of the looks detailed in the (very convenient) style cards included, or a look I create on my own with this palette, people have stopped me in the street to tell me that my eyes are beautiful</li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> It is natural-looking but not boring.</li>
            <li> So I guess my conclusion it that if I put in the time I could find a better deal for the look, but</li>
            <li> But I really do love the 2 colors I use.  </li>
            <li> With the exception of Satin Sheets, I love all of the colors.</li>
            <li> I love these eye shadows.</li>
            <li> and I am able to apply sufficient amount of color without a lot of work.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> ..guess it was ok for the gift..got for xmas and got after 3 days of ordering it...</li>
            <li> is okay</li>
            <li> and I love, love, love the product.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE my two faced.</li>
            <li> This collection is great because it gives you a nice natural look.  </li>
            <li> It makes my eyes look better than they do without eyeshadow, but without being overdone.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the box it comes in.  </li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> Love the color combos.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallet.  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, packaging is adorable, but not practical.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Makes blue eyes pop and comes with tutorial cards to help you master the perfect technique.</li>
            <li> Love their color palettes and the quality of the products.  </li>
            <li> I love the sturdy case.</li>
            <li> It requires blending and more</li>
            <li> Something else to note:  if you&#x27;re a fan of being able to do your makeup quickly and get out the door, as I often do, this is great for that as the colors can be very applied very lightly and still make you feel put together.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love how it stays on and feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> the one hand, the first look, the one created with the colors in the top row, is really nice.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re willing to pay the money for this set, I&#x27;d say it is an excellent tool for your makeup bag if you want a versatile eye shadow set with which you can get both the natural or smokey eye look if you prefer.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I really love all the light</li>
            <li> I loved that the colors blend really well together.  </li>
            <li> This stuff lasts a while and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Someone who is more experienced with makeup can definitely make them work though!  </li>
            <li> This set offers a great range of colors (each looks fantastic on skin).  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin and light green eyes (almost like the image on the front of the box) and this palette looks great..</li>
            <li> I have had the same pallet for 4 years and it STILL looks beautiful on.</li>
            <li> Too Faced, its so smooth feeling when you put it on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> , the top row, is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> More than worth the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that too much, considering I use my own brush set anyway.  </li>
            <li> This palette is nice, the colors are all very blendable.</li>
            <li> but the colors are a bit light, so if that&#x27;s what you are looking for then</li>
            <li> This is not a drugstore product and cheap applicators are not going to work for the looks explained in the set.  </li>
            <li> This set of eye shadows really does have the perfect tones to achieve the \\&quot;naked eye\\&quot; look, as it claims to.</li>
            <li> All three looks are very natural and very, very sexy.  </li>
            <li> Super easy and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I use the \\&quot;Day\\&quot; look most often, and it easily transitions into a smokier/evening look - by either building the intensity of the included shadows, or I&#x27;ll use NARS&#x27; Coconut Grove in the very outer \\&quot;V\\&quot; of the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and really like being able to blend the colors so easily.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant because it can be pricey, but it was well worth it!</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you are interested in purchasing this palette, I suggest you buy it at a store where you are able to check the contents yourself.</li>
            <li> It was the first Too Faced pallet I bought, and I have bought more of their products since.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s a magnet shut so that it doesn&#x27;t flop open if you DID carry it alone in your purse (with an added mirror of your own since there isn&#x27;t one in there!)</li>
            <li> we know this brand from Ulta and the condition of the makeup was fine, nice natural colors</li>
            <li> This one was the most similar and I liked the colors in this one a LOT.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the most versatile set to go from the office to anywhere!  </li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;naked,&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li> yes even the black looks good when used the way they describe!</li>
            <li> The colors are soft and neutral, so it&#x27;ll give your eyes a beautiful natural look.</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of colorful shadows, but I wanted to try something a bit more sophisticated and mature.</li>
            <li> my 14 yr old wanted in a nice sturdy case that can take the abuse of being dragged around to sleepovers with her.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I can see these colors working on any skin/eye color combination, because they are so soft and neutral.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this item I really didn&#x27;t think anything more about it except I hope I receive my item on time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who would like some nice, natural eye looks and instructions on how to achieve them.  </li>
            <li> The pigments are vibrant and application is very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love being able to alternate between the matte eye shadows, or using the shimmery ones - or sometimes both!</li>
            <li> product has quickly become my quick go-to choice for eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and will likely order another palette.  </li>
            <li> This palette gives such beautiful, soft eyeshadow looks -</li>
            <li> have a very fair complexion and these shadows do not wash me out and are dark enough to be able to apply for a nighttime look or a daytime look, depending on the colors I choose from the palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For all the rave reviews, I was pretty excited to try this shadow collection.  </li>
            <li> You can combine any of the shadows to create your own style, from day time natural to super shadow sexy to romantic.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful, you can coordinate or mix them if you want to and the little cards tell you exactly what to do with each color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see Amazon not only carries it, but offers a discount when purchasing through Subscribe and Save.   </li>
            <li> I feel like the color pickup on my brushes (I do not use brushed included with eyeshadows and opt for my own brushes which create a smoother look)</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;guides\\&quot; it comes with, which demonstrates which colors to apply in order to achieve specific \\&quot;looks\\&quot;, is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> You can go from a soft day look to a sexy soft sophisticated look.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to do smoky, since I&#x27;m bleach blonde and fair completed.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s worth mentioning since some buying might want it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this after using the natural eye palette of theirs, which I love.</li>
            <li> I still use the natural one more.</li>
            <li> I think best of all, this palette has helped me break out of my rut and start experimenting with different colors and techniques again, and not just with the colors included, but some of the palette and some other eyeshadow singles that I&#x27;ve used and put aside and forgotten about.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they look good on other women, but not me.  </li>
            <li> I really like this palette, even though I originally wanted the \\&quot;boudoir\\&quot; set.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this palette to anyone who likes a softer look, though I&#x27;m sure you could really make these colors pop by adding some liquid to the mix.</li>
            <li> right now I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Pigmented enough and suitable for daytime makeup and for the festive and evening.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s occurred to me that it might be good to tone it down some</li>
            <li> I love appearing as though I&#x27;m wearing little to no makeup, and still being able to walk the streets</li>
            <li> your own set of \\&quot;naked eye\\&quot; shadows if you really wanted to.</li>
            <li> your own set of \\&quot;naked eye\\&quot; shadows if you really wanted to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very fair blonde, and I&#x27;ve worn makeup since I was a very young teen.</li>
            <li> My first reaction is no.  </li>
            <li> I think I over-used the one color that emptied first, so</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, blends well, looks natural.</li>
            <li> I love this naked eye compact.  </li>
            <li> With Too Faced, however, you will get slightly higher quality.</li>
            <li> With Too Faced, however, you will get slightly higher quality.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be trying more Too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first experience with Too Faced</li>
            <li> It even comes with 3 pretty flash cards with 6 looks/tutorial.</li>
            <li> Decay and Two-Faced eyeshadows more than I actually like MAC&#x27;s.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first Too Faced product and I am absolutely inlove with it!</li>
            <li> It has such a nice color soft color palette!</li>
            <li> Other than that the colors are nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with how beautifully these colors apply.t being said, there are also less expensive brands which carry very similar colors, and you could piece together</li>
            <li> This is overall a good set, I like the variety of colors offered, would get 5 stars if the eyeshadows were bigger.</li>
            <li> Pretty convenient packaging, very girly)</li>
            <li> Well worth it, will be trying the other palettes for sure.</li>
            <li> None of these shadows will give you a dark smoky look which i liked because I wasn&#x27;t looking for that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SUPER soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also strongly recommend practicing these looks at home so that you become proficient enough to pull them out for a girls night or date night.  </li>
            <li> I love this palette and I use every single color in it.</li>
            <li> While you can certainly go out and buy cheaper products, you will lose the combined packaging and instructions provided in all of</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got 3 nice little instruction cards.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend using the tiny brush they give (use ur own) because to me its just a cheap little brush that doesnt work very well.</li>
            <li> The Day look uses In the Buff, which is a sheer, milk-white color, Pillow Talk, a shimmery taupe, and Like A Virgin, which is a matte, light brown shade.</li>
            <li> Some of the really shimmery ones have some fallout</li>
            <li> I wear too much makeup!!!\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of the shadows apply very well -</li>
            <li> My set did not come with the brush, but I don&#x27;t really care about that.  </li>
            <li> The price was also very competitive.</li>
            <li> I like this although I&#x27;ve not played around with it much.</li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> Mine did not come with the brush shown which is very diasappointing.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the look of too much makeup</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> As a result, my eyeshadows last for as long as I want it to, looking as beautiful as when I initially applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Soft and Sexy, Natural at Night, and Natural as well.  </li>
            <li> But shadow foundation which was added as a present was not bad, it&#x27;s quite pretty thing.</li>
            <li> It comes with instruction cards (3) which detail how to achieve a particular look with the eyeshadow palette, which is a nice little touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In other words, it enhances your natural beauty instead of standing out on its own.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than I usually spend on make up, so I really hoped to get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased the Too Faced Naked Eye Palette a year or so ago at a national makeup chain</li>
            <li> It really does make a huge difference in the appearance and how long the eyeshadow will remain without needing a touch-up.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the colors are just TOO DARK for my taste and there is one glittery one, I ended up with more glitter on my cheeks and nose than on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> They are all pretty shimmery, except for I have sensitive skin and it suits me.</li>
            <li> These colors are nice and powdery, very pigmented and you don&#x27;t have to work hard at all to pick up the colors.  </li>
            <li> (Satin Sheets is the main offender in this palette, but that&#x27;s the one shade I don&#x27;t particularly care for anyway), but I found blowing excess off the brush helps a bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d invest in a high quality set of brushes.  </li>
            <li> The little cards with drawings and suggestions are adorable, but I don&#x27;t follow them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> old is jealous and wants one too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not skilled enough with make up to have chosen the colors on my own, so I appreciate this first set in the collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are a few in the set that have a shimmer to them, but I would describe it more like a pearl than \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; when applied.</li>
            <li> My favorite for the past two years has been Cargo&#x27;s Essential Eye Palette (in Cool Neutral) -</li>
            <li> This seller went above and beyond, I received my product very quickly and not only was there a very sweet note left inside the box for me but a tube of eye shadow primer from the same brand as the eye shadow I purchased (a very sweet bonus)I will definitely be buying from this seller (not just because they gave me a bonus but because they are very reliable)in the near future!</li>
            <li> You need to give yourself enough time to do this right.  </li>
            <li> I really love the shimmery yet natural look a few of these shadows give.  </li>
            <li> It is a very natural palette which I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, you could buy a few different drug store brand eye shadows to achieve the same effects - but this set is very complete and good quality</li>
            <li> The variety of colors is nice in that you will find that you&#x27;ll use all of them, unlike some other collections wherein only one or two of the colors you end up actually</li>
            <li> I prefer to use a shadow as an eyeliner and the black color goes on smooth with no smudging or feathering.  </li>
            <li> If you only want a matte look, you won&#x27;t enjoy every single color in this box.</li>
            <li> I use brushes anyway, not the little foam thingys most makeup come with so its not a big deal</li>
            <li> The Classic look uses Birthday Suit (light mocha color), Satin Sheets (a shimmery pink), and Unmentionables (a slate grey, metallic shade).</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t flattering and they aren&#x27;t natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a busy year (added another baby) and don&#x27;t have time to go out shopping,</li>
            <li> The shadows wear very well - all day - although I always wear a primer, so I can&#x27;t say if they&#x27;d last as well without primer.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty and blend with each other well.  </li>
            <li> The shadows in this palette are so soft and blendable.</li>
            <li> I also have a cosmetology license, so I have learned how to professionally apply makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like that the set comes with instructions for three different looks.  </li>
            <li> It is my go-to natural every day look.  </li>
            <li> Complete strangers compliment me on my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I use mine everyday and love it, but it needs to come with the stuff listed as being included, especially for the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The pallet is worth the buy along with other too faced products.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m typically a MAC cosmetic user, but like Urban Decay and Two-Faced eyeshadows more than I actually like MAC&#x27;s.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This palette comes with three style cards, each with a different look: a Day look, a Classic look, and a Fashion look.</li>
            <li> First of all I got this pallete later than somethings which I ordered at the same time with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like the cards that show how to create different looks with the different colors.  </li>
            <li> The look is pretty and flattering, but not amazing, and I ought to be able to get the same look for a lot less.</li>
            <li> At that point one of the colors (the middle of the top row) was empty, but there was still a lot left of all the other shades.  </li>
            <li> But the finished product is not only completely natural looking, it&#x27;s downright glamorous.</li>
            <li> , it can definitely age a young face.  </li>
            <li> It smells kind of weird</li>
            <li> Between the Too Faced Naked palette &amp; the Natural palette, I&#x27;m gonna go with the naked.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have pointed out the lack of a brush, but again, these are intended for home application with a high quality set of shadow brushes.  </li>
            <li> I am a novice when it comes to more complex eyeshadow application so the guides included in Too Faced products are extremely helpful!  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend this palette to the the woman, who needs something special or serious.</li>
            <li> And the FABULOUS Fashion look features Pink Cheeks (a very pale pink), Lap Dance (a darker, matte taupe) and finally, Stiletto (a very inky black).</li>
            <li> I have only used the middle shadows of the pallete so far because I have bought a bunch of other shadows from too faced that I am also trying out.</li>
            <li> Long story short, an acquaintance, who works at Ulta recommended Too Faced&#x27;s palettes when I complimented her on her eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the lighter colors are a little transparent and don&#x27;t have much pigment, but otherwise this offers some nice nude colors, particularly for base building, like all over lid.</li>
            <li> Classy, subtle very natural.</li>
            <li> so rather than trying to find a similar look for less, I did buy this a second a time.  </li>
            <li> In one palette I can go from a soft and natural look to an edgy dark smoky eye.</li>
            <li> I also use individual colors when I&#x27;m creating looks with other shadows.  </li>
            <li> The squareness of it makes it awkward and it doesn&#x27;t fit anywhere except drawers and big boxes.  </li>
            <li> Two of the shades I can use in other other ways with other colors, but the rest are a complete waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this with a wet brush, but with a dry brush it makes my eyes look powdery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m paying a few extra bucks for the convenience of a pre-made collection.  </li>
            <li> Filed a returned and this person closed it because it&#x27;s fragrance??</li>
            <li> For me acquaintance with \\&quot;Too faced\\&quot; closed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not actually wearing less makeup, but it looks like I am!</li>
            <li> wasting all those other colors.  </li>
            <li> although it has two ends, one end has an eyeshadow applicator and the other</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m planning to get the other collections.</li>
            <li> (I also read other reviews wherein this was mentioned.)  </li>
            <li> The pigmentation is really dark, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So though I claim it&#x27;s not worth the money, my actions say otherwise.</li>
            <li> for me it comes down to whether using just one look</li>
            <li> I was expecting to have an applicator included as I had from a previous purchase</li>
            <li> /&gt;It IS a tad expensive but the quality is really high.  </li>
            <li> No good pigmentation, unaccurate internal form.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with the set has the traditional sponge applicator on one end and a thin eyeliner brush on the other.  </li>
            <li> Using the sample of shadow insurance that came it intensifies the color a bit, so I think I use a little less shadow.  </li>
            <li> I havent used the little brush and sponge (sponges like the one included tend to carry a lot of bacteria).</li>
            <li> I knocked off one star because mine did not come with the little applicator as the picture shows.  </li>
            <li> It took a little practice to get the look I wanted</li>
            <li> Mine DID come with an applicator brush in a little drawer in the bottom of the case.</li>
            <li> The box is chunky, too, not the type of makeup accessory you&#x27;d throw in your little makeup bag.</li>
            <li> (The set I bought didn&#x27;t come with the little brush...</li>
            <li> Both work well and have held up to everyday use.  </li>
            <li> thinking I&#x27;d save the time and maybe a few dollars</li>
            <li> With that being said, there are also less expensive brands which carry very similar colors, and you could piece together</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed with this brand, its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have to use sparingly because they are so dang small.</li>
            <li> In the Buff and Pillow Talk also work well with Lancome&#x27;s Dill (Dill in the outer V), which I&#x27;ll use when I use an olive eyeliner (Bobbi Brown&#x27;s Forest Shimmer) instead of my usual brown/bronze.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a heavy makeup wearer for well over a decade now, but lately as I approach my thirties</li>
            <li> use it everyday!</li>
            <li> any way I will not more pay money and time for this brend.</li>
            <li> This is intended for complex application in front of a well lighted mirror.  </li>
            <li> was very very small for the price</li>
            <li> second and third looks (rows two and three) are horrible on me.  </li>
            <li> I lean towards the softer subtle colors</li>
            <li> I mean really truly horrible.  </li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to receiving the Too Faced Naked Eye Palette, but was extremely disappointed when I received it.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this brand and color palette.</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed it didn&#x27;t come with one in a little drawer in the bottom of the case.  </li>
            <li> while I still like it, I was getting bored with it.</li>
            <li> Tried to return knock off item and fake item.</li>
            <li> Should have told Too faced this person is making fake products of theirs and selling them to make money.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am returning this palette immediately.</li>
            <li> packaging is bulky and incredibly inconvenient for travel.  </li>
            <li> And I just hate that I&lt;</li>
            <li> in the set is the base for the shadows, but for now I use with essens.</li>
            <li> I apply it after my base foundation, then use eyeshadow.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> we know this brand from Ulta and the condition of the makeup was fine, nice natural colors my 14 yr old wanted in a nice sturdy case that can take the abuse of being dragged around to sleepovers with her.  I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> So my package was shipped perfectly, and it arrived on time and quick. The pallete is great I have only used the middle shadows of the pallete so far because I have bought a bunch of other shadows from too faced that I am also trying out. But the shadows are great and so are the instruction cards. I do not recommend using the tiny brush they give (use ur own) because to me its just a cheap little brush that doesnt work very well. The pallet is worth the buy along with other too faced products.</li>
            <li> Wish I could purchase some of the colors separately ;-(</li>
            <li> I love this palette. I use for my day time make up but can be used to night too. The colors are pigmented and go on great. I havent used the little brush and sponge (sponges like the one included tend to carry a lot of bacteria). this is also nice for travel.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup!  The colors are beautiful, you can coordinate or mix them if you want to and the little cards tell you exactly what to do with each color.  I got nothing but compliments from my co-workers when I started using this set.  I knocked off one star because mine did not come with the little applicator as the picture shows.  I use brushes anyway, not the little foam thingys most makeup come with so its not a big deal but they need to change their picture if they changed the product.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this brand and color palette. I love Too Faced, its so smooth feeling when you put it on your eyelids. You wont be disappointed with this brand, its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and I have been using about a month. I absolutely love how it stays on and feels so smooth. I was hesitant because it can be pricey, but it was well worth it! I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I love this palette because the colors are beautiful! The best of all is that you can follow the instructions in the cards and get an amazing look! I would recommend it to anyone! It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> For all the rave reviews, I was pretty excited to try this shadow collection.  It&#x27;s more than I usually spend on make up, so I really hoped to get my money&#x27;s worth.  Did I?  I&#x27;m really not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the one hand, the first look, the one created with the colors in the top row, is really nice.  It is natural-looking but not boring. Flattering, noticeably wearing shadow, but doesn&#x27;t scream at you.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;naked,&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m okay with that.  I&#x27;m not skilled enough with make up to have chosen the colors on my own, so I appreciate this first set in the collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second and third looks (rows two and three) are horrible on me.  I mean really truly horrible.  I would never wear them,  They aren&#x27;t flattering and they aren&#x27;t natural.  Maybe they look good on other women, but not me.  Two of the shades I can use in other other ways with other colors, but the rest are a complete waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the colors, I find the shadow to be good quality.  It lasts all day (12-14 hours) without fading or creasing, and that&#x27;s without primer.  Using the sample of shadow insurance that came it intensifies the color a bit, so I think I use a little less shadow.  The primer might pay for itself that way, but I haven&#x27;t bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for me it comes down to whether using just one look, the top row, is worth the money.  My first reaction is no.  The look is pretty and flattering, but not amazing, and I ought to be able to get the same look for a lot less. And I just hate that I&lt;br /&gt;m wasting all those other colors.  I can&#x27;t stand to throw it away, so it&#x27;s still sitting in my drawer, never to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the subscribe and save is a good discount, and the shadow lasted about 9 months.  At that point one of the colors (the middle of the top row) was empty, but there was still a lot left of all the other shades.  I&#x27;ve had a busy year (added another baby) and don&#x27;t have time to go out shopping, so rather than trying to find a similar look for less, I did buy this a second a time.  I think I over-used the one color that emptied first, so I hope to make this second box last longer.  So I guess my conclusion it that if I put in the time I could find a better deal for the look, but right now I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have that time, so I&#x27;m paying a few extra bucks for the convenience of a pre-made collection.  So though I claim it&#x27;s not worth the money, my actions say otherwise.</li>
            <li> I love this palette and I use every single color in it. If you were traveling, you could grab this box and have all your eye shadow covered. I have fair skin and light green eyes (almost like the image on the front of the box) and this palette looks great.. yes even the black looks good when used the way they describe! Honestly, I can see these colors working on any skin/eye color combination, because they are so soft and neutral. I don&#x27;t like eyeshadows that have a lot of glitter in them, and that isn&#x27;t a problem here. There are a few in the set that have a shimmer to them, but I would describe it more like a pearl than \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; when applied. If you only want a matte look, you won&#x27;t enjoy every single color in this box.</li>
            <li> Very nice palette of color; my 24yr. old is jealous and wants one too. I lean towards the softer subtle colors and she loves the bolder ones with sparkle. Goes on smooth, blends well, looks natural. I will be buying this product for all of my daughters too.[[ASIN:B003TNVSTW Too Faced Naked Eye Palette 1 ea]]</li>
            <li> This is overall a good set, I like the variety of colors offered, would get 5 stars if the eyeshadows were bigger. I have to use sparingly because they are so dang small. But still do not regret getting this. Too Faced Palettes are AWESOME</li>
            <li> When I purchased this item I really didn&#x27;t think anything more about it except I hope I receive my item on time. This seller went above and beyond, I received my product very quickly and not only was there a very sweet note left inside the box for me but a tube of eye shadow primer from the same brand as the eye shadow I purchased (a very sweet bonus)I will definitely be buying from this seller (not just because they gave me a bonus but because they are very reliable)in the near future!</li>
            <li> Too Faced hit the nail on the head with this Naked Eye Palette. The amazing thing about it is the colors are so neutral, and yet so flattering, that when you begin applying them you almost doubt that it will do anything for you at all. But the finished product is not only completely natural looking, it&#x27;s downright glamorous. Whenever I use any of the looks detailed in the (very convenient) style cards included, or a look I create on my own with this palette, people have stopped me in the street to tell me that my eyes are beautiful and/or they stop me to ask if I&#x27;m a celebrity. (That \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; instance has happened to me not once, not twice, but three times.)   I feel like this palette gives the Urban Decay Naked Palette a run for its money. I love appearing as though I&#x27;m wearing little to no makeup, and still being able to walk the streets like I&#x27;m a rock star.   Now, details. This palette comes with three style cards, each with a different look: a Day look, a Classic look, and a Fashion look. The Day look uses In the Buff, which is a sheer, milk-white color, Pillow Talk, a shimmery taupe, and Like A Virgin, which is a matte, light brown shade. The Classic look uses Birthday Suit (light mocha color), Satin Sheets (a shimmery pink), and Unmentionables (a slate grey, metallic shade). And the FABULOUS Fashion look features Pink Cheeks (a very pale pink), Lap Dance (a darker, matte taupe) and finally, Stiletto (a very inky black). All three looks are very natural and very, very sexy.  This is a must have in your makeup arsenal, ladies!</li>
            <li> This review is by Shawn&#x27;s wife.  I really love the shimmery yet natural look a few of these shadows give.  The rest of the colors are just TOO DARK for my taste and there is one glittery one, I ended up with more glitter on my cheeks and nose than on my eyelids. But I really do love the 2 colors I use.  Use with Too Faced Shadow Insurance, it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> is it suppose to come with a brush because i see it in the pic but its different in person.</li>
            <li> Oooh, I love this palette! My favorite for the past two years has been Cargo&#x27;s Essential Eye Palette (in Cool Neutral) - while I still like it, I was getting bored with it. Long story short, an acquaintance, who works at Ulta recommended Too Faced&#x27;s palettes when I complimented her on her eyeshadow. I was happy to see Amazon not only carries it, but offers a discount when purchasing through Subscribe and Save.   This palette gives such beautiful, soft eyeshadow looks - all of the colors work well together, and the three suggested looks (with instructions) are really nice too. I use the \\&quot;Day\\&quot; look most often, and it easily transitions into a smokier/evening look - by either building the intensity of the included shadows, or I&#x27;ll use NARS&#x27; Coconut Grove in the very outer \\&quot;V\\&quot; of the eyes. In the Buff and Pillow Talk also work well with Lancome&#x27;s Dill (Dill in the outer V), which I&#x27;ll use when I use an olive eyeliner (Bobbi Brown&#x27;s Forest Shimmer) instead of my usual brown/bronze. The shadows wear very well - all day - although I always wear a primer, so I can&#x27;t say if they&#x27;d last as well without primer. They blend very easily, and apply evenly (that was the biggest problem I&#x27;d had all along with Cargo&#x27;s palette). Some of the really shimmery ones have some fallout (Satin Sheets is the main offender in this palette, but that&#x27;s the one shade I don&#x27;t particularly care for anyway), but I found blowing excess off the brush helps a bit. With the exception of Satin Sheets, I love all of the colors. I think best of all, this palette has helped me break out of my rut and start experimenting with different colors and techniques again, and not just with the colors included, but some of the palette and some other eyeshadow singles that I&#x27;ve used and put aside and forgotten about.  I have the Neutral and Smokey palettes on my Wish List - and can&#x27;t wait to purchase those as well!</li>
            <li> I love these eye shadows. The pigmentation is really dark, so a little goes a long way. You can combine any of the shadows to create your own style, from day time natural to super shadow sexy to romantic. I used this palette set to do my make-up for my wedding. It took a little practice to get the look I wanted but the quality is great and will give you the results you want. I bought the eye shadow primer from Too Faced Cosmetics to compliment this palette, it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty and blend with each other well.  I really like the cards that show how to create different looks with the different colors.  The brush that comes with the set has the traditional sponge applicator on one end and a thin eyeliner brush on the other.  Both work well and have held up to everyday use.  My issue is the names that the company has given the different eye shadows.  Example: Like a Virgin, Pillow Talk, Satin Sheets, Lap Dance.  I will not buy this set for my middle school niece.</li>
            <li> I love this naked eye compact.  The colors are are soft and are perfect for day, afternoon, and evening wear.</li>
            <li> This palette truly does create a naked eye.  It makes you look like you&#x27;re put together but without anyone noticing that you&#x27;ve got makeup on.  In other words, it enhances your natural beauty instead of standing out on its own.  Each line of shadows is made to create a different look, although you could of course mix and match, and they go from day to night.  I also use individual colors when I&#x27;m creating looks with other shadows.  I feel like the color pickup on my brushes (I do not use brushed included with eyeshadows and opt for my own brushes which create a smoother look) is quite nice and I am able to apply sufficient amount of color without a lot of work.  Something else to note:  if you&#x27;re a fan of being able to do your makeup quickly and get out the door, as I often do, this is great for that as the colors can be very applied very lightly and still make you feel put together.  I highly recommend this palette to anyone who likes a softer look, though I&#x27;m sure you could really make these colors pop by adding some liquid to the mix.</li>
            <li> The shadows in this palette are so soft and blendable. The colors are soft and neutral, so it&#x27;ll give your eyes a beautiful natural look. They are all pretty shimmery, except for I have sensitive skin and it suits me. However, I don&#x27;t like the names used for the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a sample of the Too Faced Shadow Insurance (Primer)and I couldn&#x27;t believe it! It worked! No creasing or fading. It smells kind of weird but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality set.  Mine DID come with an applicator brush in a little drawer in the bottom of the case. It&#x27;s got 3 nice little instruction cards. This stuff lasts a while and is easy to apply. It&#x27;s SUPER soft. I love it.</li>
            <li> was not for me..was very very small for the price..guess it was ok for the gift..got for xmas and got after 3 days of ordering it...very good service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very fair blonde, and I&#x27;ve worn makeup since I was a very young teen. I also have a cosmetology license, so I have learned how to professionally apply makeup. This eyeshadow set is a very good one, if you&#x27;re willing to pay the price! I&#x27;m not going to lie, you could buy a few different drug store brand eye shadows to achieve the same effects - but this set is very complete and good quality shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a heavy makeup wearer for well over a decade now, but lately as I approach my thirties it&#x27;s occurred to me that it might be good to tone it down some as I age. I wear a lot of colorful shadows, but I wanted to try something a bit more sophisticated and mature. This set of eye shadows really does have the perfect tones to achieve the \\&quot;naked eye\\&quot; look, as it claims to. I&#x27;m not actually wearing less makeup, but it looks like I am! You can contour and accent the eye without your face screaming, \\&quot;Look at me! I wear too much makeup!!!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator this set comes with is okay, I do wish they had included two applicators instead of just one (although it has two ends, one end has an eyeshadow applicator and the other is a brush for lining the eye). Considering this set has 9 colors, it would be nice to have more than one applicator! The box is chunky, too, not the type of makeup accessory you&#x27;d throw in your little makeup bag. It&#x27;s best stored at home in a bathroom drawer. The \\&quot;guides\\&quot; it comes with, which demonstrates which colors to apply in order to achieve specific \\&quot;looks\\&quot;, is a nice touch. I love being able to alternate between the matte eye shadows, or using the shimmery ones - or sometimes both! All of the shadows apply very well - In The Buff is especially nice as an under-eye brightener for someone as fair skinned as myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re willing to pay the money for this set, I&#x27;d say it is an excellent tool for your makeup bag if you want a versatile eye shadow set with which you can get both the natural or smokey eye look if you prefer. With that being said, there are also less expensive brands which carry very similar colors, and you could piece together your own set of \\&quot;naked eye\\&quot; shadows if you really wanted to. With Too Faced, however, you will get slightly higher quality. I&#x27;ve been very happy with how beautifully these colors apply.t being said, there are also less expensive brands which carry very similar colors, and you could piece together your own set of \\&quot;naked eye\\&quot; shadows if you really wanted to.

            <li> I achieved great eyeshadow applications! You can go from a soft day look to a sexy soft sophisticated look.  None of these shadows will give you a dark smoky look which i liked because I wasn&#x27;t looking for that.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail yesterday &amp; all i can say is that i absolutely love it!  The colors blend so perfectly &amp; the instruction cards make it so easy to use. Between the Too Faced Naked palette &amp; the Natural palette, I&#x27;m gonna go with the naked.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the Too Faced Naked Eye Palette a year or so ago at a national makeup chain and I love, love, love the product.  So I reordered from Amazon thinking I&#x27;d save the time and maybe a few dollars, however, the item I received from Amazon did not have the extra drawer with the application brush; it was a smaller box with only the eye shadows. The photos on Amazon show the drawer and brush.  I hope I didn&#x27;t pay for something that I didn&#x27;t get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I love the product!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE my two faced. I have had the same pallet for 4 years and it STILL looks beautiful on. More than worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow set!  This collection is great because it gives you a nice natural look.  It makes my eyes look better than they do without eyeshadow, but without being overdone.  I really like that the set comes with instructions for three different looks.  It makes using it a no-brainer.  My set did not come with the brush, but I don&#x27;t really care about that.  I would recommend this product to anyone who would like some nice, natural eye looks and instructions on how to achieve them.  I will definitely be trying more Too Faced products in the future!</li>
            <li> I liked this product. It&#x27;s my first experience with Too Faced and I like it. in the set is the base for the shadows, but for now I use with essens. The colors are bright, beautiful and rich. Pigmented enough and suitable for daytime makeup and for the festive and evening. Also accompanied by instructions for applying shadows. Pretty convenient packaging, very girly)</li>
            <li> This product is everything it is suppose to be. The colors are excellent and really stay on. I love it. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Tried to return knock off item and fake item. Should have told Too faced this person is making fake products of theirs and selling them to make money. Filed a returned and this person closed it because it&#x27;s fragrance?? WTH?? Doesn&#x27;t even make sense..WIll never ever buy again from this scammer...</li>
            <li> I loved it &amp; I&#x27;m really happy with it  but mine didn&#x27;t came with a brush  i don&#x27;t know why?</li>
            <li> The shades of eye make-up are very attractive.  The quality of the make-up is excellent.  I love the box it comes in.  The price was also very competitive.</li>
            <li> use it everyday! its my go to shadows  great price</li>
            <li> I like this although I&#x27;ve not played around with it much. I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to do smoky, since I&#x27;m bleach blonde and fair completed. My only complaint is the lighter colors are a little transparent and don&#x27;t have much pigment, but otherwise this offers some nice nude colors, particularly for base building, like all over lid.</li>
            <li> I have one and I love it and my sister loved it and so I got it for her birthday, but it did not come with the brush thing. It is amazing eye shadow, but she can&#x27;t use the eyeliner without the brush that comes with it because she doesn&#x27;t have one. I use mine everyday and love it, but it needs to come with the stuff listed as being included, especially for the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The palette is what I liked.  I prefer to use a shadow as an eyeliner and the black color goes on smooth with no smudging or feathering.  The neutral colors are perfect for the eyes.  I am very pleased with this product and will likely order another palette.  I would definitely recommend this brand and color.</li>
            <li> If you like powdery eyes you&#x27;ll like this. I haven&#x27;t tried this with a wet brush, but with a dry brush it makes my eyes look powdery. I&#x27;d prefer a matte look. Love the color combos. But wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SET! It has such a nice color soft color palette! And I&#x27;m planning to get the other collections. (The set I bought didn&#x27;t come with the little brush... I guess the change the packaging style.)</li>
            <li> First of all I got this pallete later than somethings which I ordered at the same time with it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this palette to the the woman, who needs something special or serious. I am very unsatisfied. it&#x27;s like a cosmetic for child. No good pigmentation, unaccurate internal form. For me acquaintance with \\&quot;Too faced\\&quot; closed. But shadow foundation which was added as a present was not bad, it&#x27;s quite pretty thing. any way I will not more pay money and time for this brend. as for me for the same money which I paid I could get something from lux cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to receiving the Too Faced Naked Eye Palette, but was extremely disappointed when I received it.The photo on the Amazon web page depicts a palette with a brush that seems to flip-out of a section in the palette. There is \\&quot;NO\\&quot; such feature, \\&quot;NO\\&quot; brush included in any way shape or form.  Also the description states that there are included three (3) instruction cards for three different looks that one can create with this palette. Instruction cards \\&quot;NOT\\&quot; included. Needless to say I am returning this palette immediately. Therefore, if you are interested in purchasing this palette, I suggest you buy it at a store where you are able to check the contents yourself. DO NOT buy it from Amazon as you will not receive what they are representing on their website.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallet.  It is my go-to natural every day look.  I get so many compliments on my eyeshadow.  The colors last forever.  Definitely worth the price.  It was the first Too Faced pallet I bought, and I have bought more of their products since.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Item NOT as advertised . Mine did not come with the brush shown which is very diasappointing. Other than that the colors are nice</li>
            <li> This is my first Too Faced eye palette purchase and I LOVE IT!!! In one palette I can go from a soft and natural look to an edgy dark smoky eye. Complete strangers compliment me on my eyeshadow. Well worth it, will be trying the other palettes for sure.</li>
            <li> This set is really nice. It mixes up the day/night time looks that you may need all in one kit.</li>
            <li> Beautiful packaging... beautiful shades...great quality. Great make up. It even comes with 3 pretty flash cards with 6 looks/tutorial. It is a very natural palette which I like. Classy, subtle very natural.</li>
            <li> This collection is beautiful.  It comes with instruction cards (3) which detail how to achieve a particular look with the eyeshadow palette, which is a nice little touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container has a magnet closure, which I like.  However, the picture displayed on Amazon is not the correct photo.  (I also read other reviews wherein this was mentioned.)  The photo of the product shows a bottom slide out compartment drawer wherein a brush is stored.  THERE IS NO COMPARTMENT AND NO BRUSH WITH THE PRODUCT.  I don&#x27;t mind that too much, considering I use my own brush set anyway.  But, it&#x27;s worth mentioning since some buying might want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadows are of excellent quality.  They provide spectacular coverage, feel silky and glide on nicely without a lot of flaking.  The variety of colors is nice in that you will find that you&#x27;ll use all of them, unlike some other collections wherein only one or two of the colors you end up actually liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very fair complexion and these shadows do not wash me out and are dark enough to be able to apply for a nighttime look or a daytime look, depending on the colors I choose from the palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I received came with a sample of Two-Faced eyeshadow primer.  I use MAC eyeshadow primer.  I have not tried the sample of Two-Faced primer yet.  But, I will stress this when using ANY quality eyeshadow...USE PRIMER!  It really does make a huge difference in the appearance and how long the eyeshadow will remain without needing a touch-up.  Some primers are tinted and are meant to change the look of the eyeshadows (color).  However, the primer I use is nude.  It looks like my foundation color.  I apply it after my base foundation, then use eyeshadow.  As a result, my eyeshadows last for as long as I want it to, looking as beautiful as when I initially applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has quickly become my quick go-to choice for eyeshadow.  (I&#x27;m typically a MAC cosmetic user, but like Urban Decay and Two-Faced eyeshadows more than I actually like MAC&#x27;s.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product.  Additionally, the photo of the product on Amazon needs to be updated with the actual product showing the correct container.Decay and Two-Faced eyeshadows more than I actually like MAC&#x27;s.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product.  Additionally, the photo of the product on Amazon needs to be updated with the actual product showing the correct container.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette, even though I originally wanted the \\&quot;boudoir\\&quot; set.  This one was the most similar and I liked the colors in this one a LOT.  I have fair skin, so most of these colors work for my skin tone.  However, the darker ones make me feel like I got punched in the face.. Someone who is more experienced with makeup can definitely make them work though!  I also don&#x27;t like the look of too much makeup, it can definitely age a young face.  That&#x27;s why I really love all the light colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS a tad expensive but the quality is really high.  These colors are nice and powdery, very pigmented and you don&#x27;t have to work hard at all to pick up the colors.  I didn&#x27;t even GET the applicator shown in the photo (I got mine from sephora), but I always use my own brushes anyway...  I still feel cheated, even though I wouldn&#x27;t have used it, and I wish they would&#x27;ve opted for a mirror instead.  The little cards with drawings and suggestions are adorable, but I don&#x27;t follow them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, packaging is adorable, but not practical.  The squareness of it makes it awkward and it doesn&#x27;t fit anywhere except drawers and big boxes.  I like that it&#x27;s a magnet shut so that it doesn&#x27;t flop open if you DID carry it alone in your purse (with an added mirror of your own since there isn&#x27;t one in there!) it won&#x27;t get all over your stuff, or break.  The colors are set in there really nicely, so I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll crack like a lot of eye shadows tend to do.</li>
            <li> This was my first Too Faced product and I am absolutely inlove with it! Ive had it for about 3 months and its almost gone and all the colors are very good if you are looking for a neutral look.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using the natural eye palette of theirs, which I love. This palette is nice, the colors are all very blendable. I know it says its a naked palette but the colors are a bit light, so if that&#x27;s what you are looking for then it&#x27;s a great palette. I still use the natural one more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye shadow. Makes blue eyes pop and comes with tutorial cards to help you master the perfect technique. Super easy and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased on this product. Made a great gift. My grandaughter who is 21 loved this gift. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This palette was given as a gift.  Colors are beautiful and make up goes on easy and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!</li>
            <li> This set offers a great range of colors (each looks fantastic on skin).  The pigments are vibrant and application is very smooth.  I loved that the colors blend really well together.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love their color palettes and the quality of the products.  I was expecting to have an applicator included as I had from a previous purchase so I was disappointed it didn&#x27;t come with one in a little drawer in the bottom of the case.  But everything else is great!  I love the sturdy case.</li>
            <li> I am a novice when it comes to more complex eyeshadow application so the guides included in Too Faced products are extremely helpful!  While you can certainly go out and buy cheaper products, you will lose the combined packaging and instructions provided in all of Too Faced&#x27;s eye palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is bulky and incredibly inconvenient for travel.  This is intended for complex application in front of a well lighted mirror.  I keep several of these palettes in a vanity.  Other reviewers have pointed out the lack of a brush, but again, these are intended for home application with a high quality set of shadow brushes.  This is not a drugstore product and cheap applicators are not going to work for the looks explained in the set.  It requires blending and more precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to use this at home and I&#x27;d invest in a high quality set of brushes.  Sonia Kashuk has affordable good quality sets.  Add a set to your shopping cart, you won&#x27;t regret it.  This is investment type makeup.  Not for the gal who is gonna dash something on her face and go.  Use the drugstore products for that.  You need to give yourself enough time to do this right.  I&#x27;d also strongly recommend practicing these looks at home so that you become proficient enough to pull them out for a girls night or date night.  Practice makes perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about this set is that you can wear it to the office and out at night.  Probably the best Too Faced eye palette out there!  I&#x27;ve tried Soft and Sexy, Natural at Night, and Natural as well.  This is by far the most versatile set to go from the office to anywhere!  Great quality and texture to all!</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow palette!  The instructions that came with it were wonderful!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and really like being able to blend the colors so easily.</li>
