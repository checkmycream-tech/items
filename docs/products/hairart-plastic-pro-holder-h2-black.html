            <li>this is really a nice mannequin holder.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to make my own wig and this helps a lot.</li>
            <li>The C Clamp came in handy when making my u part wig.</li>
            <li>Kind of a hassle.</li>
            <li>But I did learn how to use it on my own.</li>
            <li>It is my own fault</li>
            <li>If you do your own hair this is def.</li>
            <li>Good clamp, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Comes in three separate parts that were very easy to figure out how to assemble.</li>
            <li>This Holder is very strong, and flexible.</li>

            <li>I use cotten thread on large spools, and this clamp is perfect to attach to a table and keep my cotton thread off the floor, easy to use, and keep my cats from trying to play with it as it moves.</li>
            <li>Easy assembly, fits the styrofoam wig heads like a champ, and good clamping on most any surfaces.</li>
            <li>price seemed to good to be true, but to inexpensive to ignore.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight plastic.</li>
            <li>this one is ok moves a lot.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t attach to many surfaces.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I received this item it looks ok</li>
            <li>but if you are planning to use this for anything more than styling get something sturdier.</li>
            <li>I love this wig holder.</li>
            <li>IT can adjust to fit any table and works quite well!</li>
            <li>It will not stay put on the counter top edge.</li>
            <li>I was able to hook it up to kitchen breakfast counter (using a towel</li>
            <li>Does what it needs: )</li>
            <li>is so much better</li>

            <li>This is sturdy plastic which I like most because I dont have to worry about my daughter breaking something</li>
            <li>I like that I can tighten or loosen the top part of the stand</li>
            <li>My daughter is able to style the mannequins hair at a better position than holding the doll head on her knees.</li>
            <li>This can be connected to almost any table or counter top.  </li>
            <li>I got this to take to a convention so that I could touch up wigs at the hotel, and it works okay for that--</li>

            <li>BUT WORKS FINE</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Way cheaply built nylon construction.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit Form Head</li>
            <li>Read the questions asked, and thanks to one kind buyer, we can all now use this product.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t scratch granite) and it was fabulous.  </li>
            <li>The head of the stand didn&#x27;t fit into it.</li>
            <li>This item is great for putting wig heads along with different types of wigs.</li>

            <li>a really great seller to buy from they really value customers and go above and beyond :)</li>
            <li>thanks! :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased and so happy because this stand makes my life a little easier.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to see a product that could make it easier to blow dry and style without use of a chin strap.  </li>
            <li>I am not a wig professional, but this seems like such a great value!</li>
            <li>Love it for the price, makes wig making so much easier</li>
            <li>It really holds the canvas head well and stays in place. :)</li>
            <li>I HAD ONE OF THESE ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO, BUT IT WAS FULL METAL</li>
            <li>If you need a stand for practising this is definitely a good choice, especially if you&#x27;re just a beginner or just trying things out because then if you change your mind</li>
            <li>not bad for the price</li>
            <li>This product was not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Its does a good job at supporting a new fresh styrofoam head but has to put tape around it once the head gets worn.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fine haha), but it works just fine-</li>
            <li>If I styled my hairpiece more frequently, I&#x27;d probably purchase a sturdier one than this, but for someone that doesn&#x27;t style frequently, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>The foam head I have fits onto it well, and the clamp seems pretty secure, too.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very affordable.</li>
            <li>assembly, was easy, and very sturdy product.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this procuct to anyone, who like&lt;br</li>
            <li>This let you clamp down your wig had on a table, So you can comb your wig out very nice to have.</li>
            <li>You will need a large free edge to use this product.</li>
            <li>I only use this once a year for my halloween wigs but it is a huge help love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>too much Salon care is better but the neck holder is too big for my head better for styrofoam head</li>
            <li>Worth the price and durable, would buy again if i happen to need an additional one.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Will be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>This was a great price and will do exactly what I need when I sit down to make my wigs.</li>
            <li>I tried many things as substitutes for this very useful item when styling human hair doll wigs.  </li>
            <li>Was happy at first to recieve it by the date that it was suppose to come, but was slightly rough/used looking but it does what it was ment for.</li>
            <li>but is 1 of the realistic professional Kind with the plastic hole in the neck area fits likeva glove</li>
            <li>This is just right for using to put a mannequin head on.  </li>
            <li>Very useful for someone new to the use of wigs!</li>
            <li>its light and can be taken apart and put back together again easily.</li>
            <li>great price and no more frustration in working with a wiggly mannequin head.  </li>
            <li>Super fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>An extra wide screw on holder makes it ideal for any work bench or table.</li>
            <li>you very much.</li>
            <li>The price was amazing and came faster than expected.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok definitely needed this for school and to work on my skills</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it said in the description box it was sturdy and light-weight.</li>
            <li>Will shell out more $$ next time for a nicer one.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>It did not hold up the head very well at all!</li>
            <li>Glad finally order one.</li>
            <li>BUT I WAS GLAD TO FIND IT JUST THE SAME.</li>
            <li>Seems solid and sturdy for being made mostly of plastic.</li>
            <li>It gives me the able to move the head around as i practice different hairstyles.</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you see!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Exactly like the one I used in cosmo class.</li>
            <li>I will buy another one from the same seller, just a better quality.</li>
            <li>It also does not come assembled but assembly was not difficult.</li>
            <li>The plastic is very sturdy and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>I have not used one yet but plan to use long pins to attach the ball to the top of the canvas wig head that works with this head holder.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars for it be extra easy to put together</li>
            <li>the large Neck holder</li>
            <li>It can accommodate large surfaces as well as paper-thin surfaces.</li>
            <li>About the hand size of a large glue gun.</li>
            <li>We hooked it to a counter top and it did move just a bit more than I wanted it to, but overall worth the investment for an amateur.  </li>
            <li>This stuff looks huge in the picture but in reality it&#x27;s in a package as big as a vitamin bottle BUTTTTT!!!!</li>
            <li>that the form, so I placed some toilet tissue over it and that helped to keep the form in place for easy maneuverability.</li>
            <li>This device is very well made.</li>
            <li>Very sturdly, and moves when needed.</li>
            <li>They help so much in keeping the head in place.</li>
            <li>Makes wig making much easier.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look that much like the picture</li>
            <li>It had really fast shipping</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I really like the versatility of the clamp itself.</li>
            <li>I just wobbles a lot and the clamp doesn&#x27;t clamped or grip very well..</li>
            <li>Very sturdy for the price.</li>
            <li>This clamp holds the mannequin head in place, and makes wig making so much easier.</li>
            <li>it makes it much easier than clamps that are stationary when trying to style a wig</li>
            <li>This is going to be so much help when making wigs.</li>
            <li>C clamp is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>HAHAHAHA</li>
            <li>No grip it doesn&#x27;t stay in 1 position moves around to much it had chips</li>
            <li>This item is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Wobbles way too much.</li>
            <li>My husband attached it to a flat bar stool seat and put rubber tabs where the smooth plastic touches the seat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually pretty sure I&#x27;m missing a piece too</li>
            <li>My 5 year old uses it for play and it&#x27;s worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Also, the top plate is slanted and will slip off when you try to tighten it down.</li>
            <li>Clever man.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this little invention, I can make my wigs fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I have it set up on my counter up high</li>
            <li>it really holds tight to whatever you put it on and it can be adjusted really easily..</li>
            <li>Very restrictive as far as where it can be mounted...</li>
            <li>Does not secure well to table tops as the plastic/nylon bends and gives more than it should.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with human hair wigs for easy styling.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look brand new but does what i wanted it to.</li>
            <li>but it did not seem brand new.  </li>
            <li>This is something I will only use occasionally, so it is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Holds my wig head in place, only thing is it&#x27;s not that wide, so you need a table with the outside nice and no drawers or anything.</li>
            <li>so my 3 year old daughter cannot reach it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small inconvenience, and while the parts are a little rough/cheap, it performs well and the price was great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for holding a Styrofoam wig head for your wig,  but still felt a little flimsy, but I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li>But my wig head whole is a little wide, so the head didn&#x27;t fit very well..</li>
            <li>Soft plastic</li>
            <li>The quality is that of the tools like these you see in professional salons.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to style my wigs now by simply clamping this to the vanity counter.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money I spent!</li>
            <li>Can definitely be useful for crafts and other styling projects.</li>
            <li>The pieces are also very cheaply made, with the flat parts are warped and small bits of plastic that weren&#x27;t cut off.</li>
            <li>Transportable and easy to attach to any hard surface.</li>
            <li>I would NOT use this for involved styling or cutting, as it doesn&#x27;t have a strong enough hold, but it&#x27;s fine for combing and touch-ups.</li>
            <li>I brought this clamp for a manikin head as Christmas present for my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I just put a thin sock over the holder before putting the head on it to snug up the fit, issue easily fixed!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it promised and has a tight grip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and has a firm grip and a tight hold.</li>

            <li> this is really a nice mannequin holder.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to make my own wig and this helps a lot.</li>
            <li> The C Clamp came in handy when making my u part wig.</li>
            <li> Kind of a hassle.</li>
            <li> But I did learn how to use it on my own.</li>
            <li> It is my own fault</li>
            <li> If you do your own hair this is def.</li>
            <li> Good clamp, easy to use.  </li>

            <li> price seemed to good to be true, but to inexpensive to ignore.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight plastic.</li>
            <li> this one is ok moves a lot.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t attach to many surfaces.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I received this item it looks ok</li>
            <li> but if you are planning to use this for anything more than styling get something sturdier.</li>
            <li> I love this wig holder.</li>
            <li> IT can adjust to fit any table and works quite well!</li>
            <li> It will not stay put on the counter top edge.</li>

            <li> Does what it needs: )</li>
            <li> is so much better</li>

            <li> This is sturdy plastic which I like most because I dont have to worry about my daughter breaking something</li>
            <li> I like that I can tighten or loosen the top part of the stand</li>
            <li> My daughter is able to style the mannequins hair at a better position than holding the doll head on her knees.</li>
            <li> This can be connected to almost any table or counter top.  </li>
            <li> I got this to take to a convention so that I could touch up wigs at the hotel, and it works okay for that--</li>

            <li> I did put some sticky ribber contacts on it to make it stay on the table better.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely much better than I figured it would have been.</li>

            <li> its pretty nice to customize your wigs .</li>
            <li> BUT WORKS FINE</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Way cheaply built nylon construction.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit Form Head</li>
            <li> Read the questions asked, and thanks to one kind buyer, we can all now use this product.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t scratch granite) and it was fabulous.  </li>
            <li> The head of the stand didn&#x27;t fit into it.</li>
            <li> This item is great for putting wig heads along with different types of wigs.</li>

            <li> Cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> It was cheaply made - but it was cheaply priced..  </li>
            <li> Cheap plastic.</li>

            <li> I really like the wig stand clamp, it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> a really great seller to buy from they really value customers and go above and beyond :)</li>
            <li> thanks! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased and so happy because this stand makes my life a little easier.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to see a product that could make it easier to blow dry and style without use of a chin strap.  </li>
            <li> I am not a wig professional, but this seems like such a great value!</li>
            <li> Love it for the price, makes wig making so much easier</li>
            <li> It really holds the canvas head well and stays in place. :)</li>
            <li> I HAD ONE OF THESE ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO, BUT IT WAS FULL METAL</li>
            <li> If you need a stand for practising this is definitely a good choice, especially if you&#x27;re just a beginner or just trying things out because then if you change your mind</li>
            <li> not bad for the price</li>
            <li> This product was not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Its does a good job at supporting a new fresh styrofoam head but has to put tape around it once the head gets worn.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s fine haha), but it works just fine-</li>
            <li> If I styled my hairpiece more frequently, I&#x27;d probably purchase a sturdier one than this, but for someone that doesn&#x27;t style frequently, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The foam head I have fits onto it well, and the clamp seems pretty secure, too.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very affordable.</li>
            <li> assembly, was easy, and very sturdy product.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this procuct to anyone, who like&lt;br</li>
            <li> This let you clamp down your wig had on a table, So you can comb your wig out very nice to have.</li>
            <li> You will need a large free edge to use this product.</li>
            <li> I only use this once a year for my halloween wigs but it is a huge help love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> too much Salon care is better but the neck holder is too big for my head better for styrofoam head</li>
            <li> Worth the price and durable, would buy again if i happen to need an additional one.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Will be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> This was a great price and will do exactly what I need when I sit down to make my wigs.</li>
            <li> I tried many things as substitutes for this very useful item when styling human hair doll wigs.  </li>
            <li> Was happy at first to recieve it by the date that it was suppose to come, but was slightly rough/used looking but it does what it was ment for.</li>
            <li> but is 1 of the realistic professional Kind with the plastic hole in the neck area fits likeva glove</li>
            <li> This is just right for using to put a mannequin head on.  </li>
            <li> Very useful for someone new to the use of wigs!</li>
            <li> its light and can be taken apart and put back together again easily.</li>
            <li> great price and no more frustration in working with a wiggly mannequin head.  </li>
            <li> Super fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> An extra wide screw on holder makes it ideal for any work bench or table.</li>
            <li> you very much.</li>
            <li> The price was amazing and came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok definitely needed this for school and to work on my skills</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it said in the description box it was sturdy and light-weight.</li>
            <li> Will shell out more $$ next time for a nicer one.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> It did not hold up the head very well at all!</li>
            <li> Glad finally order one.</li>
            <li> BUT I WAS GLAD TO FIND IT JUST THE SAME.</li>
            <li> Seems solid and sturdy for being made mostly of plastic.</li>
            <li> It gives me the able to move the head around as i practice different hairstyles.</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you see!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Exactly like the one I used in cosmo class.</li>
            <li> I will buy another one from the same seller, just a better quality.</li>
            <li> It also does not come assembled but assembly was not difficult.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very sturdy and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I have not used one yet but plan to use long pins to attach the ball to the top of the canvas wig head that works with this head holder.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars for it be extra easy to put together</li>
            <li> the large Neck holder</li>
            <li> It can accommodate large surfaces as well as paper-thin surfaces.</li>
            <li> About the hand size of a large glue gun.</li>
            <li> We hooked it to a counter top and it did move just a bit more than I wanted it to, but overall worth the investment for an amateur.  </li>
            <li> This stuff looks huge in the picture but in reality it&#x27;s in a package as big as a vitamin bottle BUTTTTT!!!!</li>
            <li> that the form, so I placed some toilet tissue over it and that helped to keep the form in place for easy maneuverability.</li>
            <li> This device is very well made.</li>
            <li> Very sturdly, and moves when needed.</li>
            <li> They help so much in keeping the head in place.</li>
            <li> Makes wig making much easier.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look that much like the picture</li>
            <li> It had really fast shipping</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I really like the versatility of the clamp itself.</li>
            <li> I just wobbles a lot and the clamp doesn&#x27;t clamped or grip very well..</li>
            <li> Very sturdy for the price.</li>
            <li> This clamp holds the mannequin head in place, and makes wig making so much easier.</li>
            <li> it makes it much easier than clamps that are stationary when trying to style a wig</li>
            <li> This is going to be so much help when making wigs.</li>
            <li> C clamp is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> HAHAHAHA</li>
            <li> No grip it doesn&#x27;t stay in 1 position moves around to much it had chips</li>
            <li> This item is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Wobbles way too much.</li>
            <li> My husband attached it to a flat bar stool seat and put rubber tabs where the smooth plastic touches the seat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually pretty sure I&#x27;m missing a piece too</li>
            <li> My 5 year old uses it for play and it&#x27;s worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Also, the top plate is slanted and will slip off when you try to tighten it down.</li>
            <li> Clever man.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this little invention, I can make my wigs fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I have it set up on my counter up high</li>
            <li> it really holds tight to whatever you put it on and it can be adjusted really easily..</li>
            <li> Very restrictive as far as where it can be mounted...</li>
            <li> Does not secure well to table tops as the plastic/nylon bends and gives more than it should.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with human hair wigs for easy styling.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look brand new but does what i wanted it to.</li>
            <li> but it did not seem brand new.  </li>
            <li> This is something I will only use occasionally, so it is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Holds my wig head in place, only thing is it&#x27;s not that wide, so you need a table with the outside nice and no drawers or anything.</li>
            <li> so my 3 year old daughter cannot reach it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small inconvenience, and while the parts are a little rough/cheap, it performs well and the price was great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for holding a Styrofoam wig head for your wig,  but still felt a little flimsy, but I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li> But my wig head whole is a little wide, so the head didn&#x27;t fit very well..</li>
            <li> Soft plastic</li>
            <li> The quality is that of the tools like these you see in professional salons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to style my wigs now by simply clamping this to the vanity counter.</li>
            <li> Its worth the money I spent!</li>
            <li> Can definitely be useful for crafts and other styling projects.</li>
            <li> The pieces are also very cheaply made, with the flat parts are warped and small bits of plastic that weren&#x27;t cut off.</li>
            <li> Transportable and easy to attach to any hard surface.</li>
            <li> I would NOT use this for involved styling or cutting, as it doesn&#x27;t have a strong enough hold, but it&#x27;s fine for combing and touch-ups.</li>
            <li> I brought this clamp for a manikin head as Christmas present for my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I just put a thin sock over the holder before putting the head on it to snug up the fit, issue easily fixed!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it promised and has a tight grip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and has a firm grip and a tight hold.</li>
            <li> Recently I posted a negative comment about this product, so it&#x27;s only right that I update the comment that I left.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This c-clamp wig head holder was offered during checkout via the new Amazon add on program when I ordered a half dozen Styrofoam bases.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a steady heavy duty  </li>
            <li> It was tooo small and i was very disapointed</li>
            <li> It was alittle confusing at first trying to figure out how to put the stand together being that it doesn&#x27;t come with directions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times already for cuts and styles and haven&#x27;t had a single problem yet.</li>
            <li> though with heavy wigs, the ball joint will move and it won&#x27;t stay completely upright!</li>
            <li> Opening is not deep enough to properly tighten down.</li>
            <li> When I trim my long hair wigs, I can get another two months of wear.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother contacting seller, it came a long way (China)</li>
            <li> Have been wanting this for a long time</li>
            <li> i had never used one of these and struggled for a long time trying to keep that mannequin head in place as i worked on my wigs.  </li>
            <li> The upright middle part however was a little smaller</li>
            <li> The instructions are actually on the box that the wig holder comes in, I was apprehensive about purchasing it due to the reviews, however I like it and can&#x27;t wait to start making wigs.</li>
            <li> Interesting, a small metal attachment continues to fall off, making it difficult to stand still for the actual doll head.</li>
            <li> To honest i&#x27;m not sure how I lived without this item for so long, it makes styling and cutting my wigs a breeze.</li>
            <li> Putting it together was a little awkward (I don&#x27;t understand why you have to assemble it in the first place) and it doesn&#x27;t clamp on super tightly (</li>
            <li> so I have 1 loose piece</li>
            <li> It would not grip onto the area I was using tight enough</li>
            <li> Only issue is that it&#x27;s not sturdy enough so if I&#x27;m brushing the hair too hard, it&#x27;ll start moving</li>
            <li> Like a simple paper with at the least picture instructions is necessary.</li>
            <li> Broke within in the week total waste of money again</li>
            <li> It works as expected with my styrofoam wig cap.</li>
            <li> It is just what I wanted and expected.  </li>
            <li> its everything i expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to use than expected.</li>
            <li> however I chose not to use it because it makes it harder to tilt the stand/head.</li>
            <li> It does come in just a plastic bag so be careful that the pieces do not fall out since it is not all put together.</li>
            <li> then i expected .</li>
            <li> I have the bottom section clamped down on a stool, so I can sit on the stool without a stick sticking up, and when I want to use the stick I simply place it on and screw it down.</li>
            <li> got my clamp along with a few other items and I can definitely say it did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> As the other reviews have stated, this does not come with instructions.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t know if  the head holder is too small or the Styrofoam head hole too big</li>
            <li> so it was not worth it to return</li>
            <li> Not very strong, don&#x27;t bother trying to use it with a canvas head.  </li>
            <li> This is just your typical mount.  </li>
            <li> Standard Styrofoam wig heads have a hole in the base that fits right on this thing.</li>
            <li> It clamps tight and stays in place.</li>
            <li> It clips on tight and adjusts to</li>
            <li> The clamp is adjustable to almost any width and holds tight.</li>
            <li> I bought several styrofoam balls in order to have a small base for the wigs that fit small dolls.  </li>
            <li> It served for it&#x27;s purpose, I still wish it would have came with a little instructional booklet.</li>
            <li> Not very pleased.</li>
            <li> Yes the plastic was a little messy but what do you expect for this price.</li>
            <li> Holds firmly.</li>
            <li> The foam wig head stays firmly in place.</li>
            <li> Installation isn&#x27;t intuitive, and the stem in a bit too narrow for any of my styrofoam heads, so they wobble while I&#x27;m styling.</li>
            <li> So it was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> I just received my Holder and was not able to put the plastic round piece into the holder.  </li>
            <li> Space inside Clamp is very small , will only accommodate thin table or countertops .</li>
            <li> I paid very little for it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure where it goes or</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the wig head or the clamp..</li>
            <li> There is a small steel ring that comes with it</li>
            <li> It is way too small.</li>
            <li> But it is small.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would improve upon is having the clamp open up a bit wider to accommodate tables with a thicker table-top base.</li>
            <li> I contacted a few individuals who have also purchased this product and they informed me that I was putting the three pieces together the wrong way.</li>
            <li> Not good for staying with.</li>
            <li> It was a poor buy.</li>
            <li> But the rest of the clamp it is made so poorly</li>
            <li> I cannot understand why it is so poorly made.</li>
            <li> The device was poorly constructed and looked somewhat worn.</li>
            <li> I received one of the clamps that had a broken piece from the wheel.</li>
            <li> it holds well from a very thin edged table to a thick one.  </li>
            <li> For years I have styled my wig while on my head attached tightly with a chin strap (very uncomfortable).  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with one.</li>
            <li> Managing the piece on my head was difficult.  </li>
            <li> Bad packaging...</li>
            <li> stupid thing locked up on me</li>
            <li> This thing is awful quality.</li>
            <li> I use to use the stand of a fan for a wig stand and it was horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The plastic is very sturdy and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Awesome for what I need kinda slides @ times but it&#x27;s ok definitely needed this for school and to work on my skills</li>
            <li> Needed a stand to keep my wig form in place while Styling a wig, the clamp holds nicely in place on a table or shelf . The upright middle part however was a little smaller that the form, so I placed some toilet tissue over it and that helped to keep the form in place for easy maneuverability.</li>
            <li> Garbage. Opening is not deep enough to properly tighten down. Also, the top plate is slanted and will slip off when you try to tighten it down. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Helps me create my wig with no problem.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a steady heavy duty  c clamp this one is ok moves a lot.  You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in place. Cheap plastic. Can&#x27;t attach to many surfaces.</li>
            <li> Broke within in the week total waste of money again no paper work to return ended up just throwing it out along with my money</li>
            <li> I really like the wig stand clamp, it&#x27;s very easy to use. It&#x27;s sturdy enough for the price. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Get this. Does exactly what it said in the description box it was sturdy and light-weight. In the stores this was like 30$ got mines for 6.88!</li>
            <li> I use it when I&#x27;m styling wigs and it serves it&#x27;s purpose so no complaints from me ,would by again</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars for it be extra easy to put together it has no instructions but its self explanatory hold my foam head perfectly.</li>
            <li> Recently I posted a negative comment about this product, so it&#x27;s only right that I update the comment that I left. I contacted a few individuals who have also purchased this product and they informed me that I was putting the three pieces together the wrong way. After reviewing their suggestions I realized that the information that they were providing me with was correct. So I apologize and I would definitely purchase this item again in the future if I need to do so!&lt;br /&gt;Regards, Alexis</li>
            <li> This device is very well made. It is sturdy and versatile. I have the bottom section clamped down on a stool, so I can sit on the stool without a stick sticking up, and when I want to use the stick I simply place it on and screw it down.</li>
            <li> Bad packaging...no instuctions had to figure out how to put it together!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied. It&#x27;s easy to assemble and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I received this item it looks ok but if you are planning to use this for anything more than styling get something sturdier.</li>
            <li> The instructions are actually on the box that the wig holder comes in, I was apprehensive about purchasing it due to the reviews, however I like it and can&#x27;t wait to start making wigs.</li>
            <li> this is really a nice mannequin holder. its sturdy and holds up well. you can&#x27;t go wrong with one. thanx</li>
            <li> well worth the money have ordered more and more of these</li>
            <li> I love this wig holder. I have been trying to make my own wig and this helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Compact, inexpensive and it works.  This is something I will only use occasionally, so it is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Was happy at first to recieve it by the date that it was suppose to come, but was slightly rough/used looking but it does what it was ment for. Very sturdly, and moves when needed. Doesn&#x27;t look brand new but does what i wanted it to.</li>
            <li> Was looking for this item and within days I was able to finish a project I had started! IT can adjust to fit any table and works quite well! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> These are just what a person needs to store and also style their wigs, it is easy to work with and holds the wigs upright so you can brush and style them.</li>
            <li> Way cheaply built nylon construction. Does not secure well to table tops as the plastic/nylon bends and gives more than it should. Spend the extra money on a metal design. I retuned this one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold the tightest but is good for what I needed it for!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit Form Head</li>
            <li> Great for wig styling. It has no assembly instructions so I have 1 loose piece and I&#x27;m not sure where it goes or what it&#x27;s purpose is.</li>
            <li> It works as expected with my styrofoam wig cap. I can finally make my wigs without balancing the wig head between my thighs.</li>
            <li> As the other reviews have stated, this does not come with instructions. Thank you to the buyer who answered a question and gave instructions on how to put this together! Otherwise I would have returned it! The company that makes this product should get a clue! Once I got it put together, it was simple, it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware! Read the questions asked, and thanks to one kind buyer, we can all now use this product.</li>
            <li> You will need a large free edge to use this product. I planed to use is it in my bathroom where I cut and styled my wigs. It will not stay put on the counter top edge. My husband attached it to a flat bar stool seat and put rubber tabs where the smooth plastic touches the seat. This gave it the grip it needed to stay in place. Clever man. Cheep fix. It does the job and the price was perfect. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> thought this was gonna be cheap in quality, its pretty good get the job done. I have no complaints with this product</li>
            <li> Received promptly.  Just as pictured.</li>
            <li> Soft plastic but it works good</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. the plastic is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t seem to grip well. Will shell out more $$ next time for a nicer one.</li>
            <li> Just as pictured. Easy to use. Holds firmly.</li>
            <li> They help so much in keeping the head in place. It would be more difficult without this. It&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> It comes in its pieces without instructions on how to assemble. The pieces are also very cheaply made, with the flat parts are warped and small bits of plastic that weren&#x27;t cut off.</li>
            <li> For years I have styled my wig while on my head attached tightly with a chin strap (very uncomfortable).  I was so happy to see a product that could make it easier to blow dry and style without use of a chin strap.  I was able to hook it up to kitchen breakfast counter (using a towel so I didn&#x27;t scratch granite) and it was fabulous.  I could easily use both hands while styling and wig never moved (I had attached wig to styrofoam head with wig push pins).  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with human hair wigs for easy styling.</li>
            <li> Works great! Makes wig making much easier. Fits the wig head with no problem.</li>
            <li> This product works just as described.  The wig head fits perfectly on it and makes it easy to style your wig.</li>
            <li> It does the job for the price!</li>
            <li> Does what it needs: )</li>
            <li> The head of the stand didn&#x27;t fit into it. It was a poor buy. Had to get from another seller</li>
            <li> It was tooo small and i was very disapointed</li>
            <li> The clamps provide a good stable hold on the edge of a shelf so I can work with the wig to style it when needed.  The foam wig head stays firmly in place.</li>
            <li> it swivels around so you can work at diffrent angls. It clamps tight and stays in place. It fits my styrofomes snug.</li>
            <li> Just as discribed get the job job done</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy, worked great</li>
            <li> It fits my needs great.  It is just what I wanted and expected.  It makes wearing wigs easier to do.</li>
            <li> This item is great for putting wig heads along with different types of wigs.</li>
            <li> Good and fast shipping</li>
            <li> When I got it, it seem like it was an used item already with all the scratches on it. Not very pleased.</li>
            <li> So this came in pieces in a plastic bag with no instructions at all. The fact that they would assume people know how to put this thing together is beyond me. Like a simple paper with at the least picture instructions is necessary. I&#x27;m actually pretty sure I&#x27;m missing a piece too</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> This head stand is great for holding up my mannequin head. Only issue is that it&#x27;s not sturdy enough so if I&#x27;m brushing the hair too hard, it&#x27;ll start moving and I have to keep adjusting it. Other than that, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Installation isn&#x27;t intuitive, and the stem in a bit too narrow for any of my styrofoam heads, so they wobble while I&#x27;m styling.</li>
            <li> Holds my wig head in place, only thing is it&#x27;s not that wide, so you need a table with the outside nice and no drawers or anything. Like bathroom counters.</li>
            <li> This is just your typical mount.  It cost the same as buying it the local Sally&#x27;s so if you have one close I would suggest just getting it there unless you don&#x27;t mind waiting for it to be shipped.</li>
            <li> This sucked! It did not hold up the head very well at all! I got so fed up I just put the head between my legs and never got any use out of the actual product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for holding a Styrofoam wig head for your wig,  but still felt a little flimsy, but I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li> Theres only 1 goheadning about this clamp is that my mannequin head which is not styrofoam but is 1 of the realistic professional Kind with the plastic hole in the neck area fits likeva glove But the rest of the clamp it is made so poorly does not rotate smoothly must be grip needs to be readjusted too much Salon care is better but the neck holder is too big for my head better for styrofoam head I would not recommend buying This Salon care is so much better the large Neck holder so I only give this product 2 star because it holds The mannequins head like a glove</li>
            <li> Used in collaboration with the Celebrity Whitney Manikin, also from Amazon, and can say with all the movement caused by my daughter practicing hair styles this clamp stands up to the challenges every time.</li>
            <li> I love it! going to get another one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look that much like the picture but it will work. It had really fast shipping and I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it as of yet.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my Styrofoam wig holder.  Fab!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Works as intended.</li>
            <li> great support help with making wigs.</li>
            <li> This product clamps to a cabinet top, holds a foam head, and wig for storage and styling! Very useful for someone new to the use of wigs!</li>
            <li> Interesting, a small metal attachment continues to fall off, making it difficult to stand still for the actual doll head.</li>
            <li> The C Clamp came in handy when making my u part wig. The price was amazing and came faster than expected. Worked great.</li>
            <li> This let you clamp down your wig had on a table, So you can comb your wig out very nice to have.</li>
            <li> stupid thing locked up on me and i cant even unscrew it ugh! i would def not buy again .</li>
            <li> Perfect Fit&#x27;s Any Table Or Counter !</li>
            <li> Used this with a wig dummy to work on a Halloween wig.  It worked ok and was definitely better than trying to do it yourself.  We hooked it to a counter top and it did move just a bit more than I wanted it to, but overall worth the investment for an amateur.  It might be just how these work as I have never used one before.</li>
            <li> I bought my granddaughter a beautician&#x27;s head to practice hairstyles on. This clamp works perfectly and was a good buy. I wouldn&#x27;t have any hesitation recommending it.</li>
            <li> 👸&lt;br /&gt;👗👍 I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;👡</li>
            <li> I bought this this along with 2 wig heads didnt know how was I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to put it together I wish it had instructions but after  10 minutes I found out how to put it together</li>
            <li> It works. This is sturdy plastic which I like most because I dont have to worry about my daughter breaking something</li>
            <li> I just received my Holder and was not able to put the plastic round piece into the holder.  Any suggestions. Please&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Good clamp, easy to use.  I like that I can tighten or loosen the top part of the stand so while the wig head is on it, I don&#x27;t have to move, I can just turn and position the wig head on the stand.</li>
            <li> Love it for the price, makes wig making so much easier</li>
            <li> Space inside Clamp is very small , will only accommodate thin table or countertops . Plastic is ragged and not formed well . Cheap product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I saw the rubber padding on the clamp.  This was a great price and will do exactly what I need when I sit down to make my wigs.</li>
            <li> One of the cheaper ones I found and so the product is a bit cheap as well. But it did well for my purposes, I needed to fix the wig slant and clamp numerous times which is why I gave it 3 stars...</li>
            <li> This item helps with holding the mannequin head in place. My daughter is able to style the mannequins hair at a better position than holding the doll head on her knees.</li>
            <li> I used this with a wig head that I purchase from Amazon. This can be connected to almost any table or counter top.  Wig Head - Water Repellant 22&amp;#34; Circumference is what I used the C-Clamp with..</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described. Good Job!!</li>
            <li> It was shipped promptly, crossing fingers this product works well!</li>
            <li> Kind of a hassle. Does not stay put on bathroom sink &amp; etc...</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use when I trim my wigs. It works like a charm. It clips on tight and adjusts to i can position wig where i need it. It helps me extend the life of my synthetic wigs by removing hair that kinked (happens even with best care). When I trim my long hair wigs, I can get another two months of wear.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me  It would not grip onto the area I was using tight enough So it was a waste of my money It is jus sitting in my drawer collecting dust</li>
            <li> Thanks to this little invention, I can make my wigs fast and easy. It was easy to assemble. Glad finally order one.</li>
            <li> Its does a good job at supporting a new fresh styrofoam head but has to put tape around it once the head gets worn.</li>
            <li> This thing is awful quality. I cannot understand why it is so poorly made. However it does do the job.</li>
            <li> The device was poorly constructed and looked somewhat worn. The plastic had knicks and dents and the latch did not hold when attached to a table. This was prior to attaching a wig head. I didn&#x27;t bother contacting seller, it came a long way (China) and it was only $6. I have purchased another.</li>
            <li> I got this to take to a convention so that I could touch up wigs at the hotel, and it works okay for that--though with heavy wigs, the ball joint will move and it won&#x27;t stay completely upright! I would NOT use this for involved styling or cutting, as it doesn&#x27;t have a strong enough hold, but it&#x27;s fine for combing and touch-ups.</li>
            <li> Transportable and easy to attach to any hard surface.</li>
            <li> Easy assembly, fits the styrofoam wig heads like a champ, and good clamping on most any surfaces. I really like the versatility of the clamp itself. It can accommodate large surfaces as well as paper-thin surfaces. Worth the price and durable, would buy again if i happen to need an additional one.</li>
            <li> Have been wanting this for a long time and I found it here for .,97 cents, Yeeze cant beat that with a baseball bat.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed Thank You!</li>
            <li> It served for it&#x27;s purpose, I still wish it would have came with a little instructional booklet. But I did learn how to use it on my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the wig head or the clamp.. But my wig head whole is a little wide, so the head didn&#x27;t fit very well.. I just wobbles a lot and the clamp doesn&#x27;t clamped or grip very well..</li>
            <li> The holder is easy to use and adjustable. It really holds the canvas head well and stays in place. :)</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for holding my wig head to style my wigs. I really like how you can take it apart easily which makes it good for storing when you travel. I use to use the stand of a fan for a wig stand and it was horrible lol so this was a good investment.</li>
            <li> I HAD ONE OF THESE ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO, BUT IT WAS FULL METAL AND I WAS LOOKING FOR ONE LIKE IT. THIS IS SIMILAR BUT NOT AS GOOD QUAILTY AS THE ONE I BROUGHT BEFORE BUT I WAS GLAD TO FIND IT JUST THE SAME.</li>
            <li> this wig stand is very durable and so easy to use,can clamp anywhere,swivels and moves frontwards and backwards and  side to side this stand makes styling a wig SO EASY! Beautysbin provided me with the best service i have ever received anywhere! a really great seller to buy from they really value customers and go above and beyond :)</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to style my wigs. Very sturdy for the price. I love it, it made my life a lot easier</li>
            <li> its everything i expected and it was shipped on time and without any hassle. came inside of a box with stuffing. its light and can be taken apart and put back together again easily.</li>
            <li> Bought this to practice making a wig. It&#x27;s a great tool to have for making wigs and need to stabilize a manequin head. Way better than trying to use you knees to do it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for an awesome price. This clamp holds the mannequin head in place, and makes wig making so much easier.</li>
            <li> Works great! My 5 year old uses it for play and it&#x27;s worked exactly as described. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This does work. It fits into my Styrofoam wig stand and will clamp to a table or bathroom counter top. It is very light weight plastic. If I styled my hairpiece more frequently, I&#x27;d probably purchase a sturdier one than this, but for someone that doesn&#x27;t style frequently, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This can attach to just about any table or counter without ruining the surface, this is the best one that I have purchased so far..</li>
            <li> Seems solid and sturdy for being made mostly of plastic. Comes in three separate parts that were very easy to figure out how to assemble. The foam head I have fits onto it well, and the clamp seems pretty secure, too. I&#x27;ve had no problems and I don&#x27;t forsee any future problems. Good product for the price. I&#x27;d definitely buy another of these if I needed it.</li>
            <li> I love that it can be adjusted as to the angle. it makes it much easier than clamps that are stationary when trying to style a wig</li>
            <li> does what it says it will do. it is the perfect shape &amp; size for the wig head. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This Holder is very strong, and flexible. It gives me the able to move the head around as i practice different hairstyles. It was alittle confusing at first trying to figure out how to put the stand together being that it doesn&#x27;t come with directions. But i figured it out by the picture displayed on the box. i would recommend this stand to anybody that love to do wigs.</li>
            <li> These were needed to display mannequin heads for Indian headdress and World War II headware.  Very satisfied with the way they are used.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Does exactly what it promised and has a tight grip.</li>
            <li> i had never used one of these and struggled for a long time trying to keep that mannequin head in place as i worked on my wigs.  i never even thought i could get one for this price and that it worked so well.  well made, great price and no more frustration in working with a wiggly mannequin head.  now i can work faster and better on my wigs.  it holds well from a very thin edged table to a thick one.  great product!!</li>
            <li> It does its purpose!  I have it set up on my counter up high so my 3 year old daughter cannot reach it! It&#x27;s easier to use than expected. Its worth the money I spent! I would recommend to anyone who does their own hair often!</li>
            <li> Great Product Fast Delivery!!</li>
            <li> You can attach this to any countertop and style your wig.</li>
            <li> The wig head stand is great. It was just what I needed to style my wigs very easy to use and I can put the stand on any table. What a great tool to have everyone that has wigs to style should get one. I definitely approve it.</li>
            <li> Perfect hold , nice quality and it swivels ! Love it</li>
            <li> Product as seen on site, all in all happy with puchase. Would use site again and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I received one of the clamps that had a broken piece from the wheel. I still was able to use it without returning it.</li>
            <li> Great product, came in on time and performs as advertised, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is going to be so much help when making wigs. I love this, it is super sturdy and this will help me out alot!!! Great product, Thanks  :-)</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very affordable. C clamp is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> works well for me does what I need it to do on all my heads. Keeps them in place without harm</li>
            <li> DEBRA REQUESTED THAT I BUY THIS FOR HER LOL SHE CAN NOW HOLD HER HEAD UP PROPERLY WHILE I HOOK HER HAIR UP. SHE ALSO FEELS MORE CONFIDENT NOW. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE. HAHAHAHA</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t know if  the head holder is too small or the Styrofoam head hole too big but when styling wig it wobbles. I just put a thin sock over the holder before putting the head on it to snug up the fit, issue easily fixed!</li>
            <li> it does what it is supposed to do! can&#x27;t ask for more</li>
            <li> Arrived when promised.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use and put together  with 12 inch Styrofoam  head.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> this stand it great, I even bought a second one for a family member. I&#x27;m pleased and so happy because this stand makes my life a little easier.</li>
            <li> NOT AS GOOD AS THE ONE I GOT FROM SCHOOL BUT WORKS FINE</li>
            <li> No grip it doesn&#x27;t stay in 1 position moves around to much it had chips and it&#x27;s a pain to always keep it the same position. I have to use a towel or pillow case to keep it still</li>
            <li> Nice, very strong, I love it</li>
            <li> great price,great product,great service,I will reccomend to my friends so they can find bargi9ns,on your web site,It&#x27;s the best one that I have found.</li>
            <li> This makes it so easy for me to style my wigs. I&#x27;m so glad that I don&#x27;t ever have to hold mannequin head between my legs(very uncomfortable).</li>
            <li> Works for what I need it for.&lt;br /&gt;Wig head sits on this thing correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on the edge of my bookshelf and do my hair (wig) like that.</li>
            <li> I love this wish I had purchased it years ago. I only use this once a year for my halloween wigs but it is a huge help love it</li>
            <li> It holds the head up. I did put some sticky ribber contacts on it to make it stay on the table better.</li>
            <li> wish it had a swivel for the mount, but great deal for the price</li>
            <li> The stand was cheap but pretty good quality. It does losen up a bit every once in a while but any stand I&#x27;ve ever used has done that. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be a strong stand but it&#x27;s definitely much better than I figured it would have been. I&#x27;ve used it several times already for cuts and styles and haven&#x27;t had a single problem yet. There is a small steel ring that comes with it however I chose not to use it because it makes it harder to tilt the stand/head. If you need a stand for practising this is definitely a good choice, especially if you&#x27;re just a beginner or just trying things out because then if you change your mind it&#x27;s not a big loss of cash.</li>
            <li> This product was useful and was in good condition. I like that it came together with the rest of my order.</li>
            <li> I brought this clamp for a manikin head as Christmas present for my 9 year old daughter. This head holder seemsto be made of strong plastic and the clamp part worked fine. I recommend this holder to anyone that is looking for a quality holder with inexpensive price. Sally&#x27;s manikin holders are about $8-$15. I paid about $5 with shipping.</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent price!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!! :D its pretty nice to customize your wigs .</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  It&#x27;s fully adjustable so you can swival the head in any direction...great product.  I do flea/farmer&#x27;s markets and needed a way to show off the hats and scarves I crochet.  Super fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble. The gadgets are easy to use. The quality is that of the tools like these you see in professional salons.</li>
            <li> Love it! Can put it anywhere with an edge.</li>
            <li> I paid very little for it so it was not worth it to return but it did not seem brand new.  It looked used.  It works though:)</li>
            <li> This stuff looks huge in the picture but in reality it&#x27;s in a package as big as a vitamin bottle BUTTTTT!!!! its works like you cannot believe. All you need is for it to hold the form head while it clamps to table or chair............then buy this. Enough said</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this item!  It&#x27;s much easier to style my wigs now by simply clamping this to the vanity counter. Can even tilt/turn the wig head form to do hair on all sides!!!  Great price too. . . thanks! :-)</li>
            <li> It is not the highest quality but it is does the job. It is worth the price. As they say, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> As a sideline I&#x27;ve been  a puppeteer for over 30 years. The figures I use are life size and wear custom designed wigs. On some of my reviews you can see a video of  the puppets and I&#x27;ll make it a point to add a clip to this review as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This c-clamp wig head holder was offered during checkout via the new Amazon add on program when I ordered a half dozen Styrofoam bases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price seemed to good to be true, but to inexpensive to ignore. So into the cart it went and with my Prime membership arrived  with two day free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can assure you this mount is excellent - it works wonderfully in keeping the head forms stable while you work on the wigs. An extra wide screw on holder makes it ideal for any work bench or table. The locking mechanism is effortless to use and the standard size post makes it ideal for any head form. A simple turn of the locking wheel allows you to tilt the entire post in the direction or at the level you need to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid build quality and  effortless to use this outstanding holder makes working on wigs as easy as pie.The price is beyond fair and the holder was delivered quickly and wonderfully packaged in a heavy cardboard box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m so pleased with this holder be ordering many more. A great product at a beyond  reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is way too small. The picture makes it look much bigger. But it is small. About the hand size of a large glue gun. I received mine damaged. Lesson learned. Will not order from this merchant again.</li>
            <li> This wig stand is great. This item is very sturdy. Customer service was great.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased others from local stores before and was not happy.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering another one shortly.</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you see!&lt;br /&gt;I got my clamp along with a few other items and I can definitely say it did not disappoint. It does come in just a plastic bag so be careful that the pieces do not fall out since it is not all put together.</li>
            <li> Amazing item for the price.  I have to wear a piece as my hair did not fully return after chemotherapy.  Managing the piece on my head was difficult.  Having this to put the wig head on and dry and style did the trick...very happy!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item to hold a styrofoam wig head--it definitely serves its purpose. The only thing I would improve upon is having the clamp open up a bit wider to accommodate tables with a thicker table-top base.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the one I used in cosmo class. Very strong &amp; easy to use. I was able to put it together easily even though it didnt come with instructions.</li>
            <li> I tried many things as substitutes for this very useful item when styling human hair doll wigs.  I bought several styrofoam balls in order to have a small base for the wigs that fit small dolls.  I have not used one yet but plan to use long pins to attach the ball to the top of the canvas wig head that works with this head holder.</li>
            <li> If you are working with wigs and need to hold a wig head in place, this is what you need. It&#x27;s easy to use and has a firm grip and a tight hold. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic.  Clamp does not tighten enough to hold the wig in place.  Very inexpensive.  I wish tha I had not been impressed by the price.  I should have paid more, and gotten a quality piece.  It is my own fault and I will not make the same mistake again.  I will buy another one from the same seller, just a better quality.</li>
            <li> Not very strong, don&#x27;t bother trying to use it with a canvas head.  It won&#x27;t hold it and it will keep tilting.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job, but the portion that holds the foam head can&#x27;t stay upright while moveable. It&#x27;s a small inconvenience, and while the parts are a little rough/cheap, it performs well and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I was able to style my wigs without this.  This is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for styling your wigs.</li>
            <li> hello where have you been all my weave days. ladies If you do your own hair this is def. a most have it will be your best friend don&#x27;t know how to use it you tube it .</li>
            <li> This is just right for using to put a mannequin head on.  Just make sure it is attached to the table securely</li>
            <li> I am still waiting on this product, I know payment has been deducted from my account.  When will I receive the merchandise?</li>
            <li> it was pretty small. actually smaller then i expected . but it should do the trick. not bad for the price</li>
            <li> Putting it together was a little awkward (I don&#x27;t understand why you have to assemble it in the first place) and it doesn&#x27;t clamp on super tightly (but it&#x27;s not holding metal to be welded or anything, so that&#x27;s fine haha), but it works just fine- sticks into the mannequin head easily and serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> It was cheaply made - but it was cheaply priced..  You get what you pay for most times.  I returned mine.</li>
            <li> To honest i&#x27;m not sure how I lived without this item for so long, it makes styling and cutting my wigs a breeze. gone forever are the days of me holding my wig with one hand and scissors in another.</li>
            <li> These clamps are awesome! Standard Styrofoam wig heads have a hole in the base that fits right on this thing. The clamp is adjustable to almost any width and holds tight. Can definitely be useful for crafts and other styling projects.</li>
            <li> i had to put it together myself with no directions had to look online for the pic and follow it</li>
            <li> Works ok. Cheap plastic. Screwed through the plastic cap and messed up the underside of my table. Get a legit one for more money. Will be worth it in the end. Don&#x27;t buy this unless you are using it for storing a wig on a block. Not good for staying with. Wobbles way too much.</li>
            <li> I love this product... before I heard about this on youtube.. I would have to hold my wigs in my hands to brush out or style but with this I can actually clamp it any where i want and style.. it really holds tight to whatever you put it on and it can be adjusted really easily.. love it love it..</li>
            <li> This does the job great and cool price!</li>
            <li> does the job its made to do.</li>
            <li> So far so good haven&#x27;t started making my wig yet I only mounted the stand.  This product was not bad for the price. It also does not come assembled but assembly was not difficult.</li>
            <li> Very restrictive as far as where it can be mounted...</li>
            <li> I bought this with one thing in mind. I crochet. I use cotten thread on large spools, and this clamp is perfect to attach to a table and keep my cotton thread off the floor, easy to use, and keep my cats from trying to play with it as it moves.</li>
            <li> I am not a wig professional, but this seems like such a great value! it does it&#x27;s job. It is great to be able to style a stable wig.</li>
            <li> Well made and does the job!</li>
            <li> Works great for my sisters mannequin heads. Yes the plastic was a little messy but what do you expect for this price. I cleaned it up a lil with a razor knife.</li>
            <li> assembly, was easy, and very sturdy product.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this procuct to anyone, who like&lt;br /&gt;to create different wig styles.</li>
            <li> Got the job done for my home made wig!😀</li>
            <li> i like this this  mannepuin head holder it&#x27;s help me a lot for making my wigs!&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much.</li>
