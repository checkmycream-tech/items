            <li>I never thought it would be this effective and it truly has been a life saved.</li>
            <li>I was so happy that a family member recommended that I try this product they had heard about, and I already purchased more since using up the original tube.</li>
            <li>I love this product any time of the year.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with Dr. Dans CortiBalm.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure would do wonders for sunburnt lips as well.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you why it worked better for me than hydrocortisone cream alone, since this contains that</li>
            <li>more of a Vaseline feel.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was tickled to find it available on Amazon - and the price for two fit into my budget.</li>
            <li>Cannot recommend more highly!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too oily and soaks in quickly while healing your lips.</li>
            <li>long story short, this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li>I have been using CortiBalm for the last 3 days and so far my lips feel great.  </li>
            <li>They worked, kind of, but left my lips feeling kind of dry, so I used Aquaphor with them.</li>
            <li>I put too much pressure on my lips with it th first time and smushed it a bit!</li>
            <li>love it only one I buy</li>
            <li>I would not spend the extra money to buy this as there are many moisturizing lip balm out there.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>Product does exactly what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li>This lip balm is very soothing on severely chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is very calming and helps to relieve dryness.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with reactions to many other chapsticks and this did the trick!  </li>
            <li>Love it, the only lip balm that actually works and keeps my lips from peeling.</li>
            <li>One week later, and this product has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I use a combination of Cortibalm first, then a layer of Blistex Lip Infusion Sheer Liquid Balm (for shine &amp; SPF)</li>
            <li>Goes on nice an smooth and does wonders on really chapped and painful lips.  </li>
            <li>The lip balm is pretty much tasteless and unscented which is good.  </li>
            <li>It took one day to clear up my lips that where cracked, swollen, and bleeding.</li>
            <li>DAN&#x27;S CORTIBALM fixed my problem up in a jiffy.  </li>
            <li>So be prepared for it to be soft.</li>
            <li>Normally I use it on my lips - especially during the cold winter months - but it works great on littlle bumps like hives and bug bites.</li>
            <li>Normally I purchase at tube from a local dermatology office but they were out of the product.</li>
            <li>The consistency is definitely different than a normal Chapstick-</li>
            <li>I reapplied lip balm every thirty minutes and my lips were so tight it hurt to speak, smile, or move my have in any way.</li>
            <li>It has helped the painful dryness and cracking that resulted from my medication, and within 24 hours there was great improvement.</li>
            <li>my lips were already 50% healed and by the next day they were back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I must have ordered 10 different lip balms to try and this wins hands down.</li>
            <li>It is unscented, and has only a very slight smell (not unpleasant) that you will recognize as beeswax if you have every used unscented beeswax candles.</li>
            <li>I tried several different products and nothing was working,every morning my lips were so swollen ,and so sensitive and sore.</li>

            <li> This does nothing for my lips no change at all, it does not last long either.</li>
            <li> My son is taking accutane suffering from dry lips which is a known side effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t know what dry lips are.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this works well for me, even on cracked dry lips that itch at the corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less than a week later he had healed lips!</li>
            <li> I have some weird issue where I get really red and irritated skin under my bottom lip when I have allergy problems or sweat too much.</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips due to being on Accutane.  </li>
            <li> This lip balm has made a big difference, no more cracked and bleeding lips.</li>
            <li> So I still must use other lip balms during the day.</li>
            <li> Now they just feel like normal lips that get dry with the cold and dryness caused by heating.</li>
            <li> Seems like you have changed the formula from what it was a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exaggerating, it smells like a dead animal and is nauseating.</li>
            <li> They even were bloody on certain spots.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> Buy at least two.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also have used it on chapped upper lip from over-Kleenexing during a cold.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am unable to use conventional products.</li>
            <li> cannot blame him, it really does smell awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised there&#x27;s no way to mask the awful smell.</li>
            <li> My lips are peeling and nasty because of Accutane/Isotretinoin related dehydration.</li>
            <li> Advertising is wrong.</li>
            <li> They were peeling so bad</li>
            <li> They would get swollen and itchy and would feel awful.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is on accutane for acne and her lips became horribly chapped.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who is on Accutane, with the worst side effect being terribly chapped lips.</li>
            <li> She has a real bad problem with cracked lips, HS band member (Clarinet) and outdoor sports-girl.  </li>

            <li> I have had issues with my lips for the last 10 years.  They would get swollen and itchy and would feel awful.  I have been using CortiBalm for the last 3 days and so far my lips feel great.  Hoping that the continued use keeps them feeling this wonderful.</li>
            <li> My daughter is on accutane for acne and her lips became horribly chapped. This stuff is amazing and the best we have tried. I must have ordered 10 different lip balms to try and this wins hands down. It isn&#x27;t too oily and soaks in quickly while healing your lips. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Love it, the only lip balm that actually works and keeps my lips from peeling.</li>
            <li> This does nothing for my lips no change at all, it does not last long either.</li>
            <li> This is like heaven for your lips or chapped areas around your lips! My dermatologist recommended it, and it took my lips which were suffering from an allergic reaction to nearly perfect in 6 hours.</li>
            <li> good stuff for my chapped lips</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who is on Accutane, with the worst side effect being terribly chapped lips. One week later, and this product has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> I love this product any time of the year.  Normally I use it on my lips - especially during the cold winter months - but it works great on littlle bumps like hives and bug bites. Normally I purchase at tube from a local dermatology office but they were out of the product. I was tickled to find it available on Amazon - and the price for two fit into my budget. It arrived on time just as promised. No complaints from me!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It took one day to clear up my lips that where cracked, swollen, and bleeding. Wish I had a picture.  It was recommend to me by my esthetician at David Alexander Spa in Annapolis, Md</li>
            <li> My son is taking accutane suffering from dry lips which is a known side effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin doctor suggested this product so we purchased on his suggestion. It works well but my son won&#x27;t use it because it smells horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot blame him, it really does smell awful.</li>
            <li> This is the best solution for chapped lips!  It isn&#x27;t just geese with flavor, it actually works.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been searching for a chap stick that I&#x27;m not allergic to. This one works like a charm!</li>
            <li> love it only one I buy</li>
            <li> Amazing lip healing for Accutane. I tried tons of different chapsticks, lip balms and oils; none of them worked. Dan&#x27;s Cortibalm within two days repaired my cracked lips. I would recommend to any accutane user.</li>
            <li> My son was told to use this by the dermatologist. He likes it.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with Dr. Dans CortiBalm. It has helped the painful dryness and cracking that resulted from my medication, and within 24 hours there was great improvement. I really appreciated that Dr. Dans Cortibalm had so few ingredients, to minimize potential allergic reactions. It is unscented, and has only a very slight smell (not unpleasant) that you will recognize as beeswax if you have every used unscented beeswax candles. I was so happy that a family member recommended that I try this product they had heard about, and I already purchased more since using up the original tube. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is very soothing on severely chapped lips.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with reactions to many other chapsticks and this did the trick!  The no smell no taste took a day to get used to but I love this stuff!  Amazing for winter chapped lips and I&#x27;m sure would do wonders for sunburnt lips as well.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am unable to use conventional products. It is my go to!!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s Dermatologist recommended this Cortibalm for her.  She has a real bad problem with cracked lips, HS band member (Clarinet) and outdoor sports-girl.  This lip balm has made a big difference, no more cracked and bleeding lips.</li>
            <li> My lips are peeling and nasty because of Accutane/Isotretinoin related dehydration. Have you ever seen the Dave Chappelle skits with Tyrone the Crackhead? WELL DR. DAN&#x27;S CORTIBALM fixed my problem up in a jiffy.  I use a combination of Cortibalm first, then a layer of Blistex Lip Infusion Sheer Liquid Balm (for shine &amp; SPF)</li>
            <li> This product is the only one I can use on my lips without them swelling and developing a rash.  This seller is excellent and will order from again and again.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing lip balm, I dont think the added cortisone does anything in terms of healing. I would not spend the extra money to buy this as there are many moisturizing lip balm out there.</li>
            <li> My husbands lips were horribly chapped! He couldn&#x27;t get relief from anything. My brother told us his dermatologist had recommended this to him and then told us. So we bought it! Less than a week later he had healed lips! It was amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  The lip balm is pretty much tasteless and unscented which is good.  Goes on nice an smooth and does wonders on really chapped and painful lips.  Nothing else seemed to work, so I purchased this based on my doctors recommendation. I put it on as soon as it arrived and again at bedtime and by the next morning my lips were already 50% healed and by the next day they were back to normal.  Cannot recommend more highly!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! I was so happy to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Advertising is wrong. Says 2 - pack. I received  1 and tried contacting the seller but never got a reply. I wouldn&#x27;t have paid 9.00 and something for 1 tube of it. Its a great product, just buy it from someone else.</li>
            <li> Seems like you have changed the formula from what it was a few years ago. I could tell as soon as I put it on. Whatever it is, it is not like it once was.</li>
            <li> Product does exactly what it is advertised to do.  No complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Works miracles especially on super chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Works great when on or off Accutane.</li>
            <li> The BEST Lip Balm on the market!!</li>
            <li> This chapstick is a must for Accutane users. Buy at least two. I have four - purse, nightstand, bathroom &amp; work desk.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I have some weird issue where I get really red and irritated skin under my bottom lip when I have allergy problems or sweat too much. NOTHING worked to fix it when it happened. I tried a steroid cream from my doctor, hydrocortisone cream alone, berts bees Chapstick...nothing helped. Then I came across this when googling Chapstick for allergies and this stuff is amazing. I can&#x27;t tell you why it worked better for me than hydrocortisone cream alone, since this contains that but it&#x27;s awesome! The consistency is definitely different than a normal Chapstick- more of a Vaseline feel. So be prepared for it to be soft. I put too much pressure on my lips with it th first time and smushed it a bit! 😂 long story short, this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> My lips sometimes would get swollen and sore. My dermatologist gave me some cream samples. They worked, kind of, but left my lips feeling kind of dry, so I used Aquaphor with them. When the samples ran out, I asked for a prescription. My doc told me to try Dr. Dan&#x27;s CortiBalm, and it worked!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t gone on Accutane while living a northeastern winter you don&#x27;t know what dry lips are. I reapplied lip balm every thirty minutes and my lips were so tight it hurt to speak, smile, or move my have in any way. They were peeling so bad I was chewing on skin flakes 24/7. They even were bloody on certain spots.&lt;br /&gt;Two days of wearing this product and all of that is gone. Now they just feel like normal lips that get dry with the cold and dryness caused by heating. I never thought it would be this effective and it truly has been a life saved. However I must deduct a star for smell. It is REPULSIVE. I&#x27;m not exaggerating, it smells like a dead animal and is nauseating. I&#x27;m surprised there&#x27;s no way to mask the awful smell.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Received on time/as promised.</li>
            <li> I just want to say this product saved my lips from the severe cracked,chapped lips I suffered from a sinus infection I had. I tried several different products and nothing was working,every morning my lips were so swollen ,and so sensitive and sore. I tried this as a last resort and after 24hrs the swelling and sensitivity was almost gone, after 1week I was cured. This was a miracle after over a month in pain just a couple of days on Dr. Dans and the pain was gone.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It really works.</li>
            <li> Great chapstick for when lips are so chapped they itch. I have eczema and this works well for me, even on cracked dry lips that itch at the corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have used it on chapped upper lip from over-Kleenexing during a cold. Clears it up overnight on both my children. I&#x27;d definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips due to being on Accutane.  This lip balm is very calming and helps to relieve dryness.  Because of the medication in it can be used only up to 4 times a day, which is not enough when on Accutane.  So I still must use other lip balms during the day. But this lipbalm keeps my lips feeling fine for around an hour, which is a great relief.  Will buy again.</li>
