            <li>Great price!</li>
            <li>Nice price, Thank You!</li>
            <li>but i love it definitely a great toothpaste mix.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Nice change from the monotony of mint toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Nice cinnamon taste without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>thank you Amazon for making this easy rather than me stocking up when I go on vacation!</li>
            <li>Love the cinnamon.</li>
            <li>I love the taste of cinnamon and no pharmacy or grocery store in my area caries cinnamon toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Interesting idea</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t healthy</li>
            <li>COLGATE A FAVORITE SINCE CHILDHOOD</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a strong cinamint flavor, more cinnamon than mint, but it leaves a fresher feeling mouth than those lighter flavored toothpastes.</li>
            <li>, everything else is good about it except it is colored bright red, which could be mistaken for blood.</li>
            <li>it whitened my teeth well and had a strong cinnamon taste.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re fine with that, you may like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>That was the only thing good about it.  </li>
            <li>Would send it back , but would cost more than it is worth.  </li>
            <li>The first taste on the toothpaste is cinnamon, but after that comes the mint taste.</li>
            <li>i only bought it because it was cheap.</li>
            <li>Technically, this is a gel, not a paste, so if you are someone who really prefers a gel, and you like that fresh aftertaste, this is for you.</li>
            <li>I can not get in the state I live in....</li>
            <li>Usually I go for cinnamon, as it&#x27;s the non-mint toothpaste you can find most often.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t tell from the large print, but in smaller print on the packaging you can find the word &amp;#34;Cinnamint.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Toothpaste is nowhere near its expiration date.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothpaste but it is not available at any of my local stores.  </li>
            <li>At first when i ordered this i was a little worried about the cinnamint mix</li>

            <li> My favorite toothpaste! I can not get in the state I live in....thank you Amazon for making this easy rather than me stocking up when I go on vacation!</li>
            <li> Nice change from the monotony of mint toothpaste. Love the cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Nice price, Thank You!</li>
            <li> Not a very strong flavor or lasting scent.</li>
            <li> At first when i ordered this i was a little worried about the cinnamint mix but i love it definitely a great toothpaste mix.</li>
            <li> Great item! Great price!</li>
            <li> I love the taste of cinnamon and no pharmacy or grocery store in my area caries cinnamon toothpaste.  Thank you, Colgate, for making it, and thank you, Amazon, for selling it!</li>
            <li> Goes from a peppy \\&quot;cinnamint\\&quot; taste to a rendered animal fat taste. Toothpaste is nowhere near its expiration date. If my hubbie buys this again my mistake, and the above is an aberration, I will change my rating...but in the meantime, I think I will be breathing shallowly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like mint, so I&#x27;m always on the hunt for non-mint toothpaste. Usually I go for cinnamon, as it&#x27;s the non-mint toothpaste you can find most often. You can&#x27;t tell from the large print, but in smaller print on the packaging you can find the word &amp;#34;Cinnamint.&amp;#34; Wish I&#x27;d noticed this when I bought it in the store. The first taste on the toothpaste is cinnamon, but after that comes the mint taste. If you&#x27;re fine with that, you may like this toothpaste. Because I don&#x27;t like mint, I was really disappointed, and wished it was somehow made more obvious on the packaging/advertising.</li>
            <li> Product came in a timely manner.  That was the only thing good about it.  It was not the same toothepaste that i remembered and tasted terrible.  Would send it back , but would cost more than it is worth.  Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> Interesting idea, everything else is good about it except it is colored bright red, which could be mistaken for blood.That isn&#x27;t healthy if you want to keep track of gum health, there&#x27;s no way to know.I hadn&#x27;t considered that when I bought it.</li>
            <li> i found this product at the dollar store. it whitened my teeth well and had a strong cinnamon taste. i only bought it because it was cheap.</li>
            <li> This is the same toothpaste I used to buy, but can no longer find at retail. Yes, it is a strong cinamint flavor, more cinnamon than mint, but it leaves a fresher feeling mouth than those lighter flavored toothpastes. Technically, this is a gel, not a paste, so if you are someone who really prefers a gel, and you like that fresh aftertaste, this is for you.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste but it is not available at any of my local stores.  Nice cinnamon taste without being overwhelming.  So grateful to Amazon for carrying this product!</li>
            <li> COLGATE A FAVORITE SINCE CHILDHOOD</li>
            <li> It is not cinnamon, it is cinnamint, which is super disgusting. It&#x27;s like brushing your teeth with sadness</li>
