            <li>I can honestly say this is the best curly hair product I&#x27;ve used, and that&#x27;s after using one for years I thought was the best.  </li>
            <li>:)    YAY for bumble and bumble!</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>Curls are nicely defined without being crunchy.  </li>
            <li>but I have found this to be the best curl product thus far that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Scrunches up to hold great curls and waves, but do not use much!  </li>
            <li>I love the way my curls stay in place.</li>
            <li>Overall - great!</li>
            <li>Love the volume it gives my hair.</li>
            <li>I love B &amp; B hair products</li>
            <li>Even if you lightly press the applicator it tends to dispense ALOT more product then you will need.</li>
            <li>After years and years of using pretty much every product on the market I can truly say I am happy with the end result.    </li>
            <li>There are usually a few problems that contribute to not getting the best look when styling curly hair.</li>
            <li>, the mousse is great, only issue is it doesn&#x27;t help keep my curly hair managed.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the cash!</li>
            <li>This product in the dynamic duo gives the most amazing hold with no crunch.  </li>
            <li>Using a small amount is important and all that is needed for frizz free beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>When this product arrived it felt full, but all of the air in the can had been let out so</li>
            <li>It is fantastic and worth every cent.</li>
            <li>my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time.</li>
            <li>This is a bit pricey but is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It has been worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It gives just the right amount hold and smooths the curls without being oily.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair sort and tousled right now.</li>
            <li>I hardly have to use any and the curls are beautifully formed, voluminous, and not at all frizzy.  </li>
            <li>And the best part is a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>This product really keeps the curls!</li>
            <li>You will not be pleased with the resuls if you use the entire amount.</li>
            <li>WAY too much came out!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t require taming frizzy ends with a separate cream after drying.  </li>
            <li>This one left my hair looking healthy and shiny and</li>
            <li>Everyone who says if you use too much, you won&#x27;t like the results, is right, so you just need a smidge.  </li>
            <li>I put about a quarter size amount (some reviews say not to use that much - I have shoulder length hair &amp; need that much -</li>
            <li>Orginally I thought the product cost too much for 3.5oz.</li>
            <li>You can really feel the quality of the product as you work it into your hair.</li>
            <li>A must for those with curly hair and want it to look soft and fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>(As others have said, you really don&#x27;t want to use too much or risk crunchy hair all day).  </li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>I use this on my straight hair</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for people who want curly hair without much work.</li>
            <li>It is applied from the top of the head down and the curls are scrunched.</li>
            <li>and I love it when the bottle is new and in its typical condition.</li>
            <li>Love it, but wish it cost less!</li>
            <li>and I get a completely new look.</li>
            <li>Tip - if you get more than the amount you need when pressing the dispensor simply scoop the extra product into the plastic cap cover and use the following day.</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft as if no product was added.  </li>
            <li>I like to have non-crunchy, soft curls, but this seems to enhance the frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am interested to see how long the can will last me!</li>
            <li>I cannot begin to count up the bazillion different products I&#x27;ve tried on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I normally only need between a nickel and a quarter size to get a conditioned soft look with the hold I need.</li>
            <li>I then use my product and when I am done, the very last thing I apply is Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious Foam.</li>
            <li>but  IT IS worth it) on towel dried hair - then comb it through.</li>
            <li>Just do not use a lot, your hair will be crunchy all day, also watch the amount you put near your head because unless you have tight curls that start at the root the straight hair near your scalp will be crunchy with the product, only do the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding it hard to come up with words that adequately describe its odor: toxic chemical, plasticky, headache-inducing, etc.</li>
            <li>The only downside, and it&#x27;s a small one, is that the foam feels hard to the touch near the top of the head.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers about the small amount needed; I have long curly hair and was very suprised when I first pressed the dispenser.</li>

            <li> I sometimes spray a little Bumble &amp; Bumble Reactivating Mist later in the day if I need a pick-me-up to the curls.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products especially for curly hair and was never satisfied until I tried this one!</li>
            <li> You really only need a very small amount to cover an entire head of hair and I have medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Only use a very small amount and your curls and waves will last all day.</li>
            <li> Products that either make your hair too dry, too oilly, weigh curls down or cause them to look stringy.</li>
            <li> I will keep this short and sweet and say that this is the absolute worst smelling hair product I have ever come across in my life.</li>
            <li> I flip my head upside down &amp; scrunch my hair with a towel.</li>
            <li> Use very little or you will have very dry crunchy curls.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product as one half of my hair product cocktail for about 2 yrs now.  </li>
            <li> and I use less than a quarter size.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last that long -</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and use a diffuser to dry it.</li>
            <li> It is also a little pricy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I say use a little</li>
            <li> It will not be a fluffy mousse but thins to a gel but still works well if used within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to waste, but this one went in the trash.</li>
            <li> A few spiral curls with the curling iron</li>
            <li> I have had other products that work the same and wasn&#x27;t as expensive for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair stiff and crunchy...which is not cool for me!  </li>
            <li> i mean I have thick medium to long hair</li>
            <li> and my husband complained of the stiffness once it dried.  </li>
            <li> I hate how much it costs</li>
            <li> The slow drops that did come out were liquid and not mousse at all.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive and there isn&#x27;t a lot of product in the container.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive -</li>
            <li> This is a very expensive mousse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, and I absolutely hate it.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really, this is a horrible product.</li>

            <li> I like the Bumble and Bumble products and have used them for a long time.  This product really keeps the curls!</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to count up the bazillion different products I&#x27;ve tried on my naturally curly hair. This is a bit pricey but is totally worth it. I put about a quarter size amount (some reviews say not to use that much - I have shoulder length hair &amp; need that much - Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last that long - but  IT IS worth it) on towel dried hair - then comb it through. I flip my head upside down &amp; scrunch my hair with a towel. Then stand back up finish the scrunching.(I do add about a quarter size amount of a Keratin Boosting Foam to the ends of the curls.)  I sometimes spray a little Bumble &amp; Bumble Reactivating Mist later in the day if I need a pick-me-up to the curls.</li>
            <li> There are usually a few problems that contribute to not getting the best look when styling curly hair. Not having a flattering cut that enhances the type of curl you have. Products that either make your hair too dry, too oilly, weigh curls down or cause them to look stringy. I have tried numerous products especially for curly hair and was never satisfied until I tried this one! It gives just the right amount hold and smooths the curls without being oily. Orginally I thought the product cost too much for 3.5oz. It has been worth every penny. You really only need a very small amount to cover an entire head of hair and I have medium length hair. Even if you lightly press the applicator it tends to dispense ALOT more product then you will need. You will not be pleased with the resuls if you use the entire amount. I normally only need between a nickel and a quarter size to get a conditioned soft look with the hold I need. I would recommend this product and the other products in Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious line.

It will not be a fluffy mousse but thins to a gel but still works well if used within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> This is THE product to use.    After years and years of using pretty much every product on the market I can truly say I am happy with the end result.    I agree with the other reviewers about the small amount needed; I have long curly hair and was very suprised when I first pressed the dispenser. WAY too much came out! You can really feel the quality of the product as you work it into your hair. Using a small amount is important and all that is needed for frizz free beautiful curls. I am interested to see how long the can will last me! I also never thought to use the gel and the foam together. I will try that tomorrow. :)    YAY for bumble and bumble!</li>
            <li> A must for those with curly hair and want it to look soft and fresh all day.  This is the best B&amp;B product they have made!</li>
            <li> Scrunches up to hold great curls and waves, but do not use much!  I used a nickel squirt of foam and my husband complained of the stiffness once it dried.  Shake and press very carefully to get the tiniest squirt possible in your palm.  I wear my hair sort and tousled right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product as one half of my hair product cocktail for about 2 yrs now.  I hate how much it costs but every single time I think I can get away with buying something cheaper I always always regret it.  This product in the dynamic duo gives the most amazing hold with no crunch.  I use this along with Davines Invisible Paste before blow drying and I get big bouncy curls that hold all day. Everyone who says if you use too much, you won&#x27;t like the results, is right, so you just need a smidge.  Totally worth the cash!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this is the best curly hair product I&#x27;ve used, and that&#x27;s after using one for years I thought was the best.  I was convinced to give this a try and loved it!  I hardly have to use any and the curls are beautifully formed, voluminous, and not at all frizzy.  (As others have said, you really don&#x27;t want to use too much or risk crunchy hair all day).  It&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t require taming frizzy ends with a separate cream after drying.  Not to mention it smells great!</li>
            <li> I never give reviews on products, but just had to do it for this one.  I have used many expensive hair products for curly hair and they have all left me hair dry looking and with friz.  This one left my hair looking healthy and shiny and NO friz my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time. I finally have my curls back. And the best part is a little goes a long way.  It comes out looking like a gel and mouse at the same time.</li>
            <li> When this product arrived it felt full, but all of the air in the can had been let out so the mousse couldn&#x27;t come out. The slow drops that did come out were liquid and not mousse at all. This is a very expensive mousse and I love it when the bottle is new and in its typical condition. I am extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great product but too wxpensive for the amount you get! It was gone in 14 days!</li>
            <li> This product is expensive and there isn&#x27;t a lot of product in the container.  I have had other products that work the same and wasn&#x27;t as expensive for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love the way my curls stay in place. It really does work.</li>
            <li> The best for curly hair.  Should never come off the market.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and use a diffuser to dry it. I then use my product and when I am done, the very last thing I apply is Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious Foam. It is amazing. When you rub it between your hands, it foams up. It is applied from the top of the head down and the curls are scrunched. Your hairdo will last two days (at least) and it will look like new after you&#x27;ve slept on it. The only downside, and it&#x27;s a small one, is that the foam feels hard to the touch near the top of the head. I think that&#x27;s what keeps the curls in place. It is also a little pricy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for people who want curly hair without much work. It is fantastic and worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I will keep this short and sweet and say that this is the absolute worst smelling hair product I have ever come across in my life. I&#x27;m finding it hard to come up with words that adequately describe its odor: toxic chemical, plasticky, headache-inducing, etc. UGH. I&#x27;m not one to waste, but this one went in the trash.</li>
            <li> It is expensive - but I have found this to be the best curl product thus far that I have tried.  I have fine, thin, naturally curly hair.  This product lifts at the roots so curls don&#x27;t look lank.  Curls are nicely defined without being crunchy.  Hair feels soft as if no product was added.  Overall - great!</li>
            <li> This is it!  Only use a very small amount and your curls and waves will last all day. It is a great addition to B&amp;B curl creme and together they are great at keeping frizz out and bounce in!  Just do not use a lot, your hair will be crunchy all day, also watch the amount you put near your head because unless you have tight curls that start at the root the straight hair near your scalp will be crunchy with the product, only do the bottom.  When I say use a little i mean I have thick medium to long hair and I use less than a quarter size.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it. I use this on my straight hair and then I  diffuse. Love the volume it gives my hair. A few spiral curls with the curling iron and I get a completely new look.</li>
            <li> Use very little or you will have very dry crunchy curls.  I use only a dime size amount for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love B &amp; B hair products, the mousse is great, only issue is it doesn&#x27;t help keep my curly hair managed.</li>
            <li> Love it, but wish it cost less!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come out like a mousse at all - just a gooey gel. And instead of enhancing my curls it just weighs done my hair.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely horrible. I have naturally curly hair and was a past bumble and bumble product advocate. I decided to switch back after my recent product (TIGI Curlesque; just not the same) changed their formulation.&lt;br /&gt;This foam makes my hair frizzy. Does nothing to enhance the curl. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, and I absolutely hate it. I like to have non-crunchy, soft curls, but this seems to enhance the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Really, this is a horrible product.</li>
            <li> If you have an affinity for lots of hairspray and product, this may work for you...but I&#x27;m just not into barbie doll hair!  This product makes my hair stiff and crunchy...which is not cool for me!  Try it before you buy it!</li>
