            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i in love with this</li>
            <li>You can see by the description on the bottle, it could be mostly Mineral Oil.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied .................</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>This product can be purchased .... fast .... seller and good quality ....</li>
            <li>very oily/greasy wish they were able to make it so that the oil could absorb quickly into your skin!!</li>
            <li>Quick service and well packaged.</li>
            <li>His skin tone has evened out and looks clean and clear. : )</li>
            <li>well i feel kind a more or less.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Ingredients:  Mineral Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Rosa Mosqueta Seed Oil (Rose Hip), FD&amp;C Red #17, Fragrance (Parfum)&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>every penny worth it.</li>
            <li>This oil is good because it moisturizes the skin, but not pure</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Skin felt very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but i feel that is too short</li>
            <li>For me personally I do not like because it did not penetrate the skin easily</li>
            <li>, it makes the skin soft and smooth and a little goes a long way for such an excellent price</li>
            <li>my skin is very soft !!</li>
            <li>I am going to really like this oil.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this</li>
            <li>and I had to pay the return very upset about that</li>
            <li>I bought another one that was 100%, more expensive and another brand, but she seems to like this one better.</li>
            <li>Please keep in mind that you cannot remove them, but this oils reduces them and the skin looks a lot more firm and soft.</li>
            <li>Since she has been using it for the past month her hand is for the first time starting to look better.</li>
            <li>I didnt see no big deal or difference but its ok to put a little oil on your hands to massage</li>
            <li>So far I see some results in the dryness in my skin</li>
            <li>It dose leave my skin feeling soft, but beyond that nothing else.</li>
            <li>So far, I did not get any</li>
            <li>You can see much difference between one organic and this, everything is different in texture, smell, color and the way the skin absorbs.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product, IT moisturizes your skin leaving it soft and radiant</li>
            <li>Also, this helps prevents new stretch marks and removes those that are still red.     </li>
            <li>if you are looking for a rosehip oil 100% natural or organic, this is not what you want, because it has several ingredients that are not natural and has fragrance.</li>
            <li>All he needed was some good oil to fight the bad oil.</li>

            <li> i will oder always&lt;br /&gt;my body look much better with this&lt;br /&gt;my mark looks more ligth&lt;br /&gt;i in love with this</li>
            <li> I used this for a while on my face, but I found other moisturizers to use instead. So I gave it to a friend who&#x27;s acne was bugging him and he told me his face has never looked that good in forever! All he needed was some good oil to fight the bad oil. His skin tone has evened out and looks clean and clear. : )</li>
            <li> Smell great, I add this oil to my face cream</li>
            <li> Skin felt very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but i feel that is too short and it&#x27;s good but not in all, well i feel kind a more or less.</li>
            <li> It smells like my dads Vitalis for the hair.I didnt see no big deal or difference but its ok to put a little oil on your hands to massage</li>
            <li> Great price and nice product. Quick service and well packaged.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for this oil, it makes the skin soft and smooth and a little goes a long way for such an excellent price</li>
            <li> This product did not list mineral oil in the description given in the Ad.  The ingredients listed on the bottle are as shown.  &amp;#34;Ingredients:  Mineral Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Rosa Mosqueta Seed Oil (Rose Hip), FD&amp;C Red #17, Fragrance (Parfum)&amp;#34;  This product feels heavy and greasy.  You can see by the description on the bottle, it could be mostly Mineral Oil.</li>
            <li> I was using for stretch marks during pregnancy and did work. So far, I did not get any and I&#x27;m in the middle of the 6 month.</li>
            <li> awsome !! my skin is very soft !! i recomend this product</li>
            <li> This oil is good because it moisturizes the skin, but not pure 100% does not give you the results you expect. The oil is very simple to remove scars.</li>
            <li> This product can be purchased .... fast .... seller and good quality .... I am satisfied .................</li>
            <li> Great product......every penny worth it. My wife became a fan of it. I don&#x27;t know what it is but that will bring you a magic on your face!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this, I was expecting it to have more of an oil base plus the smell was not very good. Sort of burned my skin like it was an alcohol base or something. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and makes my skin glow with health! Will definitely buy again and do recommend to anyone looking for an acne solution.</li>
            <li> I love this. It smooth-ens the skin. I use it on my butt and legs before bed.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a rosehip oil 100% natural or organic, this is not what you want, because it has several ingredients that are not natural and has fragrance. For me personally I do not like because it did not penetrate the skin easily and I wanted something organic. You can see much difference between one organic and this, everything is different in texture, smell, color and the way the skin absorbs. I definitely stick with one organic</li>
            <li> I recommend this product, IT moisturizes your skin leaving it soft and radiant, My experience has been good using this product.</li>
            <li> Is good complement for your skin</li>
            <li> no odor at all very disappointing on this product had to send it back and I had to pay the return very upset about that</li>
            <li> This is the best product make my skin smmoth and beautiful</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who is recovering from chemotherapy. She had a burn in her hand caused by the chemo drugs that has lasted now for 6 months. Her doctor recommended Rose Hip oil for its skin regenerating properties. Since she has been using it for the past month her hand is for the first time starting to look better. I bought another one that was 100%, more expensive and another brand, but she seems to like this one better. I wish I had taken pictures to show before and after...</li>
