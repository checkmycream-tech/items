            <li>I am so happy I was introduced to Paula&#x27;s Choice!</li>
            <li>Best BP product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>These products together have greatly improved my skin!</li>
            <li>and I have to say this may be the best BP I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>n&#x27;t (I was very pleasantly surprised!).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Wonderful, amazing, life-changing product!</li>
            <li>Packaging is good.</li>
            <li>Works immediately...a good choice..</li>
            <li>Add sunscreen and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very impressed!</li>
            <li>Best benzo I have used for my &#x27;mature&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li>just ordered more products from Paula&#x27;s Choice and received this code.</li>
            <li>It seems to smell better too?</li>
            <li>Can cause skin to get dry if used too often, but I&#x27;ve found the best routine to be just a dab per pimple at bedtime.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>It will dry out your skin so make sure you have a good quality moisturizer on hand.</li>
            <li>but this product is far better and more affordable than Proactiv.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says -- moisturizes, leaves a smooth and silky matte finish, can be worn under makeup, and controls breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything that works with such amazing results.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had struggled with acne since I was in elementary school into my junior year of college.  </li>
            <li>I would not say it&#x27;s worth it, didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>This is a nice, basic benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>If you want to save $$ on your first order copy this link and paste it - you will get $10 off your first order Code: http://goo.gl/ZeUIbO</li>
            <li>There are better deals on benzoyl peroxide out there, but I don&#x27;t need a giant bottle sitting around.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and the only thing that has cleared up my adult acne.</li>
            <li>I am in my 30s and experience hormonal acne flare ups along my jaw line, as well as I have large pores.</li>
            <li>Really good BP that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or make it red.</li>
            <li>This lotion is gentle, but you will still need a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Very drying and</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Woke up this morning, and the inflammation went down tremendously!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Acne treatment has helped keep my acne under control - very few pimples any more.  </li>
            <li>Goes on clear.</li>
            <li>I use this product in conjunction with PC Clear cleanser and exfoliant.</li>
            <li>use is all the time, have really noticed a big difference</li>
            <li>I have adult acne prone/combination skin.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who&#x27;s tried to stop using BP knows it destroys your skin worse than it ever had been on its own, so you basically have to keep using it...forever.</li>
            <li>I never had many pimples but my parents put me on Proactiv when I was a teenager, setting me up for failure.</li>
            <li>After finally seeking out a doctor to figure out my skin problems, she told me I was probably using products that had too much benzoyl peroxide/salycilic acid  and suggested using something with 2.5% instead of the minimum 7 that is used in others in regular drugstores.  </li>
            <li>The last couple of nights I treated each of them with a dab of this treatment and WOW.</li>
            <li>This product is gently enough for my sensitive skin, and works well.  </li>
            <li>I love the thin texture and gentleness of this product.</li>

            <li> Both were huge compared to this small little tube.</li>
            <li> Paula&#x27;s Choice doesn&#x27;t really dry out my skin the same way Proactiv did and is a way to keep just enough acne medication in my regimen to keep my face from exploding.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clear, but actually white.</li>
            <li> Used every other day, once a day for my sensitive skin in dry environment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m in my thirties and am often told I look 10 years younger due to my regimen of BP + AHA + Jojoba.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Gentle and thin consistency.</li>
            <li> The salicylic acid toner that is supposed to be used with this product is not strong enough to fully exfoliate and to keep your pores from getting clogged.  </li>
            <li> I was looking to try something other than Proactiv, which has been my product for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> and I am so grateful to have found Paula&#x27;s Choice and will definitely be a lifelong customer!</li>
            <li> I use it every other night and follow up with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It will bleach out fabrics so be careful!</li>
            <li> So unfortunately the two don&#x27;t work very well together.  </li>
            <li> Should also at least double the size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This worked very well as alternative to Proactive lotion, less expensive and no need to have recurring orders.  </li>
            <li> Just a little dot on the &#x27;blemish&#x27; at bedtime</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> I hate that it is so expensive for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the thin &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; solution.</li>
            <li> They probably call it a gel because it&#x27;s thin.</li>
            <li> I hate that my skin has adapted/become addicted to BP products</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it!!! use is all the time, have really noticed a big difference</li>
            <li> This product keeps the clogs in your pores from getting infected, which I assume is achieved by the benzoyl peroxide.  It does not keep your pores from clogging.  The salicylic acid toner that is supposed to be used with this product is not strong enough to fully exfoliate and to keep your pores from getting clogged.  So unfortunately the two don&#x27;t work very well together.  This lotion is gentle, but you will still need a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For the last week I&#x27;ve had a number of breakouts (specifically my mouth/chin area) as a result of eliminating sweets &amp; chocolate out of my diet and including regular exercise. The last couple of nights I treated each of them with a dab of this treatment and WOW. Woke up this morning, and the inflammation went down tremendously! Including the one on my chin that was hurting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind Benzoyl Peroxide is drying, and it bleaches fabric. I recommend using it at night. Definitely worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My Uncle is a dermatologist, and he has recommends buying products with benzoyl peroxide rather than salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> I was looking to try something other than Proactiv, which has been my product for over 20 years. Although it includes the desired % of benzoyl peroxide it doesn&#x27;t compare. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Packaging is good.</li>
            <li> Works immediately...a good choice..</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and the only thing that has cleared up my adult acne. It will dry out your skin so make sure you have a good quality moisturizer on hand.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, amazing, life-changing product! I had struggled with acne since I was in elementary school into my junior year of college.  After finally seeking out a doctor to figure out my skin problems, she told me I was probably using products that had too much benzoyl peroxide/salycilic acid  and suggested using something with 2.5% instead of the minimum 7 that is used in others in regular drugstores.  Two years later and I am so grateful to have found Paula&#x27;s Choice and will definitely be a lifelong customer!</li>
            <li> This works WONDERS! Just a little dot on the &#x27;blemish&#x27; at bedtime and it is practically gone by morning. I&#x27;ve never found anything that works with such amazing results. Can cause skin to get dry if used too often, but I&#x27;ve found the best routine to be just a dab per pimple at bedtime. Fantastic. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very drying and I would not say it&#x27;s worth it, didn&#x27;t work for me :c</li>
            <li> I am so happy I was introduced to Paula&#x27;s Choice! I have been using several of the products for the last 4 months. So far, I am very impressed! I have adult acne prone/combination skin.  My biggest concern in switching to Paula&#x27;s Choice was that I would break out but I didn&#x27;t (I was very pleasantly surprised!).&lt;br /&gt;This Acne treatment has helped keep my acne under control - very few pimples any more.  It can be a bit drying, though, so I use it every other night and follow up with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered more products from Paula&#x27;s Choice and received this code. If you want to save $$ on your first order copy this link and paste it - you will get $10 off your first order Code: http://goo.gl/ZeUIbO</li>
            <li> This is a nice, basic benzoyl peroxide. Gentle and thin consistency. Goes on clear. There are better deals on benzoyl peroxide out there, but I don&#x27;t need a giant bottle sitting around. It would last forever!!! I love the thin texture and gentleness of this product.</li>
            <li> Best BP product I have ever used. Does exactly what it says -- moisturizes, leaves a smooth and silky matte finish, can be worn under makeup, and controls breakouts. I use this product in conjunction with PC Clear cleanser and exfoliant. I am in my 30s and experience hormonal acne flare ups along my jaw line, as well as I have large pores. These products together have greatly improved my skin!</li>
            <li> I have finally found something that works with my oily skin. I hate that it is so expensive for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> I hate that my skin has adapted/become addicted to BP products but this product is far better and more affordable than Proactiv. I never had many pimples but my parents put me on Proactiv when I was a teenager, setting me up for failure. Anyone who&#x27;s tried to stop using BP knows it destroys your skin worse than it ever had been on its own, so you basically have to keep using it...forever.

            <li> Don&#x27;t like the thin &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; solution. They probably call it a gel because it&#x27;s thin. It&#x27;s not clear, but actually white. I purchased Daniel Kern&#x27;s Acne solution as well as Claror. Both were huge compared to this small little tube. No matter what these manufacturers say, BP is the same except for consistency, hence why I do not like this one. They should offer a thicker solution like Claror and Daniel Kern. Should also at least double the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my thirties and am often told I look 10 years younger due to my regimen of BP + AHA + Jojoba. Add sunscreen and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> Really good BP that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or make it red.</li>
            <li> I ordered this last week and I have to say this may be the best BP I&#x27;ve ever used. It seems to smell better too? Not sure why. I use it twice a day after cleansing and follow with a moisturizer (cetaphil) My skin is responding well. Yay!!! I&#x27;m 32 and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Best benzo I have used for my &#x27;mature&#x27; skin.</li>
