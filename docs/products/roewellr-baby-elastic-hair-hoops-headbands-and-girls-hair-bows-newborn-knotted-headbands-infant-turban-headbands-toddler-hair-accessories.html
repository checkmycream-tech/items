            <li>nicely made, soft and good quality.</li>
            <li>I love tht they are of stretchy material but they are way too huge my baby isn&#x27;t here</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t see them being able to fit a baby</li>
            <li>These are cute, but in no way fit a baby.</li>
            <li>sure what type of baby they would fit.</li>
            <li>Perfect headbands, it is made of stretchy material so it will fit comfortably for a long time!</li>
            <li>Easy too use.</li>
            <li>These headbands looked super cute my daughter.</li>
            <li>Super cute</li>
            <li>They were huge</li>
            <li>Love them, fabric is nice and soft for babies head</li>
            <li>I have a HUGE collection of bows, head wraps, etc.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have had these when she was smaller, great quality.</li>
            <li>such a great look with any outfit</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t wait till she can fit them.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and</li>
            <li>a light stretchy fabric that doesn&#x27;t dig into her head</li>
            <li>If they don&#x27;t fit my newborn lady I am still really excited to have them for whenever they do fit her.</li>
            <li>I use those beautiful head wrap with a matching dress and it is also very good in cold weather it can cover</li>
            <li>Fits well and it stretches nicely so she can probably wear it as she gets older too.</li>
            <li>ur little one ears keep her ears nice n warm love it .</li>
            <li>Exactly what we wanted and more</li>
            <li>Fit my big 3m old perfectly.  </li>
            <li>1 year old daughter looks very cute ..</li>
            <li>Got these for my 5 month old baby girl they look so cute on her!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these.  </li>
            <li>They fit my average size 10 month old daughter perfectly.</li>
            <li>They are super comfy and not leave marks</li>
            <li>and I think she&#x27;ll be able to wear them as she gets older.</li>
            <li>- These are the ones I get the most compliments and &amp;#34;where did you get those.&amp;#34;  I have a 3-4 month old baby girl with an 85th percentile head, but these fit her even at 2 months.  </li>
            <li>These are adorable, but I wish they actually tied so they could be adjusted, also the color options are just ok, wish you could pick different colors, still really cute though!</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li>Love how they look on my 8 month old daughter!</li>
            <li>so I was worried they may not fit but not only do they fit perfectly</li>
            <li>I love the material they are soft and they stretch as well.</li>
            <li>then i expected but a good product.</li>
            <li>My 6 month old daughter looks absolutely adorable in these headbands.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely ADORABLE on my 14 month old.</li>
            <li>Very cute, however they are pretty big for an Infant/baby!!</li>
            <li>but I do like the colors and the price is right for what you get.</li>
            <li>These are just refreshing since so much of what is offered for girls is extremely frou frou and flowery, so I am pleased to have found more substantial headbands that have fun and sweet colors without making me feel like I am wrapping a present when I put one on her head.</li>
            <li>They have great elasticity and she will be able to wear them for the next few years.</li>
            <li>Great quality not only for babys, algo for big girls and moms</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to all mummies who hav baby girl !!</li>
            <li>I wish they had more colors because I would definitely purchase them all!</li>
            <li>still cute overall</li>
            <li>they fit my 1month old .</li>
            <li>They fit an adult&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>But they are really pretty came in all the colors</li>
            <li>Fit my 8 month old really well.</li>
            <li>I also know that she&#x27;ll be able to wear them for a long time.</li>
            <li>I really like these, but baby doesn&#x27;t tolerate them very well.</li>
            <li>Also really polyester feeling but</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for all the mommies!</li>
            <li>The material is soft, but it slides right off my daughters head.  </li>
            <li>Run slightly legs more like 3+months &amp; not adjustable.</li>
            <li>and I feel like they will expand as she gets older.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, besides the picture there isn&#x27;t any real indication of how big or small they are.</li>
            <li>They seem to be super comfortable on her little soft head also.</li>
            <li>Shipping wasn&#x27;t at long as expected, love these!</li>
            <li>I love them but they do not fit my baby</li>
            <li>my 6 month old has a pretty big head.</li>
            <li>They were cute, but too small for my 8 month old 😞</li>
            <li>I do not recommend them if you a few month old baby, they will fit your head not hers.</li>
            <li>Soft and don&#x27;t leave marks.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 8 months old and her head is measuring 17 1/4.</li>
            <li>n soft in material ...</li>
            <li>Unless your baby has an adult sized head these are not for you...</li>
            <li>Fits my 2 month old daughter.</li>
            <li>I saw the baby picture wearing the mint blue one which I really wanted</li>
            <li>Like them so far</li>
            <li>So soft and stretchy</li>
            <li>The other reviews are right, they are a bit big for babies and</li>
            <li>They fit a little loose but still wearable.</li>
            <li>I purchased for my 9 month old granddaughter and the knot up front left an indent red mark on her head.</li>
            <li>They look a little cheap and the bow lies a little too low for my taste</li>

            <li> then i expected but a good product.</li>
            <li> My 6 month old daughter looks absolutely adorable in these headbands.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely ADORABLE on my 14 month old.</li>
            <li> Very cute, however they are pretty big for an Infant/baby!!</li>
            <li> but I do like the colors and the price is right for what you get.</li>
            <li> These are just refreshing since so much of what is offered for girls is extremely frou frou and flowery, so I am pleased to have found more substantial headbands that have fun and sweet colors without making me feel like I am wrapping a present when I put one on her head.</li>
            <li> They have great elasticity and she will be able to wear them for the next few years.</li>
            <li> Great quality not only for babys, algo for big girls and moms</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to all mummies who hav baby girl !!</li>
            <li> I wish they had more colors because I would definitely purchase them all!</li>
            <li> still cute overall</li>
            <li> they fit my 1month old .</li>
            <li> They fit an adult&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> But they are really pretty came in all the colors</li>
            <li> Fit my 8 month old really well.</li>
            <li> I also know that she&#x27;ll be able to wear them for a long time.</li>
            <li> I really like these, but baby doesn&#x27;t tolerate them very well.</li>
            <li> Also really polyester feeling but</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for all the mommies!</li>
            <li> The material is soft, but it slides right off my daughters head.  </li>
            <li> Run slightly legs more like 3+months &amp; not adjustable.</li>
            <li> and I feel like they will expand as she gets older.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, besides the picture there isn&#x27;t any real indication of how big or small they are.</li>
            <li> They seem to be super comfortable on her little soft head also.</li>
            <li> Shipping wasn&#x27;t at long as expected, love these!</li>
            <li> I love them but they do not fit my baby</li>
            <li> my 6 month old has a pretty big head.</li>
            <li> They were cute, but too small for my 8 month old 😞</li>
            <li> I do not recommend them if you a few month old baby, they will fit your head not hers.</li>
            <li> Soft and don&#x27;t leave marks.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 8 months old and her head is measuring 17 1/4.</li>
            <li> n soft in material ...</li>
            <li> Unless your baby has an adult sized head these are not for you...</li>
            <li> Fits my 2 month old daughter.</li>
            <li> I saw the baby picture wearing the mint blue one which I really wanted</li>
            <li> Like them so far</li>
            <li> So soft and stretchy</li>
            <li> The other reviews are right, they are a bit big for babies and</li>
            <li> They fit a little loose but still wearable.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my 9 month old granddaughter and the knot up front left an indent red mark on her head.</li>
            <li> They look a little cheap and the bow lies a little too low for my taste</li>
            <li> A little big for my 10 month old niece, bit she will use it later</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little big for my 3.5 month old</li>
            <li> my baby is 5 month and it fits slightly loose so she can wear it later as well.</li>
            <li> Just different than what I expected</li>
            <li> I thought that the shipping would take a long time since they were coming from China</li>
            <li> A little bigger in size</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected also.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> They Arrived Quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> I had also ordered other headbands from another company that were delivered within a couple of days-standard shipping.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that the white is not bright and has a small tint of pink.</li>
            <li> She has been wearing it since she was 10 month and her head size is just about average.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive a black one.</li>
            <li> I think they are just a little too snug and bulky....</li>
            <li> My daughter has a few years before she can even think about wearing these.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that this company&#x27;s shipping is VERY slow.</li>
            <li> but they do run small.</li>
            <li> Only bad thing I have to say is the size.</li>
            <li> I noticed some reviewers complaining about a weird chemical smell, but I didn&#x27;t experience that at all.</li>
            <li> my package was wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with these!!</li>
            <li> I hate to take them off.</li>

            <li> Just what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived way before the expecting date.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is that they&#x27;re still a bit big for my 6mth old,but she&#x27;ll grow into them.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that.  . no complaints here.</li>
            <li> nicely made, soft and good quality. my baby is 5 month and it fits slightly loose so she can wear it later as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the headbands. Quality is great! Only bad thing I have to say is the size. I bought these with intentions for my infant. Sizes run biggger then my daughter head. I had to customize mine. Which I didn&#x27;t mind cause these are awesome!</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured! Individually wrapped! Love, love, love them! Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> My daughter is 8 months old and her head is measuring 17 1/4. They fit perfectly and I think she&#x27;ll be able to wear them as she gets older.</li>
            <li> Well made, bright and beautiful ... Fit my 2 year old perfectly.  I can wear them, too!</li>

            <li> Cute but wish it was adjustable</li>
            <li> I really like these, but baby doesn&#x27;t tolerate them very well. I think they are just a little too snug and bulky....she is 9mos FYI</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted and more</li>
            <li> Soft material, nice colors, great fit!&lt;br /&gt;Individually wrapped- love the price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these headbands! They are the perfect size and material for my 7 month old!</li>
            <li> Very cute. The only issue is that the white is not bright and has a small tint of pink. Looks like it was washed with something red.</li>
            <li> Headbands are SO adorable, and granddaughter looks precious in them. Only complaint is that this company&#x27;s shipping is VERY slow. I had also ordered other headbands from another company that were delivered within a couple of days-standard shipping.</li>
            <li> I have 6 months daughter n she love.. love.. these head wrap and it&#x27;s very cute n soft in material ... I use those beautiful head wrap with a matching dress and it is also very good in cold weather it can cover ur little one ears keep her ears nice n warm love it . Highly recommend to all mummies who hav baby girl !! It can use from 0-12 months .</li>
            <li> These are cute, but in no way fit a baby. I do wear them though. :)</li>
            <li> These are a bit bigger than I assumed they&#x27;d be. To be fair, besides the picture there isn&#x27;t any real indication of how big or small they are. If they don&#x27;t fit my newborn lady I am still really excited to have them for whenever they do fit her. The colors are great, bold, true to what is pictured. I noticed some reviewers complaining about a weird chemical smell, but I didn&#x27;t experience that at all. These are just refreshing since so much of what is offered for girls is extremely frou frou and flowery, so I am pleased to have found more substantial headbands that have fun and sweet colors without making me feel like I am wrapping a present when I put one on her head.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these headbands!!! My 6 month old daughter looks absolutely adorable in these headbands. She looks so cute I hate to take them off. I wish they had more colors because I would definitely purchase them all! Great buy, great price and more importantly great quality. Thank you...two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Unless your baby has an adult sized head these are not for you... They were huge</li>
            <li> Love the band but they do run small. I purchased for my 9 month old granddaughter and the knot up front left an indent red mark on her head. I wish I would have had these when she was smaller, great quality.</li>
            <li> Very adorable and nice fabric.</li>
            <li> Run slightly legs more like 3+months &amp; not adjustable. Also really polyester feeling but still cute overall Just different than what I expected</li>
            <li> love them ! they fit my 1month old .</li>
            <li> Love them they are perfect and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.  You may want to sew the knot so it doesn&#x27;t come undone.  They slip off my Baby&#x27;s head though; hopefully she will grow into them.  Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Omg!! I&#x27;m obsessed with these!! Super cute..love the stretchy material..good quality... My baby is 6 months and they fit perfectly ..such a great look with any outfit</li>
            <li> my 1 year daughter girl looks beautiful with those headbands !!</li>
            <li> Perfect headbands, it is made of stretchy material so it will fit comfortably for a long time!</li>
            <li> Love them.  Well made.  Fit my big 3m old perfectly.  Ty so much for the great price!</li>
            <li> These head bands are so cute.  They&#x27;re a little big for my 3.5 month old but I can&#x27;t wait till she can fit them.</li>
            <li> They were cute, but too small for my 8 month old 😞</li>
            <li> Shipping wasn&#x27;t at long as expected, love these!</li>
            <li> Cute headbands but my package was wrong. I didn&#x27;t receive a black one. Got 2 yellows!!!</li>
            <li> Such a bummer.  The material is soft, but it slides right off my daughters head.  The material is slippery.</li>
            <li> Loveee these ! For the price they are amazing! 1 year old daughter looks very cute .. She has been wearing it since she was 10 month and her head size is just about average.</li>
            <li> Love them, fabric is nice and soft for babies head and they look adorable!!!</li>
            <li> The fabric is very cheap fabric. I should&#x27;ve known better. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat them. The are slightly large for newborns but are very cute!</li>
            <li> Great product! Material is very nice. Fits my 2 month old daughter. Fits well and it stretches nicely so she can probably wear it as she gets older too. It Does Not untie to change size. It&#x27;s a band with the bow tied to it.  Package was nice! I saw the baby picture wearing the mint blue one which I really wanted but it does not come in that color. I just noticed it was a pic for reference.  Overall great product! Highly recommended for all the mommies!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re way too big to be considered &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; headbands and have no way to make them smaller or tighten them. My daughter has a few years before she can even think about wearing these.</li>
            <li> I wish the size was adjustable</li>
            <li> These are adorable! Fit my 11 month old daughter perfect!</li>
            <li> As described , very nice</li>
            <li> Awesome material!  Like them so far</li>
            <li> These are really nice - except they are huge. They fit an adult&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what type of baby they would fit.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these.  I have a HUGE collection of bows, head wraps, etc. for my baby girl but THESE - These are the ones I get the most compliments and &amp;#34;where did you get those.&amp;#34;  I have a 3-4 month old baby girl with an 85th percentile head, but these fit her even at 2 months.  They are comfortable and a light stretchy fabric that doesn&#x27;t dig into her head and I feel like they will expand as she gets older.  The colors are beautiful and bright and overall I am just SUPER happy with these.</li>
            <li> I love them. So soft and stretchy</li>
            <li> These are absolutely ADORABLE on my 14 month old. They have great elasticity and she will be able to wear them for the next few years.</li>
            <li> daughter in law likes them.</li>
            <li> I love them but they do not fit my baby they are for grown people but I will use them on her when she gets bigger as I have a newborn. I do not recommend them if you a few month old baby, they will fit your head not hers. But they are really pretty came in all the colors</li>
            <li> Got these for my 5 month old baby girl they look so cute on her! Just what I wanted! They fit a little loose but still wearable. She can grow into them as they are stretchy material. They Arrived Quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> These are adorable, but I wish they actually tied so they could be adjusted, also the color options are just ok, wish you could pick different colors, still really cute though!</li>
            <li> I love the headbands!!!  cute &amp; perfect fitting for my 7 month old</li>
            <li> These are headbands are cute on my baby! I thought that the shipping would take a long time since they were coming from China but they arrived quicker than my expectations.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my one year old princess!!</li>
            <li> A little big for my 10 month old niece, bit she will use it later</li>
            <li> Very cute, however they are pretty big for an Infant/baby!!</li>
            <li> Love love love these hair bands everyone keep asking me where I got them from.</li>
            <li> great deal and seller</li>
