            <li>i couldnt believe i was even wearing it, and guess what no horrible break outs like i normally get with products i</li>
            <li>My wife got to try this product for free and she is very thankful she did.</li>
            <li>I have been using for a few weeks now...not seeing an great results.  </li>
            <li>So far I am really enjoying this moisturizer as I have tried basically everything.  </li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary bottle of this product to aid my review.</li>
            <li>I received a bottle of this moisturizer complimentary</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this to be as good as other products for my skin anyway.</li>
            <li>– Prompt delivery and great attention after sales, ready to give advice if needed , Lovely product seems to be having the desired effect&amp;quot; Second bottle I&#x27;ve ordered now it&#x27;s really making a difference to my skin, I hope to order the serum and eye cream next</li>
            <li>I want to first say that I wasn&#x27;t expecting the smell to be fresh and almost minty</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>It gave me a rash the first night I used it.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different skin care products and most work somewhat</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn’t pay it if I didn’t know that it worked, but it really does!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs in seconds leaving my skin feeling rejuvenated and soft.</li>
            <li>I love the texture--not too heavy, absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>I just sat through it and my face returned to normal fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>thanks so much!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always fun getting samples of new products to try.</li>
            <li>I really like this formulation.  </li>
            <li>and I really notice a difference in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its too soon to do a full product review but the shipping was extra fast.  </li>
            <li>when i was half asleep, i had no sleep and still looked fresh in the face, it feels so light</li>
            <li>Not bad enough to need to wash it off though.</li>
            <li>decent product, but not overnight results.</li>
            <li>While I try many different products, this is one I would actually continue to buy for myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I waited several days before coming back, I wanted to use it for several days first to be able to give an unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, I liked the product enough to continue using it and enough to recommend it to people who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I have very sensitive skin and cannot use astringents.</li>
            <li>’s priced at $37.99 right now which is probably somewhere in the middle as far as skincare goes.</li>
            <li>The peppermint oil was subtle enough to not be overwhelming but strong enough to lift my spirits when I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product cleans well and still leaves her face soft.</li>
            <li>She likes that it is a soft cleaner,</li>
            <li>i really believe the texture of my skin is feeling different &amp; my lines seem to be smoothing also.</li>
            <li>thirty eight years old</li>
            <li>They are too sticky or don’t smell good or have a weird texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it made my skin feel fresh and look instantly smoothing my friends even said i looked wide</li>
            <li>It has that salon smell like you feel like you are getting a professional facial.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A great product! Tightens the skin and moisturizes -- though I had to use another (light) moisturizer once I had it on.</li>
            <li> When my wife saw this product, her face lit up. I could tell she wanted to try it. What she likes about this Vitamin C Facial facial serum is how it cleans her face. The product cleans well and still leaves her face soft. She likes that it is a soft cleaner, that cleans well, but does not irritate. I&#x27;m sure she will find out some more of the benefits of this product the more she uses it. My wife got to try this product for free and she is very thankful she did. As the product cleans, it slowly removes some of the lines around her eyes. She can&#x27;t wait to see the product to continue to work its magic on her face.</li>
            <li> I happen to really love this moisturizer. There is a hint of mint, makes my face so smooth, and cool. Will get it again</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great for oily skin. I love the texture--not too heavy, absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> I waited several days before coming back, I wanted to use it for several days first to be able to give an unbiased opinion.  So far I am really enjoying this moisturizer as I have tried basically everything.  i really believe the texture of my skin is feeling different &amp; my lines seem to be smoothing also. I am a MUAH and do makeup and hair for a lot of print magazines.  I will tell my models and families about this awesome product.  thanks so much!  Noelani Flannagin</li>
            <li> I received my moisturizer yesterday.  I really like this formulation; it&#x27;s very smooth and light.  The fragrance is pleasant and not overpowering.  The packaging is also very nice, appropriate for a premium product.  The benefit of this formulation are the peptides (anti-aging).  It will take some time to see if there is a benefit in the appearance of my skin.  Update:  I apply this along with ROC (retinol cream) before bed at night.  I am seeing an improvement in the appearance of my skin in the morning.  I really like this formulation.  I have also been impressed by the support that I have received from this company.  They send me emails with guidance on how to use this product with contact information for further dialog and support.</li>
            <li> It gave me a rash the first night I used it. I waited about a week and tried it again, and I have not had anymore issues. Love the product. I had someone tell my yesterday that I was 28..... but don&#x27;t tell them that I am actually 46!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product so far!! But have not used it long!!</li>
            <li> Its too soon to do a full product review but the shipping was extra fast.  The only suggestion I would make is to take the big white upc sticker attached to the actual bottle off.  When I took it off it made it sticky. Once I use this for a month, I&#x27;ll post a full review.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever tried.  Received on time and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this to be as good as other products for my skin anyway. I may work for others.</li>
            <li> I like it very much but I feel it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I need especially when I have taking sun bathing.</li>
            <li> I love how makes my skin feel!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have recieved this product and was stunned it&#x27;s smell is a bit intregining but when placed on my skin it was gone instantly like my face soaked it up before i could even blink! it made my skin feel fresh and look instantly smoothing my friends even said i looked wide awake  when i was half asleep, i had no sleep and still looked fresh in the face, it feels so light i couldnt believe i was even wearing it, and guess what no horrible break outs like i normally get with products i use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have to say, when I got this I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be any different than any other creams I&#x27;ve reviewed before, but I was surprised! I want to first say that I wasn&#x27;t expecting the smell to be fresh and almost minty which was very refreshing! I also like the light feel of it as well when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;It soaks into your skin and not greasy at all (which, I hate with other creams).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and love the results!</li>
            <li> – Prompt delivery and great attention after sales, ready to give advice if needed , Lovely product seems to be having the desired effect&amp;quot; Second bottle I&#x27;ve ordered now it&#x27;s really making a difference to my skin, I hope to order the serum and eye cream next</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always fun getting samples of new products to try. Ones that have the potential to make me feel younger and look younger are extra special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Anti-Aging Moisturizer from Bonapiel was my latest test. It went on silky and smooth and felt great once applied. What I liked most about the product is the scent. The peppermint oil was subtle enough to not be overwhelming but strong enough to lift my spirits when I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have very sensitive skin and cannot use astringents. My face turns beet red the minute I apply them. Whether this product contains an astringent or not, I&#x27;m not sure but it did cause my face to turn a bit red. Not bad enough to need to wash it off though. I just sat through it and my face returned to normal fairly quickly. I broke out a few times after using it but I don&#x27;t know whether that was due to the product or just hormonal which is why I didn&#x27;t penalize the product in my star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I liked the product enough to continue using it and enough to recommend it to people who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. If you like the scent of peppermint, this is definitely a nice addition to the beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary bottle of this product to aid my review. The shipping was very fast and the product arrived in perfect condition. I used the entire bottle of this product. Although I did not notice a difference in the appearance of my lines, wrinkles, or pores, I did notice that my skin seemed to have a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent product, but not overnight results.</li>
            <li> You need to try this love it.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this anti aging moisturizer from Bonapiel! I have been using it for a month and I really notice a difference in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At thirty eight years old I’m combatting fine lines and wrinkles and all the things none of us want to see when we look in the mirror! I have tried a lot of different skin care products and most work somewhat but there is usually something I don’t like about them. They are too sticky or don’t smell good or have a weird texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bonapiel is the opposite of all these things. I love the smell! It has that salon smell like you feel like you are getting a professional facial. Just the scent alone is relaxing and calming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just press the applicator down once to get the perfect amount per application. It goes on smooth and easy and doesn’t leave you greasy or shiny at all. My skin just drinks it up and absorbs it all. I feel like my skin is softer and has a glow to it that wasn’t there before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really thrilled with the results of Bonapiel that I saw after using for just days. While I try many different products, this is one I would actually continue to buy for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s priced at $37.99 right now which is probably somewhere in the middle as far as skincare goes. I probably wouldn’t pay it if I didn’t know that it worked, but it really does!</li>
            <li> i did notice the lines were less defined</li>
            <li> This is a light weight cream, not greasy or sticky at all and a hint of mint smell</li>
            <li> I am in a lot of product testing sites to I have tried TONS of anti-aging moisturizers. This one was different from all of them. I love the pump dispenser it is so much more sanitary than digging in a pot/jar. The pump works perfectly and dispenses just the right amount of moisturizer with 2 pumps. What stood of the most is the refreshing cool feeling I get when I apply this moisturizer. The texture is light and airy and wears perfectly under makeup with no peeling or flaking.  It goes on smooth and absorbs in seconds leaving my skin feeling rejuvenated and soft. I received a bottle of this moisturizer complimentary but I would purchase it for myself.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few weeks now...not seeing an great results.  Will continue to try, and hope to see something soon.</li>
