            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about everything in the past to no avail.</li>

            <li> Not as expected, other moisturizers do a better job for much less money.</li>
            <li> As someone with type 1 diabetes, I struggle w/ dry feet. I have tried many different lotions, oils, etc. This one was recommended by a Doctor, and it really seems to work for me. I apply after a shower/bath, and put socks on for a few minutes. When I go to get a pedicure, my 12+ year go-to salon has commented on how much better my feet look.  Try it!</li>
            <li> My sister has diabetes and her doctor prescribed this for her feet saying it was only available from a doctor&#x27;s office. I wanted it for my feet as nothing else worked to keep it soft and smooth (I don&#x27;t have her illness), but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price so I came on Amazon and found it available for a lot less. Already ordered more. Great product.</li>
            <li> Good product for all skin areas. Learned about the product from wound care nurse. I highly recommend for all friends who have dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my podiatrist and I have been using it for over two years to prevent dry cracked skin on the soles of my feet.  I tried other products and this is the only one that works.  An 8 Oz. bottle lasts me about 8 months.</li>
            <li> I purchase a few bottle of these on a regular basis.  My son&#x27;s podiatrist recommended this to use on his dried out feet and it works great.  We use it when the weather gets cold and it protects our skin very well.  Amazon has a good price on it also ($16 a bottle vs the $25 my doctor wanted).</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that far exceeds similar type lotions available over the counter,but ,this contains oakin- and they don&#x27;t and it works great just as is indicated. I am diabetic and it was recommended by my podiatrist for use. I purchased it on line from Amazon as it was almost $6.00 less than if I purchased from the doctor&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li> I can get this product from my foot Dr., but the cost is higher in the office.  I do hope the supply is not dwindling as use up a particular vendor&#x27;s supply.</li>
            <li> This smells pretty funny and leaves behind a greasy residue even if you spend a long time rubbing it in. It didn&#x27;t give me any sort of negative reaction like many products do on my sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t really help my eczema at all like I had hoped.</li>
            <li> My Podiatrist sold me my first bottle of Amerigel to use on my dry, diabetic feet. I&#x27;ve used just about everything in the past to no avail. This lotion doesn&#x27;t dry my feet out after an initial application. It leaves behind a moisture barrier. It also contains oak extract and urea, both excellent for flaking, dry, cracked skin. I use it on my hands and feet (dry skin and eczema), and on my arms and legs, dry, fragile, sun damaged skin. I&#x27;ve been through several bottles since, because it works. I don&#x27;t know how many half used Eucerin or Aveeno bottles and tubes I have around here, because they don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> The first time, my mother&#x27;s doctor recommended this lotion for her leg and feet. Well, I purchased it out of the doctor&#x27;s office and complained about the price. Since that time, I&#x27;ve been purchasing on Amazon. Thanks Amazon. People who purchase often from Amazon should be entitled to free shipping without a cost. There are several items i purchase every other month and sometime every month.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Amerigel as a recommendation from my podiatrist.  Was having terrible problems with dry skin on my toes.  I received this almost immediately and started using it.  When I returned to the podiatrist, only after 3 weeks of using the product he said, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m don&#x27;t know if you took my recommendation or not but your toes looks 100% better.  What a relief.  It was either this or wear sneakers the rest of my life to cover my feet.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This was recommend by foot DR and it helps heal sores on legs after I started using Amergel Gauze pads I will use for a long time</li>
            <li> Podiatrist trim mended it for my crusty dry hurting feet. Immediate improvement with feet almost perfectly soft and feeling good in just 3 weeks. DH is using it on his hands and feet with like results.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best ever for us southern gals who are allergic to shoes and end up with yucky feet covered with dead skin! after only three applications, things are looking very dainty! The lotion was recommended by a podiatrist, and he was right!</li>
            <li> Price was great.  I paid $14.00 more for the same size at my doctors office.  It&#x27;s been satisfactory for my skin condition.</li>
            <li> Working slowly, but can see improvement in skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> I get better results if I put it on my feet with socks before bedtime.  My callous on my outer toes have disappeared.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Best product to treat necrobiosis on my legs.</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF, EXPENSIVE BUT IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> my doc sells this at his office. the only place I found it less expensive is on Amazon. Same great stuff.</li>
            <li> I hsve large brown spots on my shins from running into things.  They have been there for years and would not go away.  With the Amerigel Care Lotion they are starting to lighten up.  Dr. said it would take a while, but it is working.</li>
            <li> I had used multiple different lotions in the past but my dermatologist said that I would be more satisfied with this lotion. He was correct.</li>
            <li> Hoping it works on my skin problem</li>
            <li> Excellent product for dry cracking skin! Softens skin and promotes healing in a very short period (10 to 14 days).</li>
            <li> Non greasy and absorbs fast</li>
            <li> Great healing product, the only thing better is Amerigel&#x27;s ointment. Amerigel&#x27;s products are worth their weight in gold, they&#x27;ve healed the cracks on my feet that prescription dermatology creams can&#x27;t touch.</li>
            <li> I recently saw a podiatrist.  One of my complaints was a callus on the bottom of my foot. It hurt when I walk and I wanted to know how best to remove it.  The podiatrist recommended a combination of the Pumice Sponge Block [[ASIN:B004WBI2FS Swissco Pumice Sponge]] and Amerigel Care Lotion. His office sold it for $20. The doctor office price is a little more expensive than Amazon but could be used with your pre-tax medical account as it comes with a doctor note as required by the tax regulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To treat my callus the doctors instructed me to leather up the sponge with soap and use it every time I take a shower. After using the Pumice Sponge he told me to use Amerigel Lotion.  He said he finds it particularly effective THICK dry skin.  It has been three weeks since I began using the pumice sponge/Amerigel and I am pretty impressed with the results. My callus no longer bothers me, and my foot feels smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a photo of the bottle and a drop of lotion on my hand so you can see the consistency.  It is fairly thick, does not feel greasy, and absorbs very quickly. It is totally unscented which is a big plus in my book.  It is helping me quite well and I am recommending it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> I am so thankful I was introduced to this great cream. Made especially for diabetics.&lt;br /&gt;After my husband bathes, the sitter rubs legs, feet, and arms with this cream. The moisture helps make skin soft&lt;br /&gt;And  less dry. It is so helpful, I have started using as a body cream</li>
            <li> I used this lotion on my feet in the summer as well as for the feet of my diabetic mother.  It provides good moisturizing coverage without being sticky.  Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> great lotion, my husband is a diabetic and uses it on his feet and legs works great.</li>
            <li> had used it before, but could not find it locally - many uses for skin problems - especially if you have had MRSA on skin.</li>
            <li> Too liquid-y. Didn&#x27;t help me. Maybe other people will benefit from it though. It was too expensive too. I prefer Rosie&#x27;s Toesies which is peppermint-y.</li>
            <li> long lasting moisture.  17 more words required - it&#x27;s just good for me - that&#x27;s all i know - try it.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time we&#x27;ve purchased this product. Ran out of the first one and had to replace it. I&#x27;m usually really skeptical when it comes to creams but this one really works. Would recommend to anybody suffering from rashes.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my podiatrist. I have some rough spots on the bottom of my feet, and this works fairly well at softening and eliminating them.</li>
            <li> This product works great in clearing up dry skin on your feet. The price is much less than at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> as advertised quick shipping arrived safe.</li>
            <li> works well on my 90 yr old mother&#x27;s bruised legs, and makes skin softer</li>
            <li> I like it but you are selling it at an inflation price. I will not be buying this through you.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this product for anyone who has any decreased sensation in their feet.&lt;br /&gt;It will improve the softness of the bottom of your feet.&lt;br /&gt;The product took a long time to arrive and it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> My granddad loves this cream.</li>
            <li> Received it promptly.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> I think I noticed my legs lightening a bit and it isn&#x27;t greasy. Buying it again.</li>
