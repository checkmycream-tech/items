            <li>The color works great</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product!  </li>
            <li>I love the wand it is the best.</li>
            <li>The applicator is so easy to use and perfectly separates lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good mascara for going out at night.</li>
            <li>was very pleased this was a rip off</li>
            <li>Then I have amazing raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING...</li>
            <li>this mascara is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great Service, arrived at time, just what I put in my order, good packing, and good price, thanks for this.</li>
            <li>The seller was great and quick at getting it to me.</li>
            <li>truly a one of a kind mascara with a unique and easy to use wand that enhances and defines lashes!</li>
            <li>I have used this for many, many years and love it.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, so keep that in mind when I tell you that I absolutely love this mascara until an hour after application, when it starts to wander all over my face.</li>
            <li>Wow-my lashes looked better than they ever have.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>love this product .</li>
            <li>and  I  just love the way it pulls out the lashes.</li>
            <li>I have most likley given it a worl.</li>
            <li>Givenchy was mentioned in a famous makeup artists, Wayne Goss, youtube blog.</li>
            <li>I ordered the mascara and was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I love this method for applying so easy and allows for spot areas and no smearing.  </li>
            <li>i was so excited about this mascara only to be incredibly dissapointed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I find the brush on this mascara to easily be 5-stars, though the liquid itself is 3-stars for me.</li>
            <li>and I thought this mascara might help them look more full.  </li>
            <li>I put it on light</li>
            <li>Or if you want a cheaper but really awesome quick to use mascara, try L&#x27;Oreal Carbon Black.</li>
            <li>it took a couple of times to get used to the wand, and to learn how to perfect it, but now, I would never go back to any other kind.  </li>
            <li>Product will certainly make your lashes stand out more....</li>
            <li>The tip really does make application much more precise, which is great for getting the lashes in the corner of your eyes without over-applying in other areas and making things clumpy.  </li>
            <li>Plus I love how I could really build out the outer corner lashes and give my eyes a lift.</li>
            <li>but my eyes only looked good for an hour or 2.  </li>
            <li>(And I say that as someone who would NOT describe herself as being particularly skilled at makeup, so I don&#x27;t believe this is only for someone who is more experienced.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how it grabbed the littlest hairs and made them appear thicker and longer, its like I grew new lashes.</li>
            <li>Great product, I love the way the little brush gets to the area on my outside of eyelid, and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Lashes are so important because they can make your whole face pop.</li>
            <li>Simple amazing.</li>
            <li>the mascara is costly but to me it is worth it.</li>
            <li>A bit pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li>vs. 5-stars is that I don&#x27;t think the mascara liquid itself is as good as other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>and it came right off.</li>
            <li>Product was old dried out not any good have used this prcduct many times from sephora</li>
            <li>but it give you way more control than any other brush out there, huge lashes and</li>
            <li>Great to use on hard to reach lashes.</li>
            <li>I find the mascara to be very stable.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS MASCARA</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wear mascara</li>
            <li>and it seems like I don&#x27;t get quite as many wears out of it as I do other brands of mascara.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this mascara when having my makeup professionally applied.  </li>
            <li>It makes my lashes so, so beautiful and almost makes them look fake.</li>
            <li>It did take a little practice before I felt like I was taking advantage of the full potential of the wand, but it wasn&#x27;t long before I felt like I was using it successfully.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate, and no drips, or smudges.  </li>
            <li>MASCARA WARDROBE - 1 MASCARA, 3 BRUSHES - DEFINE CURL VOLUME]] is also interesting because it is one tube of mascara that comes with three different kinds of brushes, each meant to achieve a different look.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are full long and feathery without clumps.</li>
            <li>It seems to dry out quickly</li>
            <li>Exact same problem.</li>
            <li>Natural look girls bypass this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better for this mascara to be part of your arsenal of mascaras and not the only one as it may not be practical for everyday use.</li>
            <li>, DOES&#x27;NT DRY VERY FAST.  </li>
            <li>I can tell when it is getting old because it starts to get a little clumpier and doesn&#x27;t coat my lashes quite as well, even if I clean off the brush.  </li>
            <li>So: with the caveats that you have never had a problem with raccoon eyes, you don&#x27;t have oily skin, you don&#x27;t live in a place with high humidity, and you don&#x27;t sweat or get wet</li>
            <li>The round tip makes application simple and clean.</li>
            <li>I have looked my entire adult life for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; mascara.  </li>
            <li>it comes right off with little effort.</li>
            <li>The first time I made a mess.</li>
            <li>You will get results if you are looking for a more dramatic eye.</li>

            <li> It certainly blows away any other brand - upscale to drug store - hands down.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the fact that this mascara drips down my face at the first hint of humidity makes the high price even more insulting.  </li>
            <li> Cheap or expensive</li>
            <li> I will never go back to the other wands</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin I might recommend this product but if not get waterproof or another brand.</li>
            <li> it barely stayes on and clumps, making you look like you spent hours crying.</li>
            <li> The wand makes every little tiny lash excessable bringing it out.</li>
            <li> It clumps horribly, it really is not anything like Dior or Lancome.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other mascara but this.</li>
            <li> So sometimes I find myself cheating and using this wand in other brands of mascara if I can get it to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little round ball brush is what initially attracted me to this product.  </li>
            <li> The round, small applicator ball allows you to get every lash, including in the inner and outer part of your eye.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> but it is not too dark.</li>
            <li> In retrospect maybe I should have gotten waterproof, but the Clinique mascara I was using previously wasn&#x27;t waterproof and this didn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li> But this didn&#x27;t happen previously</li>
            <li> , black is black</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant on ordering this one from the look of the wand...</li>
            <li> The product is what I really disliked.</li>
            <li> It is not on heavy</li>
            <li> I was wrong; it is no different than an $8.00 drugstore product.  </li>
            <li> I have very few eyelashes .</li>
            <li> A bit hard to find tho.</li>
            <li> Hard to find mascara.  </li>
            <li> Thought I would really like this item, but I hate it.</li>
            <li> I am still working on not over applying and have it look too thick.  </li>
            <li> The formula may be decent, but the applicator wand is awful.</li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to apply mascara using this weird ball-shaped wand.</li>
            <li> And I am no spring chicken.</li>
            <li> but beware of how difficult it can be to get off!</li>
            <li> therefore I&#x27;m terrible at putting it on - usually smear it.  </li>
            <li> the wand works as promised but the mascara is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> The round, small applicator ball allows you to get every lash, including in the inner and outer part of your eye. I have used this for many, many years and love it. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Thought I would really like this item, but I hate it. It clumps horribly, it really is not anything like Dior or Lancome. The seller was great and quick at getting it to me. The product is what I really disliked.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so keep that in mind when I tell you that I absolutely love this mascara until an hour after application, when it starts to wander all over my face. Then I have amazing raccoon eyes. And the \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; version? Please. Exact same problem. So: with the caveats that you have never had a problem with raccoon eyes, you don&#x27;t have oily skin, you don&#x27;t live in a place with high humidity, and you don&#x27;t sweat or get wet, this is a great mascara.</li>
            <li> truly a one of a kind mascara with a unique and easy to use wand that enhances and defines lashes! great buy.</li>
            <li> This mascara brush is so well designed that I wish everyone knew about it.  Well, then again, maybe not.  It certainly blows away any other brand - upscale to drug store - hands down.  You gotta try it.  I won&#x27;t use any other mascara but this.</li>
            <li> i was so excited about this mascara only to be incredibly dissapointed! the wand works as promised but the mascara is horrible. it barely stayes on and clumps, making you look like you spent hours crying. I sent it back only to find out that Sephora takes 30 business days (over two months) to get you a refund! i should have taken it back to the store instead of sending it back through mail.</li>
            <li> Wow-my lashes looked better than they ever have. You have to be open minded to trying something totally different though. And it takes practice. The first time I made a mess. The third time I have it figured out. I am still working on not over applying and have it look too thick.  I love how it grabbed the littlest hairs and made them appear thicker and longer, its like I grew new lashes. I have NEVER had a mascara do this. And I am no spring chicken. Plus I love how I could really build out the outer corner lashes and give my eyes a lift. I did not have the raccoon eye problem some reviewers mentioned. It didn&#x27;t flake. And I use DHC olive oil cleanser and it came right off. You will get results if you are looking for a more dramatic eye. Natural look girls bypass this one. Or if you want a cheaper but really awesome quick to use mascara, try L&#x27;Oreal Carbon Black.</li>
            <li> Product will certainly make your lashes stand out more.... but beware of how difficult it can be to get off!</li>
            <li> I have looked my entire adult life for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; mascara.  I was a little hesitant on ordering this one from the look of the wand...but, well, I ordered.  It is amazing.  AMAZING...it took a couple of times to get used to the wand, and to learn how to perfect it, but now, I would never go back to any other kind.  I find the mascara to be very stable.  I live in a very humid climate, and no drips, or smudges.  I love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> The formula may be decent, but the applicator wand is awful. It takes forever to apply mascara using this weird ball-shaped wand. I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> had this product before. love it</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this mascara when having my makeup professionally applied.  At first, I was skeptical of the mascara brush because it looked very intimidating to me.  However, once I saw how the makeup artist applied the mascara I was impressed.  The tip really does make application much more precise, which is great for getting the lashes in the corner of your eyes without over-applying in other areas and making things clumpy.  It did take a little practice before I felt like I was taking advantage of the full potential of the wand, but it wasn&#x27;t long before I felt like I was using it successfully.  (And I say that as someone who would NOT describe herself as being particularly skilled at makeup, so I don&#x27;t believe this is only for someone who is more experienced.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike about this mascara, and why I am giving it 4-stars vs. 5-stars is that I don&#x27;t think the mascara liquid itself is as good as other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  It seems to dry out quickly and it seems like I don&#x27;t get quite as many wears out of it as I do other brands of mascara.  I can tell when it is getting old because it starts to get a little clumpier and doesn&#x27;t coat my lashes quite as well, even if I clean off the brush.  So sometimes I find myself cheating and using this wand in other brands of mascara if I can get it to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to experiment with different kinds of brushes [[ASIN:B00DIFC53Y eyeko MASCARA WARDROBE - 1 MASCARA, 3 BRUSHES - DEFINE CURL VOLUME]] is also interesting because it is one tube of mascara that comes with three different kinds of brushes, each meant to achieve a different look.  There isn&#x27;t an identical brush to this one from Givenchy, though the brush meant for curling is close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I find the brush on this mascara to easily be 5-stars, though the liquid itself is 3-stars for me.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS MASCARA AS IT COVERS EVERY LASH.  THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH IT IS THAT IT SMUDGES A BIT, DOES&#x27;NT DRY VERY FAST.  I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT THOUGH AS IT COVERS ALL MY LASHES AND MAKES MY EYES LOOK BIGGER.</li>
            <li> This mascara is wonderful! It makes my lashes so, so beautiful and almost makes them look fake. It&#x27;s better for this mascara to be part of your arsenal of mascaras and not the only one as it may not be practical for everyday use. It&#x27;s a good mascara for going out at night.</li>
            <li> the product arrives beautifully packaged recommend it!</li>
            <li> The little round ball brush is what initially attracted me to this product.  I have rather skimpy eyelashes and I thought this mascara might help them look more full.  I was wrong; it is no different than an $8.00 drugstore product.  In addition, the fact that this mascara drips down my face at the first hint of humidity makes the high price even more insulting.  Save your money. This product is definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have very few eyelashes . This mascara makes it look like I have a lot . love this product .</li>
            <li> Best mascara/brush ever!!  A bit hard to find tho. This brush works great on your lower lashes!!</li>
            <li> I went to Barney&#x27;s for a facial and when they put this mascara on my eyelashes I felt as if they were brushing my hair. It just made my lashes flow outward. When I looked into the mirror I could not believe the lashes were on my face. I brought the mascara and not the rest of the products. I love the wand it is the best. I will never go back to the other wands the mascara is costly but to me it is worth it. I am very happy with it. I have mastered it to the point my daughter asks me if I have on mascara. It is not on heavy I put it on light and  I  just love the way it pulls out the lashes.</li>
            <li> As a product junkie there is not a mascara I haven&#x27;t tried I don&#x27;t think. Cheap or expensive I have most likley given it a worl. Lashes are so important because they can make your whole face pop. Givenchy was mentioned in a famous makeup artists, Wayne Goss, youtube blog. I ordered the mascara and was not disappointed! The wand makes every little tiny lash excessable bringing it out. There has been no flaking and it lasts until removed which is another&#x27;s benifit.... it comes right off with little effort. My lashes are full long and feathery without clumps. Simple amazing. My mascara hunt is over!</li>
            <li> this mascara is amazing. The applicator is so easy to use and perfectly separates lashes. The round tip makes application simple and clean.</li>
            <li> Hard to find mascara.  Use daily. Great to use on hard to reach lashes. A bit pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li> This mascara DID make my lashes look GREAT... but my eyes only looked good for an hour or 2.  Then black/grey smudges started forming underneath.  The mascara was coming off!  In retrospect maybe I should have gotten waterproof, but the Clinique mascara I was using previously wasn&#x27;t waterproof and this didn&#x27;t happen.  I hadn&#x27;t used any oils or cremes on my eyes in 24 hours so I think it&#x27;s just the oiliness of my skin or maybe the length of my lashes that caused the problem.  But this didn&#x27;t happen previously so if I can find the receipt it&#x27;s going back to Sephora.  If you have dry skin I might recommend this product but if not get waterproof or another brand.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  You have to get used to the brush but it give you way more control than any other brush out there, huge lashes and it washed off easily.&lt;br /&gt;There is also NO SCENT.  I don&#x27;t have any idea why some mascaras are scented, that needs to stop.  This is NOT - thank cuss!</li>
            <li> Great !!! Gives a volume and separate each lash from another.</li>
            <li> Great Service, arrived at time, just what I put in my order, good packing, and good price, thanks for this.</li>
            <li> Product was old dried out not any good have used this prcduct many times from sephora was very pleased this was a rip off</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear mascara therefore I&#x27;m terrible at putting it on - usually smear it.  I love this method for applying so easy and allows for spot areas and no smearing.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Great product, I love the way the little brush gets to the area on my outside of eyelid, and it is so easy to use. The color works great, black is black I guess, but it is not too dark. I am very happy with this product.</li>
