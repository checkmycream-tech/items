    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>But the whish product is the best I have used.  </li>
            <li>When I found out about waxing, it was the greatest discovery for me.</li>
            <li>Excellent price.</li>
            <li>Awesome seller</li>
            <li>Wonderful product that works!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>It smells great and the results are great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This works great for alleviating and preventing ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>A great way to soothe skin and keep ingrown hairs at bay post wax.</li>
            <li>good stuff</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good band-aid for my bikini area, before I go through laser hair removal.</li>
            <li>so perhaps that is why I do not feel a great love for the product.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice bottle and has a nice smell and texture, but don&#x27;t notice any difference after using it.</li>
            <li>I have had a significant reduction in ingrown hairs after shaving and am happy with the product</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, fair skin with a ruddy complexion, so any kind of irritation shows up as bright as a stop sign.  </li>
            <li>This product has worked wonders for me, and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>After one day most of redness gone.</li>
            <li>my skin felt way better than before.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work</li>
            <li>I was much better using alcohol and then a lotion.</li>
            <li>I have used most of this up.  </li>
            <li>It was better then Tend Skin</li>
            <li>Found it here on Amazon for better price than my spa stocks it at.</li>
            <li>My bikini area has never looked better.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a magical product that you see a difference after one use</li>
            <li>I feel it is better than</li>
            <li>just ok</li>
            <li>However the skin around the affected area was healthy after using it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that does as of yet.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite serum, but good, fast service</li>
            <li>and it was very cool and soothing.</li>
            <li>But if it didn&#x27;t accomplish any of its purpose, am I really justified in giving it more than 1 star?</li>
            <li>You have to stick with it, and use it consistently, but i&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li>To quote the wifey, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay, not the greatest&amp;#34; so take that for what it is worth.</li>
            <li>I applied this light oil.</li>
            <li>Also, cheap packaging.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find this to be very effective but possibly it&#x27;s a cumulative thing.</li>
            <li>Significant improvement.</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>and I must say this product is truly worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It particularly reduced the redness which is where i have the most problems.  </li>
            <li>A quick application of the serum afterward prevents any ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be better then the older products like Princereigns Ingrown Hair Serum or Tend Skin.</li>
            <li>Compared to the other products that I&#x27;ve tried over the years, it&#x27;s been the most effective.  </li>
            <li>Quick, easy, drys fast, no smell.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re also getting your money&#x27;s worth, I believe.  </li>
            <li>Its worth it.</li>
            <li>I was sure that this would prove to be effective only on fine or sparse hairs, and would leave me unaffected.</li>
            <li>I use it for my bikini area just once a day, right after I shave and get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very satisfied and at least for me it is MUCH better than Tend.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to apply very much of it either.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, especially the neck area, which makes shaving troublesome; other products sting, but Flawless is very gentle and soothing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had better results by just using anti-perspirant solid over the area.</li>
            <li>I needed something that would take care of the ingrown hairs I already have, and I think this product is more for preventing future ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really scented, which is quite nice.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>This is the first ingrown hair serum I&#x27;ve purchased, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of others to compare it to.</li>
            <li>Does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li>I shaved and sure enough it was starting to itch and be irritated very quickly.</li>
            <li>This products has a positive review from me.</li>
            <li>My skin gets red and bumpy from the irritation and applying this heals my skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and have struggled forever with finding a product to sooth my skin after shaving.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Would give 5 stars but the bumps dont go away as fast as i would like them to.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wax as much when using this product and it was gentle, non greasy on the skin.</li>
            <li>I did not see any difference between using this product and just straight shaving with no serum.</li>
            <li>I may not have used any other products to which I can compare it, but I&#x27;m okay with that as I fully intend to re-order this when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>Big improvement right away!</li>
            <li>On average 2-3 days is the time span i was thinking more like overnight.</li>
            <li>Bikini Zone brand is better and half the price.</li>
            <li>THIS DID WORK, BUT WITCH HAZEL IS MAIN INGREDIANT, SO JUST BUY A BOTTLE OF IT</li>
            <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as quickly and prevents ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>I also have NO razor burn or red bumps, and my legs are smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Strong enough to work but gentle enough to use anywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week, and my bikini bumps are already sooo much better.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had a little bit more of a scent</li>
            <li>For example, Bikini Zone worked well, but it needed to be applied at least twice a day to stay effective.  </li>
            <li>it worked where many other approaches had fallen short.</li>
            <li>Okay, not outstanding.</li>
            <li>I find that shaving made my hair grow thicker and I frequently got ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I am a 27 year old woman.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it completely eliminates them, but it does help.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>wow, what a difference it makes when I use it vs.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and tend to get razor bumps or irritation when I shave.</li>
            <li>Works good no residue left behind.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long ways and lasts me for about a month or more per bottle.</li>
            <li>Its fabulous, has cut down immensely on my ingrown hairs (if not eliminated them completely), and has made shaving manageable.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because I have a major problem with ingrown hairs on my bikini line.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this product, I had done a lot of research and tried several different techniques to get rid of bikini-zone irritation: using only fresh razor blades, not pressing against my skin, using mineral oil, etc.  </li>
            <li>I ended up giving it away to my ten year old niece to play with, along with her play shaving set.</li>
            <li>I try to use it at least every other day, and one pump is more than enough product.</li>
            <li>Although the container seems very small, at the rate at which I&#x27;ve been using it, I expect this single bottle to last at least 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After 6 months of use, I&#x27;m still loving this ingrown hair serum!</li>

            <li> But I still get ingrowns they don&#x27;t seem to last as long as before</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a lot in the bottle and it doesn&#x27;t last very long if you use it as directed.</li>
            <li> , I thought this product smelled really nice, didn&#x27;t leave any gross residue, and didn&#x27;t have bad side effects. ...</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> but it seemed to be Princereigns but more expensive with less product.</li>
            <li> But I do know this product resolved some long standing problem spots for me after just two uses!</li>
            <li> I bought this product out of the blue after looking at other options for eliminating ingrown hair...</li>
            <li> After a few days of daily use, I see that it definitely helps to exfoliate and allow the hairs to come through the skin.  </li>
            <li> When I use this serum it calms everything down almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I was using Tend for a LONG time which works, but only a little.</li>
            <li> I repeat this routine for at least 2 to 3 days after shaving and the results are completely clear skin, never to see an ingrown hair again.</li>
            <li> It works, the few times I applied it, it actually reduced the discoloration and bumps on my skin.</li>
            <li> I had to use it several times for it to work, so for me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My hubbys military</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> I only have to use a small amount (about one squirt from the bottle)</li>
            <li> Not sure if this stuff actually works all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure there is any product that would work instantly (if there is I haven&#x27;t found it).  </li>
            <li> The consistency of it is very similar to that of a thick baby oil, and does not soak up immediately.</li>
            <li> Basically this product seems to be watered down hair gel.</li>
            <li> I bought this based off the reviews and alternate reviews I saw in a magazine, however it is too expensive for the size, and I switched to Aloe with the same results (cheaper alternative) -</li>
            <li> It does keep hairs from getting ingrown but also keeps your panties stuck firmly to your bikini line.</li>
            <li> Just ended up being another wasted product that sat on my shelf until spring cleaning when I decided to trash it.</li>
            <li> That being said, it has seemed to help me avoid ingrown hairs, as well as reduce the couple dark spots that have shown up over the past couple years.</li>
            <li> Just went on a week-long vacation to the beach, and stupidly left this behind....</li>
            <li> Waste of 20$.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this based off the reviews and alternate reviews I saw in a magazine, however it is too expensive for the size, and I switched to Aloe with the same results (cheaper alternative) -</li>
            <li> No more burning or rash! good stuff</li>
            <li> I have used both tend skin and prince reigns - both of which work.  But the whish product is the best I have used.  It smells great and the results are great.  It particularly reduced the redness which is where i have the most problems.  i would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product has worked wonders for me, and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  I use it for my bikini area just once a day, right after I shave and get out of the shower.  It gets rid of current irritation, and it keeps bumps from coming back later on in the day.    Prior to using this product, I had done a lot of research and tried several different techniques to get rid of bikini-zone irritation: using only fresh razor blades, not pressing against my skin, using mineral oil, etc.  The truth is, if I want ALL the hair gone, I need go over spots several times in multiple directions, and that creates irritation.  But this serum combats that.    You&#x27;re also getting your money&#x27;s worth, I believe.  I only have to use a small amount (about one squirt from the bottle) once a day.    I&#x27;d tried several different balms before.  For example, Bikini Zone worked well, but it needed to be applied at least twice a day to stay effective.  I have very sensitive, fair skin with a ruddy complexion, so any kind of irritation shows up as bright as a stop sign.  I was amazed this product worked so well because I have used other Derma Doctor products before (KP Duty) with very poor results.  I believe the company has struck gold with this product, though.  I&#x27;d suggest trying it: it worked where many other approaches had fallen short.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week, and my bikini bumps are already sooo much better. I wax and started getting ingrowns recently; I exfoliated, used Tend Skin, and I would still get some stubborn ingrowns and nothing worked. I tried this, and I have to say, so far I&#x27;m impressed. Significant improvement. Can&#x27;t wait to see how it keeps working.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this stuff actually works all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had better results by just using anti-perspirant solid over the area.</li>
            <li> I am a dark-skinned female and this product worked like a charm for my ingrown hairs. I used it twice a day after each shower. I wax occasionally under my arms and my bikini area. I don&#x27;t shave and haven&#x27;t done so in almost 8 years. I find that shaving made my hair grow thicker and I frequently got ingrown hairs. When I found out about waxing, it was the greatest discovery for me. Waxing reduced my ingrown hairs but using this product eliminated my ingrown hairs altogether.</li>
            <li> THIS DID WORK, BUT WITCH HAZEL IS MAIN INGREDIANT, SO JUST BUY A BOTTLE OF IT FOR 3RD OF PRICE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, but I didn&#x27;t think this worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly doesn&#x27;t work if you already have ingrowns.  i wouldn&#x27;t buy it if you were expect it to resolve any ingrown problems.</li>
            <li> I am a 27 year old woman. Whish is the only thing that can prevent my ingrown hairs. My routine is to soften the hair by soaking in the tub, then shave using a multibladed razor and conditioner instead of shaving cream. A quick application of the serum afterward prevents any ingrown hairs. Quick, easy, drys fast, no smell.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other products that I&#x27;ve tried over the years, it&#x27;s been the most effective.  My skin is very sensitive, especially the neck area, which makes shaving troublesome; other products sting, but Flawless is very gentle and soothing.  I like the results, but I hope they make the product bigger.</li>
            <li> I was using Tend for a LONG time which works, but only a little. Got frustrated with it not doing enough so I opted to try this instead. Big improvement right away! After one day most of redness gone. I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5, because it is not a miracle worker but I&#x27;m very satisfied and at least for me it is MUCH better than Tend.</li>
            <li> I used the noxima bikini razors (disposable) followed by this gel. I did NOT have ANY bumps or irritation whatsoever. I usually (without treatment) get bumps within an hour. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite serum, but good, fast service</li>
            <li> This does help with ingrown hairs and red bumps. I wouldn&#x27;t say it completely eliminates them, but it does help. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I have a major problem with ingrown hairs on my bikini line. This has not worked to prevent them at all. It does take away some of the itch that I get the day of and after shaving. But I still get ingrowns they don&#x27;t seem to last as long as before but I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works good no residue left behind. Would give 5 stars but the bumps dont go away as fast as i would like them to. On average 2-3 days is the time span i was thinking more like overnight. But overall would purchase again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this to be very effective but possibly it&#x27;s a cumulative thing. Will revisit when I&#x27;ve used up the bottle.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would take care of the ingrown hairs I already have, and I think this product is more for preventing future ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Great product. Excellent price. Awesome seller</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice bottle and has a nice smell and texture, but don&#x27;t notice any difference after using it.</li>
            <li> It works, the few times I applied it, it actually reduced the discoloration and bumps on my skin. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> To quote the wifey, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay, not the greatest&amp;#34; so take that for what it is worth. She wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it, but it did work.</li>
            <li> This products has a positive review from me. I have the problem of having rashes on my inner thighs when I  shave. Once I  put the product, it smoothed my skin and within 5-10mins my skin felt way better than before.</li>
            <li> This works great for alleviating and preventing ingrown hairs.  I use this all the time after shaving or waxing.  It&#x27;s not really scented, which is quite nice.  A little goes a long ways and lasts me for about a month or more per bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this so much! I have extremely sensitive skin and I just started waxing. My skin gets red and bumpy from the irritation and applying this heals my skin very quickly. I will definitely not go without this ever again. You don&#x27;t need to apply very much of it either.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wax as much when using this product and it was gentle, non greasy on the skin. I didn&#x27;t experience any break outs and I used this daily.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work and it is definitely not perfect but is much, much better than others that I&#x27;ve tried.  I have had a significant reduction in ingrown hairs after shaving and am happy with the product</li>
            <li> Literally no difference in my skin. I have yet to find a product that actually helps ingrown hairs or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, I thought this product smelled really nice, didn&#x27;t leave any gross residue, and didn&#x27;t have bad side effects. ...But if it didn&#x27;t accomplish any of its purpose, am I really justified in giving it more than 1 star?</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if this serum will prevent ingrown hairs. But I do know this product resolved some long standing problem spots for me after just two uses!</li>
            <li> I bought this product out of the blue after looking at other options for eliminating ingrown hair...and I must say this product is truly worth every penny! Soon after I shaved my under arms and bikini area I applied this light oil. Once it dries it leaves the skin so subtle!  I repeat this routine for at least 2 to 3 days after shaving and the results are completely clear skin, never to see an ingrown hair again. I endorse this product 100%!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a WOC with a lot of body hair prone to in growing. I was sure that this would prove to be effective only on fine or sparse hairs, and would leave me unaffected. Not so!! Its fabulous, has cut down immensely on my ingrown hairs (if not eliminated them completely), and has made shaving manageable. I&#x27;ll be using it regularly.</li>
            <li> It did nto help me.  I had to use it several times for it to work, so for me it was a waste of money. I found out I was much better using alcohol and then a lotion.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference between using this product and just straight shaving with no serum. Perhaps it works for straight-haired people.  I&#x27;d give it no stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the point and really expensive.  I hate shaving and this was no help</li>
            <li> There is not a lot of product.  I have used most of this up.  I see only a litte help with ingrowns.  Okay, not outstanding.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!  The hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as quickly and prevents ingrown hairs.  I also have NO razor burn or red bumps, and my legs are smooth and soft.  This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that works! Buy it!!</li>
            <li> Basically this product seems to be watered down hair gel. Sticky and stinky. It does keep hairs from getting ingrown but also keeps your panties stuck firmly to your bikini line. Save the money and go get a wax. Also, cheap packaging. The pump broke off and exploded all over my shower caddy EVEN WITH THE LID ON.</li>
            <li> My friend told me that where ever I remove hair on my face bumps would come but this keeps them away and I keep a supply around because I never know when I&#x27;m going to need it.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be better then the older products like Princereigns Ingrown Hair Serum or Tend Skin. It was better then Tend Skin but it seemed to be Princereigns but more expensive with less product. Shame on them</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money again. There isn&#x27;t a lot in the bottle and it doesn&#x27;t last very long if you use it as directed. Bikini Zone brand is better and half the price.</li>
            <li> this is the only product that has worked for me against red bumps and irritation. i will definitely buy this product again</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for months..Found it here on Amazon for better price than my spa stocks it at. A great way to soothe skin and keep ingrown hairs at bay post wax.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re about to start shaving/waxing &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas, you need this. I shaved and sure enough it was starting to itch and be irritated very quickly. As soon as I hopped out the shower, I used this and it was very cool and soothing. So bumps or redness the next morning! Buy this! Its worth it. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have tried every serum out there and still haven&#x27;t found one that works.  I saw no difference and I followed the directions religiously.  Just ended up being another wasted product that sat on my shelf until spring cleaning when I decided to trash it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! You have to stick with it, and use it consistently, but i&#x27;m pretty happy with the results. It&#x27;s a good band-aid for my bikini area, before I go through laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> The product works as described. My bikini area has never looked better. I just wish it had a little bit more of a scent</li>
            <li> This is the first ingrown hair serum I&#x27;ve purchased, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of others to compare it to. That being said, it has seemed to help me avoid ingrown hairs, as well as reduce the couple dark spots that have shown up over the past couple years. I only use it on my bikini line area, and I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 3 months. I try to use it at least every other day, and one pump is more than enough product. Although the container seems very small, at the rate at which I&#x27;ve been using it, I expect this single bottle to last at least 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After 6 months of use, I&#x27;m still loving this ingrown hair serum! Just went on a week-long vacation to the beach, and stupidly left this behind.... wow, what a difference it makes when I use it vs. not! I may not have used any other products to which I can compare it, but I&#x27;m okay with that as I fully intend to re-order this when it&#x27;s gone. I still have about 1/5 bottle remaining.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn and definitely soothes the skin.  After a few days of daily use, I see that it definitely helps to exfoliate and allow the hairs to come through the skin.  It is a lightweight serum too.  It isn&#x27;t a magical product that you see a difference after one use but I&#x27;m not sure there is any product that would work instantly (if there is I haven&#x27;t found it).  I feel it is better than just ok but since I can&#x27;t give it 3.5 stars, I rounded up to 4 as I know a lot of people that rave about it. Everyone&#x27;s skin and body is different so perhaps that is why I do not feel a great love for the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have really sensitive skin and tend to get razor bumps or irritation when I shave. When I use this serum it calms everything down almost instantly. I use it on my bikini area, back of legs, and underarms. A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything to my skin. I saw no improvements. Waste of 20$.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff when I used to get waxed but now I use it when I shave. My hubbys military so he shaves everyday sometimes he gets irritated and this stuff soothes as well as fixes the ingrowns. Strong enough to work but gentle enough to use anywhere.</li>
            <li> I saw this in a catalog and decided to try it on my legs after shaving. I have super sensitive skin and have struggled forever with finding a product to sooth my skin after shaving. Unfortunately, this product did not help me either. The only thing that the serum did was leave an oily feeling on my skin. It did not prevent me from having any ingrown hairs after shaving, nor did it keep me from having razor burn. It was like applying oil to a razor burn that came anyway. The consistency of it is very similar to that of a thick baby oil, and does not soak up immediately. Therefore, it got on my clothes and became quite messy. I ended up giving it away to my ten year old niece to play with, along with her play shaving set.</li>
            <li> Does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive for the size and does not work at all. It was a complete waste of time and money. I will look for another product and I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because of ingrown and it doesn&#x27;t deliver the results. However the skin around the affected area was healthy after using it.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that does as of yet. Oh well.</li>
