            <li>br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t impressed to say the least.instructions need to be longer than that two page pamphlet.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a teeth whitening product on the internet as it&#x27;s great for the price.  </li>
            <li>I will be happy to recommend this kit to anyone looking for a good teeth whitener kit at home.</li>
            <li>this stuff is great and easy to use!!</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>All that was good about the kit was he could save the form that you have to put in scalding water, then put it in your mouth, to make some sort of tooth mold to hold the bleach; so, you could purchase a bleach somewhere else to make a difference in the whitening of his teeth.</li>
            <li>Good choice.</li>
            <li>and I see an amazing difference already.</li>
            <li>but I did not have to use them as I have my own trays made</li>
            <li>According to my dentist, carbamide peroxide is an excellent at home product for teeth whitening and this kit has the right strength to keep my teeth and gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>SUPER happy with this.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS VERY STRONG.</li>
            <li>I have better results with this stuff in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars based on the fact that it arrived 2 days after I thought it was supposed to arrive, but the gel in the syringes is by far the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>THIS KIT COMES WITH A LOT FOR THE MONEY, VERY EASY TO USE, EVEN VITAMIN E SWABS FOR YOUR TEETH TO KEEP THEM HEALTHY AND PREVENT SCENSATIVITY.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DENY THE DIFFERENCE.</li>
            <li>One tip I will give, boil the teeth guards 2 times because the mold comes out much better :)</li>
            <li>and I was ok.</li>
            <li>forming is super important!</li>
            <li>The results are quick!</li>
            <li>THE LIGHT IS AWSOME.</li>
            <li>Although this kit may look impressive at first glance, it&#x27;s really not much.</li>
            <li>There is a bonus teeth whitening pen included with the order which was cool.  </li>
            <li>As I would expect from buying on Amazon, my package arrived very quickly in just a few days and was packaged very nicely.  </li>
            <li>and I have a bright white smile in every pic!(I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to keep using the product to see how much my teeth change!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I had very low expectations when buying this kit.</li>
            <li>It does kind of tingle and feel strange if it leaks out onto your gums (and will change them colors, but that goes away too)</li>
            <li>The instructions are ok, they could be a little more detailed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As always, thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Frankly, I already had healthy white teeth</li>
            <li>I have used this product, exactly as directed, 4 times and have not seen any results whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>first time I tried the gel, it was just for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to use haha.</li>
            <li>I learned the less gel the better!</li>
            <li>and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone else.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Anyone can figure out how to mold the trays and how to use the peroxide gel but the instructions that came with mine say absolutely nothing about the included swabs.</li>
            <li>and I really doubt that it does anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of times to get the mouth pieces to fit to my teeth properly.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>received the package super fast last week.</li>
            <li>Second time, I went for a full 15 minute session, my teeth were 2 shades whiter.  </li>
            <li>on my wedding day I whitened them right before I left for the church</li>
            <li>What I can tell you, those trays are messy no matter how much you trim them for a custom fit.</li>
            <li>and it also made my teeth very sensitive to heat/cold.  </li>
            <li>The first two days I only used the product once a day</li>
            <li>They are marked as having vitamin E</li>
            <li>I did not feel sensitivity so far</li>
            <li>a side note, the trays can take a few tries to mold right and comfortable to your mouth.  </li>
            <li>The included UV light is the same one that other kits has</li>
            <li>That is not long enough, keep it under the water until it&#x27;s completely limp (it will not form together like instructions say) it just gets more mushy...and then will form a lot easier to your teeth.</li>
            <li>It is not very easy to mold them right</li>
            <li>Used this as described and barely saw any change in my teeth.</li>
            <li>So far, I only used it twice</li>
            <li>I do drink coffee a couple times a week but usually give my teeth a quick brush after I&#x27;m done drinking it.</li>

            <li> And the pen seems to last a long time.</li>

            <li> You just have to read the directions carefully.</li>

            <li> The trays are not worth a million bucks, but I guess they are alright.</li>
            <li> , I like that my teeth got whiter but the cost to my mouth was not worth it.</li>
            <li> As if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, the battery powered light shocked me twice on the fourth (and</li>

            <li> Not that I am an expert on teeth whitening, but I have tried a few products.</li>
            <li> I used it longer than it said, no pain or problems, the little vitamin sticks helped with the few cold sensitive spots and my teeth whitened a lot in 3 sessions!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is because I use the night pen a couple times a week</li>
            <li> They usually either shock my teeth or do nothing to remove the stains.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the pen has done a ton to whiten my teeth because the syringes have noticeably whitened them, but I still use it before bed when I remember and usually after I eat when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing to sit with this stuff in your mouth for an hour at a time, only to have no whitening take place.  </li>

            <li> Good but didnt work as expected</li>
            <li> This will be a very short review because I have to be somewhere in a few minutes.  Although this kit may look impressive at first glance, it&#x27;s really not much. I used it as directed and I&#x27;m not sure that I see any difference at all.  Also, the directions are very poor. Anyone can figure out how to mold the trays and how to use the peroxide gel but the instructions that came with mine say absolutely nothing about the included swabs. They are marked as having vitamin E but they are completely dry and I can&#x27;t detect that anything is on them.  Again, the directions say nothing at all about what you are supposed to do with them.  The included UV light is the same one that other kits has and I really doubt that it does anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone else.</li>
            <li> Used this as described and barely saw any change in my teeth. For the price you would think it would have worked very disappointed in this product total waste&lt;br /&gt; of money</li>
            <li> No change in the color of my teeth. Waste of money. I&#x27;ve been following all the instructions and it has no effect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the product, it&#x27;s me. I received this kit almost a month ago and only used it twice. What I can tell you, those trays are messy no matter how much you trim them for a custom fit.</li>
            <li> As I would expect from buying on Amazon, my package arrived very quickly in just a few days and was packaged very nicely.  There is a bonus teeth whitening pen included with the order which was cool.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a teeth whitening product on the internet as it&#x27;s great for the price.  As always, thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband. Didn&#x27;t make a difference to his teeth. All that was good about the kit was he could save the form that you have to put in scalding water, then put it in your mouth, to make some sort of tooth mold to hold the bleach; so, you could purchase a bleach somewhere else to make a difference in the whitening of his teeth. wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> I used this kit to prepare for my wedding I didn&#x27;t follow the directions, I spaced out my whitening over a few months and the gradually got whiter. on my wedding day I whitened them right before I left for the church and I have a bright white smile in every pic!(I also used colgate optic white toothpaste and mouthwash the entire time except after I whitened I used sensodyne)</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of times to get the mouth pieces to fit to my teeth properly. It says to only hold them under water for 7ish seconds. That is not long enough, keep it under the water until it&#x27;s completely limp (it will not form together like instructions say) it just gets more mushy...and then will form a lot easier to your teeth. but yes, suck suck sucking the air our of the trays while it&#x27;s in your mouth forming is super important! I practiced ahead of time and that helped a lot. I learned the less gel the better! It does kind of tingle and feel strange if it leaks out onto your gums (and will change them colors, but that goes away too) I used it longer than it said, no pain or problems, the little vitamin sticks helped with the few cold sensitive spots and my teeth whitened a lot in 3 sessions! SUPER happy with this. I love it.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great and easy to use!!</li>
            <li> I have researched teeth whiteners for a few weeks before I pulled the trigger on this one. It turns out that we can get pro strength whiteners online.  I decided to try this kit because it has everything included.  I like the fact that this is sold by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I received the package super fast last week. So far, I only used it twice and I see an amazing difference already. Frankly, I already had healthy white teeth but my teeth got even whiter. I did not feel sensitivity so far and there is zero burn on my gums. It does give me some minor zingers but no big deal.  The trays are not worth a million bucks, but I guess they are alright. You just have to read the directions carefully. It is not very easy to mold them right but you can always start over. Good choice.</li>
            <li> THIS KIT COMES WITH A LOT FOR THE MONEY, VERY EASY TO USE, EVEN VITAMIN E SWABS FOR YOUR TEETH TO KEEP THEM HEALTHY AND PREVENT SCENSATIVITY. THE LIGHT IS AWSOME. IF YOU USE IT 15 MIN...3 DAYS IN A ROW YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DENY THE DIFFERENCE.</li>
            <li> I have used this product, exactly as directed, 4 times and have not seen any results whatsoever.  Very disappointing to sit with this stuff in your mouth for an hour at a time, only to have no whitening take place.  As if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, the battery powered light shocked me twice on the fourth (and last) time I used it.  A complete waste of money and time.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to try another brand if I want to see whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> It does not evenly whiten your teeth</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like it says&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t impressed to say the least.instructions need to be longer than that two page pamphlet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I had very low expectations when buying this kit. I&#x27;ve been whitening my teeth for years at the dentist using zoom. I usually spend on the LOW end $300 each time I do it. A friend of mine also purchased this kit and recommended it to me, and after about a week and a half of using the mouth pieces and gel(and pen before bed), my teeth were just as white as when I get them professionally whitened. And I even missed 2 days! I was extremely surprised to say the least. I definitely recommend this product, especially for the price! One tip I will give, boil the teeth guards 2 times because the mold comes out much better :)</li>
            <li> This kit was given to me by my dentist as an aftercare package.  According to my dentist, carbamide peroxide is an excellent at home product for teeth whitening and this kit has the right strength to keep my teeth and gums healthy.  But he warned me about keeping the gel away from my gums, as it may hurt. I am keeping the syringes in the refrigerator so as to increase their life time.  The kit comes with trays but I did not have to use them as I have my own trays made earlier.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried the gel, it was just for 2 minutes. It did not hurt but did not whiten either. Second time, I went for a full 15 minute session, my teeth were 2 shades whiter.  I am going to wait a few days for my next session but I know it will work. There is probably enough gel for 6 months. I will be happy to recommend this kit to anyone looking for a good teeth whitener kit at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using crest white strips the past few years which work pretty well but I notice with them that my teeth only stay white a couple weeks after stopping. I do drink coffee a couple times a week but usually give my teeth a quick brush after I&#x27;m done drinking it. I used this kit the recommended 2 weeks and that cycle ended about 3 weeks ago. My teeth are still white. I&#x27;m not sure if it is because I use the night pen a couple times a week but I really like it. And the pen seems to last a long time. I recommend this product and will be having my fiance use it next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars based on the fact that it arrived 2 days after I thought it was supposed to arrive, but the gel in the syringes is by far the best I have ever tried. Not that I am an expert on teeth whitening, but I have tried a few products. They usually either shock my teeth or do nothing to remove the stains.  I&#x27;m not sure if the pen has done a ton to whiten my teeth because the syringes have noticeably whitened them, but I still use it before bed when I remember and usually after I eat when I&#x27;m out. It&#x27;s fun to use haha.</li>
            <li> I used this product for three days. The first two days I only used the product once a day and I was ok. On the third day I used it twice, just happened to have enough time that day to do it twice. On my second time of the day my gums on one spot started to hurt a little but I left it going, it didn&#x27;t hurt to bad. Then another spot started to hurt so I took everything out of my mouth. I found two white spots that hurt really bad on my gums, one on the top one on the bottom. So I had chemical burns on my gums. THIS PRODUCT IS VERY STRONG. In the three days I used this product my teeth got a lot whiter but it also burned my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Crest whitening strips before, I found that it did work but my teeth didn&#x27;t get as white as they did with this product. Then again my gums didn&#x27;t get burned with Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the trays can take a few tries to mold right and comfortable to your mouth.  The instructions are ok, they could be a little more detailed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this product again, I like that my teeth got whiter but the cost to my mouth was not worth it.</li>
            <li> What you see here is day 1 and 2! The results are quick! Day one I only had the trays in for 2 minutes, day 2 I had the trays in for 15 min each! I&#x27;m excited to keep using the product to see how much my teeth change!</li>
