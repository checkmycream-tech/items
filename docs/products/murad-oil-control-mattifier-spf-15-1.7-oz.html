    <ol>

            <li>It is just the best product I&#x27;ve found for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
            <li>is one of the best,</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>In combination with a face primer in the morning, I am extremely happy with the product!  </li>
            <li>He looked great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome stuff - and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive/acne-prone skin!</li>
            <li>The Murad Mattifier arrived in great condition and is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>The smell and texture is not all that great</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price here</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s truly a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is great for sports.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion I have ever used...and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for almost 2 years and will continue to purchase until something better comes along!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this mattifier!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing for me</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like Elmer&#x27;s Glue.</li>
            <li>Give it a minute or two to dry/absorb and you will have a nice matte look.</li>
            <li>The SPF 15 is a really nice bonus for fair-skinned people like myself</li>
            <li>I liked the SPF</li>
            <li>I can wear just this with no make up and feel pretty great about my skin, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>but this is, by far, the BEST moisturizing mattifier I have ever bought!</li>
            <li>None of the Murad products works to help clear up my acne but their mattifier is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>this by far is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Best part, it layers beautifully with makeup and doesn&#x27;t pill, even when you apply it with a heavy hand.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast, so i was very happy with that.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>, i do not have many breakouts now</li>
            <li>Was OK.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find anything else that comes close to this</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend it to friends for sure.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it here.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many mattifiers over the years that listing them would take a phone book.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it actually works.</li>
            <li>I would give it five stars if it were a bit more moisturizing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even done yardwork and still looked pretty good considering the circumstances.</li>
            <li>This product is very good at controlling oily facial skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I was skeptic about changing mositeriser but this has been great, especially since I have exteme oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so oily I don&#x27;t think there could be a product ever available that could control it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic oil free moisturizer with sunscreen that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>This product has a unique texture, but I can work with it.  </li>
            <li>I used a sample of this product and it was fantastic, had to buy a full size - works wonders under makeup when you have oily skin</li>
            <li>However, in the evening I use a rich face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I noticed a significant difference</li>
            <li>Keeps my pores clean ...</li>
            <li>so this stuff is AMAZING for being able to go twice as long.</li>
            <li>I am loving this product so far</li>
            <li>but I guess the saying is true, you get what you pay for,</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I use it as my daily morning moisturizer and feel great that I am able to finally incorporate SPF into my routine.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works to help control oil!!</li>
            <li>It is a little bit thicker than the one that doesn&#x27;t say Mattifier but that is what make this product great.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>BUT, as for as my normal work-day, I look fine and oil-free</li>
            <li>This product is no exception, and was so happy to be able to save a few bucks by buying through here than through the standard cosmetic store.</li>
            <li>I not only love Murad products</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>and it always does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>It retails for about $10 more in my local stores.</li>
            <li>But this mattifier works better than any I have tried, and I have tried several.</li>
            <li>This cream is better than any SPF creams they sell in the office as long as you use it with the retinol or retina.</li>
            <li>I put nearly a fingertip full of the gunk on my finger, spread on fingertips of both hands, and blot all over my face.</li>
            <li>, it is strong enough to bother me, but I am a non-perfume-wearer as smells just bother me.</li>
            <li>but it will still leave your skin looking very oily</li>
            <li>which is all I can really ask for.</li>
            <li>Works very well with a retinol or retina.</li>
            <li>I use a 100% silica powder on days when a complete no-shine look is a must, but most days I only use this mattifier.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin and have been getting more acne as i get older.</li>
            <li>Its a decent product</li>
            <li>Also, this product lasts a pretty long time, so its worth it.</li>
            <li>And I am 56 yrs old and still battling oil &amp; large pores.  </li>
            <li>I was still shiny after about an hour, and for the price i feel like it should perform a little better.</li>
            <li>My skin still does get a little oily throughout the day but its SOOOO much better than it was before.</li>
            <li>It glides on smooth and dries pretty quick, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>For those of you without flaky dry skin I bet you could use this daily and love it.</li>
            <li>This Murad Oil Control Mattifier actually works, and works so much better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>This tube is huge, so it should last a very long time.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy on my face and my face can breath.  </li>
            <li>There is a tiny, tiny bit of shine left over, but not enough to bother most people.</li>
            <li>I have a 13yr old son who plays football, basketball, and baseball we see a dermatologist for his acne.</li>
            <li>The product performance wasnt exactly what i was expected from a respected company like Murad.</li>
            <li>I do use it over a moisturizer however because it can be hard to get makeup on if its not moist enough - it still controls oil quite well (and that&#x27;s what I was more concerned about)</li>
            <li>I pretty much stay matte all day very little shine.</li>
            <li>However, I live in Florida and after a workout or going outside, I am going to get oily!  </li>
            <li>: Doesnt cause any breakouts, feels very light on the skin, did not make the oily situation any worse, etc.., and has SPF, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>I like the other products, but this one just didnt really do as well as i felt it should have.</li>
            <li>I would actually say it prohibits oil definitely for the first few hours after application.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I like the other products, but this one just didnt really do as well as i felt it should have.</li>
            <li> I would actually say it prohibits oil definitely for the first few hours after application.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Murad for over 2 years now and my only complaint is the price, pretty pricey</li>
            <li> I have been in the makeup/skin care biz for a long time, so I&#x27;ve seen many products that fail.</li>
            <li> If I work an eight or ten hour day, I still have to blot once or twice, but that is a major improvement compared to having to blot 4-5 times a day as with other mattifiers</li>
            <li> The only times it didn&#x27;t fully work are when I blotted my face with a wet paper towel in the middle of the day because I was sweaty and when I tried to use with another moisturizer, that nixed all oil-banishing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should add that 8 hours seems to just be my limit with my skin b/c every other product that claimed the same results would flop out on me by lunch time (after only 3-4 hours)</li>
            <li> but when i do they dont last long!!!</li>
            <li> only other complaint is that it is not quite moisturizing enough for me, and doesn&#x27;t really work with other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky spots and oily spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> Keeps skin dry throughout day</li>
            <li> In the winter, this will make your skin a bit dry.</li>
            <li> In the photos afterwards I could see that his face wasn&#x27;t nearly as shiny as usual.</li>
            <li> My face is extremely shiney all day long.  </li>
            <li> Not the real deal , total fake.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to control the oil t-zone on my skin; perhaps it will help other people.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin even when I layer other products (benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid gel, for example).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of any other product that would do this.</li>
            <li> The smell initially concerned me, but now I hardly notice it.</li>
            <li> The cream is actually quite thick, but you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face unoily ALL day when other moisturizers created an ice rink on my forehead!</li>
            <li> Every little bit counts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to give me the appearance that I need.</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy on the face and that&#x27;s a plus.  </li>
            <li> That said, if you have embarrassingly oily skin or you get weird shiny face by early afternoon at work, you should try this.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY OILY skin and this stuff does in fact keep me oil-less for at least 8 hours, then my skin seems to over-power</li>
            <li> It does the trick and that&#x27;s not easy to do with my skin.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> Controls oil for at least 8 hours!</li>
            <li> It is expensive for the size you get</li>
            <li> too bad</li>
            <li> my face is so oily all the time by the time 2pm comes around its horrible.</li>
            <li> I have horribly oily skin and have tried everything and nothing seem to worked.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not the real deal , total fake.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. I have extremely oily skin and have been getting more acne as i get older. This works wonders, i do not have many breakouts now but when i do they dont last long!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Keeps me with a matte finish all day--even in the summer.</li>
            <li> Great shine control! Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Was OK. My face is probably just too oily for anything to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I not only love Murad products but this is, by far, the BEST moisturizing mattifier I have ever bought! It keeps my face unoily ALL day when other moisturizers created an ice rink on my forehead! It is expensive for the size you get but it&#x27;s definitely worth it! The cream is actually quite thick, but you don&#x27;t need a lot. I use it on my neck and face and the SPF definitely helps!</li>
            <li> Works well, but doesn&#x27;t keep me matte all day. Kind of smells like Elmer&#x27;s Glue.</li>
            <li> makes me look refreshed in the morning to take on the day. I use it everyday to give me the appearance that I need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily skin but this takes care of it and all day. I&#x27;ve even done yardwork and still looked pretty good considering the circumstances.</li>
            <li> I have semi-oily skin and face still shines even after using this product</li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far my face is so oily all the time by the time 2pm comes around its horrible. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 days and it&#x27;s amazing for me I pretty much stay matte all day very little shine. The smell and texture is not all that great but I can deal with it. It does not feel heavy on the face and that&#x27;s a plus.  I will definitely continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but totally worth it. I can wear just this with no make up and feel pretty great about my skin, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky spots and oily spots on my face.  This moisturizer is great.  It is a little bit thicker than the one that doesn&#x27;t say Mattifier but that is what make this product great.  It is not heavy on my face and my face can breath.  It has sun block in it so I don&#x27;t burn.  It is just the best product I&#x27;ve found for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have never found anything to help my oil production on my face...too bad I can&#x27;t use my face oil in a vehicle!  And I am 56 yrs old and still battling oil &amp; large pores.  This product gives me the moisture I need without the oil.  I would actually say it prohibits oil definitely for the first few hours after application.  However, I live in Florida and after a workout or going outside, I am going to get oily!  This product has a unique texture, but I can work with it.  I have been using it for almost 2 years and will continue to purchase until something better comes along!</li>
            <li> Its a decent product but it will still leave your skin looking very oily</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mattifier! Don&#x27;t worry if it goes on shiny. Give it a minute or two to dry/absorb and you will have a nice matte look. There is a tiny, tiny bit of shine left over, but not enough to bother most people. I use a 100% silica powder on days when a complete no-shine look is a must, but most days I only use this mattifier. It holds up well in the heat. I work 1/4 of my shift outside in the southern heat and humidity but I never leave work with a shiny face. The SPF 15 is a really nice bonus for fair-skinned people like myself but I do wish they would make an SPF 30 for this same product.</li>
            <li> I spend a ton of money on this every month and I don&#x27;t regret it one bit.  It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
            <li> This really works! I have a shiny t-zone and I use this every day. It doesn&#x27;t break me out either.</li>
            <li> I used a sample of this product and it was fantastic, had to buy a full size - works wonders under makeup when you have oily skin</li>
            <li> Does not seem to control the oil t-zone on my skin; perhaps it will help other people.</li>
            <li> Fantastic oil free moisturizer with sunscreen that absorbs quickly. Haven&#x27;t been able to find anything else that comes close to this</li>
            <li> The Murad Mattifier arrived in great condition and is a very good product.  This product is very good at controlling oily facial skin.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different mattifiers and Murad is one of the best,</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Decreases the oil on my face. Have been using this product for the last 6 months and no problems.</li>
            <li> None of the Murad products works to help clear up my acne but their mattifier is the best I&#x27;ve found.  I have extremely oily skin and this product isn&#x27;t sold in Canada so I&#x27;m always picking some up when I&#x27;m in the States.  If you&#x27;ve been thinking of trying it, do.  It&#x27;s a great price here (Sephora sells it for around $40) and I&#x27;d recommend it to friends for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the only SPF for the face that I have ever found that does not break me out, and, as a bonus, actually lives up to its name by controlling oil all day. I use it as my daily morning moisturizer and feel great that I am able to finally incorporate SPF into my routine.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of moisturizers and this by far is the best I&#x27;ve used. It truly works-- keeps my face moisturized but control oil in my t-zone area. If you&#x27;ve never used it, it smells and has the consistency of Elmer&#x27;s glue but it&#x27;s truly a great moisturizer. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad for over 2 years now and my only complaint is the price, pretty pricey but I guess the saying is true, you get what you pay for, b/c I&#x27;ve never had an issue with the brand and it always does exactly what it says it will. This product is no exception, and was so happy to be able to save a few bucks by buying through here than through the standard cosmetic store. I have EXTREMELY OILY skin and this stuff does in fact keep me oil-less for at least 8 hours, then my skin seems to over-power the ingredients and I start to look shiny again at hour 9 and 10. BUT, as for as my normal work-day, I look fine and oil-free which is all I can really ask for. I should add that 8 hours seems to just be my limit with my skin b/c every other product that claimed the same results would flop out on me by lunch time (after only 3-4 hours) so this stuff is AMAZING for being able to go twice as long.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin dry throughout day</li>
            <li> My face is extremely shiney all day long.  With this face lotion, it keeps it under control.  In combination with a face primer in the morning, I am extremely happy with the product!  However, in the evening I use a rich face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It WORKS. My husband used it the night he was going to an awards ceremony, where he found out he had won an award and had to go up onstage. In the photos afterwards I could see that his face wasn&#x27;t nearly as shiny as usual. He looked great!</li>
            <li> This product works well! I am so glad I found it here. It retails for about $10 more in my local stores.</li>
            <li> Have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin.  This is the best lotion I have ever used...and I have tried many.  Controls oil for at least 8 hours!</li>
            <li> As someone whose face is as greasy as a pizza within 3-4 hours of washing my face, I have tried everything to reduce my skin&#x27;s oiliness over the years. I have tried so many mattifiers over the years that listing them would take a phone book. This Murad Oil Control Mattifier actually works, and works so much better than any other product I have tried. Best part, it layers beautifully with makeup and doesn&#x27;t pill, even when you apply it with a heavy hand. If I work an eight or ten hour day, I still have to blot once or twice, but that is a major improvement compared to having to blot 4-5 times a day as with other mattifiers I have tried. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin even when I layer other products (benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid gel, for example).</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast, so i was very happy with that.  The product performance wasnt exactly what i was expected from a respected company like Murad. I like the other products, but this one just didnt really do as well as i felt it should have. I was still shiny after about an hour, and for the price i feel like it should perform a little better. Pro&#x27;s: Doesnt cause any breakouts, feels very light on the skin, did not make the oily situation any worse, etc.., and has SPF, which is always a plus. I&#x27;m gonna use it up for those reasons and price, but i wont be buying again. Bummer. :/</li>
            <li> I was skeptic about changing mositeriser but this has been great, especially since I have exteme oily skin.  I noticed a significant difference and I have recommended it to all my sisters who have similar skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so oily I don&#x27;t think there could be a product ever available that could control it. The oil comes out and has to go somewhere. But this mattifier works better than any I have tried, and I have tried several. Instead of being blot-ready after 2 hours of applying my make up, I can go almost 4 now. Every little bit counts.&lt;br /&gt;It smells a bit medicinal, but once it dries you don&#x27;t smell it anymore. A little bit goes a LONG way. This tube is huge, so it should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Did not control oil at all like the last time I bought this product.</li>
            <li> Legit. It totally works to keep oil under control and I use it in the summer. The smell initially concerned me, but now I hardly notice it. It&#x27;s awesome stuff - and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive/acne-prone skin! It glides on smooth and dries pretty quick, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Works very well with a retinol or retina. Controls oil to stop acne also has a sunscreen to help prevent burning. This is great for sports. I have a 13yr old son who plays football, basketball, and baseball we see a dermatologist for his acne. This cream is better than any SPF creams they sell in the office as long as you use it with the retinol or retina.</li>
            <li> I have horribly oily skin and have tried everything and nothing seem to worked. Tried this and now I am hooked! This is the only thing I have tried that actually controls my oily skin. My skin still does get a little oily throughout the day but its SOOOO much better than it was before. This stuff really works to help control oil!!</li>
            <li> This mattifier did not work for me.  It left a white haze and did nothing for my oiliness.  I liked the SPF so I don&#x27;t use it on workdays</li>
            <li> Keeps my pores clean ... only cleanser I&#x27;ve found that will do this without stripping my skin!</li>
            <li> Well, this actually...mattifies! I don&#x27;t like the smell, it is strong enough to bother me, but I am a non-perfume-wearer as smells just bother me. I put nearly a fingertip full of the gunk on my finger, spread on fingertips of both hands, and blot all over my face. It absorbs quickly. Best of all, it actually works. It keeps the forehead and t-zone shine at bay. The only times it didn&#x27;t fully work are when I blotted my face with a wet paper towel in the middle of the day because I was sweaty and when I tried to use with another moisturizer, that nixed all oil-banishing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other complaint is that it is not quite moisturizing enough for me, and doesn&#x27;t really work with other moisturizer. This means I can&#x27;t use it daily as some days my skin is peeling a bit from prescription acne meds and I need to use a heavier moisturizer. That said, if you have embarrassingly oily skin or you get weird shiny face by early afternoon at work, you should try this. I don&#x27;t know of any other product that would do this. I would give it five stars if it were a bit more moisturizing and I could use it daily. For those of you without flaky dry skin I bet you could use this daily and love it.</li>
            <li> In the winter, this will make your skin a bit dry.</li>
            <li> It does the trick and that&#x27;s not easy to do with my skin. I do use it over a moisturizer however because it can be hard to get makeup on if its not moist enough - it still controls oil quite well (and that&#x27;s what I was more concerned about) and I know I have the SPF on to protect my face. I have been in the makeup/skin care biz for a long time, so I&#x27;ve seen many products that fail. Murad always knows what its doing and it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg for once. Also, this product lasts a pretty long time, so its worth it.</li>
            <li> No good. Does not stop my oily face. Waste of my money</li>
