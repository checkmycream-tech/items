            <li>A very good sized one, you may easily carry everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works great for my morning shaves, and is very smooth on my face and leaves no razor bumps.</li>
            <li>price is very ok for it&#x27;s value.</li>
            <li>Not the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, but effective, reliable, inexpensive, and can be used before coffee has banished the haze from your mind without risk of slitting your jugular.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a quick shave and doesn&#x27;t cut my skin like a blade razor.</li>
            <li>Very easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>This is an ok razor for a cordless.</li>
            <li>This was such an excellent gift to my boyfriend for his birthday.</li>
            <li>For under $20 I don&#x27;t think it get much better than this guy here.</li>
            <li>but I think I could get one better.</li>
            <li>Better in almost every way than anything else I&#x27;ve used in this price bracket.</li>
            <li>It shaves pretty good</li>
            <li>I find it far more pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>Working fine</li>
            <li>This little guy is perfect for shaving my arms every day.</li>
            <li>This shaver is no longer available, but there is a newer model (that I have not tried yet):</li>
            <li>Works great with shaving cream or just plain old soap and water if you&#x27;re cheap lol.</li>
            <li>This shaver delivers a good shave for an extraordinarily low price.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be much happier with a better quality razor.</li>
            <li>For the $15 I paid for it, brilliant, and it is pleasant to have a small quiet &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; shaver.</li>
            <li>charges quickly and gets the job done with no irritation .</li>
            <li>Very easy to hold, easy to clean and charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to find a razor of this type that only has 2 blades.  </li>
            <li>Will keep y&#x27;all posted.... ;)</li>
            <li>However, this razor spat &amp; sputtered the first time my husband used it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 2016: Back in January, the spring that pushes the cutters into the heads lost some of its spring, and I had to disassemble the head, give the spring a good bend, and put everything back together.</li>
            <li>Very quiet, does a surprisingly good job for how quiet it is.</li>
            <li>( I did know this prior to purchase &#x3D;&amp;#62; all fine.)</li>
            <li>works as expected, the 2 headed shaver may not be as efficient as the 3 headed ones, but this fits my face better.</li>
            <li>The manual says to charge when the orange light comes on when shaving, at that point, you have a couple of days left.</li>
            <li>then some and provides a very razor close shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very lightweight, cuts well enough and of adequate size.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts more than long enough for me to shave and</li>
            <li>Update January 2017: Finally terminally broke, good service for the price.</li>
            <li>It is water washable and more silent than other models.</li>
            <li>Having said that, for those with a light growth, this little Philips rotary works very well, provided you use it daily.</li>
            <li>I am sorry for seller.it is a good product</li>
            <li>Bit slow &amp; not quite clean as my old Panasonic, but that thing was $200.</li>
            <li>I just live near an airport and it is not very convenient to get package</li>
            <li>The human face is not flat.  </li>
            <li>Philips invented the rotary head technology, my first shaver, back in the 1960s, was a Philips, perhaps not surprising as I grew up in The Netherlands, and so the technology is mature, and works well.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long and battery doesn&#x27;t last long.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> works as expected, the 2 headed shaver may not be as efficient as the 3 headed ones, but this fits my face better.</li>
            <li> This is an ok razor for a cordless.</li>
            <li> This shaver delivers a good shave for an extraordinarily low price.  I plan to use this as my travel razor and as a backup to my Noreleco Awatec 875.  Shave takes a bit longer than the three head Norelcos.  Only downside is charge time can take up to 8 hours.  ( I did know this prior to purchase &#x3D;&amp;#62; all fine.)</li>
            <li> A very good sized one, you may easily carry everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I am considering buying extra one, putting in the car for anytime use.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very ok for it&#x27;s value.</li>
            <li> This was such an excellent gift to my boyfriend for his birthday. He was very happy and satisfied on how it works. ( no kidding!)</li>
            <li> Update January 2017: Finally terminally broke, good service for the price. This shaver is no longer available, but there is a newer model (that I have not tried yet): [[ASIN:B01F5KZQJO Philips Norelco AXE Shave XA504/42]]. Will keep y&#x27;all posted.... ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 2016: Back in January, the spring that pushes the cutters into the heads lost some of its spring, and I had to disassemble the head, give the spring a good bend, and put everything back together. Took about ten minutes and a pair of needle nose pliers. Working fine since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: I noticed that the price has gone up from what I paid for this razor, $14.75, probably would not have bought it closer to $20. Having said that, for those with a light growth, this little Philips rotary works very well, provided you use it daily. It is silent, which is a relief after the Remington I was using, and I had to remember to rotate the pivoting shaver heads across my skin, rather than &amp;#34;shave straight&amp;#34;, as you do with a blade shaver. Philips invented the rotary head technology, my first shaver, back in the 1960s, was a Philips, perhaps not surprising as I grew up in The Netherlands, and so the technology is mature, and works well. I Began using the fully charged shaver on 4/25, and the battery was fully drained by 5/8, or, in my case, 11 daily shaves. The manual says to charge when the orange light comes on when shaving, at that point, you have a couple of days left. For the $15 I paid for it, brilliant, and it is pleasant to have a small quiet &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a quick shave and doesn&#x27;t cut my skin like a blade razor. The cut could be a little closer though</li>
            <li> Norelco is a good brand. However, this razor spat &amp; sputtered the first time my husband used it. Upon trying to use it again, the razor lagged and just DIED. I would only recommend this razor to someone that has bad karma coming back to them!!</li>
            <li> Works great for my morning shaves, and is very smooth on my face and leaves no razor bumps. Works great with shaving cream or just plain old soap and water if you&#x27;re cheap lol. Battery lasts more than long enough for me to shave and then some and provides a very razor close shave.</li>
            <li> Good quality shaver that perfectly met my need. I just loved it.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight, cuts well enough and of adequate size. This is what he had long sought. It is water washable and more silent than other models.</li>
            <li> This razor is a piece of trash.  It does not work well at all.  Despite what the package says, the two razor heads do not really pivot, so it really only cuts a flat surface.  The human face is not flat.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing!  You&#x27;ll be much happier with a better quality razor.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. That being said, it should be known that I bought it for $15. Very quiet, does a surprisingly good job for how quiet it is. I have relatively thin beard growth, but the shave was a lot closer than the cheap remington that I had before this one. For under $20 I don&#x27;t think it get much better than this guy here.</li>
            <li> It shaves pretty good but I think I could get one better. But it passes for what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp and cannot be used wet, so no shaving cream or water allowed.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Very easy to hold, easy to clean and charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> bought this for me and my boyfriend, LOVE IT!!! charges quickly and gets the job done with no irritation .</li>
            <li> I am sorry that I said I got it late. I just live near an airport and it is not very convenient to get package I am sorry for seller.it is a good product</li>
            <li> Really a good buy!  Does the same job the expensive ones do.  Would have given 5 stars, but the battery does&#x27;nt last long enough.</li>
            <li> This little guy is perfect for shaving my arms every day. Highly recommend! The charge lasts for days and days too.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to find a razor of this type that only has 2 blades.  I find it far more pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Bit slow &amp; not quite clean as my old Panasonic, but that thing was $200. For the price u can&#x27;t beat it. Plus, u get it take it anywhere because of its size. $6.50 what a steal.</li>
            <li> A Philllips Norelco rechargeable shaver for $6.50! Whoo hoo! What a deal. Bought 3 of them and am happy that I did. Works great!</li>
            <li> Not the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, but effective, reliable, inexpensive, and can be used before coffee has banished the haze from your mind without risk of slitting your jugular.  Better in almost every way than anything else I&#x27;ve used in this price bracket.</li>
            <li> Very easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> As for a two headed razor, it&#x27;s of good cost performance.</li>
