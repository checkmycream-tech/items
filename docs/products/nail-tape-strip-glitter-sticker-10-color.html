            <li>my mom loved!</li>
            <li>Loved it for the price!</li>
            <li>I think these are great for the price paid.  </li>
            <li>But they work great</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>Very nice product,low cost</li>
            <li>Very happy with the tapes themselves, not 100% pleased with the color selection.</li>
            <li>You get a lot more than you&#x27;d expect and these are perfect for taping to create boundaries and paint designs or can be used as decorative tape once sealed in with top coat.</li>
            <li>None of them were damaged and the colors are amazing.</li>
            <li>but when i do the design comes out nice.</li>
            <li>The tape is very functional and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Great for anyone who wants to start playing with nail tape, fun with a great price!</li>
            <li>Definitely glad that I bought them.</li>
            <li>Within an hour it was coming off even with a top coat.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I did receive two purple tapes in the pack but that is ok.</li>
            <li>I wish they were just a bit thicker, but I love to use them on my nails</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Very good for the price, they came in full sized rolls and they stick decently.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item not to long ago and was happy to find that they arrived on time in a nice package.</li>
            <li>This are cheap and nothing like how the look they are to this and rip easily after they rip it take like 15 minutes trying to find the tip of the tape</li>
            <li>But nevertheless, I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap this was when I saw it; I figured it was a sampler.</li>
            <li>They do tend to peel quickly, but for a night out, I think they are fine...</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, full size tape spools!</li>
            <li>Other than that, its a great product</li>
            <li>Fun colors.</li>
            <li>or else they&#x27;ll peel right off your nail.</li>
            <li>The white tape breaks very easy, must be the way it&#x27;s made.</li>
            <li>arrived quicker than expected &amp; i love them!</li>
            <li>I just love all of the different colors that came in the pack.</li>
            <li>the colors are pretty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still learning how to use them, so I have more than enough tape to practice.</li>
            <li>Is ok but doesn&#x27;t stay sticky for long</li>
            <li>Just have to make sure polish is all the way dry before applying to avoid messing up the design!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really use them much</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and lasts a long time before peeling off.  </li>
            <li>This not only shipped super fast</li>
            <li>Other than that I was very pleased with the overall product.</li>
            <li>I bought these a few weeks ago and they arrived earlier than expected which is great!</li>
            <li>Had to be careful when putting the clear polish on top of tape the color would dissolve.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely buy them again as long as I would get as many as I was told I would get</li>
            <li>I figured that would be pretty basic.</li>
            <li>The tape isn&#x27;t as sticky as I thought it would be but would probably stick if you put a clear coat on top, also you have to cut it with scissors, which is very hard to cut it in the exact length of my nail.</li>
            <li>Came a day early.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have a comparison picture to show how thin the tape actually is.</li>
            <li>and I have used the white and blue so far.</li>
            <li>The colors were good and were all in separate packages, the only complaint I have is that the tape sometimes falls off the wheel, and it can be hard to find the end of the tape.</li>
            <li>Not a long lasting strip</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest cutting the strips before putting them on your nails and using a clear top coat after it is on.</li>

            <li> There was plenty of colors and it actually came before the expected date.</li>
            <li> The green was a frayed somehow and when I tried to take some off from the tabbed area entire chunks of it came off , in addition the red one was dented in spots and falling off the roll.</li>
            <li> I got the following colors: silver, green, white, pink, black, red, dark blue, purplish pink, platinum, and gold.</li>
            <li> I let my nails dry for 2h and then put the nail tape on them and about after a day maybe even half a day they were falling off</li>
            <li> other than that, I guess there</li>
            <li> Just have to be very careful to seal the ends</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here, sometimes they don&#x27;t stick, and they didn&#x27;t even send me a roll of black tape...</li>
            <li> Allows polish to slide in underneath it creating a look that is not clean or neat.</li>
            <li> (I expected at least a month shipping going from China to US), but it was not a sampler.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I didn&#x27;t anticipate was how thin the tape is.</li>
            <li> recommend sealing them to make them past longer.</li>
            <li> Not a very good product.</li>
            <li> the strips are really hard to get off of the &amp;#34;wheel&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Thin tape....</li>
            <li> too thin</li>
            <li> False advertisement .</li>
            <li> I thought the strips would be wider but they turned out to be very thin and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>

            <li> I just love all of the different colors that came in the pack. Definitely glad that I bought them. @I_TheAbstract on IG to see how I&#x27;ve been using them (:</li>
            <li> my mom loved! Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> Fun colors. Thin tape....I&#x27;d suggest cutting the strips before putting them on your nails and using a clear top coat after it is on.</li>
            <li> Is ok but doesn&#x27;t stay sticky for long</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on ! Within an hour it was coming off even with a top coat. I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the tapes themselves, not 100% pleased with the color selection. I received 2 purple tapes, but no gold. I guess you are never guaranteed what is in the picture so I cannot be too upset.</li>
            <li> Very nice product,low cost and you can do a lot of designs with this tape and the colors are pretty</li>
            <li> Not a long lasting strip</li>

            <li> Just some tape.  You get a lot more than you&#x27;d expect and these are perfect for taping to create boundaries and paint designs or can be used as decorative tape once sealed in with top coat.</li>
            <li> I think these are great for the price paid.  They do tend to peel quickly, but for a night out, I think they are fine...recommend sealing them to make them past longer.</li>
            <li> I find this tape to not be sticky enough and the nail polish tends to seep underneath it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really use them much but when i do the design comes out nice.</li>
            <li> I thought the strips would be wider but they turned out to be very thin and hard to work with. Not a very good product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this cause I let my nails dry for 2h and then put the nail tape on them and about after a day maybe even half a day they were falling off</li>

            <li> too thin but i found some use for them</li>
            <li> This are cheap and nothing like how the look they are to this and rip easily after they rip it take like 15 minutes trying to find the tip of the tape</li>
            <li> Waist , didn&#x27;t work too well . False advertisement .</li>
            <li> I did receive two purple tapes in the pack but that is ok. The white tape breaks very easy, must be the way it&#x27;s made. The tape is very functional and arrived in perfect condition. I would order again.</li>
            <li> Came a day early. I got the following colors: silver, green, white, pink, black, red, dark blue, purplish pink, platinum, and gold.

This not only shipped super fast (I expected at least a month shipping going from China to US), but it was not a sampler. That&#x27;s right, full size tape spools! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I like them but I only received nine when it says ten... Wasn&#x27;t very happy But they work great and I would definitely buy them again as long as I would get as many as I was told I would get</li>
            <li> They work well, however some were damage in packaging process (I assume) The green was a frayed somehow and when I tried to take some off from the tabbed area entire chunks of it came off , in addition the red one was dented in spots and falling off the roll. Very good for the price, they came in full sized rolls and they stick decently. All in all I would definitely get again! Great for anyone who wants to start playing with nail tape, fun with a great price!</li>
            <li> This product is great. It goes on easy and lasts a long time before peeling off.  The colors are awesome.</li>
