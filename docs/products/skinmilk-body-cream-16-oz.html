            <li>I consider it a wonderful find!</li>
            <li>A great find!  </li>
            <li>This product was great!</li>
            <li>When I found this product again on Amazon I literally screamed with happiness!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as a inexpensive alternative to belly butter and it has been working great.</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Product is great and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product a while ago from Rite Aide, and i loved it.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m always on the look out for good lotions.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>nice Amazon is an option.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>But for people with normal skin, I bet this lotion is awesome</li>
            <li>Skin milk is by far the best, I&#x27;ve even tried specialty lotions used on Diabetics.</li>
            <li>I first experienced using this body cream about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>The lotion is fantastic on my skin, and the cream is even better!  </li>
            <li>I used to love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for many years, but the store stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion and buy it anytime</li>
            <li>Skin Milk body cream is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Dry/flaky skin doesn&#x27;t stand a chance with the moisture punch this cream packs!! : )</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>I love the skin milk skin care product line.  </li>
            <li>It feels so silky and it not overly scented like many of the products out there.  </li>
            <li>It has a light scent to it (kind of a milky, vanilla scent) and although it took some rubbing in (to get to fully absorb)</li>
            <li>i used to be able to find in at the store but for some reason they stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>i was glad to be able to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best for dry skin all over the body.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best body cream ever!</li>
            <li>This cream for the body has a lovely whipped texture and a light clean scent.</li>
            <li>They could probably get away with selling this for a lot more... but lucky for us they keep it honest. ;)</li>
            <li>The scent is fairly light and not too feminine if a guy wanted to use some.</li>
            <li>but i can smooth them over with this cream.</li>
            <li>I am still grateful to find it available regardless of the cost.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and hydrates well without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>I had smooth skin ALL day.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use as long as I can find it - have not seen in stores, so it&#x27;s great to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>It gets me through this dry weather that I am experiencing this Winter, and I couldn&#x27;t ask for better!!</li>
            <li>It is a heavy cream, but feels very good on &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li>I like to apply this product right after a shower or before bedtime.</li>
            <li>The smell is so soft and pleasant and you won&#x27;t be left smelling like a perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>I was disppointed to learn my local retailer suddenly stopped carrying this product, but happily I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I used to love it, but it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li>Maybe it got too hot, I don&#x27;t know, but I will try again</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even uses it to massage my feet because it glides in so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>So love this cream, is thick and rick, smells great (like milk), works wonders, and just can;t say enough</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a good amount of lactid acid in it so it eats up dead skin cells pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I really love it, I have very, very dry skin</li>
            <li>Love this product... always use in winter as skin gets very dry.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s very watery.  </li>
            <li>it is going straight in the trash.</li>
            <li>Stretch marks are very hereditary in my family</li>
            <li>I always am looking for reasonably priced, quality lotions (since I use a lot).</li>
            <li>i feel like it really moisturizes my hands</li>
            <li>The reasonable price makes it a no-brainer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how long lasting this cream is!  </li>
            <li>I wish I could continue to buy locally in stores instead of paying more for shipping than the actual product costs.  </li>
            <li>I think that this particular batch of cream is really old.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be using it in the future for the same purpose if it&#x27;s still around by then! :)</li>
            <li>It sure helps my dry skin and keeps it soft all day long.</li>
            <li>used to carry this line at my local Walmart for about half the price, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft.</li>
            <li>Skin Milk keeps my skin moist and soft ALL day and it is not like using softening.</li>
            <li>My son is 16 months old now</li>
            <li>so I was concerned early on about doing what I could to prevent them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very watery and after a while my skin was dry.</li>
            <li>i really like to use this in the winter when everything is so dry.</li>
            <li>Very thick and smooth.</li>

            <li> Very thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> I also live in a very dry climate so I get very dry skin.</li>
            <li> i had a dry skin patch that i scratched a little too much</li>
            <li> The skin on my legs becomes extremely dry in the Winter, and this is one of only two products I have found that keeps it supple and gets rid of the scaley appearance.  </li>
            <li> I want to buy a lifetime supply because I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to find it again.</li>
            <li> It traps the moisture into your body and keeps it there all day long.</li>
            <li> Like most milk based creams/lotions it is a little difficult to rub in</li>
            <li> Keeps skin moist a long time!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> and I think usage of this cream is the reason why I escaped without a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li> after using this stuff it got WAY less red &amp; started healing up!  </li>
            <li> The climate in Denver is so very dry.  </li>
            <li> When I say all day long, I mean ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> A very little bit goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is being made differently or if it broke down a little during shipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any until towards the end of my pregnancy, then I got a few small red marks which disappeared after I gave birth and continued to use this cream.</li>
            <li> and my horribly disgusting scaly red elbow seems to be doing much better too.  </li>
            <li> It arrived without a seal over it, not completely full and with what looked suspiciously like a finger-scoop from it.  </li>
            <li> I recently ordered this and was a little disappointed because it was much runnier than I remember.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my $10 as I threw it away without using it.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few products I can use on my skin.  </li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t need to reapply after a few minutes like with some lotions.  </li>
            <li> I just started using the body cream version of this product, simply because I was getting frustrated trying to get every last bit of lotion out of the lotion pump.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product has changed or not, but it is not of the quality it used to be.  </li>
            <li> It can be difficult to locate locally</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick (as a cream should be) but after working it into your skin you will not be greasy.</li>
            <li> I also get rough dry gross elbows, not overly bad but still annoying.</li>
            <li> Plus I like the subtle, almost non-existent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle.  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless I did and was very unhappy with every lotion, cream, and body butter is used afterward.</li>
            <li> I hate that greasy feeling some lotions &amp; creams give</li>

            <li> I purchased this product a while ago from Rite Aide, and i loved it. My skin was so soft. I don&#x27;t know what this product is because it don&#x27;t feel like what i purchased before. It&#x27;s very watery and after a while my skin was dry.</li>
            <li> I used to love this lotion.  I&#x27;m not sure if this product has changed or not, but it is not of the quality it used to be.  It used to keep my skin so moist.  Now it&#x27;s very watery.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.  I used to love it, but it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li> I think that this particular batch of cream is really old.  The body lotion gave me a rash.  I am not even going to try the cream... it is going straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for many years, but the store stopped carrying it. I really love it, I have very, very dry skin and it works well. I recently ordered this and was a little disappointed because it was much runnier than I remember. I&#x27;m not sure if it is being made differently or if it broke down a little during shipping. Maybe it got too hot, I don&#x27;t know, but I will try again, maybe I&#x27;ll get it from a different purveyor.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It gets me through this dry weather that I am experiencing this Winter, and I couldn&#x27;t ask for better!!</li>
            <li> The climate in Denver is so very dry.  I found Skin Milk several years ago, however when I could no longer find it in the local stores I turned to Amazon.  Skin Milk keeps my skin moist and soft ALL day and it is not like using softening. I consider it a wonderful find!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a inexpensive alternative to belly butter and it has been working great. Like most milk based creams/lotions it is a little difficult to rub in but once it is on it stays on all day and keeps my skin well moisturized/nourished. The fragrance is very mild and pleasant. They could probably get away with selling this for a lot more... but lucky for us they keep it honest. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** My son is 16 months old now and I think usage of this cream is the reason why I escaped without a single stretch mark. Stretch marks are very hereditary in my family so I was concerned early on about doing what I could to prevent them. I didn&#x27;t have any until towards the end of my pregnancy, then I got a few small red marks which disappeared after I gave birth and continued to use this cream. I will definitely be using it in the future for the same purpose if it&#x27;s still around by then! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got Multiple Sclerosis and I need I.V. infusions so the skin on my arms gets bruised and irritated from the tape. I also live in a very dry climate so I get very dry skin. So I&#x27;m always on the look out for good lotions. Skin milk is by far the best, I&#x27;ve even tried specialty lotions used on Diabetics. I also get rough dry gross elbows, not overly bad but still annoying. One or two applications is all it takes to repair them. I absolutely love this lotion and buy it anytime I can find it. It can be difficult to locate locally so it&#x27;s nice Amazon is an option. A very little bit goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. The scent is fairly light and not too feminine if a guy wanted to use some.</li>
            <li> Skin Milk body cream is my favorite. It sure helps my dry skin and keeps it soft all day long.</li>
            <li> I first experienced using this body cream about 10 years ago. I never used anything after buying this body cream until it was discontinued from my local Walmart stores. I was devastated that I had to switch to something else that I knew was inferior. Nonetheless I did and was very unhappy with every lotion, cream, and body butter is used afterward. When I found this product again on Amazon I literally screamed with happiness! Lol. I love this product and was glad to be reunited!! Skin milk body cream has this silky softness that glides on the skin like silk. It traps the moisture into your body and keeps it there all day long. When I say all day long, I mean ALL DAY LONG. It&#x27;s amazing how long lasting this cream is!  I want to buy a lifetime supply because I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to find it again. It&#x27;s the best for dry skin all over the body. It does not leave that greasy feel like butters do and is longer lasting than lotion. I even use it on my face. The smell is so soft and pleasant and you won&#x27;t be left smelling like a perfume bottle. It&#x27;s very subtle.  You have to try this product. Hands down the best body cream ever! Even Shea butter does not compare.  This is the last product I will use as a moisturizer now that I have found it again. My boyfriend even uses it to massage my feet because it glides in so smooth and soft. If I could rate this product 1000 stars I would! I&#x27;m happy every time I use it. Dry/flaky skin doesn&#x27;t stand a chance with the moisture punch this cream packs!! : )</li>
            <li> So love this cream, is thick and rick, smells great (like milk), works wonders, and just can;t say enough</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay. I have extremely dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t cut it for me. But for people with normal skin, I bet this lotion is awesome</li>
            <li> skin milk cream is good stuff.  I temporarily used it in place of philosophy&#x27;s face cream when i ran out.  There&#x27;s a good amount of lactid acid in it so it eats up dead skin cells pretty well.  It&#x27;s thick (as a cream should be) but after working it into your skin you will not be greasy. I hate that greasy feeling some lotions &amp; creams give you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also i had a dry skin patch that i scratched a little too much &amp; it got irritated.  after using this stuff it got WAY less red &amp; started healing up!  and my horribly disgusting scaly red elbow seems to be doing much better too.  I tried lots of ointments &amp; oils on my scaly patches but i still get them. Nothing makes them stop forming but this stuff seems like it eats them up.  So maybe i can&#x27;t stop the patches from coming but i can smooth them over with this cream.</li>
            <li> It arrived without a seal over it, not completely full and with what looked suspiciously like a finger-scoop from it.  It was a waste of my $10 as I threw it away without using it.</li>
            <li> I love the skin milk skin care product line.  It is one of the few products I can use on my skin.  It feels so silky and it not overly scented like many of the products out there.  I wish I could continue to buy locally in stores instead of paying more for shipping than the actual product costs.  I am still grateful to find it available regardless of the cost.</li>
            <li> I just started using the body cream version of this product, simply because I was getting frustrated trying to get every last bit of lotion out of the lotion pump.  The lotion is fantastic on my skin, and the cream is even better!  I was disppointed to learn my local retailer suddenly stopped carrying this product, but happily I found it on Amazon.  I just would prefer to buy it local...</li>
            <li> This cream for the body has a lovely whipped texture and a light clean scent. Goes on smoothly and hydrates well without being greasy.  A great find!  I will continue to use as long as I can find it - have not seen in stores, so it&#x27;s great to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> To me it smells like play doh .... It&#x27;s a bit runny (watery) when its suppose to be cream... Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it....</li>
            <li> On a whim I decided to purchase this product. I always am looking for reasonably priced, quality lotions (since I use a lot). This product was great! It has a light scent to it (kind of a milky, vanilla scent) and although it took some rubbing in (to get to fully absorb) I had smooth skin ALL day. I like to apply this product right after a shower or before bedtime.</li>
            <li> Very thick and smooth. Keeps skin moist a long time! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love this product... always use in winter as skin gets very dry.  It is a heavy cream, but feels very good on &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> i really like to use this in the winter when everything is so dry. i feel like it really moisturizes my hands and i don&#x27;t need to reapply after a few minutes like with some lotions.  i used to be able to find in at the store but for some reason they stopped carrying it.  i was glad to be able to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li> The skin on my legs becomes extremely dry in the Winter, and this is one of only two products I have found that keeps it supple and gets rid of the scaley appearance.  The reasonable price makes it a no-brainer.  Plus I like the subtle, almost non-existent fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;They used to carry this line at my local Walmart for about half the price, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li> Product is great and it&#x27;s not greasy. Love it!</li>
            <li> My niece likes this and I gave it as a Christmas gift to her. I also bought some for myself.</li>
