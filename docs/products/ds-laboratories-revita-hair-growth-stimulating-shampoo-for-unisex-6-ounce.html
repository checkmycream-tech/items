            <li>This is a nice trick to force us buy more bottles.</li>

            <li>Does it grow more?</li>
            <li>DS Labs seems like they care more about the money then</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel and look.</li>

            <li>It worked very well on my hair, I saw the results, I&#x27;m very happy with this product, I will keep buying it, Thanks.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo, my hairdresser definitely sees a difference.</li>

            <li>I rarely use additional product on my hair anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it with Rogain and I am having success keeping my hair.</li>
            <li>I say its worth a tr..</li>
            <li>new one that I got lathers and it is easy to squeeze.</li>
            <li>She claims it works very well!</li>
            <li>First one used to give lather</li>
            <li>I swore by this product after the first bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be a lot cheaper (and better) for you in the long run by doing that.</li>
            <li>Since this product is gentle, and nourishes the scalp, I feel it really worked!  </li>
            <li>but it leaves my hair unusually greasy.</li>
            <li>I believe all the anesthetics and the stress was responsible for my hair loss.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really seems to make and keep my hair</li>
            <li>After 2 months the thin spot on the top of my head filled in.  </li>
            <li>The first shampooing doesn&#x27;t suds up much, but after rinsing and using for a second time, there are plenty of suds!</li>
            <li>The only way to really tell if it is really responsible for the nice re-growth of hair would have been to use it on only half my head, and I wasn&#x27;t about to do that.  </li>
            <li>The newer packaging and new bottle was indicator that the product has changed.  </li>
            <li>Around the end of 2010 I ordered a a couple new bottle&#x27;s off amazon.</li>
            <li>and they sent me two new bottles directly from them.</li>
            <li>My naturally wavey hair is now naturally curly!</li>
            <li>This product shouldn&#x27;t be called a shampoo its more like a thick conditioner in which you need to squeeze a hand-full just to coat the scalp.  </li>
            <li>, after a serious injury which required many surgeries.  </li>
            <li>well, I have no other option of what to get as far as thickening shampoo.</li>
            <li>This will force us take more quantity (it is hard to squeeze it out and often I have to open the cap and squeeze it).</li>
            <li>I can now go outside without a wig, as my new growth of hair is filling in the bald spots.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the shampoo long enough to know if it works, but I think my hair has stopped falling out so fast.</li>
            <li>Also, the first bottle, I noticed that a lot less hair fell out during a shower.</li>
            <li>My hair is a little less grey( more brown)</li>
            <li>and I do think my hair is looking a little thicker, but only the slightest bit - not sure if its because my follicles are any healthier or growing any better or if it just makes the hair appear fuller - either way</li>
            <li>Just go back to using decent shampoo/conditioner every other day.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this read some of the other newer reviews in the last year and a half about this product going downhill then decide for yourself if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>

            <li> As a 2800 hair graft recipient I wasn&#x27;t about to burn up expensive hair with junky shampoos.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> All I can figure out is when they started making it out of the country that&#x27;s when things started going bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was purchased for my cousin, who is experiencing hair loss.  She claims it works very well!</li>
            <li> I bought this item after having used this product before.  The newer packaging and new bottle was indicator that the product has changed.  With that being said I received the item and tried it out.  This product shouldn&#x27;t be called a shampoo its more like a thick conditioner in which you need to squeeze a hand-full just to coat the scalp.  I returned the product to amazon and asked for a new one thinking it may have been a bad batch. But again, I received it and it had the same pasty conditioner feel and does not foam up.  I will never buy this item again, quality has dropped and they should be ashamed to even make such a horrible product. BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have no idea what&#x27;s up with this shampoo but it leaves my hair unusually greasy. It takes About 3-4 shampooings with something else to get it out.. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend the shampoo. Who wants greasy hair when it&#x27;s already thin???   Not me!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo on the advice of my hairdresser. I have hair falling out at the temples. I haven&#x27;t used the shampoo long enough to know if it works, but I think my hair has stopped falling out so fast. The shampoo is very thick and hard to get out of the container. The first shampooing doesn&#x27;t suds up much, but after rinsing and using for a second time, there are plenty of suds! I leave it on my hair for the prescribed 4-5 minutes before the 2nd rinse and then I use the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about this shampoo is, it leaves my hair shiney and my scalp no longer itches. I like the idea that that there are no sulfides in this shampoo and that it is cleaning my hair follicles. I rarely use additional product on my hair anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using this product for more than a year. I&#x27;m happy to report that my hair loss has stopped and my balding spots have filled in. My naturally wavey hair is now naturally curly! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle. First one used to give lather and I was happy with this product. I observed some quality change in the second one and this one? No lather at all. This will force us take more quantity (it is hard to squeeze it out and often I have to open the cap and squeeze it). This is a nice trick to force us buy more bottles. Is this the way their research is going? I will not buy this product again till they revert to their original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, June 28 2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new one that I got lathers and it is easy to squeeze.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping great price!</li>
            <li> smells nice, still waiting for results.</li>
            <li> Have noticed less hair falling out and hair feels and looks fuller.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, my hairdresser definitely sees a difference. Been using it for almost 2 years. My hair is so healthy I may have to get my hair cut more often.</li>
            <li> Learn about what shampoo you use. As a 2800 hair graft recipient I wasn&#x27;t about to burn up expensive hair with junky shampoos. This stuff is top notch. Does it grow more? No. Does it keep what you already have ? Sure helps! Now go get your Rogaine foam and get busy looking good!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 3 years now. When I first started I loved it, nice smell left my hair feeling soft, and most important of all was that it kept my hair from falling out. Around the end of 2010 I ordered a a couple new bottle&#x27;s off amazon. When it arrived It didn&#x27;t look the same or smell the same. Which really isn&#x27;t such a big deal, but my hair started falling out like crazy! This never happened in the three years previous while using this. It was like it just stopped working. So i just figured I got some knock offs and called DS labs and they sent me two new bottles directly from them. Well when they got in they looked the same and smelled the same as the amazon ones. My hair was still falling out and this product wasn&#x27;t helping it stop like before. All I can figure out is when they started making it out of the country that&#x27;s when things started going bad. The quality on a scale from 1-10 now is a 0. If it was a year or two ago I would have given it a 10 out of 10. I mean what the heck happened? All I can say is after 3 years I will never order this product again. I have lost half my hair since using the new stuff in less then 6 months and some self esteem and confidence. DS Labs seems like they care more about the money then the customer, probally using cheaper ingrediants and ways of making it. Before purchasing this read some of the other newer reviews in the last year and a half about this product going downhill then decide for yourself if it&#x27;s worth it. Just trying to save you some money and frustration.</li>
            <li> I used to use it, but the quality has lowered over the years. Just go back to using decent shampoo/conditioner every other day. It&#x27;ll be a lot cheaper (and better) for you in the long run by doing that.</li>
            <li> Sorry but it didn&#x27;t work for me, I use it for over a year and I have no results</li>
            <li> After 2 months the thin spot on the top of my head filled in.  My hair is a little less grey( more brown) Haven&#x27;t helped the front hairline.  I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> It works as a shampoo it does not help regrow any hair but, probably is a contributor to hair loss slowing down.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for hair loss.</li>
            <li> I like this product because ... well, I have no other option of what to get as far as thickening shampoo. It smells nice, that&#x27;s true. I&#x27;ve gone through two bottles of this already and the second bottle seems to have a much different texture and color than the previous bottle. Also, the first bottle, I noticed that a lot less hair fell out during a shower. I swore by this product after the first bottle. The second bottle, however, isn&#x27;t doing the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully DS Labs gets the formula more consistent. I&#x27;ll stick with this shampoo for now.</li>
            <li> It worked very well on my hair, I saw the results, I&#x27;m very happy with this product, I will keep buying it, Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am still using this, can&#x27;t imagine being without it. It was recommended by a hair expert in Florida. I have used it ever since, usually order several bottles at a time. It stopped the excessive loss of hair and energizes your scalp. It helps with scalp tension.</li>
            <li> The only way to really tell if it is really responsible for the nice re-growth of hair would have been to use it on only half my head, and I wasn&#x27;t about to do that.  I lost most of my hair, (it was falling out in clumps!), after a serious injury which required many surgeries.  I believe all the anesthetics and the stress was responsible for my hair loss.  Since this product is gentle, and nourishes the scalp, I feel it really worked!  I can now go outside without a wig, as my new growth of hair is filling in the bald spots.  I re-ordered this product, as I have faith in it.  Bottle lasted a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel fuller.  Plus it also doesn&#x27;t have the SLS ingredients that can harm hair.  It&#x27;s been a good choice.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really seems to make and keep my hair thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for about a month now ans even my barber seems to notice a difference. I use it with Rogain and I am having success keeping my hair. No more&lt;br /&gt;hair on my pilliow case every morning. Not everything works for everyone&lt;br /&gt;but I say its worth a tr..</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  Second time I have ordered it..  Will continue to do so.  Love the way it makes my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now and I do think my hair is looking a little thicker, but only the slightest bit - not sure if its because my follicles are any healthier or growing any better or if it just makes the hair appear fuller - either way, I&#x27;ll continue to use it, but don&#x27;t expect any miracles</li>
