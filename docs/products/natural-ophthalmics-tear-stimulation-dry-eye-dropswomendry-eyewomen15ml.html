    <ol>
            <li>These drops are beyond wonderful.</li>
            <li>very good product.</li>
            <li>Eye drops are very good.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with this product, but didn&#x27;t realize that it says to discard after 30 days of opening.</li>
            <li>These drops feel great.</li>
            <li>Using now  - seems great.</li>
            <li>:o)  </li>
            <li>Good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>took a while to arrive but a good product</li>
            <li>Will surely buy again, great stuff</li>
            <li>so I am very pleased that I found these.</li>
            <li>Read about some of the stuff in the popular eye drops and you won&#x27;t ever want to use them in your eyes.</li>
            <li>I dumped the solution out of the bottle it foamed a bit - that&#x27;s the surfactant action, which is sort of like putting soap in your eyes - not the best idea out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>made my own eye drops (boiled water, Celtic sea salt, organic sulfur), and they work like magic – but it’s science.  </li>
            <li>Also very quick delivery!</li>
            <li>Love the product  </li>
            <li>I like to support smaller companies, and their customer service was excellent.</li>
            <li>I love that the bottle is easier to squeeze.</li>
            <li>my eyes feel much better.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is homeopathic.</li>
            <li>I picked this one up on a whim and boy am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>The ads claim  that these drops cause your body to make more tears</li>
            <li>Better alternative than chemical drops.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>This is better then Visine (don&#x27;t even bother with Systane).  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t separate) and a surfactant (surface-acting; it makes stuff like lotion spread better) used in foods, drugs, vaccines like Gardasil, soaps and cosmetics.</li>
            <li>The health of America is rapidly deteriorating, and misleading labels on supposedly safe products aren&#x27;t helping.</li>
            <li>I found an over-the-counter brand that seems to work much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye drops for my Sjogren&#x27;s dry eye (severe), and this homeopathic formula is the best yet.</li>
            <li>I believe the drops are working but going to use them more consistently for better results</li>
            <li>On a side note, I bought this product from Muscle Nerds, a smaller company with great customer feedback listed.</li>
            <li>I originally found this product at a conference in the exhibit hall.</li>
            <li>Does a great job if you have dry eyes</li>
            <li>label is a bit misleading, in that it implies a clean remedy</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that was natural and effective, and I got both.  </li>
            <li>Well, I was full of hope</li>
            <li>do recommend making your own, or using one of the preservative free individual use ones made by Similasan.</li>
            <li>It would be economically beneficial if it came in a dual package..</li>
            <li>The first day I received it, I tried it and right away my eyes started to burn.</li>
            <li>It works very, very well.</li>
            <li>This product is very good for acute dry eye relief, but whether or not it is any better than other dry eye product made by the same company, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>In the beginning, only need one drop in each eye for relief, now need more.</li>
            <li>First one that works like it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite drop for dry eyes.</li>
            <li>and  the price is reasonable</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing to the eye.</li>
            <li>It stings a bit, but that&#x27;s not the real issue because even saline can do that.</li>
            <li>Homeopathic and natural remedies should be better than what the law allows, they should not simply follow the rules – the rules aren’t helping or protecting anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When my eyes feel super dry, even one drop in each is good enough to last.</li>
            <li>I gave up all the other OTC eye drops as this one works better.</li>
            <li>These drops work well at moistening your eyes and helping clean out white gunk that accumulates.</li>
            <li>These drops are more watery that others that I have used which means I have drops running down my face each time I use them.  </li>
            <li>I think I like it,feel less irritation and more moist eye,I will recommend this for people who is on iPad a lot</li>
            <li>It also is used as a preservative, though that is not its main use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if your doctor approves use.</li>
            <li>Was using doctor recommended over-the-counter &amp;#34;dry eye&amp;#34; product until my new Opthamaligist recommended &amp;#34;Natural Ophthalmics.&amp;#34;  Have to use this product less often with a greater reward...</li>
            <li>I love homeopathics, but these eye drops leave a little to be desired.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how much it cleans stuff out of your eyes.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really say I have been consistent enough using the drops to rate that factor.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t ordered a new bottle yet, will think about it.</li>
            <li>and I like that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use anything but these natural drops.</li>
            <li>You do have to use them frequently.  </li>
            <li>I could not find any natural drops</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sterile water is of course not a preservative, it&#x27;s the liquid medium used to deliver the drops (duhhh, right?).&lt;br /&gt;Sodium chloride is table salt, good old NaCl, and it&#x27;s the oldest preservative on earth - think salted meats.</li>
            <li>The real issue is the black lettered claim: \\&quot;Preservative - Free\\&quot; on the front, right under the red lettering \\&quot;Women&#x27;s Tear Stimulation\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listed on the back under Inactive Ingredients, and I will copy exactly, verbatim ~&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really helps my dry eyes.</li>
            <li>They really help my eyes with my extended wear contacts and dry eye.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would stick with the major brands.</li>
            <li>I wanted something natural with no long term effects.  </li>
            <li>I have a condition called ocular rosacea and, was told to try different natural tear drops saying they won&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>No different from natural tears type drops.</li>
            <li>They work okay but seem rather thin in texture.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my severe dry eye problem is not to be helped by natural products.</li>

            <li> I have used less and less over the course of 1 month, so they are actually doing what I thought this would do.</li>
            <li> Some of the other names for this are:  Polyoxyethylene-</li>

            <li> It has been shown to cause: gastrointestinal problems, heart and circulatory problems, allergic reactions from the uncomfortable to the severe, and horrifyingly enough, fertility problems in women.</li>
            <li> it loses its potency after 30 days.</li>
            <li> the least offensive depending on what it’s used in.</li>
            <li> In eye drops that are used on the fragile eye tissues and mucus membranes it just seems like a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Inactive ingredients: (non-preserved) Sterile water; Polysorbate 80; Citrates;</li>
            <li> the worst thing out there?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These drops work well at moistening your eyes and helping clean out white gunk that accumulates. I was surprised how much it cleans stuff out of your eyes. No stinging or discomfort and I like that it is all natural. Read about some of the stuff in the popular eye drops and you won&#x27;t ever want to use them in your eyes. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything but these natural drops.</li>
            <li> I am a return customer...this stuff works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love the product  It only lasts for a short time though</li>
            <li> Refresh Optive is better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought these would be &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; but they are not as lubricating as Refresh Optive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, they start to get a little salty over time, like the water is evaporating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would stick with the major brands. I don&#x27;t notice benefits from these, aside from how they add water to my eyes. They don&#x27;t keep my eyes moist.</li>
            <li> very good product. Also very quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t helped at all.</li>
            <li> I ouse this every day and it keeps my eyes moos with my contact lenses.  I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Really helps my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I was happy with this product, but didn&#x27;t realize that it says to discard after 30 days of opening. I didn&#x27;t have to use it every day, so I was kind of shocked when I read this on the bottle. It didn&#x27;t say that in the product description anywhere. I might have reconsidered considering the price. On a side note, I bought this product from Muscle Nerds, a smaller company with great customer feedback listed. I like to support smaller companies, and their customer service was excellent. They went above and beyond when I contacted them about a question. I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> I love that the bottle is easier to squeeze. Works well.</li>
            <li> Will surely buy again, great stuff</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that this product helped stimulate tears for me. It did lubricate a bit, though not as well as Refresh drops from the drug store. Perhaps my severe dry eye problem is not to be helped by natural products.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was natural and effective, and I got both.  It would be economically beneficial if it came in a dual package..</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it has to be disposed after one month and I usually have half bottle left.</li>
            <li> Eye drops are very good.  They help with very dry eyes.  You do have to use them frequently.  I could not find any natural drops so I am very pleased that I found these.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  Does a great job if you have dry eyes and  the price is reasonable</li>
            <li> This product is very good for acute dry eye relief, but whether or not it is any better than other dry eye product made by the same company, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> These drops feel great. I can&#x27;t stand drops that burn, and these definitely don&#x27;t. When my eyes feel super dry, even one drop in each is good enough to last. A co-worker tried them yesterday for her burning eye and she felt IMMEDIATE relief. Good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a month sinceI reviewed this product. I still like them, but hadn&#x27;t noticed a \\&quot;Discard 30 days after opening\\&quot; line on it. They still work, but not as well. In the beginning, only need one drop in each eye for relief, now need more. It doesn&#x27;t burn still, but bummer it loses its potency after 30 days. Not sure about spending that much money per month...haven&#x27;t ordered a new bottle yet, will think about it.</li>
            <li> These drops claim to do a lot of things but they are not different than putting water in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Big bottle, but expires in only one month.</li>
            <li> Was using doctor recommended over-the-counter &amp;#34;dry eye&amp;#34; product until my new Opthamaligist recommended &amp;#34;Natural Ophthalmics.&amp;#34;  Have to use this product less often with a greater reward...my eyes feel much better.  Highly recommend if your doctor approves use.</li>
            <li> I originally found this product at a conference in the exhibit hall. I am shocked by how much it helps. I have severe dry eye from Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome. I gave up all the other OTC eye drops as this one works better.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing to the eye. Relieves my dry eye. Love that it is homeopathic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  It&#x27;s my favorite drop for dry eyes.</li>
            <li> took a while to arrive but a good product</li>
            <li> Helped quite a bit...great product</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like it at all. The first day I received it, I tried it and right away my eyes started to burn. I figured, well, maybe my eyes are just too dry or too tired, so, I went to bed and in the morning, I tried it again. Nope, it still burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it several different times and each time I put 1 drop in my eye, it burns, so, it doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry eyes. I have a condition called ocular rosacea and, was told to try different natural tear drops saying they won&#x27;t burn. This one obviously does so, I&#x27;ll just continue to use the one I have been using which does burn but only once in awhile. Not each time I put the drops in my eyes like this drop does.</li>
            <li> I picked this one up on a whim and boy am I glad I did.  First one that works like it should.  I have picked others up only to have them dry out my eye.  This one works for me.  Now it is the only one I buy.  Try it!  It may work for you also.</li>
            <li> These drops are more watery that others that I have used which means I have drops running down my face each time I use them.  The ads claim  that these drops cause your body to make more tears but I can&#x27;t really say I have been consistent enough using the drops to rate that factor.</li>
            <li> Using now  - seems great. Better alternative than chemical drops.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Help my dry eyes instantly</li>
            <li> This is better then Visine (don&#x27;t even bother with Systane).  I wanted something natural with no long term effects.  It works well.  I find I use it less then the Visine I was using. I just wish there was a cure for my dry eye syndrome.</li>
            <li> These drops are beyond wonderful.</li>
            <li> Well, I was full of hope but this didn&#x27;t work at all for me; I used it twice before I put on my glasses to read the micro-print on the back of the label. It stings a bit, but that&#x27;s not the real issue because even saline can do that. The real issue is the black lettered claim: \\&quot;Preservative - Free\\&quot; on the front, right under the red lettering \\&quot;Women&#x27;s Tear Stimulation\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listed on the back under Inactive Ingredients, and I will copy exactly, verbatim ~&lt;br /&gt;Inactive ingredients: (non-preserved) Sterile water; Polysorbate 80; Citrates; Sodium chloride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sterile water is of course not a preservative, it&#x27;s the liquid medium used to deliver the drops (duhhh, right?).&lt;br /&gt;Sodium chloride is table salt, good old NaCl, and it&#x27;s the oldest preservative on earth - think salted meats. It is also used to make an isotonic solution, and is necessary here along with the water to make saline, but it is still also a preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citric acid is a preservative, think home canned fruit - it&#x27;s used to retain color. Citrates are used in eye drops to heal eye injuries without calcifying the cornea. They are also used as a buffer.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polysorbate 80 is an emulsifier (it holds oil and water together so it doesn&#x27;t separate) and a surfactant (surface-acting; it makes stuff like lotion spread better) used in foods, drugs, vaccines like Gardasil, soaps and cosmetics. Some of the other names for this are:  Polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-20-monooleate, Polyoxyethylene (80), sorbitan monooleate, (x)-sorbitan, mono-9-octadecenoate, poly (oxy-1,2 ethanediyl), Tween 80, POE (80), sorbitan monooleate, and E433. It has been shown to cause: gastrointestinal problems, heart and circulatory problems, allergic reactions from the uncomfortable to the severe, and horrifyingly enough, fertility problems in women. It also is used as a preservative, though that is not its main use. Please search to verify this for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This label is a bit misleading, in that it implies a clean remedy but it contains polysorbate 80, and perhaps uses it along with citrates as preservatives while claiming to be preservative free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is Polysorbate 80 the worst thing out there? Probably not; it may even be one of the least offensive depending on what it’s used in. In injectibles like vaccines it can be downright deadly. In eye drops that are used on the fragile eye tissues and mucus membranes it just seems like a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I dumped the solution out of the bottle it foamed a bit - that&#x27;s the surfactant action, which is sort of like putting soap in your eyes - not the best idea out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I fussy? You bet! My health and that of my family depends on it. The health of America is rapidly deteriorating, and misleading labels on supposedly safe products aren&#x27;t helping. Homeopathic and natural remedies should be better than what the law allows, they should not simply follow the rules – the rules aren’t helping or protecting anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made my own eye drops (boiled water, Celtic sea salt, organic sulfur), and they work like magic – but it’s science.  :o)  I have used less and less over the course of 1 month, so they are actually doing what I thought this would do. The salt is the preservative, as well as creating an isotonic solution, the sulfur is supposed to help heal. Works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend making your own, or using one of the preservative free individual use ones made by Similasan.</li>
            <li> I think I like it,feel less irritation and more moist eye,I will recommend this for people who is on iPad a lot</li>
            <li> I started buying these online because they are cehaper than at the eye doctor. They really help my eyes with my extended wear contacts and dry eye.</li>
            <li> Just eye drops, it seems. No different from natural tears type drops. Pricey, for what it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye drops for my Sjogren&#x27;s dry eye (severe), and this homeopathic formula is the best yet.</li>
            <li> I believe the drops are working but going to use them more consistently for better results</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry eyes due to SJS/TENS.  This is the only eye drop the soothes my eyes and provides real&lt;br /&gt;Moisture.  It works very, very well.</li>
            <li> They work okay but seem rather thin in texture. Also I need to keep putting them in because within an hour or so, it feels like I haven&#x27;t even used them. I found an over-the-counter brand that seems to work much better. I love homeopathics, but these eye drops leave a little to be desired.</li>
