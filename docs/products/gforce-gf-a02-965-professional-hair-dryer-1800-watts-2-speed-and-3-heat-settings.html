            <li>and I&#x27;m generally not that good at doing my own hair.</li>
            <li>The dryer itself is light and easy to handle, yet has mega power.</li>
            <li>hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer was comfortable, the placement of the controls was fine, though not what I prefer.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for free for purposes of review.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Hair Dryer!!!!</li>
            <li>The 1st setting, supposedly the weakest setting, was very powerful</li>
            <li>Pretty good for a cheap dryer fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>Solid feel, very good cord, super strong air flow, does not have too much heat thankfully, switches stay out of the way too!</li>
            <li>Just flip switch and cool air.</li>
            <li>I love all the options it has and feel that it is gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>just want to say that this review is pretty specific to what I feel a hair dryer should be, but I also understand that a hair dryer is probably more personal preference than anything, so I will do my best to describe why I like or don&#x27;t like something.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other reviews stated that he heat was very effective</li>
            <li>She said that this Hair Dryer works great and dries her hair faster than the one she previously used.</li>
            <li>Blows hair really well and makes your hair look nice, calm and gives it a professional look!</li>

            <li>Powerful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any other one we owned is as good as this one.</li>
            <li>so you could imagine the 3rd strong setting !  </li>
            <li>, so far it operate&#x27;s perfecto for us and is easy to bring on the go in the gym bag or for away at college buy as a gift if not for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The length of the wire is a little over 7 feet which is a pretty good length if your wall socket is away from the mirror like mine.</li>
            <li>Another customer mentioned that her hair did not get heated up even on the hot temperature setting.</li>
            <li>I love the different setting and the consistent performance.</li>
            <li>Even on the hottest setting, I could blow the dryer on one spot and it didn&#x27;t get too hot that I had to move it.  </li>
            <li>Love the cool switch that doesn&#x27;t have to be held down.</li>
            <li>x User Manual In English &amp; Spanish yes included and is easy to follow !!</li>

            <li>Fast Shipping ...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy and curly hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer by GForce is really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it has 2 speed setting and 3 temperature control setting making it very flexible with options for your styling</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a hair dryer i highly recommend this one to anyone!</li>
            <li>got a choice of if I want it hot or cool and the red button help&#x27;s with the additional coolness</li>
            <li>(I have medium to long, fine, wavy hair.)  </li>
            <li>And it has a button for instant cool to set the section you are working on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I felt the high setting was way too high.  </li>
            <li>you need a new hair dryer, this one should provide you with everything you need.</li>
            <li>Works like a professional dryer!  </li>

            <li>x Professional Hair Dryer with 1800 Watts of Power&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But i saw this says it&#x27;s a Professional hair dryer</li>

            <li>but I can only go by my experience, and it wasn&#x27;t very</li>

            <li>It has 3 temperature control settings, whereas the third temperature allows it to reach extremely high temperatures as soon as I turned it on.</li>
            <li>I felt like the low setting should be the high setting</li>
            <li>and it takes a real good hair dryer to dry my hair without making it fizzy and bad.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a new hair dryer for the last six months.  </li>
            <li>and I love that feature because it helps keep the hair dryer from slipping off of our small vanity.  </li>
            <li>Mine don&#x27;t generally take much use or abuse, so they last me a long time.  </li>
            <li>I use this to style my hair not necessarily dry because I let them air-dry.&lt;br /&gt;The dryer also has a loop that can be used to hang it when not in use.</li>
            <li>The plug was a normal two prong plug without the GFI head on it, which makes it easier to plug in with other items.  </li>
            <li>With approximately seven feet of cord, you should be able to find a plug and dry your hair without limiting yourself as to where you have to be.  </li>
            <li>It is a little warmer and the low setting doesn&#x27;t blow as hard, which is what I wanted, so it better suited me.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it is overly heavy, though it is decently large and may feel heavy with a longer use.  </li>
            <li> I use a dryer always to dry my hair after washing it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably why my hair didn&#x27;t dry well.  </li>
            <li> My routine is to let my hair air dry part of the way and then briefly use the hair dryer to dry it the rest of the way and do a little minor styling.  </li>
            <li> I did not have that issue, It could also be due to my hair type, I have straight thick hair.</li>
            <li> The cold shot button was easy to reach.  </li>
            <li> What I was left with was damp hair that was tangled, even though I dried it twice as long as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is dry in 2 minutes!!</li>
            <li> A little heavy but no big deal.  </li>
            <li> It gives u an option of either cold or hot air!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not overly heavy, approximately two pounds, and I find I don’t need to highest heat setting to dry my hair as the medium provides enough heat.  </li>
            <li> so I just wasted my money</li>
            <li> I usually get my hair done weekly, and now I don&#x27;t need to worry about it.</li>
            <li> It literally blew my hair away from my head like I was in a car with my head out the window, which made it less efficient at drying while causing unnecessary tangling.  </li>
            <li> No more frizzy dryed out hair!!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer gave me professional salon look without costing me the insane amount I would pay for there.</li>
            <li> There is a loop at the base of the handle for hanging.  </li>

The length of the wire is a little over 7 feet which is a pretty good length if your wall socket is away from the mirror like mine. There are three temperature settings on the hair dryer that can be changed based on the style you are going for. This hair dryer gave me professional salon look without costing me the insane amount I would pay for there. Another customer mentioned that her hair did not get heated up even on the hot temperature setting. I did not have that issue, It could also be due to my hair type, I have straight thick hair. I use this to style my hair not necessarily dry because I let them air-dry.&lt;br /&gt;The dryer also has a loop that can be used to hang it when not in use. There are 2 speed settings as well. The buttons are easy to reach and press. Overall, I totally recommend this hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I received this under a promotion for my honest and unbiased review. My review is based on my personal experience.</li>

            <li> One of the best hair dryers I have ever used. The dryer itself is light and easy to handle, yet has mega power. I love the different setting and the consistent performance. I would definitely recommend this dryer to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I recieved my Gforce hair dryer a day after I ordered it and it is extremely powerful and awesome. It is the best hair dryer I have ever bought and I would recommend everyone who needs a hair dryer to order the gforce professional hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Solid feel, very good cord, super strong air flow, does not have too much heat thankfully, switches stay out of the way too!</li>
            <li> best hair dryer I have owned</li>
            <li> Works like a professional dryer!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter. She said that this Hair Dryer works great and dries her hair faster than the one she previously used.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free for purposes of review. I honestly love this Hair Dryer! It has 3 temperature control settings, whereas the third temperature allows it to reach extremely high temperatures as soon as I turned it on. It also has 3 power/ strength settings. The 1st setting, supposedly the weakest setting, was very powerful so you could imagine the 3rd strong setting !  The 2 nozzles were a huge plus! I have very frizzy and curly hair, and a lot of it. I usually get my hair done weekly, and now I don&#x27;t need to worry about it. I used this Hair Dryer for the first time last night out of the shower and my hair got straight and silky quickly! It looked better than the salon and I&#x27;m generally not that good at doing my own hair. I highly recommend this Hair Dryer!!!! Definitely a must of 2015 and a money saver!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this blower , I rate it five starts it works great an is very strong!! I recommend it to anyone !! And service is amazing, quick shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Swed</li>
            <li> Having a good hair dryer is very important for any woman. I have tried and tested many as my hair is very long and it takes a real good hair dryer to dry my hair without making it fizzy and bad. This hair dryer by GForce is really good.&lt;br /&gt;It uses 1800 watts of power and heats up well. it has 2 speed setting and 3 temperature control setting making it very flexible with options for your styling preference.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with not one but TWO nozzles for concentrating air. It also has removable filters which is great. I use a dryer always to dry my hair after washing it. This dryer does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;Package Includes&lt;br /&gt;1 x Professional Hair Dryer 1800 Watts&lt;br /&gt;2 x Concentrator Nozzles&lt;br /&gt;1 x Removable Washable Filter&lt;br /&gt;1 x User Manual In English &amp; Spanish&lt;br /&gt;1 x Warranty Certificate&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to receive this for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a hair dryer in many years.  Mine don&#x27;t generally take much use or abuse, so they last me a long time.  When my hair dryer simply stopped working the other day, I knew I needed a new one.  After some searching, I decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to say that this review is pretty specific to what I feel a hair dryer should be, but I also understand that a hair dryer is probably more personal preference than anything, so I will do my best to describe why I like or don&#x27;t like something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this hair dryer, even on the low setting, puts out a lot of air.  I felt like the low setting should be the high setting and I felt the high setting was way too high.  It literally blew my hair away from my head like I was in a car with my head out the window, which made it less efficient at drying while causing unnecessary tangling.  (I have medium to long, fine, wavy hair.)  My routine is to let my hair air dry part of the way and then briefly use the hair dryer to dry it the rest of the way and do a little minor styling.  What I was left with was damp hair that was tangled, even though I dried it twice as long as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second thing I noticed was the heat.  Even on the hottest setting, I could blow the dryer on one spot and it didn&#x27;t get too hot that I had to move it.  That&#x27;s probably why my hair didn&#x27;t dry well.  Other reviews stated that he heat was very effective so maybe my dryer just didn&#x27;t work well, but I can only go by my experience, and it wasn&#x27;t very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer was comfortable, the placement of the controls was fine, though not what I prefer.  The cold shot button was easy to reach.  The white ovals on the sides are a rubbery material and I love that feature because it helps keep the hair dryer from slipping off of our small vanity.  The plug was a normal two prong plug without the GFI head on it, which makes it easier to plug in with other items.  There is a loop at the base of the handle for hanging.  I don&#x27;t feel like it is overly heavy, though it is decently large and may feel heavy with a longer use.  I like that the filter is removable for cleaning.  I&#x27;m sure it will help prolong the life of the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I decided to return this and I bought one at the store.  It is a little warmer and the low setting doesn&#x27;t blow as hard, which is what I wanted, so it better suited me. I hope this information helps.he handle for hanging.

            <li> Great blow dryer.....my teenaged daughter keeps &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; it! Guess I will have to order one for her too.</li>
            <li> Very good. Powerful. May be too strong for some folks even on lowest setting</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new hair dryer for the last six months.  Nothing I found was up to my standards until I got this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has 1800 watts of power with two speeds and three heat settings.  It comes with two attachments for directing the air where you want it.  There is also a loop for hanging the dryer when not in use.  With approximately seven feet of cord, you should be able to find a plug and dry your hair without limiting yourself as to where you have to be.  And it has a button for instant cool to set the section you are working on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not overly heavy, approximately two pounds, and I find I don’t need to highest heat setting to dry my hair as the medium provides enough heat.  This is a plus as we all know heat is not a friend to our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a new hair dryer, this one should provide you with everything you need.</li>
            <li> This hair blower is the greatest one I ever had!!! I don&#x27;t think any other one we owned is as good as this one. Blows hair really well and makes your hair look nice, calm and gives it a professional look! It gives u an option of either cold or hot air! It also is very light weight which makes it very easy to take around with you anywhere you&#x27;re going. If you&#x27;re looking for a hair dryer i highly recommend this one to anyone!</li>
