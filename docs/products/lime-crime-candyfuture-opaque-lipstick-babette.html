            <li>Wonderful polite and speedy seller.</li>
            <li>great shade for everyone!</li>
            <li>was excellent product was in perfect shape.  </li>
            <li>This color is the perfect mix of a coral and nude.</li>
            <li>Lime Crime is awesome.</li>
            <li>it looks amazing on my skin tone!!</li>
            <li>absolutely beautiful and perfect!</li>
            <li>came in perfect condition and works great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and a beautiful color.</li>
            <li>Great shipping time and packaging- boxed and bubble wrapped.</li>
            <li>Product was great.</li>
            <li>but i mix it with a peach lipstick and its even more beautiful!</li>
            <li>great on its own,</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still fairly opaque.</li>
            <li>I do love how creamy they are!</li>
            <li>but i like it more that way!</li>
            <li>So in love with this lipstick and color!</li>
            <li>Its suitable for fair skinned people.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this Lime Crime lipstick!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful, unique color I have not seen yet.</li>
            <li>so I played around with it and found that if I just use one quick swipe across my top lip, press my lips together, and then use a brush to refine and fill in gaps... that leaves me with a perfect amount of color/coverage.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to put on a million coats to get a bright pop of color, which I love.  </li>
            <li>The lipstick itself smells wonderful but is very soft.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth over chapstick.</li>
            <li>So beautiful, a must have for the fair to mid skin tone.</li>
            <li>and im pleased with that.</li>
            <li>I use mostly Mac for lip products but the texture and colour of this takes the cake.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a darker more brown/coral.</li>
            <li>and they love it.</li>
            <li>She really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>I love Lime Crime&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>for 18 buks i could do so much better....</li>
            <li>The color is great and the main reason I purchased.</li>
            <li>It goes on like a dream super smooth and great coverage, the color is beautiful, a little more orange</li>
            <li>was very quick to ship packaging</li>
            <li>The color and container was beautiful for my daughters birthday present.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>shipping was fast and it was packaged nice, so I would give the seller 5 stars</li>
            <li>my new favorite lipstick!</li>
            <li>so excited this was on Amazon  vendor</li>
            <li>Super pigmented goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick...very opaque...not drying on the lips...love the packaging...looking forward to purchasing more lime crime lip products in the future</li>
            <li>I used a lip concealer to get its true color and its so pretty!</li>
            <li>It is INCREDIBLY pigmented, but it&#x27;s not drying, nor does it leave an odd-looking build up/caking on your lips as I&#x27;ve noticed with certain other lipsticks</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very pretty color</li>
            <li>First of all I am a lipstick junky!</li>
            <li>This lipstick smells amazing  similar to  MAC lipsticks.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li>Will definitely order from this company again, love the no animal testing.</li>
            <li>I lightly swiped it once across my lip, and literally said &amp;#34;oh my god&amp;#34; out loud.</li>
            <li>but this brand and color interested me.</li>
            <li>Their lipstick stays on very well and goes on with lots of color!  </li>
            <li>Pretty color but not on me.</li>
            <li>so I can see the color first.</li>
            <li>Pretty color but broke after 4 uses</li>
            <li>The color Babette is very light and flat.</li>
            <li>I do really like this lipstick, I think it is overpriced, though.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and quality shipping</li>
            <li>color is this is very opaque peachy nude.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very pigmented color</li>
            <li>a really cute pink.</li>
            <li>Other then that it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>The color isnt exactly the same as the picture, it is a little more of an orangy-tan pink than a true baby pink, but still a gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite one from the collection, very pretty color, long lasting and creamy on the lips.</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite lipstick yet.</li>
            <li>the color is great but the lipstick is way too dry and doesn&#x27;t long last at all....</li>
            <li>Been waiting to get this particular lipstick</li>
            <li>The lipstick is fine but the color is not what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>; lips so to just wear it normally</li>
            <li>Now I will admit I am new to wearing lipstick.  </li>
            <li>also the smell , smelled somewhat old...</li>
            <li>While I like it, it&#x27;s not worth the money I spent on it, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never liked the feeling on my lips and because I have very full lips</li>
            <li>Wish they sold in major makeup stores</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the lipstick inside came a little sideways so it kind of scrapes the side and its very soft lipstick</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the color may seem a tad average on the website, in person, it&#x27;s very peachy.</li>

            <li> Doing this means it doesn&#x27;t wear as long, of course, but I don&#x27;t mind that as much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels dry</li>
            <li> other than that it came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always just gone au natural in the past.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press down too hard or twist too much out to apply.</li>
            <li> strange to me, maybe due to temperature in the shipping.</li>
            <li> I was expected a pink.</li>
            <li> , I personally don&#x27;t care for the way it looks, it&#x27;s too stark against my skin tone as well.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lips very dry, it has no luster and goes on like plaster!</li>
            <li> The color is the first nude that didn&#x27;t wash me out or make me look ill.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m gonna have to mix it with other lipstick or gloss.</li>
            <li> I would try other colors but will probably purchase from a store</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your lips a little dry but just put some Chapstick under it!</li>
            <li> but seriously, there are other drug store brand that equally or if not more pigmented and long lasting as this one.</li>
            <li> the lipstick itself in the tube was not very secure</li>
            <li> Not subtle or for faint of heart.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few applications to get even coverage</li>
            <li> but looks dead on me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend a lot of money on makeup usually</li>
            <li> What a waste of $19!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it smells</li>
            <li> I usually mix it with a nude lip gloss.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t push to hard on it</li>
            <li> just weird.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not good nor bad ...</li>
            <li> The lipstick was not the shade shown, very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do really like this lipstick, I think it is overpriced, though. I wanted to try the brand without paying the exorbitant shipping at the Lime Crime website. While I like it, it&#x27;s not worth the money I spent on it, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> somewhat upset that this lipstick came smudged and somewhat melted. the lipstick itself in the tube was not very secure and when i applied it , it moved around and gets stuck to the rim. also the smell , smelled somewhat old... not the signature smell of vanilla . strange to me, maybe due to temperature in the shipping. other than that it came earlier than expected and im pleased with that.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite lipstick yet. I use mostly Mac for lip products but the texture and colour of this takes the cake. Wonderful polite and speedy seller. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li> The lipstick was not the shade shown, very disappointed. It&#x27;s a darker more brown/coral. I was expected a pink. I do love how creamy they are!</li>
            <li> This lipstick rocks! It doesn&#x27;t make your lips a little dry but just put some Chapstick under it! It goes on like a dream super smooth and great coverage, the color is beautiful, a little more orange then the picture but i like it more that way! My only complaint is that the lipstick inside came a little sideways so it kind of scrapes the side and its very soft lipstick so don&#x27;t push to hard on it or it will break. Other then that it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> The color isnt exactly the same as the picture, it is a little more of an orangy-tan pink than a true baby pink, but still a gorgeous color. Goes on very smooth over chapstick. Great shipping time and packaging- boxed and bubble wrapped. Will definitely order from this company again, love the no animal testing.</li>
            <li> So in love with this lipstick and color! I used a lip concealer to get its true color and its so pretty! Fast shipping and quality shipping</li>
            <li> Its suitable for fair skinned people. I&#x27;m quite tan and I look like a corpse when I wore it. One of my male co workers even said the color was a miss! I let my friends use it and they love it. It&#x27;s a great product and a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> Product was great. The color and container was beautiful for my daughters birthday present. She really enjoyed it. And it came on time.</li>
            <li> my new favorite lipstick! absolutely beautiful and perfect! great on its own, but i mix it with a peach lipstick and its even more beautiful! great shade for everyone!</li>
            <li> Been waiting to get this particular lipstick forever it&#x27;s always been out of stock so excited this was on Amazon  vendor was very quick to ship packaging was excellent product was in perfect shape.  color is this is very opaque peachy nude.  Not subtle or for faint of heart.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this Lime Crime lipstick! By far my favorite one from the collection, very pretty color, long lasting and creamy on the lips.</li>
            <li> When I received this color in the mail, I couldn&#x27;t help but try it on. I lightly swiped it once across my lip, and literally said &amp;#34;oh my god&amp;#34; out loud. It is INCREDIBLY pigmented, but it&#x27;s not drying, nor does it leave an odd-looking build up/caking on your lips as I&#x27;ve noticed with certain other lipsticks I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the color may seem a tad average on the website, in person, it&#x27;s very peachy. It&#x27;s a beautiful, unique color I have not seen yet.</li>
            <li> The color is great and the main reason I purchased. I don&#x27;t spend a lot of money on makeup usually but this brand and color interested me. The color is the first nude that didn&#x27;t wash me out or make me look ill. The lipstick itself smells wonderful but is very soft. Don&#x27;t press down too hard or twist too much out to apply. It takes a few applications to get even coverage but it&#x27;s still fairly opaque.</li>
            <li> I love the color it looks amazing on my skin tone!! Overall I am very satisfied with this product! Thanks</li>
            <li> They were not kidding about the opaque part.  I&#x27;m a white girl with blonde hair and blue eyes so unless I want to be mistaken for Barbie, I can&#x27;t wear this like regular lipstick.  I have &amp;#34;bow shaped&amp;#34; lips so to just wear it normally, I personally don&#x27;t care for the way it looks, it&#x27;s too stark against my skin tone as well.  I like to make things work though so I played around with it and found that if I just use one quick swipe across my top lip, press my lips together, and then use a brush to refine and fill in gaps... that leaves me with a perfect amount of color/coverage.  Doing this means it doesn&#x27;t wear as long, of course, but I don&#x27;t mind that as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very pretty color but you have to be a fan of the &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; lip to pull this off... Think Nicki Minaj.</li>
            <li> First of all I am a lipstick junky! This lipstick smells amazing  similar to  MAC lipsticks. Super pigmented goes on smooth. Every time I wear this lipstick I always get asked what I&#x27;m wearing. Also it arrived with in 4 days. Will be extending my lime crime collection</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about this lipstick a lot, and have decided to order it. What a waste of $19! It makes my lips very dry, it has no luster and goes on like plaster! I can&#x27;t return it because I tried it already. I guess I&#x27;m gonna have to mix it with other lipstick or gloss. The color Babette is very light and flat. Beware!&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast and it was packaged nice, so I would give the seller 5 stars</li>
            <li> I love Lime Crime&#x27;s products.  Their lipstick stays on very well and goes on with lots of color!  You don&#x27;t have to put on a million coats to get a bright pop of color, which I love.  This color is the perfect mix of a coral and nude.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick...very opaque...not drying on the lips...love the packaging...looking forward to purchasing more lime crime lip products in the future</li>
            <li> So beautiful, a must have for the fair to mid skin tone. Lime Crime is awesome. Wish they sold in major makeup stores</li>
            <li> Very pigmented color but looks dead on me. It&#x27;s probably the color but seriously, there are other drug store brand that equally or if not more pigmented and long lasting as this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Hispanic but I&#x27;m a bit lighter skinned and i like the way this looks on me! a really cute pink. kinda like a darker cotton candy color. came in perfect condition and works great</li>
            <li> Now I will admit I am new to wearing lipstick.  I&#x27;ve never liked the feeling on my lips and because I have very full lips I&#x27;ve always just gone au natural in the past.  I do like the color.  I do like it&#x27;s opacity.  It feels dry so I&#x27;d definitely recommend using a gloss or a balm underneath.  My biggest gripe with the lipstick is the smell.  Being so close to the nose it&#x27;s my opinion it should be odorless if at all possible.  I do not think it smells like vanilla. I&#x27;m not sure what it smells like but it&#x27;s not good nor bad ...just weird. I am intrigued with lipstick but I&#x27;m probably not going to buy lime crime products again.</li>
            <li> The lipstick is fine but the color is not what I expected it to be. Therefore I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> the color is great but the lipstick is way too dry and doesn&#x27;t long last at all.... for 18 buks i could do so much better....</li>
            <li> Pretty color but not on me. I usually mix it with a nude lip gloss. It&#x27;s too orange for me.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the product, but the color was not at all as it was shown.  I would try other colors but will probably purchase from a store so I can see the color first.</li>
            <li> Pretty color but broke after 4 uses</li>
