            <li>Very sizeable so it went over my bun perfectly and kept all the water out, stylish too!</li>
            <li>This shower cap is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and this keeps everything tucked away nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice when trying to wash my face and keeping my hair out of the fray.</li>
            <li>Cute and good quality.</li>
            <li>Terry liner is nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice lining, plenty of room for a ponytail.</li>
            <li>I just took a nice bubble bath wearing this cap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed it in the dishwasher  and by hand (don&#x27;t have my own washer at home) and it stood up.</li>
            <li>This shower cap is nice because it has the terry cloth on the inside</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of storage facility this thing has been sitting in</li>
            <li>Good price, free shipping, &#x3D; good deal.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price!!!</li>

            <li>The cap is well made and cute but needs tighter and better quality elastic!</li>
            <li>Love love this!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best showercap.</li>
            <li>Nice quality and cute</li>

            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The cap is large and has great quality.</li>
            <li>Also the terry cloth liner makes a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>I agree with one of the reviewers, the cap looks cute and fits well but not fully waterproof.  </li>
            <li>comfortable to wear and effective</li>

            <li>it &#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel frisky when I wear it  :)</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I do love this though.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to keep adjusting to find the magic way to cover all your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this shower cap.</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe not,</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This shower cap is cute and does what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li>No complaints after more than 3 months of use.</li>
            <li>, what more could you want in a shower cap?</li>
            <li>and this is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love this shower cap.</li>
            <li>B00385WMH8 Betty Dain Stylish Design Terry Lined Shower Cap, The Socialite Collection, \\&quot;safari</li>
            <li>Great shower cap, very sturdy material, and chamois material on the inside.  </li>
            <li>But, the way I see it: I paid 10 bucks for two years of good hair protection in the shower, and that&#x27;s worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, I use it every two days.</li>
            <li>The pattern seems to be the best choice of this brand although solid fashion colors would be preferable.</li>
            <li>most of the plastic shower caps tend to.</li>
            <li>Love this shower cap.</li>
            <li>T elastic is covered, and feels more substantial than most, so I doubt there will be a problem with it stretching out of shape.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and my style stylish.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this cap.</li>
            <li>I have two of these and love them.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>love the terry lining</li>
            <li>I like that this cap does not have the water collecting fringe along the edge that many caps have.</li>
            <li>I love the terry cloth on the inside.</li>
            <li>So stylish.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what I would think of the terry cloth lining, but I love love love it.  </li>
            <li>I really love this shower cap&lt;</li>
            <li>I love this shower cap because it keeps my hair dryer than any I have ever had</li>
            <li>The lining is not terry cloth like most of the lined shower caps, but more like a microfiber material.</li>
            <li>Love leopard print.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>The leopard design is also cute.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the look and engineering of this cap but the smell....</li>
            <li>Interestingly bought the Betty Dain</li>
            <li>I have tried washing it three times and it still has an overwhelming chemically smell.</li>
            <li>The material is more like cloth and not plastic</li>
            <li>But it worked better than the cheapie dollar store ones I had been using.</li>
            <li>The cotton on the inside wasn&#x27;t a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>Cute.</li>
            <li>and i get compliments on it all the time :)</li>
            <li>This has great coverage, it&#x27;s secure, and the soft lining feels really nice.</li>
            <li>the shower and the elastic banding holds my full head of hair nicely.</li>
            <li>I loved this at first, but when it came time for the company to help me out with a warranty issue after the elastic went, they dropped the ball.  </li>
            <li>Three years is pretty darned good for a shower cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good shower cap is hard to find but this is a great shower cap!</li>
            <li>This cap fits perfectly and keeps all of my hair dry.</li>
            <li>I really like it and besides work very well, it is beautiful !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about my shower caps and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>This will cover any amount of hair you have, easy on and stays in place, easy to get all my hair under.</li>
            <li>It keeps moisture out well and lets me easily wash all areas of my face.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to get on.</li>
            <li>The quality of materials is good, but for regular use it&#x27;s kind of a hassle.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine, too.</li>
            <li>This is a SUPER SHOWER CAP!</li>
            <li>Good size for long hair, nice fit, sturdy and just so practical -even</li>
            <li>Love it, keeps my hair dry and is a great gift for friends and family</li>
            <li>Finally i got the very good shower cap, it&#x27;s worth buying it.</li>
            <li>It is the equivalent of the four food groups in shower caps: roomy, comfortable, waterproof and lined.  </li>
            <li>I have mid-shoulder length hair, it fits comfortably inside this shower cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very luxurious feel, nice fabric and terry</li>
            <li>this one, terry lined, and comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t leave a indent around my hair line.</li>
            <li>It is a FABULOUS cap.</li>
            <li>KUDOS to you, Betty Dain, for designing such a great product.</li>
            <li>This cap is generous in size, will fit all your hair</li>
            <li>so it is comfortable.</li>
            <li>This cap is comfortable.</li>
            <li>This shower cap is so fantastic.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this shower cap, since the design looks much cooler than most!  </li>
            <li>I do wish it was slightly smaller as it is pretty oversized, but it is very comfortable &amp; the quality is great.</li>
            <li>I just wish you would come out with other designs with the terry cloth lining - e.g., classy polka dots in beautiful colors would be nice. :)</li>
            <li>In another order, the Safari cap was sent clean and odor free.</li>
            <li>It is easy to put on and dries quickly afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have a head that is somewhat small and its still fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great for people with long hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s heavier than my head.</li>
            <li>Of all the things to be ridiculously excited about...</li>
            <li>Very good quality, stays put and offers complete coverage.</li>
            <li>I clean it hi-weekly, but still gets that smell.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s it , don&#x27;t have much to say, just comfortable, stylish like photo, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT because it is comfortable to wear &amp; keeps my hair dry with its nice terry cloth lining.</li>
            <li>I laugh at myself every time I put it on because it;s so huge</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s snug around the head so that water stays out but not painfully snug.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because it works very well when I&#x27;m between hair washing days.</li>
            <li>So cute and durable - this is a high quality item!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about it.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s good for water conservation, but it would be WAY better with a wider edge and/or elastic that wasn&#x27;t so tight.</li>
            <li>, there is a huge difference for the better if you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day as far as color retention goes.</li>
            <li>But this is seriously the best shower cap I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This hat is made well, drys quickly after</li>
            <li>Most caps gape and if they have any kind of terry inside it stays wet and gets moldy even if you hang it somewhere in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>The added bonus to this particular cap is that it&#x27;s stylish.</li>
            <li>and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>better quality then I expected and it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>Highly recommend:)</li>
            <li>The cap itself is great, but the elastic fit is very tight around my head.</li>
            <li>Just as advertised, it&#x27;s very soft on the inside which I was looking for and covers the hair really well and stylish!</li>
            <li>Does a good job in keeping hair dry.</li>
            <li>First of all, it smelled like garbage!</li>
            <li>Use it almost daily - love it!</li>
            <li>It fit over my large head with ease.</li>
            <li>They are large and allows you to style hair and shower without crushing your hair.</li>
            <li>The size is huge, so if you have a lot of hair this would really work for you.  </li>
            <li>It is both comfortable and fits very snuggly.  </li>
            <li>I just have to make sure to not go directly under the shower.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This makes me smile every time I take a shower.  </li>
            <li>Brings a smile to the mirror.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>I am in my 30s, have been using shower caps for about 12 years and this is my favorite one so far.</li>
            <li>The shower caps come in fun colors and styles  and are ample for &amp;#34;big hair&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;long hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>lined shower cap in a pink print on Amazon as well and it has no smell, has good quality elastic</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It has microfiber material on the inside, so its not cold feeling like the plastic ones are.</li>
            <li>I have a normal size head, so the cap fits just fine.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair dry, I love that it is terry lined on the inside!</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite feature/benefit -- who wants to step out of the shower with a clean body and a sweaty head?  :-O</li>
            <li>Really good quality cap, have had mine over a year ago now and it&#x27;s still like new after several washes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Size is nice and large which I need and terry lining is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>It has a good elastic, and a very soft inner lining.</li>
            <li>Works better than non lined, fit nice not too tight not loose at all.</li>
            <li>I have a large, rain-style shower-head in my shower (with good-pressure water), and it splashes directly all over the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>Love this shower hat with the terry lining - wish they had more styles and they were a little cheaper</li>
            <li>This one seems to have some dry quick fabric inside, and it fit&#x27;s well and securely over my curly bob.</li>
            <li>Very soft and comfortable while keeping the water out.</li>
            <li>This shower cap keeps my head warm and dry and its soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>was the same cap, and paid a lot more for it.  </li>
            <li>First of all it is a quality product; it fits my head and convers</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t happen with my old cheap one, as it was thinner and thus more flexible and could be positioned such that the elastic rested on my hairline and any marks weren&#x27;t visible.  </li>
            <li>This does exactly what you need it to do.</li>
            <li>It smelt funny when I first got it</li>
            <li>I purchased this cap it fits wonderfully over my head whether it is rolled up, wrapped, or just pulled back in my usual bun.  </li>
            <li>Whatever the case, I haven&#x27;t been able to locate one in any stores, so I finally decided to splurge on this one.</li>
            <li>And I love the yellow terry lined cloth inside.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad to see I&#x27;m not the only one who has had this issue!</li>
            <li>is my first time having a Terry Lined Shower Cap.  </li>
            <li>I am back to buy more.  </li>
            <li>I am back to purchase more as gifts and another for myself in case</li>
            <li>I have never had a better shower cap in my entire 63 years, and I&#x27;ve been through a bundle.</li>
            <li>Fabrics hold onto scents as well which is also why after several washes I have not fully been able to get the garbage smell out either.</li>
            <li>Great shower cap, but it does leave an indentation around your head if you accidentally wear it too low or for too long.  </li>
            <li>It smelled at first</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering several more in case someone decides to discontinue the product.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn cheap shower caps for years and finally decided to upgrade to something that would protect my hairline a little better and give me more room to fit my bun inside without pulling the edges too far.  </li>
            <li>It feels great and keeps your hair dry especially around the edges of the cap.</li>
            <li>otherwise, expect to be a little wet), and the print is sassy. :D</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I purchased a second one.</li>
            <li>With this cap, my hairline stays completely dry---and I wash and rinse my face in the shower, so water gets right against the cap---highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Love the generous size &amp; terry lining means no static in very fine, soft hair</li>
            <li>Love these- keeps your hair dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a strong odor</li>
            <li>It certainly met my expectations.</li>
            <li>But it certainly keeps the oversplash from the face and shoulders from dampening my hair.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have a large head.  </li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t speak for what happens if you put your head right under the showerhead, it works just fine to keep my hair dry and still let me wash my face and body.</li>
            <li>The band is nice and tight but it does not leave a mark on my forehead as others have said.</li>
            <li>I really like how large it is and the terry cloth interior.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough for keeping hair dry, but has anyone else noticed the smell?!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just plain cute!  </li>
            <li>Having the towel lining just made it a real pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really well-made and no water leaks through.</li>
            <li>Comfortable; like the look, but with only a terrycloth lining, the outer nylon material is NOT fully waterproof.</li>
            <li>colors are bright which I like and the terry lining is thick which it</li>
            <li>Kinda regret paying so much for a shower cap.</li>
            <li>I would recommend anybody who wants a shower cap to buy this item.</li>
            <li>Very pleased[[ASIN</li>
            <li>but I am able to wash my face and body and not have a wet head at all.  </li>
            <li>It did leave marks on my forehead from the elastic but those went away really fast.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s terry lined, very comfy and covers everything.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Cap worked very well up until the end.</li>
            <li>Its nice and heavy material and lined with terry cloth type fabric.  </li>
            <li>I even tested it by sticking my head directly under the shower head, and directing the spray right on the elastic band.</li>
            <li>This does a great job of keeping my hair dry and keeping it all underneath, but I really wish the elastic wasn&#x27;t so tight</li>
            <li>looks a lot more substantial than the other one.</li>
            <li>tight fit keeps out water, big enough I can fit a scrunchie or clip my hair up uner the cap - and stylish.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first cap at a beauty supply store about three years ago, and I am thrilled to find the exact same cap for sale on Amazon... for about $5 less.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if worth $9.50, maybe $7.50 the most,</li>
            <li>Actually, I bought two - one to take my elderly Mother who using a cap to clean her face, put on makeup, in the shower, etc - think she&#x27;ll be delighted.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>It seals fine and keeps my hair perfectly dry in the shower.</li>
            <li>The elastic band will stretch out over time but by then, you really should be changing it out for a new one anyways.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless it worked well, was comfortable and kept my hair dry in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this product, such a simple thing that works so well.</li>
            <li>I have been satisfied enough with this shower cap to buy several (for home, travel, etc.).</li>
            <li>Really tight but cute</li>
            <li>Well made, high quality shower cap.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shower cap.</li>
            <li>This shower cap seems to be a little better quality than others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough for my somewhat large head ( but would fit an average head just fine), fits singly enough to keep the water out, and with the soft liner is very</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to fit over my entire hairline.</li>
            <li>This shower cap really keeps my hair from getting soaked in the shower even under direct spray.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, but expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to those cheapy ones at the drugstores that barely fit your head and your nape gets all wet in the shower.</li>
            <li>This is great for thick and/or long hair.  </li>
            <li>I love using this as I cannot wash my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li>it would come in a few more color choices.</li>
            <li>This shower cap is super cute but failed to meet my expectations after the positive reviews on it I had read.</li>
            <li>I browsed around  a bit, but I really felt most were cheap, and would rip after a few uses, or under a heavy towel on a hook.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase a new Shower Cap.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s nothing new for shower caps</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for making a product that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s color treated, is curly, and is super dry.</li>
            <li>Large enough for my very long thick hair, keeps my hair dry and fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>It covers my big ol&#x27; head, the terry lining helps keep things dry and smooth under there(as long as you&#x27;re not spending the entire shower with your head directly under the showerhead, you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I decided to look for a shower cap on Amazon; I usually buy everything else here, so</li>
            <li>It gets everywhere, and is pretty gross when it&#x27;s running.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many shower caps and they are all too small as I put my hair in a bun when I shower.</li>
            <li>This is a nice cap but was never tight enough to keep my shoulder length hair dry even if I put a headband under to pull hair back and used a ponytail holder to get hair up away from the edges.</li>
            <li>and it is a nice, thick cap with elastic that will help keep her hair dry without her having to tie her hair in a head band first</li>
            <li>It is plenty big to fit all the hair in, even long hair</li>
            <li>And can be thrown in the wash to keep fresh; just line dry.</li>
            <li>Tight and secure</li>
            <li>Well make, big enough, lined nicely and actually keeps my hair dry.  </li>
            <li>As far as shower caps go (and they really don&#x27;t go far) -</li>
            <li>turned my 43 year old wife into a 65 year old.</li>
            <li>completely ice print too pricy seen cheaper one in the market</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to create waste by using a bunch of the cheap drugstore shower caps, but I might end up doing that anyway.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t stand with my head under the shower spray if I&#x27;m using it so can&#x27;t verify how waterproof it is with direct water contact.  </li>
            <li>Since I have gone natural this was something that would not do.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered my second shower cap (with the same Safari Spots print) because the elastic on my first one, which I bought exactly 2 years ago, finally gave up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough to be comfortable while accommodating my larger sized head and maybe rollers.</li>
            <li>I bought this looking for a shower cap that helped detract from a grandma look of my old one.  </li>
            <li>When hubby joins me unexpectedly in the shower</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t put your head completely under the water, but you shouldn&#x27;t do that anyway with a cap on.  </li>
            <li>It was/is such a god send when I wear my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Old school hair cap.</li>
            <li>It  was worth every penny I spent on it.</li>
            <li>Nice and roomy, and over the last year I have washed and dried numerous times.  </li>
            <li>Even when I forget to grab a hair tie, this contains all of my many, thick hairs effortlessly.</li>
            <li>I often stand under a hot shower and let the spray work the knots out of my neck and shoulders, and when I get out of the shower, my hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li>I wish it came in more subtle colors, but who cares, no one sees me wearing it.</li>
            <li>Second day hair is an entirely different subject and challenge :)</li>
            <li>Perhaps a smaller size (not the elastic part, but the main part) would alleviate this problem...</li>
            <li>My last one consistently had a moldy smell despite regular washings.</li>
            <li>Large -- lots of room for long or curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the larger size, I feel like I can actually get all my hair into it without having it tight on my head.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a quality lined shower cap that would keep my hair dry in the shower and not move around too much.  </li>
            <li>The cap is large enough to cover my long hair held up by a barrette.</li>
            <li>Terry lined caps are hard to locate and have them fit and cover all your hair</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised to put this on and have extra room on my head!</li>
            <li>The elastic band, although not tight, has a tendency to make train tracks across the middle of my forehead.  </li>
            <li>It was never tight enough</li>
            <li>An earlier New Pink Puppy shower cap was suppose to be New.</li>
            <li>Tip: has a slight plastic/ chemical smell when first opened-</li>
            <li>Yay, I can go for a quick shower without having to do my hair everyday!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to get excited about it.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have a large head, nor do I have long and heavy hair, so the cap seems very oversized to me.</li>
            <li>Also large enough for women with long hair or big heads..</li>
            <li>The cap is indeed larger than average, which is good for my long thick hair....</li>
            <li>not, I&#x27;ll happily keep it as a backup because I can&#x27;t ever again use a plastic shower cap that flattens my hair and isn&#x27;t quite large enough to accomodate chin-length hair that leave little wet sprigs in all the wrong places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cap is big enough to cover my hair completely.</li>
            <li>For some reason this leopard print shower cap has a strong smell and the elastic is weak</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t intend to stand directly under the running water</li>
            <li>I am super active, I washed my hair every day due to sweat and vanity, I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out.</li>
            <li>and it makes all the difference in the world as far as keeping my hair dry.</li>
            <li>Kept my very long hair secure from getting wet and the elastic band was not so tight to be unconfortable.</li>
            <li>The cap is large and tight enough on the band that keeps the water away from my hair.  </li>
            <li>The elastic is comfortable, and the cap is durable (previous caps give out after a few uses, either the elastic bursts or the cap itself springs a leak).</li>
            <li>Very well made &amp; elastic trim is not to tight.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if two years of life for elastic is good or bad.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve washed it in the dishwasher  and by hand (don&#x27;t have my own washer at home) and it stood up.</li>

            <li> The cap is large and has great quality.</li>
            <li> Also the terry cloth liner makes a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> I agree with one of the reviewers, the cap looks cute and fits well but not fully waterproof.  </li>
            <li> comfortable to wear and effective</li>

            <li> it &#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel frisky when I wear it  :)</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I do love this though.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to keep adjusting to find the magic way to cover all your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shower cap.</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe not,</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This shower cap is cute and does what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li> No complaints after more than 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> , what more could you want in a shower cap?</li>
            <li> and this is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love this shower cap.</li>
            <li> B00385WMH8 Betty Dain Stylish Design Terry Lined Shower Cap, The Socialite Collection, \\&quot;safari</li>
            <li> Great shower cap, very sturdy material, and chamois material on the inside.  </li>
            <li> But, the way I see it: I paid 10 bucks for two years of good hair protection in the shower, and that&#x27;s worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, I use it every two days.</li>
            <li> The pattern seems to be the best choice of this brand although solid fashion colors would be preferable.</li>
            <li> most of the plastic shower caps tend to.</li>
            <li> Love this shower cap.</li>
            <li> T elastic is covered, and feels more substantial than most, so I doubt there will be a problem with it stretching out of shape.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and my style stylish.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this cap.</li>
            <li> I have two of these and love them.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> love the terry lining</li>
            <li> I like that this cap does not have the water collecting fringe along the edge that many caps have.</li>
            <li> I love the terry cloth on the inside.</li>
            <li> So stylish.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I would think of the terry cloth lining, but I love love love it.  </li>
            <li> I really love this shower cap&lt;</li>
            <li> I love this shower cap because it keeps my hair dryer than any I have ever had</li>
            <li> The lining is not terry cloth like most of the lined shower caps, but more like a microfiber material.</li>
            <li> Love leopard print.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> The leopard design is also cute.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the look and engineering of this cap but the smell....</li>
            <li> Interestingly bought the Betty Dain</li>
            <li> I have tried washing it three times and it still has an overwhelming chemically smell.</li>
            <li> The material is more like cloth and not plastic</li>
            <li> But it worked better than the cheapie dollar store ones I had been using.</li>
            <li> The cotton on the inside wasn&#x27;t a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> Cute.</li>
            <li> and i get compliments on it all the time :)</li>
            <li> This has great coverage, it&#x27;s secure, and the soft lining feels really nice.</li>
            <li> the shower and the elastic banding holds my full head of hair nicely.</li>
            <li> I loved this at first, but when it came time for the company to help me out with a warranty issue after the elastic went, they dropped the ball.  </li>
            <li> Three years is pretty darned good for a shower cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A good shower cap is hard to find but this is a great shower cap!</li>
            <li> This cap fits perfectly and keeps all of my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I really like it and besides work very well, it is beautiful !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about my shower caps and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> This will cover any amount of hair you have, easy on and stays in place, easy to get all my hair under.</li>
            <li> It keeps moisture out well and lets me easily wash all areas of my face.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to get on.</li>
            <li> The quality of materials is good, but for regular use it&#x27;s kind of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine, too.</li>
            <li> This is a SUPER SHOWER CAP!</li>
            <li> Good size for long hair, nice fit, sturdy and just so practical -even</li>
            <li> Love it, keeps my hair dry and is a great gift for friends and family</li>
            <li> Finally i got the very good shower cap, it&#x27;s worth buying it.</li>
            <li> It is the equivalent of the four food groups in shower caps: roomy, comfortable, waterproof and lined.  </li>
            <li> I have mid-shoulder length hair, it fits comfortably inside this shower cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very luxurious feel, nice fabric and terry</li>
            <li> this one, terry lined, and comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t leave a indent around my hair line.</li>
            <li> It is a FABULOUS cap.</li>
            <li> KUDOS to you, Betty Dain, for designing such a great product.</li>
            <li> This cap is generous in size, will fit all your hair</li>
            <li> so it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> This cap is comfortable.</li>
            <li> This shower cap is so fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this shower cap, since the design looks much cooler than most!  </li>
            <li> I do wish it was slightly smaller as it is pretty oversized, but it is very comfortable &amp; the quality is great.</li>
            <li> I just wish you would come out with other designs with the terry cloth lining - e.g., classy polka dots in beautiful colors would be nice. :)</li>
            <li> In another order, the Safari cap was sent clean and odor free.</li>
            <li> It is easy to put on and dries quickly afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have a head that is somewhat small and its still fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great for people with long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s heavier than my head.</li>
            <li> Of all the things to be ridiculously excited about...</li>
            <li> Very good quality, stays put and offers complete coverage.</li>
            <li> I clean it hi-weekly, but still gets that smell.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s it , don&#x27;t have much to say, just comfortable, stylish like photo, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT because it is comfortable to wear &amp; keeps my hair dry with its nice terry cloth lining.</li>
            <li> I laugh at myself every time I put it on because it;s so huge</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s snug around the head so that water stays out but not painfully snug.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did because it works very well when I&#x27;m between hair washing days.</li>
            <li> So cute and durable - this is a high quality item!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about it.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s good for water conservation, but it would be WAY better with a wider edge and/or elastic that wasn&#x27;t so tight.</li>
            <li> , there is a huge difference for the better if you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day as far as color retention goes.</li>
            <li> But this is seriously the best shower cap I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This hat is made well, drys quickly after</li>
            <li> Most caps gape and if they have any kind of terry inside it stays wet and gets moldy even if you hang it somewhere in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> The added bonus to this particular cap is that it&#x27;s stylish.</li>
            <li> and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> better quality then I expected and it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> Highly recommend:)</li>
            <li> The cap itself is great, but the elastic fit is very tight around my head.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, it&#x27;s very soft on the inside which I was looking for and covers the hair really well and stylish!</li>
            <li> Does a good job in keeping hair dry.</li>
            <li> First of all, it smelled like garbage!</li>
            <li> Use it almost daily - love it!</li>
            <li> It fit over my large head with ease.</li>
            <li> They are large and allows you to style hair and shower without crushing your hair.</li>
            <li> The size is huge, so if you have a lot of hair this would really work for you.  </li>
            <li> It is both comfortable and fits very snuggly.  </li>
            <li> I just have to make sure to not go directly under the shower.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This makes me smile every time I take a shower.  </li>
            <li> Brings a smile to the mirror.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30s, have been using shower caps for about 12 years and this is my favorite one so far.</li>
            <li> The shower caps come in fun colors and styles  and are ample for &amp;#34;big hair&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;long hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> lined shower cap in a pink print on Amazon as well and it has no smell, has good quality elastic</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It has microfiber material on the inside, so its not cold feeling like the plastic ones are.</li>
            <li> I have a normal size head, so the cap fits just fine.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair dry, I love that it is terry lined on the inside!</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite feature/benefit -- who wants to step out of the shower with a clean body and a sweaty head?  :-O</li>
            <li> Really good quality cap, have had mine over a year ago now and it&#x27;s still like new after several washes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Size is nice and large which I need and terry lining is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> It has a good elastic, and a very soft inner lining.</li>
            <li> Works better than non lined, fit nice not too tight not loose at all.</li>
            <li> I have a large, rain-style shower-head in my shower (with good-pressure water), and it splashes directly all over the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> Love this shower hat with the terry lining - wish they had more styles and they were a little cheaper</li>
            <li> This one seems to have some dry quick fabric inside, and it fit&#x27;s well and securely over my curly bob.</li>
            <li> Very soft and comfortable while keeping the water out.</li>
            <li> This shower cap keeps my head warm and dry and its soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> was the same cap, and paid a lot more for it.  </li>
            <li> First of all it is a quality product; it fits my head and convers</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t happen with my old cheap one, as it was thinner and thus more flexible and could be positioned such that the elastic rested on my hairline and any marks weren&#x27;t visible.  </li>
            <li> This does exactly what you need it to do.</li>
            <li> It smelt funny when I first got it</li>
            <li> I purchased this cap it fits wonderfully over my head whether it is rolled up, wrapped, or just pulled back in my usual bun.  </li>
            <li> Whatever the case, I haven&#x27;t been able to locate one in any stores, so I finally decided to splurge on this one.</li>
            <li> And I love the yellow terry lined cloth inside.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to see I&#x27;m not the only one who has had this issue!</li>
            <li> is my first time having a Terry Lined Shower Cap.  </li>
            <li> I am back to buy more.  </li>
            <li> I am back to purchase more as gifts and another for myself in case</li>
            <li> I have never had a better shower cap in my entire 63 years, and I&#x27;ve been through a bundle.</li>
            <li> Fabrics hold onto scents as well which is also why after several washes I have not fully been able to get the garbage smell out either.</li>
            <li> Great shower cap, but it does leave an indentation around your head if you accidentally wear it too low or for too long.  </li>
            <li> It smelled at first</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering several more in case someone decides to discontinue the product.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn cheap shower caps for years and finally decided to upgrade to something that would protect my hairline a little better and give me more room to fit my bun inside without pulling the edges too far.  </li>
            <li> It feels great and keeps your hair dry especially around the edges of the cap.</li>
            <li> otherwise, expect to be a little wet), and the print is sassy. :D</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I purchased a second one.</li>
            <li> With this cap, my hairline stays completely dry---and I wash and rinse my face in the shower, so water gets right against the cap---highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the generous size &amp; terry lining means no static in very fine, soft hair</li>
            <li> Love these- keeps your hair dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a strong odor</li>
            <li> It certainly met my expectations.</li>
            <li> But it certainly keeps the oversplash from the face and shoulders from dampening my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a large head.  </li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t speak for what happens if you put your head right under the showerhead, it works just fine to keep my hair dry and still let me wash my face and body.</li>
            <li> The band is nice and tight but it does not leave a mark on my forehead as others have said.</li>
            <li> I really like how large it is and the terry cloth interior.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough for keeping hair dry, but has anyone else noticed the smell?!  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just plain cute!  </li>
            <li> Having the towel lining just made it a real pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really well-made and no water leaks through.</li>
            <li> Comfortable; like the look, but with only a terrycloth lining, the outer nylon material is NOT fully waterproof.</li>
            <li> colors are bright which I like and the terry lining is thick which it</li>
            <li> Kinda regret paying so much for a shower cap.</li>
            <li> I would recommend anybody who wants a shower cap to buy this item.</li>
            <li> Very pleased[[ASIN</li>
            <li> but I am able to wash my face and body and not have a wet head at all.  </li>
            <li> It did leave marks on my forehead from the elastic but those went away really fast.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s terry lined, very comfy and covers everything.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> Cap worked very well up until the end.</li>
            <li> Its nice and heavy material and lined with terry cloth type fabric.  </li>
            <li> I even tested it by sticking my head directly under the shower head, and directing the spray right on the elastic band.</li>
            <li> This does a great job of keeping my hair dry and keeping it all underneath, but I really wish the elastic wasn&#x27;t so tight</li>
            <li> looks a lot more substantial than the other one.</li>
            <li> tight fit keeps out water, big enough I can fit a scrunchie or clip my hair up uner the cap - and stylish.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first cap at a beauty supply store about three years ago, and I am thrilled to find the exact same cap for sale on Amazon... for about $5 less.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if worth $9.50, maybe $7.50 the most,</li>
            <li> Actually, I bought two - one to take my elderly Mother who using a cap to clean her face, put on makeup, in the shower, etc - think she&#x27;ll be delighted.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> It seals fine and keeps my hair perfectly dry in the shower.</li>
            <li> The elastic band will stretch out over time but by then, you really should be changing it out for a new one anyways.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless it worked well, was comfortable and kept my hair dry in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this product, such a simple thing that works so well.</li>
            <li> I have been satisfied enough with this shower cap to buy several (for home, travel, etc.).</li>
            <li> Really tight but cute</li>
            <li> Well made, high quality shower cap.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shower cap.</li>
            <li> This shower cap seems to be a little better quality than others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough for my somewhat large head ( but would fit an average head just fine), fits singly enough to keep the water out, and with the soft liner is very</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough to fit over my entire hairline.</li>
            <li> This shower cap really keeps my hair from getting soaked in the shower even under direct spray.  </li>
            <li> Great quality, but expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to those cheapy ones at the drugstores that barely fit your head and your nape gets all wet in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is great for thick and/or long hair.  </li>
            <li> I love using this as I cannot wash my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> it would come in a few more color choices.</li>
            <li> This shower cap is super cute but failed to meet my expectations after the positive reviews on it I had read.</li>
            <li> I browsed around  a bit, but I really felt most were cheap, and would rip after a few uses, or under a heavy towel on a hook.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase a new Shower Cap.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s nothing new for shower caps</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for making a product that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s color treated, is curly, and is super dry.</li>
            <li> Large enough for my very long thick hair, keeps my hair dry and fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> It covers my big ol&#x27; head, the terry lining helps keep things dry and smooth under there(as long as you&#x27;re not spending the entire shower with your head directly under the showerhead, you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I decided to look for a shower cap on Amazon; I usually buy everything else here, so</li>
            <li> It gets everywhere, and is pretty gross when it&#x27;s running.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many shower caps and they are all too small as I put my hair in a bun when I shower.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cap but was never tight enough to keep my shoulder length hair dry even if I put a headband under to pull hair back and used a ponytail holder to get hair up away from the edges.</li>
            <li> and it is a nice, thick cap with elastic that will help keep her hair dry without her having to tie her hair in a head band first</li>
            <li> It is plenty big to fit all the hair in, even long hair</li>
            <li> And can be thrown in the wash to keep fresh; just line dry.</li>
            <li> Tight and secure</li>
            <li> Well make, big enough, lined nicely and actually keeps my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> As far as shower caps go (and they really don&#x27;t go far) -</li>
            <li> turned my 43 year old wife into a 65 year old.</li>
            <li> completely ice print too pricy seen cheaper one in the market</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to create waste by using a bunch of the cheap drugstore shower caps, but I might end up doing that anyway.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t stand with my head under the shower spray if I&#x27;m using it so can&#x27;t verify how waterproof it is with direct water contact.  </li>
            <li> Since I have gone natural this was something that would not do.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered my second shower cap (with the same Safari Spots print) because the elastic on my first one, which I bought exactly 2 years ago, finally gave up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough to be comfortable while accommodating my larger sized head and maybe rollers.</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a shower cap that helped detract from a grandma look of my old one.  </li>
            <li> When hubby joins me unexpectedly in the shower</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t put your head completely under the water, but you shouldn&#x27;t do that anyway with a cap on.  </li>
            <li> It was/is such a god send when I wear my hair straight.</li>
            <li> Old school hair cap.</li>
            <li> It  was worth every penny I spent on it.</li>
            <li> Nice and roomy, and over the last year I have washed and dried numerous times.  </li>
            <li> Even when I forget to grab a hair tie, this contains all of my many, thick hairs effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I often stand under a hot shower and let the spray work the knots out of my neck and shoulders, and when I get out of the shower, my hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in more subtle colors, but who cares, no one sees me wearing it.</li>
            <li> Second day hair is an entirely different subject and challenge :)</li>
            <li> Perhaps a smaller size (not the elastic part, but the main part) would alleviate this problem...</li>
            <li> My last one consistently had a moldy smell despite regular washings.</li>
            <li> Large -- lots of room for long or curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the larger size, I feel like I can actually get all my hair into it without having it tight on my head.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a quality lined shower cap that would keep my hair dry in the shower and not move around too much.  </li>
            <li> The cap is large enough to cover my long hair held up by a barrette.</li>
            <li> Terry lined caps are hard to locate and have them fit and cover all your hair</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised to put this on and have extra room on my head!</li>
            <li> The elastic band, although not tight, has a tendency to make train tracks across the middle of my forehead.  </li>
            <li> It was never tight enough</li>
            <li> An earlier New Pink Puppy shower cap was suppose to be New.</li>
            <li> Tip: has a slight plastic/ chemical smell when first opened-</li>
            <li> Yay, I can go for a quick shower without having to do my hair everyday!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get excited about it.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a large head, nor do I have long and heavy hair, so the cap seems very oversized to me.</li>
            <li> Also large enough for women with long hair or big heads..</li>
            <li> The cap is indeed larger than average, which is good for my long thick hair....</li>
            <li> not, I&#x27;ll happily keep it as a backup because I can&#x27;t ever again use a plastic shower cap that flattens my hair and isn&#x27;t quite large enough to accomodate chin-length hair that leave little wet sprigs in all the wrong places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cap is big enough to cover my hair completely.</li>
            <li> For some reason this leopard print shower cap has a strong smell and the elastic is weak</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t intend to stand directly under the running water</li>
            <li> I am super active, I washed my hair every day due to sweat and vanity, I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out.</li>
            <li> and it makes all the difference in the world as far as keeping my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Kept my very long hair secure from getting wet and the elastic band was not so tight to be unconfortable.</li>
            <li> The cap is large and tight enough on the band that keeps the water away from my hair.  </li>
            <li> The elastic is comfortable, and the cap is durable (previous caps give out after a few uses, either the elastic bursts or the cap itself springs a leak).</li>
            <li> Very well made &amp; elastic trim is not to tight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if two years of life for elastic is good or bad.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the elastic band quickly gets stretched out of shape.</li>
            <li> Though elastic is a bit tight, one only wears it a few minutes and the dry hair is worth it!</li>
            <li> Recommended for those with thick hair, large heads or some sort of combination!</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had mine long enough to tell.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.  </li>
            <li> There is plenty of room for my long hair in this cap and the elastic is snug enough to hold it in place.  </li>
            <li> Much cuter than the pale pink or blue granny ones, does it&#x27;s job too.</li>
            <li> However, my hair still seems to get wet especially at the back neckline of the cap when bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shower cap as it surpasses any I have owned over that past 45 yrs.</li>
            <li> , if you have a lot of hair, bushy and/or long and thick, or a large head, it is probably going to work well for you.</li>
            <li> my hair was dry but had that limp slightly frizzy look that you get when walking outside on a very humid day.</li>
            <li> Finally - a shower cap that keeps your hair from GETTING wet.</li>
            <li> My hair is long.  </li>
            <li> Eventually I have to throw them away because they tear after so long of me</li>
            <li> I ordered this one because it said mold resistant and it was oversized for people with long hair.</li>
            <li> I received this shower cap and expected it to be a lot bigger based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair,</li>
            <li> This cap keeps all my long hair dry in the shower.</li>
            <li> After removing it, my hair was dry enough to now, take a shower and start from scratch from all dry hair to all wet</li>
            <li> If you have short and fine hair and a small or medium sized head, then I it might be a bit frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I just throw it in the wash with my other clothes and tumble dry low on the dryer setting.</li>
            <li> but it has a very strange smell</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a cap that keeps my hair dry while I am under the shower, once used it dries in no time at all.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair dry w/o causing sweating; doesn&#x27;t slip around.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays dry and I have never been happier.  </li>
            <li> I can wash in the washing machine &amp; line dry.</li>
            <li> &amp; my hair dry.</li>
            <li> It is roomy and keeps the hair dry when showering.</li>
            <li> a plastic cap does when I hang it on the bathroom hook to dry.  </li>
            <li> Moving around, it kept my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> It does keep my hair dry when showering</li>
            <li> Keeps hair dry in the shower</li>
            <li> Keeps the hair dry without creating a steam bath inside.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair dry, but has a bit of a funky smell that takes awhile to fade away.</li>
            <li> I have owned this shower cap for about THREE YEARS, and it has been my trusty shower buddy for all this time, keeping my hair dry</li>
            <li> so I use this to keep my hair dry in the shower.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dry in the morning.  </li>
            <li> The cap fits snuggly and my hair stays dry.</li>
            <li> I had another cap that I alternated using to allow them to dry in between.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement product that will keep my hair, including my edges dry.</li>
            <li> It fits snug and keeps my hair completely dry in the shower.</li>
            <li> Let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair dry when I need it to.</li>
            <li> yet it is snug so all of my hair stays dry.</li>
            <li> The cap itself does keep my hair dry (and there&#x27;s enough space for my long hair), but it&#x27;s just not worth the mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The terry cloth was very absorbent and was storing water next to my hair, which I found out a little too late.  </li>
            <li> I usually hang it over my towel and my towel completely wreaks from it too.</li>
            <li> Holds all of my long hair without getting wet.</li>
            <li> The elastic wore out on my previous Betty Dain, after ~ 1 year of daily use (and desert dry air).</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair absolutely dry and all the humidity out!</li>
            <li> As the marks can last for maybe half an hour, I solve this by pushing the elastic band up toward my hairline where, for whatever reason, it doesn&#x27;t mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I found the elastic band so tight on my head, especially my forehead, it leaves a mark in the time it takes for me to take my shower.</li>
            <li> After the shower, my hair was wet and the terry cloth lining was soaked.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get wet.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s big and heavy and seems to get in the way whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair from getting wet.</li>
            <li> I had bought this same brand at Bed Bath and Beyond a few years ago</li>
            <li> No part of your hair will be wet after using.</li>
            <li> The life of the cap was roughly 2 yrs.</li>
            <li> The terry lined keeps your hair from feeling matted down when you get out of the shower and keeps it perfectly dry.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy and plenty big even though my thick hair comes down to my lower back.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of hair and you don&#x27;t want it to get wet in the shower, this is the cap you want to get!</li>
            <li> When I took the shower cap off after getting out of the shower I discovered that my hair was wet!  </li>
            <li> I could not wait to receive the shower cap after reading the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Does the job and doesn&#x27;t get my hair wet!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product for over two years, 4 stars given for the fact that I have to replace the cap every six months or so due to the elastic band wearing out making the cap</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have medium length hair that is several inches past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> so i have it when other wears out.  </li>
            <li> I decided to attempt to wash it every other day.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are correct about the terry cloth interior of the cap but the animal print fabric is not plastic, hence the humidity getting to my hair.</li>
            <li> When 1 is in the wash, the other is being used.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very thick hair, and other shower caps weren&#x27;t always big enough to cover it all and stay in place.  </li>
            <li> It does tend to slip down to my eyebrows and over half my face, but hey my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> This shower cap acquired a very sour odor after a few weeks even though it was cared for properly.</li>
            <li> It fits tightly so my hair never gets wet.  </li>
            <li> If it gets a little wet from the shower, I just hang it up overnight</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my mother who has had the same shower cap for at least 30 years.  </li>
            <li> not sure how long this i can keep it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, shoulder-length hair, and I can pull my hair back, put this shower cap on, and take a shower without my hair even getting damp.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it leaves marks on my forehead (they go away after about half an hour).</li>
            <li> The cap creeps down my forehead when showering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what some of the other reviewers are doing with their shower caps to make their hair wet...</li>
            <li> The only negative I would say is it is tight on my head and leaves a mark when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I have had very little if any water seeping around the edges and my hair is very dry after its use.</li>
            <li> It stinks like week old Chinese takeout.  </li>
            <li> It is lined with terry cloth, and the outer layer is a water-proofed fabric rather than the typical plastic</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and usually something is wet when I use a shower cap.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, long hair</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> The drug store caps are all too tight but this one fits well.</li>
            <li> but the elastic is too tight for me</li>
            <li> -- imagine how tight the cap would have to be to hold all you hair up...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t ride up but is also not too tight.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair</li>
            <li> The elastic is a little too tight</li>
            <li> And furthermore, Carmen and the other people with whom I spoke on the phone were extremely rash and rude, and couldn&#x27;t wait to get rid of me.  </li>
            <li> Other caps were too small.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this shower cap, but when I used it I was extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a little pricey but took a chance and bought it anyway</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> heavy duty, keeps hair out of water, terry type material on the inside.</li>
            <li> and/or the edging wasn&#x27;t so narrow.  </li>
            <li> Does not have that heavy chemical smell</li>
            <li> I never thought in a million years Id ever wear one of these, but I got to a point, where I needed to stop washing my hair everyday, but going to the gym everyday, warrants a shower.</li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews, i was hesitant.  </li>
            <li> but after a few showers the smell starts to go away.</li>
            <li> I only used it a couple times a week and was shocked when the elastic broke last week.</li>
            <li> Needless to say after that length of time the elastic left a lot to be desired.  </li>
            <li> I wear a size small in a hat</li>
            <li> but the smell was horrendous and I had to wash it 6 or 7 times for the smell to be faint enough for me to put it on my head.</li>
            <li> I have read a few of the negative reviews and can assure you that neither cap I purchased (in 2012 or 2017) had an odor or was runny.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair every other day, as it dries and frizzes out too badly otherwise.</li>
            <li> I just throw this bad boy on and it keeps my flat ironed hair from getting wet and curling/frizzing out again.</li>
            <li> That is less than 5 months of use, compared to less expensive caps</li>
            <li> They are getting hard to find with a terry lining</li>
            <li> I tried to return it but was too late to get a refund.</li>
            <li> It is now late February</li>
            <li> It does make me feel a bit like I&#x27;m in the 50&#x27;s and glam, at least when I&#x27;m not looking in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it 3-4 days a week for at least a month now</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair, and it all fits within this cap.</li>
            <li> This cap is thick because of it&#x27;s terry cloth lining</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Í don&#x27;t always buy expensive everyday items</li>
            <li> When I did finally use it, I was disappointed to find that the cap didn&#x27;t protect my hair from the humidity of the shower...</li>
            <li> Did a poor job  </li>
            <li> Smells horrible and makes me want to gag whole</li>
            <li> Was delivered in a poor state and had an offensive odor.</li>
            <li> While this cap fits really well, it smells horrible.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just not as bad as my other one.</li>
            <li> I have bad this shower cap since late November.</li>
            <li> It is quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This shower cap is useless.  </li>
            <li> I look so silly -</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I might as well have not worn one at all...</li>
            <li> so it is uncomfortable and marks my head.  </li>
            <li> Cant find anything wrong.  </li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, something changed and the caps are very poorly made now.</li>
            <li> However, they start to smell like dirty laundry after a year.</li>
            <li> I have washed it three times and it still stinks.</li>
            <li> has very odd smell disgusting smell.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel like a housewife from Mad Men.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad about this purchase.</li>
            <li> Smell was so bad when I opened box</li>
            <li> so I was amazed that it snapped and is now worthless.</li>
            <li> Well made but has a very unpleasant odor that I can&#x27;t soak out with oxyclean and detergent.</li>
            <li> The smell is soooooooooo bad!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This smells absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package, I was assaulted by a smell so horrible</li>
            <li> Elastic broke after I was washed it in a lingerie bag three times to try to remove the awful smell.</li>
            <li> it is terrible!  </li>
            <li> what on earth is this terrible smell????  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fits snugly. As pictured.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough for keeping hair dry, but has anyone else noticed the smell?!  It stinks like week old Chinese takeout.  Ick.</li>
            <li> Really good quality cap, have had mine over a year ago now and it&#x27;s still like new after several washes. I just throw it in the wash with my other clothes and tumble dry low on the dryer setting. I think it will last me years, actually.</li>
            <li> Holds all of my long hair without getting wet. Looks stunning, lol! And can be thrown in the wash to keep fresh; just line dry.</li>
            <li> I really like how large it is and the terry cloth interior.  The quality is good too.  Thank you. Bye.</li>
            <li> The cap itself is great, but the elastic fit is very tight around my head. It is quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best showercap. I do wish it was slightly smaller as it is pretty oversized, but it is very comfortable &amp; the quality is great. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This smells absolutely disgusting. As soon as I opened the package, I was assaulted by a smell so horrible I could taste it in my mouth. I wanted to throw up it was so gross. AVOID.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and usually something is wet when I use a shower cap. This has great coverage, it&#x27;s secure, and the soft lining feels really nice. Totally worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> Love these- keeps your hair dry</li>
            <li> I agree with one of the reviewers, the cap looks cute and fits well but not fully waterproof.  I just have to make sure to not go directly under the shower.  Not sure if worth $9.50, maybe $7.50 the most, but I do like the cap.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Hold all my hair which is a lot.  Fits well.</li>
            <li> As far as shower caps go (and they really don&#x27;t go far) - this was a good cap.  It fit over my large head with ease. Kept my very long hair secure from getting wet and the elastic band was not so tight to be unconfortable. Having the towel lining just made it a real pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of hair and you don&#x27;t want it to get wet in the shower, this is the cap you want to get! It is great! If you have shorter or thinner hair you probably don&#x27;t need one this big.</li>
            <li> comfortable to wear and effective</li>
            <li> Love this shower cap! Its really cute and does its job! The only negative I would say is it is tight on my head and leaves a mark when I get out of the shower. Well made, high quality shower cap.</li>
            <li> The cap is large enough to cover my long hair held up by a barrette. Other caps were too small. It certainly met my expectations.</li>
            <li> The cap is large and has great quality. The elastic band will stretch out over time but by then, you really should be changing it out for a new one anyways.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shower caps that I have ever used.  I have been looking for a cap that keeps my hair dry while I am under the shower, once used it dries in no time at all. Great for travel, I keep one in my shower and one in my suit case.</li>
            <li> I love this item... its very stylish and the material on the inside keeps out the moisture. I have a head that is somewhat small and its still fits perfectly. I love that it can be washed!</li>
            <li> This shower cap is so cute! It&#x27;s really well-made and no water leaks through. I have really thick, long hair and this keeps everything tucked away nicely.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Works great!</li>
            <li> Great cap. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Comfortable; like the look, but with only a terrycloth lining, the outer nylon material is NOT fully waterproof. As long as you don&#x27;t intend to stand directly under the running water it &#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> has very odd smell disgusting smell.</li>
            <li> Love it. Very soft and comfortable while keeping the water out.</li>
            <li> Even when I forget to grab a hair tie, this contains all of my many, thick hairs effortlessly.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase.  I bought one over three years ago and the elastic finally died last week.  I bought, what I thought, was the same cap, and paid a lot more for it.  Did a poor job  compared to this Betty Dain cap.  This time I bought 2 of them.</li>
            <li> I love this shower cap! It covers my big ol&#x27; head, the terry lining helps keep things dry and smooth under there(as long as you&#x27;re not spending the entire shower with your head directly under the showerhead, you&#x27;ll be fine! otherwise, expect to be a little wet), and the print is sassy. :D The elastic is comfortable, and the cap is durable (previous caps give out after a few uses, either the elastic bursts or the cap itself springs a leak). All around, a good investment.</li>
            <li> This is great for thick and/or long hair.  I love using this as I cannot wash my hair everyday.  This holds all my hair in and doesn&#x27;t leak at all.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this shower cap, but when I used it I was extremely disappointed.  When I took the shower cap off after getting out of the shower I discovered that my hair was wet!  The shower cap was soaking.  The terry cloth was very absorbent and was storing water next to my hair, which I found out a little too late.  Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> This shower cap is useless.  After the shower, my hair was wet and the terry cloth lining was soaked.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Tight and secure so no water gets in anywhere.</li>
            <li> Probably the best made shower cap I&#x27;ve ever used.  It has a good elastic, and a very soft inner lining.</li>
            <li> Í don&#x27;t always buy expensive everyday items but when I do, its because of items like this.</li>
            <li> Cute! Works like a charm. Makes me feel frisky when I wear it  :)</li>
            <li> I love these. However, they start to smell like dirty laundry after a year. I clean it hi-weekly, but still gets that smell. I do love this though. Best shower cap out there.</li>
            <li> turned my 43 year old wife into a 65 year old.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and roomy shower cap nice print covers head completely ice print too pricy seen cheaper one in the market</li>
            <li> They must have fitted this to a basketball.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I am writing a review for a shower cap.  But this is seriously the best shower cap I have ever used. Unlike a lot of shower caps this is a generous size. Great for people with long hair. You don&#x27;t have to keep adjusting to find the magic way to cover all your hair. Also the terry cloth liner makes a HUGE difference! It feels great and keeps your hair dry especially around the edges of the cap. Very comfortable. I bought an extra one to keep in my suitcase for trips. So nice!</li>
            <li> This shower cap seems to be a little better quality than others I&#x27;ve had. However, my hair still seems to get wet especially at the back neckline of the cap when bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a large head, nor do I have long and heavy hair, so the cap seems very oversized to me. The cap creeps down my forehead when showering. So I am constantly pushing it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have a lot of hair, bushy and/or long and thick, or a large head, it is probably going to work well for you. If you have short and fine hair and a small or medium sized head, then I it might be a bit frustrating.  Definitely one size does not work for all.</li>
            <li> Puma. Mountain lion. Lynx. Leopard. Cheetah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I&#x27;m not talking about Mac Operating Systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m talkin about that ROWR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn your shower into a jungle scene.</li>
            <li> All shower caps are not created equal.  This one is perfect!  Well make, big enough, lined nicely and actually keeps my hair dry.  Not to mention it&#x27;s cute!!!</li>
            <li> The elastic is a little too tight</li>
            <li> Fits great even with longer hair. Keeps the water out.</li>
            <li> First of all it is a quality product; it fits my head and convers all my hair&lt;br /&gt;The colors are bright which I like and the terry lining is thick which it what I like.  Terry lined caps are hard to locate and have them fit and cover all your hair</li>
            <li> Large -- lots of room for long or curly hair.  Keeps hair dry w/o causing sweating; doesn&#x27;t slip around.  My only complaint is that it leaves marks on my forehead (they go away after about half an hour). This didn&#x27;t happen with my old cheap one, as it was thinner and thus more flexible and could be positioned such that the elastic rested on my hairline and any marks weren&#x27;t visible.  Perhaps a smaller size (not the elastic part, but the main part) would alleviate this problem... Either way it is as described and works well.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my mother who has had the same shower cap for at least 30 years.  Needless to say after that length of time the elastic left a lot to be desired.  I purchased this shower cap for her and it is a nice, thick cap with elastic that will help keep her hair dry without her having to tie her hair in a head band first so it doesn&#x27;t get wet.  This will probably be the last shower cap she will ever need....looks a lot more substantial than the other one.</li>
            <li> I love this shower cap. I have thick, shoulder-length hair, and I can pull my hair back, put this shower cap on, and take a shower without my hair even getting damp. I even tested it by sticking my head directly under the shower head, and directing the spray right on the elastic band. I often stand under a hot shower and let the spray work the knots out of my neck and shoulders, and when I get out of the shower, my hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li> The quality of materials is good, but for regular use it&#x27;s kind of a hassle. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s heavier than my head. Ok, maybe not, but it&#x27;s big and heavy and seems to get in the way whenever I use it. It seals fine and keeps my hair perfectly dry in the shower. It does tend to slip down to my eyebrows and over half my face, but hey my hair is dry. Kinda regret paying so much for a shower cap. I didn&#x27;t want to create waste by using a bunch of the cheap drugstore shower caps, but I might end up doing that anyway.</li>
            <li> This shower cap really keeps my hair from getting soaked in the shower even under direct spray.  Its nice and heavy material and lined with terry cloth type fabric.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This shower cap may be roomy, but it smelled. I tried to return it but was too late to get a refund. Save your money, do not buy this item.</li>
            <li> This will cover any amount of hair you have, easy on and stays in place, easy to get all my hair under.</li>
            <li> This shower cap is cute and does what it&#x27;s intended to do. While I can&#x27;t speak for what happens if you put your head right under the showerhead, it works just fine to keep my hair dry and still let me wash my face and body.</li>
            <li> This hat is made well, drys quickly after the shower and the elastic banding holds my full head of hair nicely. No complaints after more than 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> Finally - a shower cap that keeps your hair from GETTING wet. This does exactly what you need it to do. Keeps your hair from getting wet. It&#x27;s snug around the head so that water stays out but not painfully snug. It smelt funny when I first got it so I just turned it inside out and popped it into the washer. No smell after that! If you are looking for a good shower cap, this is it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t stand with my head under the shower spray if I&#x27;m using it so can&#x27;t verify how waterproof it is with direct water contact.  But it certainly keeps the oversplash from the face and shoulders from dampening my hair.  Very nicely made and it&#x27;s actually roomy.</li>
            <li> Adorable!  This makes me smile every time I take a shower.  Nice quality and cute, what more could you want in a shower cap?</li>
            <li> Smells horrible and makes me want to gag whole I&#x27;m wearing it.  Elastic broke after I was washed it in a lingerie bag three times to try to remove the awful smell.</li>
            <li> cap is just as explained...heavy duty, keeps hair out of water, terry type material on the inside. just what I wanted.  Also large enough for women with long hair or big heads..</li>
            <li> Finally i got the very good shower cap, it&#x27;s worth buying it. not sure how long this i can keep it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this product, such a simple thing that works so well. I only wash my hair every other day, as it dries and frizzes out too badly otherwise. I just throw this bad boy on and it keeps my flat ironed hair from getting wet and curling/frizzing out again. It&#x27;s also nice when trying to wash my face and keeping my hair out of the fray. It&#x27;s got a terry cloth lining which keeps my head from sweating, which would defeat the purpose. Love it!</li>
            <li> Holds my hair in and does the job!</li>
            <li> This is almost to big for me. I laugh at myself every time I put it on because it;s so huge I look so silly - but for someone with a lot of hair, it would be perfect. Seems to work fine, too. But I don&#x27;t run my head under water either when I wear it, so I don&#x27;t know how well it would keep water out if you put your head IN the water.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s it , don&#x27;t have much to say, just comfortable, stylish like photo, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. BUY ONE.</li>
            <li> Well made but has a very unpleasant odor that I can&#x27;t soak out with oxyclean and detergent.</li>
            <li> After having used up my supply of hotel shower caps, I thought it was time to invest in a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; one.  The terry lined keeps your hair from feeling matted down when you get out of the shower and keeps it perfectly dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about my shower caps and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It keeps moisture out well and lets me easily wash all areas of my face.</li>
            <li> How did I do without this??  I&#x27;m trying to avoid washing my hair every shower to save my color and this is fantastic!  Actually, I bought two - one to take my elderly Mother who using a cap to clean her face, put on makeup, in the shower, etc - think she&#x27;ll be delighted.&lt;br /&gt;If not, I&#x27;ll happily keep it as a backup because I can&#x27;t ever again use a plastic shower cap that flattens my hair and isn&#x27;t quite large enough to accomodate chin-length hair that leave little wet sprigs in all the wrong places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it&#x27;s just plain cute!  Brings a smile to the mirror.</li>
            <li> Great quality and like it very much.  It  was worth every penny I spent on it. I would recommend anybody who wants a shower cap to buy this item.</li>
            <li> Terrific. Best ever!!</li>
            <li> Works well, it&#x27;s your standard shower cap with the addition of the terry cloth lining. Has held up great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a big deal, but i wsh it would come in a few more color choices.</li>
            <li> Cute and good quality.</li>
            <li> Of all the things to be ridiculously excited about... a shower cap? But y&#x27;all - all my hair fits in it. ALL. MY. HAIR. Without exposing my hairline and defeating the purpose of a shower cap. Hallelujah!!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST shower cap EVER!!! LUVS it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this shower cap. Large enough for my very long thick hair, keeps my hair dry and fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> This does a great job of keeping my hair dry and keeping it all underneath, but I really wish the elastic wasn&#x27;t so tight and/or the edging wasn&#x27;t so narrow.  It leaves a DEEP red line on my forehead if I don&#x27;t take the world&#x27;s shortest shower.  So deep that it&#x27;s still there when I get to work.  I guess it&#x27;s good for water conservation, but it would be WAY better with a wider edge and/or elastic that wasn&#x27;t so tight.</li>
            <li> An earlier New Pink Puppy shower cap was suppose to be New. Was delivered in a poor state and had an offensive odor. In another order, the Safari cap was sent clean and odor free. Very pleased[[ASIN:B00385WMH8 Betty Dain Stylish Design Terry Lined Shower Cap, The Socialite Collection, \\&quot;safari Spots\\&quot;]] with this cap.</li>
            <li> I could not wait to receive the shower cap after reading the other reviews.  Unfortunately I might as well have not worn one at all...my hair is drenched!  Perhaps the one I received is defective.  Will definitely be returning it.</li>
            <li> Great quality and does what it&#x27;s supposed to :)</li>
            <li> I have tried shower caps from all over and they always left my edges damp.  Since I have gone natural this was something that would not do.  I purchased this cap it fits wonderfully over my head whether it is rolled up, wrapped, or just pulled back in my usual bun.  My hair stays dry and I have never been happier.  Thanks so much for making a product that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect. The drug store caps are all too tight but this one fits well. Does a good job in keeping hair dry.</li>
            <li> Nice cap! So nice to find a shower cap with a terry lining ,,, plus,,,, so cute! I can wash in the washing machine &amp; line dry. Very well made &amp; elastic trim is not to tight. Keeps water out! &amp; my hair dry.</li>
            <li> This shower cap is  perfect. It is roomy and keeps the hair dry when showering. I love it so much that I purchased a second one.</li>
            <li> Most caps gape and if they have any kind of terry inside it stays wet and gets moldy even if you hang it somewhere in the bathroom. This one seems to have some dry quick fabric inside, and it fit&#x27;s well and securely over my curly bob. I wish it came in more subtle colors, but who cares, no one sees me wearing it. Yay, I can go for a quick shower without having to do my hair everyday!</li>
            <li> Great shower cap, very sturdy material, and chamois material on the inside.  Looks hilarious on, but it does the job!</li>
            <li> This shower cap acquired a very sour odor after a few weeks even though it was cared for properly.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, stays put and offers complete coverage.</li>
            <li> Smell was so bad when I opened box I was hit with this chemical smell.  I&#x27;m on my second washing and after reading another review I guess it takes about 5-6 washings before the odor goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size is nice and large which I need and terry lining is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised to put this on and have extra room on my head! I love the larger size, I feel like I can actually get all my hair into it without having it tight on my head. Recommended for those with thick hair, large heads or some sort of combination!</li>
            <li> Whatever the case, I haven&#x27;t been able to locate one in any stores, so I finally decided to splurge on this one. I&#x27;m glad I did because it works very well when I&#x27;m between hair washing days.</li>
            <li> Great cap.  Large and comfortable, works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Awesome shower cap! Does the job and doesn&#x27;t get my hair wet! And I love the yellow terry lined cloth inside. Great product.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second shower cap (with the same Safari Spots print) because the elastic on my first one, which I bought exactly 2 years ago, finally gave up.  I don&#x27;t know if two years of life for elastic is good or bad.  But, the way I see it: I paid 10 bucks for two years of good hair protection in the shower, and that&#x27;s worth it to me.  So, I&#x27;m back again for another.  I like that the cap is big (I have lots of hair and don&#x27;t like to struggle shoving it into a smaller cap) and it doesn&#x27;t drip like a plastic cap does when I hang it on the bathroom hook to dry.  Terry liner is nice.  Feels good.</li>
            <li> The cap is indeed larger than average, which is good for my long thick hair.... However, I found the elastic band so tight on my head, especially my forehead, it leaves a mark in the time it takes for me to take my shower. I&#x27;m planning to modify band with additional elastic ... Which should be an eay fix.</li>
            <li> This is the best shower cap I have ever owned.  It is the equivalent of the four food groups in shower caps: roomy, comfortable, waterproof and lined.  A big plus is the quality elastic band.  I am so glad that I decided to look for a shower cap on Amazon; I usually buy everything else here, so why not this?</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair, and it all fits within this cap. Keeps my hair dry, I love that it is terry lined on the inside!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this shower cap, since the design looks much cooler than most!  But I think the design lasted about 4-5 wears before it started to run.  It gets everywhere, and is pretty gross when it&#x27;s running.  The cap itself does keep my hair dry (and there&#x27;s enough space for my long hair), but it&#x27;s just not worth the mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to see I&#x27;m not the only one who has had this issue!</li>
            <li> This cap keeps all my long hair dry in the shower. Nice lining, plenty of room for a ponytail. Makes me feel like a housewife from Mad Men.</li>
            <li> I recently had my bathroom redone.  I decided to purchase a new Shower Cap.  I saw this one and decided to try it.  I just took a nice bubble bath wearing this cap.  My hair is long.  Moving around, it kept my hair dry.  After removing it, my hair was dry enough to now, take a shower and start from scratch from all dry hair to all wet hair!&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time having a Terry Lined Shower Cap.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shower cap so it&#x27;s hard to get excited about it.  It does keep my hair dry when showering but the elastic is too tight for me so it is uncomfortable and marks my head.  I wear a size small in a hat so I don&#x27;t have a large head.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and next time will probably not buy one on-line.</li>
            <li> I love this shower cap!!! It&#x27;s so efficient!</li>
            <li> I bought these because I wanted a shower cap I can wash. These caps are great. They are large and allows you to style hair and shower without crushing your hair. They go in the wash/dryer with laundry when needed.</li>
            <li> I am back to buy more.  Purchased this for my mother and myself.  It is a great shower cap!  Keeps hair dry in the shower (mind you I do not put my head under the water) but I am able to wash my face and body and not have a wet head at all.  The size is huge, so if you have a lot of hair this would really work for you.  I am back to purchase more as gifts and another for myself in case I cannot get at a later date.</li>
            <li> I have never had a better shower cap in my entire 63 years, and I&#x27;ve been through a bundle. Just get it.</li>
            <li> Cant find anything wrong.  Been using for about a month.  It is sturdy and plenty big even though my thick hair comes down to my lower back.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I use it every two days. I have mid-shoulder length hair, it fits comfortably inside this shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product for over two years, 4 stars given for the fact that I have to replace the cap every six months or so due to the elastic band wearing out making the cap useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro Tip: has a slight plastic/ chemical smell when first opened- spray inside liner with body spray. Fixes problem.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, it&#x27;s very soft on the inside which I was looking for and covers the hair really well and stylish!</li>
            <li> I have been satisfied enough with this shower cap to buy several (for home, travel, etc.). It&#x27;s big enough to be comfortable while accommodating my larger sized head and maybe rollers. And it seems to be waterproof while showering. Plus it is not coming apart after some use. The pattern seems to be the best choice of this brand although solid fashion colors would be preferable.</li>
            <li> Functional and cute! Good size for long hair, nice fit, sturdy and just so practical -even the steamiest shower won&#x27;t change my hair do. Even works well on my child, who loves taking a shower with it.</li>
            <li> Great! Doesn&#x27;t smell. Great quality, but expensive.</li>
            <li> Best shower cap I have found so far. Very luxurious feel, nice fabric and terry lined. Does not have that heavy chemical smell most of the plastic shower caps tend to. Only complaint is that the elastic band quickly gets stretched out of shape.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy shower cap and good for the price paid.  The added bonus to this particular cap is that it&#x27;s stylish.</li>
            <li> I loved this at first, but when it came time for the company to help me out with a warranty issue after the elastic went, they dropped the ball.  Not only was I told &amp;#34;NO&amp;#34;, but it took 3 phone calls and 2 emails to get anyone to give me an answer.  And furthermore, Carmen and the other people with whom I spoke on the phone were extremely rash and rude, and couldn&#x27;t wait to get rid of me.  They should not offer a warranty at all, or offer a &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; phone number if this is the way they treat customers.  I would not recommend this shower cap if you plan on laundering it.  This did not hold up to being put through the wash.</li>
            <li> This is a great shower cap.  It is both comfortable and fits very snuggly.  I have had very little if any water seeping around the edges and my hair is very dry after its use.</li>
            <li> My hair is just below chin length and this cap works great. Keeps the hair dry without creating a steam bath inside.</li>
            <li> Love this shower cap. It is lined with terry cloth, and the outer layer is a water-proofed fabric rather than the typical plastic, so your hair doesn&#x27;t get all sweaty while you shower. T elastic is covered, and feels more substantial than most, so I doubt there will be a problem with it stretching out of shape.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair dry, but has a bit of a funky smell that takes awhile to fade away.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair twice a week and the rest of the time I use a shower cap when I shower (often twice a day). I have purchased many shower caps and they are all too small as I put my hair in a bun when I shower. Eventually I have to throw them away because they tear after so long of me constantly pulling on the sides to cover my ears. My last one consistently had a moldy smell despite regular washings. I ordered this one because it said mold resistant and it was oversized for people with long hair. This cap is thick because of it&#x27;s terry cloth lining and I can see how after showering this cap could fall in your face if you didn&#x27;t have enough hair to hold it up. It says it is mold resistant but I haven&#x27;t had mine long enough to tell. The package does not indicate if it is machine washable but it looks like it is made well and durable enough to withstand the washing machine.    UPDATE: I have bad this shower cap since late November. It is now late February and I am  just now beginning to smell the must on this shower cap whenever I put it on.</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a shower cap that helped detract from a grandma look of my old one.  When hubby joins me unexpectedly in the shower and I hadn&#x27;t planned to wash my hair, although this doesn&#x27;t make me feel sexier, it&#x27;s just not as bad as my other one.</li>
            <li> This shower cap is very good. I really like it and besides work very well, it is beautiful ! Love it.</li>
            <li> I have owned this shower cap for about THREE YEARS, and it has been my trusty shower buddy for all this time, keeping my hair dry and my style stylish.  It even survived several months in my gym bag when were were renovating the house, and I had to shower at the gym.  ;-p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, nothing lasts forever, and the elastic finally gave out on one side.  I bought my first cap at a beauty supply store about three years ago, and I am thrilled to find the exact same cap for sale on Amazon... for about $5 less.  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  YES, it is waterproof.  I have a large, rain-style shower-head in my shower (with good-pressure water), and it splashes directly all over the top of my head.  The cap never leaked.  Not once.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The terry lining stops my hair from getting sweaty during a shower.  (Put plastic anything on your head, and your scalp is going to heat up.)  This is probably my favorite feature/benefit -- who wants to step out of the shower with a clean body and a sweaty head?  :-O&lt;br /&gt;3.  Long lasting.  Three years is pretty darned good for a shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The elastic band, although not tight, has a tendency to make train tracks across the middle of my forehead.  As the marks can last for maybe half an hour, I solve this by pushing the elastic band up toward my hairline where, for whatever reason, it doesn&#x27;t mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length hair that is several inches past my shoulders.  I clip my hair up, out of the way, and then put the shower cap over my head.  If I didn&#x27;t clip my hair up, it would just fall out.  This is actually a plus -- imagine how tight the cap would have to be to hold all you hair up... ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - - - -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s about it.  LOVE this cap.</li>
            <li> I have two of these and love them. I color my hair red and don&#x27;t want to wash my hair all the time so I use this to keep my hair dry in the shower. Even after months of use there&#x27;s never a moldy smell. I&#x27;ve ordered others with anti mold but they never worked. I love this product.</li>
            <li> It fits tightly so my hair never gets wet.  It looks and feels great.  It is not plastic so you can&#x27;t put your head completely under the water, but you shouldn&#x27;t do that anyway with a cap on.  If it gets a little wet from the shower, I just hang it up overnight and it&#x27;s dry in the morning.  Really love it!!</li>
            <li> I never thought in a million years Id ever wear one of these, but I got to a point, where I needed to stop washing my hair everyday, but going to the gym everyday, warrants a shower. This saves me a lot of time, water consumption, and makes my hair stand out, because it is not over washed anymore. I browsed around  a bit, but I really felt most were cheap, and would rip after a few uses, or under a heavy towel on a hook. this one, terry lined, and comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t leave a indent around my hair line. I&#x27;ve washed it in the dishwasher  and by hand (don&#x27;t have my own washer at home) and it stood up.</li>
            <li> works great-- doesn&#x27;t leak.  love the terry lining</li>
            <li> Worth every cent. Wish I had learned of this product earlier. It was/is such a god send when I wear my hair straight.</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do perfectly</li>
            <li> This shower cap is amazing.  After reading a few reviews, i was hesitant.  It does not leak water and it is not too big.  I have long thick hair and it works like a champ.  I am thinking about ordering another so i have it when other wears out.  Highly recommend:)</li>
            <li> This shower cap is nice because it has the terry cloth on the inside but it does leave a mark on my forehead for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair absolutely dry and all the humidity out!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cap in June 2012.  I have very long, thick hair and it all fits into the cap without issue.  I have a normal size head, so the cap fits just fine.  I also don&#x27;t have any issues with it being waterproof.  I&#x27;m not sure what some of the other reviewers are doing with their shower caps to make their hair wet... are you swimming laps with it on or something?  I use mine multiple times a week and have not had any issues.  It does leave a red mark along your forehead, but the mark goes away shortly after taking it off.  It&#x27;s a cute design - better than the boring grandma looking ones you get at Wal Mart or the dollar store.</li>
            <li> tight fit keeps out water, big enough I can fit a scrunchie or clip my hair up uner the cap - and stylish.  I am in my 30s, have been using shower caps for about 12 years and this is my favorite one so far.</li>
            <li> A good shower cap is hard to find but this is a great shower cap! This cap is big enough to cover my hair completely. The terry liner helps to keep my hair in place. The cap fits snuggly and my hair stays dry. I like that this cap does not have the water collecting fringe along the edge that many caps have. I towel-dry this cap after my shower and it dries quickly. The quality is well above the shower caps sold in our local stores. I highly recommend this shower cap.</li>
            <li> I will start this by saying I am not the shower cap type. I am super active, I washed my hair every day due to sweat and vanity, I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out. It&#x27;s color treated, is curly, and is super dry. I decided to attempt to wash it every other day. Second day hair is an entirely different subject and challenge :) But for this, I had been using a disposable shower cap I took from a hotel. I decided that I had been at this a month and it was time to upgrade to a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL my hair fits under it!!! Maybe that&#x27;s nothing new for shower caps you purchase but it is for me. I love the terry cloth on the inside.It did leave marks on my forehead from the elastic but those went away really fast. The leopardskin design, well, you know. So stylish. It does make me feel a bit like I&#x27;m in the 50&#x27;s and glam, at least when I&#x27;m not looking in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I feel this is an excellent purchase. FWIW too, there is a huge difference for the better if you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day as far as color retention goes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn cheap shower caps for years and finally decided to upgrade to something that would protect my hairline a little better and give me more room to fit my bun inside without pulling the edges too far.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what I would think of the terry cloth lining, but I love love love it.  There is plenty of room for my long hair in this cap and the elastic is snug enough to hold it in place.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it 3-4 days a week for at least a month now and it is perfect in every way.</li>
            <li> I really love this shower cap&lt;br /&gt;It is lined with terry cloth!&lt;br /&gt;A great value and i wish&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased 2</li>
            <li> I love this shower cap because it keeps my hair dryer than any I have ever had and it is so cute! I had bought this same brand at Bed Bath and Beyond a few years ago but it didn&#x27;t have the lining in it that this one has and it makes all the difference in the world as far as keeping my hair dry. The lining is not terry cloth like most of the lined shower caps, but more like a microfiber material. The band is nice and tight but it does not leave a mark on my forehead as others have said. I would highly recommend this shower cap as it surpasses any I have owned over that past 45 yrs.</li>
            <li> This is a SUPER SHOWER CAP! I LOVE IT because it is comfortable to wear &amp; keeps my hair dry with its nice terry cloth lining. It is a FABULOUS cap. KUDOS to you, Betty Dain, for designing such a great product. I am buying my 2nd one today for my travel bag. I just wish you would come out with other designs with the terry cloth lining - e.g., classy polka dots in beautiful colors would be nice. :)</li>
            <li> I received this shower cap and expected it to be a lot bigger based on the reviews.  Nevertheless it worked well, was comfortable and kept my hair dry in the shower.  I had another cap that I alternated using to allow them to dry in between.  Last week I went to put the cap on and the elastic in one section broke entirely.  That is less than 5 months of use, compared to less expensive caps this is a very short life.</li>
            <li> Old school hair cap. Generous size. Well made. Works great. Love leopard print. Have sent others as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love this shower hat with the terry lining - wish they had more styles and they were a little cheaper but they do last</li>
            <li> Fits snug. Really like it.</li>
            <li> This is my second Betty Dain shower cap. I am amazed that they don&#x27;t leak!  Prior to finding Betty Dain shower caps, I thought all shower caps leaked along the edges. The shower caps come in fun colors and styles  and are ample for &amp;#34;big hair&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;long hair&amp;#34;. The elastic wore out on my previous Betty Dain, after ~ 1 year of daily use (and desert dry air).</li>
            <li> This shower cap is super cute but failed to meet my expectations after the positive reviews on it I had read. First of all, it smelled like garbage! I don&#x27;t know what kind of storage facility this thing has been sitting in but the smell was horrendous and I had to wash it 6 or 7 times for the smell to be faint enough for me to put it on my head. When I did finally use it, I was disappointed to find that the cap didn&#x27;t protect my hair from the humidity of the shower...my hair was dry but had that limp slightly frizzy look that you get when walking outside on a very humid day. The other reviews are correct about the terry cloth interior of the cap but the animal print fabric is not plastic, hence the humidity getting to my hair. Fabrics hold onto scents as well which is also why after several washes I have not fully been able to get the garbage smell out either.</li>
            <li> Great shower cap, but it does leave an indentation around your head if you accidentally wear it too low or for too long.  It is easy to put on and dries quickly afterwards.</li>
            <li> Repeat buyer of this product. Love it, keeps my hair dry and is a great gift for friends and family</li>
            <li> better quality then I expected and it&#x27;s nice but it has a very strange smell</li>
            <li> Works better than non lined, fit nice not too tight not loose at all. It smelled at first but after a few showers the smell starts to go away. Good price, free shipping, &#x3D; good deal.</li>
            <li> Great quality shower cap. I like how it has terrycloth on the inside. Also doubles as a bicycle seat rain cover.</li>
            <li> My favorite shower cap! I thought it was a little pricey but took a chance and bought it anyway and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s the best shower cap I ever had! I&#x27;m used to those cheapy ones at the drugstores that barely fit your head and your nape gets all wet in the shower. This cap is generous in size, will fit all your hair and it&#x27;s terry lined, very comfy and covers everything. No part of your hair will be wet after using. The leopard design is also cute. I love it. You get what you pay for I guess!</li>
            <li> I agonized over the shower cap reviews and finally decided to take my chances with this one.  It&#x27;s large enough for my somewhat large head ( but would fit an average head just fine), fits singly enough to keep the water out, and with the soft liner is very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the above review in 2012.  After constant use and launderings, the elastic finally gave out, and I just purchased a replacement.  Don&#x27;t agonize over which cap to buy--this one is great!  I have read a few of the negative reviews and can assure you that neither cap I purchased (in 2012 or 2017) had an odor or was runny.</li>
            <li> Great waterproof shower cap. Though elastic is a bit tight, one only wears it a few minutes and the dry hair is worth it!</li>
            <li> Love this shower cap, will buy more!  My hair frizzes with the slightest moisture.  With this cap, my hairline stays completely dry---and I wash and rinse my face in the shower, so water gets right against the cap---highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the look and engineering of this cap but the smell....it is terrible!  I tried washing the cap twice and that didn&#x27;t work. Then, I soaked it in OxyClean for 3 days hoping to get the stink out.  That didn&#x27;t work.  Now, I have to throw it away! What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> For some reason this leopard print shower cap has a strong smell and the elastic is weak so my hair escapes in the back. Interestingly bought the Betty Dain lined shower cap in a pink print on Amazon as well and it has no smell, has good quality elastic and I really like it. I didn&#x27;t bother to return this one, use it as a spare.</li>
            <li> Just what i was looking for...They are getting hard to find with a terry lining</li>
            <li> While this cap fits really well, it smells horrible. I have tried washing it three times and it still has an overwhelming chemically smell. I usually hang it over my towel and my towel completely wreaks from it too. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone because of this.</li>
            <li> Damn she looks good in this!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for. I used to use regular proceeding/shower caps that are sold in bulk from my local beauty supply stores. A couple of years ago, something changed and the caps are very poorly made now. I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement product that will keep my hair, including my edges dry. This is it. This cap fits perfectly and keeps all of my hair dry. It&#x27;s large enough to fit over my entire hairline. It doesn&#x27;t ride up but is also not too tight. The material is more like cloth and not plastic so it is comfortable. The pattern is very nice. I will be ordering several more in case someone decides to discontinue the product.</li>
            <li> Very well made. It fits snug and keeps my hair completely dry in the shower.</li>
            <li> Use it almost daily - love it! Much cuter than the pale pink or blue granny ones, does it&#x27;s job too.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cap but was never tight enough to keep my shoulder length hair dry even if I put a headband under to pull hair back and used a ponytail holder to get hair up away from the edges. But it worked better than the cheapie dollar store ones I had been using. I only used it a couple times a week and was shocked when the elastic broke last week. It was never tight enough so I was amazed that it snapped and is now worthless. Very disappointed. The cap is well made and cute but needs tighter and better quality elastic!</li>
            <li> This shower cap keeps my head warm and dry and its soft and comfortable.  I&#x27;ve had it for longer than I should but it&#x27;s got great durability.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of women, I don&#x27;t necessary need to shampoo every day. This cap is comfortable. It has microfiber material on the inside, so its not cold feeling like the plastic ones are. You can wash it in the washing machine, but I do not recommend putting it in the dryer. Let it air dry. I have ruined 1 by putting it in the dryer. I have 2 of these. When 1 is in the wash, the other is being used.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a quality lined shower cap that would keep my hair dry in the shower and not move around too much.  I have a lot of very thick hair, and other shower caps weren&#x27;t always big enough to cover it all and stay in place.  This cap works perfectly and I have no complaints.  Keeps my hair dry when I need it to.</li>
            <li> If you have to buy a shower cap, this one has CHIC-- plus its lined in terry cloth.&lt;br /&gt;Old school cool at its best.</li>
            <li> Cap worked very well up until the end. The elastic wore out so I have to replace. The life of the cap was roughly 2 yrs. The cotton on the inside wasn&#x27;t a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described.  Purchased it for a gift and the recipient loves it. Says it works great.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> So cute and durable - this is a high quality item! Not some flimsy product that is going to disintegrate or peel.  A great purchase!</li>
            <li> The smell is soooooooooo bad! what on earth is this terrible smell????  I have washed it three times and it still stinks. It&#x27;s such a strong odor and it gets in my hair. I&#x27;m so mad about this purchase. I&#x27;m going back to my plastic shower cap.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, who needs a daily shower but doesn&#x27;t need to wash her hair daily. She thinks it&#x27;s very cute and easy to use. Good product and a lot nicer than the disposable ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I like it.  The cap is large and tight enough on the band that keeps the water away from my hair.  The only thing I did not like was the smell permeating from it when I took it out of the package.  OMG, what was that?  I had to leave it outside for a couple of days but things are good now.  I do recommend it.  I have long hair, mid back, and I have no issues with this cap.</li>
            <li> This shower cap is so fantastic. It is plenty big to fit all the hair in, even long hair yet it is snug so all of my hair stays dry. It is so easy to get on.</li>
            <li> Love love this! Very sizeable so it went over my bun perfectly and kept all the water out, stylish too!</li>
            <li> Best shower cap ever! Love the generous size &amp; terry lining means no static in very fine, soft hair</li>
            <li> This is a great shower cap.  Nice and roomy, and over the last year I have washed and dried numerous times.  Can&#x27;t say enough good about it.</li>
            <li> Cute. I bought it for college since Im living in the dorms and i get compliments on it all the time :)</li>
            <li> I got this for my girl friend 2-3 months ago and it&#x27;s still working like it suppose to.</li>
            <li> Really tight but cute</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a shower cap, folks, but I can&#x27;t find any fault with it, so rated it 5 stars. I like the terry lining on the inside, but I don&#x27;t know why;</li>
