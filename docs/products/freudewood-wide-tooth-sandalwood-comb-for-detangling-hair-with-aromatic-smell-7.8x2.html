            <li>This comb is beautiful and exactly what I was searching for.</li>
            <li>The comb naturally distributes the good oils in your hair evenly for healthy gorgeous hair!</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, and combing it out after washing can take some time, even using spray-in conditioner/de-tangler.</li>

            <li>the aromatic smell is ok.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it does not create static.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m in LOVE...</li>
            <li>I love my sandlewood comb and recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li>Seems like it would be better for a man&#x27;s comb.</li>
            <li>My favorite comb ever.  </li>
            <li>Such a great discovery to have made!</li>
            <li>Smell is familiar and amazing the finish on the come is great crafted very well no areas to snag hair</li>
            <li>The wood is very well smoothed out and the comb is very effective in my hair.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant and it is just right for combing through my waist length silver hair.</li>
            <li>It detangles easily and has helped me with my static electricity problem.</li>
            <li>It is heavy, fits my hand perfectly, the teeth are at a perfect spacing so that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; the hair, and I love that it is wooden - no plastic &amp;#34;burrs&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Great for navigating through natural, african-american hair.</li>
            <li>The teeth were wider than I expected which is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I really like the good smell, and it works</li>
            <li>However it does have a sweet sandalwood smell!</li>
            <li>do not now why this goes through my tangles so easily and doesn&#x27;t snag on my hair</li>
            <li>and it seems strong</li>
            <li>I bought this item one year ago, I liked it very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The comb has a very sturdy build and is very safe to use after I towel</li>
            <li>I would recommend oiling it with arganoil or EVOO, something thats fine to have in your hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is fine</li>
            <li>I now comb my hair with this comb and end up with smooth, combed hair that hasn&#x27;t been &amp;#34;ripped&amp;#34; through with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smooth wood...comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>To be perfectly honest, I really like the comb.  </li>
            <li>I very rarely use a brush anymore</li>
            <li>The top tooth broke in the first week</li>
            <li>Great for detangling long hair.</li>
            <li>great for equally distributing natural oils on curly hair and maintain a healthy scalp.</li>
            <li>Great other than the end broke off after about a month of using it</li>
            <li>but it does fade fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty smooth and love it in my hair!</li>
            <li>my words for new customers: do not buy this product any more.</li>
            <li>The comb has a strong scent, and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>This is the best comb to use for anyone ecspecialy if you have thick hair!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>The brushes we choose can be the difference between major breakage and healthy hair.</li>
            <li>WOW a comb that is truly smooth and seam-free, does not snag my long wavy hair, and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good right away, took a few hours to offgas (presumably the glue) until the sandalwood aroma made its way through.</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s fine so far.</li>
            <li>I immediately realized how much I&#x27;d been breaking my hair before!</li>
            <li>This comb builds up no static electricity either and smells wonderful when you first open it and use it.</li>
            <li>I ordered the comb because I read I how much better wooden combs were for hair.</li>
            <li>I love wooden combs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, but it actually works great!</li>
            <li>I like the comb, especially during winter as it prevents static against hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is so nice, the teeth are wide apart</li>
            <li>Will never go back again to plastic ones again... :)</li>
            <li>Good for short hair,would not be good for long thick hair.</li>
            <li>Loved the seamless aspectwhich made combing my hair so much easier and less damaging.</li>
            <li>it works really well.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t frizz up my hair or separate my curls too much.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>very dissapointed</li>
            <li>Worked very well...</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of this comb</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care about that, but just saw a lot of people talking about that.</li>
            <li>It seems very sturdily made, but I am going to buy another just in case.  </li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sandalwood helps to gently smooth scalp&#x27;s natural oils into hair, increasing shine without the static of ordinary plastic</li>
            <li>I liked that it didn&#x27;t get caught in my hair... which usually happens when I use plastic combs.</li>
            <li>Perfect size, though the weight feels weird (presumably because I&#x27;ve been using the same flimsy plastic comb for over a decade).  </li>
            <li>I bought the wide tooth sandalwood comb because I wanted something that was seamless and would not catch or cut my hair, well there are cuts at the top of the teeth that do both.</li>
            <li>This comb is of great quality, although it does not stand the test of a 2 year-old, unfortunately.</li>
            <li>This comb is very well done, sturdy and soft.</li>
            <li>Prevents split ends makes your hair soft and straight if thats what you want.  </li>
            <li>I am a female with long hair and, believe me, I have used A LOT of combs over the years and this one is my all-time favorite.  </li>
            <li>I could live without the sandalwood smell.</li>
            <li>even with my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>Works great to gently untangle wet, long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>I began to use a wooden comb because it easier on wet hair if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is a clear quality DEGRADATION.</li>
            <li>wide tooth wooden combs are so important for anyone with wavy or curly hair.</li>
            <li>wow and</li>
            <li>Although it is very well made it is not the same size as what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li>My hair is really thick and with the plastic combs I would get the static electricity, not with this comb.</li>
            <li>I just wish they made one with longer tins, as the heavy duty plastic one I had been using before had longer tines and it felt good going through my hair especially when wet.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, flyaway hair and after reviewing combs online bought this one on the advice of other women with similar hair type.  </li>
            <li>Definitely  no &#x27;odd&#x27; smell like</li>
            <li>I just received and used this comb (today is hair washing day), detangled as smooth as butter on birth wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my wet hair straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li>wide toothed wooden comb, exactly as picture.</li>
            <li>It is very large for my hand and seems heavy.</li>
            <li>It says &amp;#34;aromatic smell&amp;#34; even though I smell it, but overall, I am pleased with this wide tooth comb and using it everyday after washing my hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for combing thick hair but not good for head massage.</li>
            <li>Little to no broken or shredded hairs...</li>

            <li> I could live without the sandalwood smell.</li>
            <li> even with my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> Works great to gently untangle wet, long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I began to use a wooden comb because it easier on wet hair if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is a clear quality DEGRADATION.</li>
            <li> wide tooth wooden combs are so important for anyone with wavy or curly hair.</li>
            <li> wow and</li>
            <li> Although it is very well made it is not the same size as what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick and with the plastic combs I would get the static electricity, not with this comb.</li>
            <li> I just wish they made one with longer tins, as the heavy duty plastic one I had been using before had longer tines and it felt good going through my hair especially when wet.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, flyaway hair and after reviewing combs online bought this one on the advice of other women with similar hair type.  </li>
            <li> Definitely  no &#x27;odd&#x27; smell like</li>
            <li> I just received and used this comb (today is hair washing day), detangled as smooth as butter on birth wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my wet hair straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li> wide toothed wooden comb, exactly as picture.</li>
            <li> It is very large for my hand and seems heavy.</li>
            <li> It says &amp;#34;aromatic smell&amp;#34; even though I smell it, but overall, I am pleased with this wide tooth comb and using it everyday after washing my hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for combing thick hair but not good for head massage.</li>
            <li> Little to no broken or shredded hairs...</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight smell as other reviews mentioned, however I only noticed it when I put it right up to my nose, otherwise I couldn&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> I used to loose a lot of hair strands on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It is well made, but my hair is too long for its size.</li>
            <li> Seems like a heritage comb or something that can be used for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have curly, long hair</li>
            <li> Finally I added a little essential oil to mask it</li>
            <li> I think I will use it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used long enough to determine long term effects but definitely no dandruff and no static!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well on wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> and this gets the job done when combing out my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I run it through when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> That can be solved with a few drops of essential oils.</li>
            <li> the new comb is thinner, the teeth have clear traces of irregular distortion, making the whole piece look very bad.</li>
            <li> like other combs i have purchased.</li>
            <li> For some reasons snags my hair and breaks it every time, which defeats the purpose of getting a wide tooth comb!</li>
            <li> The sandalwood scent is subtle, but long lasting.</li>
            <li> I hate winter hair static and my research led me to look for wood/natural combs and brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown out all my other combs!</li>
            <li> seldom, I feel that it is heavy than other, just it.</li>
            <li> But, the comb broke in less than a month</li>
            <li> I have loss less hair.  </li>
            <li> My long thick twirly hair appreciates it.</li>
            <li> I can now comb it out in half the time, and with little to no pulling.</li>
            <li> this  brash  was  broke*(((((alredy  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; smell or whatever it is.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my beard, and since tossing the plastic combs away, I&#x27;ve had very few snags or snarls resulting in less hair being ripped out..</li>
            <li> The base of the teeth of the comb is pretty rough and has taken a lot of sanding to keep it from grabbing my hair.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment with this comb is that the space in between the teeth is rough and not coated at all.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t fade very much :(</li>
            <li> Not sure this is Sandalwood, but if it is, there is no aroma to it.</li>
            <li> still use a round brush for blowdrying (with heat protection!)</li>
            <li> I see a lot less hair in this comb!!</li>
            <li> this comb works well with my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I feel weird about returning a comb after I used it, so will keep it (may use as incense!), and buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> But the teeth is very thick.</li>
            <li> It was even worse after a shampooing as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an added, chemical scent that smells weird...</li>
            <li> When it arrived it was smaller than I had envisioned as my size perception is apparently horrible.  </li>
            <li> Very small I was disappointed with the size of this comb.</li>
            <li> I would have given five stars if the roughness of the teeth base was mentioned in the description.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the terrible bug spray odor that was on the comb.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bottom line. It works! It detangles easily and has helped me with my static electricity problem. It&#x27;s well made.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, smooth finish makes it easier to detangle hair with this comb vs. plastic combs.</li>
            <li> Great for navigating through natural, african-american hair. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t as bulky.</li>
            <li> It is well made, but my hair is too long for its size. I could live without the sandalwood smell.</li>
            <li> This comb is nice. I have very thick hair and this gets the job done when combing out my wet hair. Not sure this is Sandalwood, but if it is, there is no aroma to it.</li>
            <li> Wanted a wide-toothed wooden comb with a handle.  Perfect size, though the weight feels weird (presumably because I&#x27;ve been using the same flimsy plastic comb for over a decade).  LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This comb is beautiful and exactly what I was searching for. I hate winter hair static and my research led me to look for wood/natural combs and brushes. I use this on my wet hair straight out of the shower. My only disappointment with this comb is that the space in between the teeth is rough and not coated at all. Perhaps it is meant to be that way...</li>
            <li> it works really well. My long thick twirly hair appreciates it. great for equally distributing natural oils on curly hair and maintain a healthy scalp.</li>
            <li> quality comb, feels solid. excellent value!has good weight not lite(weight) like other combs i have purchased. the aromatic smell is ok.</li>
            <li> This comb is of great quality, although it does not stand the test of a 2 year-old, unfortunately. She snapped the last tooth off. But it still does the job, with NO FRIZZ and I have had it for a while and it still smells really lovely!</li>
            <li> Is as advertised. Good comb. Doesn&#x27;t smell good right away, took a few hours to offgas (presumably the glue) until the sandalwood aroma made its way through. I would recommend oiling it with arganoil or EVOO, something thats fine to have in your hair.</li>
            <li> The top tooth broke in the first week</li>
            <li> this comb works well with my thick, curly hair. I run it through when it&#x27;s wet and it doesn&#x27;t frizz up my hair or separate my curls too much. Basically just use it to keep the dreads out!</li>
            <li> Not quite what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This comb is life-changing! The brushes we choose can be the difference between major breakage and healthy hair. I guess I always thought I needed a big paddle brush to get the job done! Not the case. This brush is beautiful and takes good care of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood helps to gently smooth scalp&#x27;s natural oils into hair, increasing shine without the static of ordinary plastic brushes.&lt;br /&gt;After I began using this comb instead of my plastic paddle brush I immediately realized how much I&#x27;d been breaking my hair before! It just isn&#x27;t necessary. I now comb my hair with this comb and end up with smooth, combed hair that hasn&#x27;t been &amp;#34;ripped&amp;#34; through with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;I still use a round brush for blowdrying (with heat protection!) but I&#x27;ve been using this comb for day-to-day use for months now and I won&#x27;t be going back.</li>
            <li> This comb is very well done, sturdy and soft. It works well on my daughter&#x27;s entangled hair. I love the fact that it does not create static.</li>
            <li> I really like it. I like the wonderful smell. seldom, I feel that it is heavy than other, just it.</li>
            <li> I bought the wide tooth sandalwood comb because I wanted something that was seamless and would not catch or cut my hair, well there are cuts at the top of the teeth that do both. very dissapointed</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I bought this to use on my beard, and since tossing the plastic combs away, I&#x27;ve had very few snags or snarls resulting in less hair being ripped out.. love it!  This comb builds up no static electricity either and smells wonderful when you first open it and use it. The scent does fade over time though.</li>
            <li> Good quality wood.  Solid construction &amp; shape.  Seems like a heritage comb or something that can be used for a long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered the comb because I read I how much better wooden combs were for hair. I have curly, long hair and I have to say...I prefer my Denman brush over the wooden comb. Especially when I&#x27;m dealing with tons of knots. After I have detangled my hair and put this comb through, it&#x27;s a soothing feeling on my scalp.The comb has a strong scent, and very sturdy. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> Worked very well... even with my naturally curly hair! I liked that it didn&#x27;t get caught in my hair... which usually happens when I use plastic combs. :)</li>
            <li> Great other than the end broke off after about a month of using it</li>
            <li> I bought this item one year ago, I liked it very much. So I bought again this year. This is a clear quality DEGRADATION. the new comb is thinner, the teeth have clear traces of irregular distortion, making the whole piece look very bad. I am very disappointed. my words for new customers: do not buy this product any more.</li>
            <li> I ave curly hair and it is always a struggled finding a comb that does not snag on my hair and pull out a lot of my hair. I decided to give this a try....wow and wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not now why this goes through my tangles so easily and doesn&#x27;t snag on my hair but I love it. And I am so happy I found this, it is number 1 on my holy grail list.</li>
            <li> I am a female with long hair and, believe me, I have used A LOT of combs over the years and this one is my all-time favorite.  It is heavy, fits my hand perfectly, the teeth are at a perfect spacing so that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; the hair, and I love that it is wooden - no plastic &amp;#34;burrs&amp;#34;.  I can&#x27;t recommend this comb highly enough!</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this comb and it seems strong but the smell is not &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; sandalwood...it&#x27;s an added, chemical scent that smells weird...and it doesn&#x27;t fade very much :(</li>
            <li> wide toothed wooden comb, exactly as picture. nice quality</li>
            <li> Smell is familiar and amazing the finish on the come is great crafted very well no areas to snag hair I was expecting the teeth of the comb to be bigger,but it is great for me</li>
            <li> Loved the seamless aspectwhich made combing my hair so much easier and less damaging. But, the comb broke in less than a month and I comb my hair only twice a week!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing comb. The fragrance smells so good but it does fade fairly quickly. That can be solved with a few drops of essential oils. The base of the teeth of the comb is pretty rough and has taken a lot of sanding to keep it from grabbing my hair. I would have given five stars if the roughness of the teeth base was mentioned in the description.</li>
            <li> Prevents split ends makes your hair soft and straight if thats what you want.  You can style any way you wish with this comb.  I very rarely use a brush anymore just this comb</li>
            <li> I have never had a sandalwood comb before and had no idea it was going to smell so good! It works great and makes my purse smell amazing!</li>
            <li> It says &amp;#34;aromatic smell&amp;#34; even though I smell it, but overall, I am pleased with this wide tooth comb and using it everyday after washing my hair!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  It de-tangles my hair.  I have loss less hair.  I have purchased one for a family member.</li>
            <li> I love wooden combs. It&#x27;s small, but it actually works great!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, but started loosing teeth right away.</li>
            <li> No snags, no frizz, no frustration.&lt;br /&gt;The comb has a very sturdy build and is very safe to use after I towel dry my hair. The teeth were wider than I expected which is wonderful. The smell is alright.</li>
            <li> The comb works perfectly for my hair which is wavy/curly. It separates the hair just enough to take out tangles but not enough to cause frizziness. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the terrible bug spray odor that was on the comb. I washed it and it was still there. Finally I added a little essential oil to mask it and It&#x27;s fine so far.</li>
            <li> Best comb I&#x27;ve owned.  Definitely  no &#x27;odd&#x27; smell like some say.  Smooth wood...comfortable to hold. Great detangler.</li>
            <li> I really like the good smell, and it works</li>
            <li> A fantastically built wood comb. The sandalwood scent is subtle, but long lasting. Great for detangling long hair.</li>
            <li> An article about hair loss said to use a wooden comb rather than plastic. It  does help in not pulling out hair while combing. I see a lot less hair in this comb!!</li>
            <li> This is awesome comb, the size if perfect, the feel is right! I think I will use it for a very long time. Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Sturdy. Still smells nice after months of use.</li>
            <li> Works great to gently untangle wet, long, thick hair. Does not cause any breakage of hair. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I had no idea a comb could work like this one does. My hair is very fine, and combing it out after washing can take some time, even using spray-in conditioner/de-tangler. I can now comb it out in half the time, and with little to no pulling. (If it does pull, it&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m in a hurry.) It also feels very comfortable in my hand. I&#x27;ve thrown out all my other combs!</li>
            <li> This is the best comb to use for anyone ecspecialy if you have thick hair! My hair is really thick and with the plastic combs I would get the static electricity, not with this comb. The smell is fine I don&#x27;t really care about that, but just saw a lot of people talking about that. It just works great! I&#x27;ve already bought two. One for home and one for the purse!</li>
            <li> I have fine, flyaway hair and after reviewing combs online bought this one on the advice of other women with similar hair type.  I can&#x27;t say it works brilliantly for the frizz but I like that it&#x27;s good quality and doesn&#x27;t snag my hair.  It&#x27;s also beautifully crafted.</li>
            <li> I just received and used this comb (today is hair washing day), detangled as smooth as butter on birth wet and dry hair.  I think I&#x27;m in LOVE... I&#x27;ll keep you all posted.  P.S. Little to no broken or shredded hairs...</li>
            <li> I began to use a wooden comb because it easier on wet hair if you have fine hair. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in snarling my hair</li>
            <li> I love my sandlewood comb and recommend it to all my friends. Pearl Buck mentioned sandlewood combs in her book &amp;#34;Pavillion of Women&amp;#34;. She sparked my interest and this comb fulfilled my expectations.The scent is light and pleasant and it is just right for combing through my waist length silver hair.</li>
            <li> I like the comb, especially during winter as it prevents static against hair. However, It has no aroma as described.</li>
            <li> It is very large for my hand and seems heavy. Seems like it would be better for a man&#x27;s comb.</li>
            <li> WOW a comb that is truly smooth and seam-free, does not snag my long wavy hair, and smells nice.  Seems to work well on wet and dry hair.  It seems very sturdily made, but I am going to buy another just in case.  I just wish they made one with longer tins, as the heavy duty plastic one I had been using before had longer tines and it felt good going through my hair especially when wet.  But this is still a very nice product.</li>
            <li> My favorite comb ever.  If you have curly hair, you need this comb.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She really likes it.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality comb. I noticed a slight smell as other reviews mentioned, however I only noticed it when I put it right up to my nose, otherwise I couldn&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> Such a great discovery to have made! I haven&#x27;t used long enough to determine long term effects but definitely no dandruff and no static! Overall pretty smooth and love it in my hair! Thanks!! And it smells soooooo good!</li>
            <li> I chose a 4 star rating instead of 5 because I suppose everything can improve.  To be perfectly honest, I really like the comb.  The smell is so nice, the teeth are wide apart which is what I needed.  it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out. Nice comb!</li>
            <li> When it arrived it was smaller than I had envisioned as my size perception is apparently horrible.  But, it is the dimension stated and does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li> A very beautiful comb. Only drawback is the smell. Not a huge fan of the &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; smell or whatever it is.</li>
            <li> Very small I was disappointed with the size of this comb. Although it is very well made it is not the same size as what you see in the picture. Good for short hair,would not be good for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I like the comb quite well.  The wood is very well smoothed out and the comb is very effective in my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and beautiful. And smells good. But the teeth is very thick. It&#x27;s good for combing thick hair but not good for head massage.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, sometimes wavy, and wide tooth wooden combs are so important for anyone with wavy or curly hair. The sandlewood is theraputic and an ancient healing technique. The comb naturally distributes the good oils in your hair evenly for healthy gorgeous hair! This comb feels like a head massage every time I use it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Well made, and doesn&#x27;t tear hair.</li>
            <li> The best ever comb ever!!!!! Best for detangling your hair.  I used to loose a lot of hair strands on a daily basis. It was even worse after a shampooing as well. But since I have stared using this comb, my hair fall has drastically reduced (probably about 1 - 4 strands). Will never go back again to plastic ones again... :)</li>
            <li> this  brash  was  broke*(((((alredy  and now  its  teeth fell out((((</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money for me. The comb is too bulky and just does not do a good job combing type B3 hair. For some reasons snags my hair and breaks it every time, which defeats the purpose of getting a wide tooth comb! However it does have a sweet sandalwood smell! I feel weird about returning a comb after I used it, so will keep it (may use as incense!), and buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> Excellent product I loved it so much I brought 2.</li>
