            <li>Love it and will get a spare!</li>
            <li>I got the product very quickly and it&#x27;s been great to have</li>
            <li>The height was perfect and the cushion is comfortable and stays in place easily while driving.  </li>
            <li>Real cheap cover.</li>
            <li>I loved them and so did many of my clients</li>
            <li>This is a well made cushion with a zip off cover that can be washed and a handy carrying grip.  </li>
            <li>To be perfect it could have a wipeable or removeable cover instead of cloth, I have spilled some stuff on it so will need a new one eventually.</li>
            <li>The size is near perfect.</li>
            <li>Cushion is comfortable,  and the height  is good,.  </li>
            <li>This is  the best cushion by far.</li>
            <li>I am impressed by how much better quality this cushion has vs. my old one.  </li>
            <li>When I first used this in my vehicle I thought it was great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable but maintains its shape all the time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and doesn&#x27;t slide on my seat.</li>
            <li>I am well pleased with this cushion as it is well made and very comfortable to sit on in my car.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this wedge cushion for more than a year and really love it.  </li>
            <li>(I am short), and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Love it though.</li>
            <li>Being fairly short, I needed something to raise me up and give me better visability, and this cushion has fulfilled that need perfectly.</li>
            <li>I needed it to see better when driving.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be more firmer.  </li>
            <li>Apart from that, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m subtracting one star because I thought that was unclear in the product description and thicker would be better.</li>
            <li>I ended up putting this cushion on top of another cushion inside a plastic zip-up bag</li>
            <li>and I drive more relaxed.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This one is much better</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that the cover is washable.</li>
            <li>so my visibility would be better</li>
            <li>Slides on leather seats but that is ok makes it easier to move around.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>That was not a need, but is okay.  </li>
            <li>Most slip and slide</li>
            <li>The saving grace is the fact that it is a zipper lined pouch, so some usable material may be able to fill it so it works as intended.</li>
            <li>SURE</li>
            <li>Better than Tush-Cush</li>
            <li>This cushion is wonderful; It eases any back or leg pain</li>
            <li>I love my cushion.</li>
            <li>Driving is so much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>sure it smoos</li>
            <li>I love this cushion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>and I can see so much better out towards the road from my car onto the road.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s called front seat driving vs back seat driving, but I am still pleased to have gotten her this excellent product.</li>
            <li>If you see the word &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; in any product, expect to spend much more.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had this seat cushion for several months and we&#x27;re very happy with the quality.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li>If it would be made of a more rigid foam, it may do the job.</li>
            <li>Gives me the height I need to drive safely.  </li>
            <li>Love the zippered cover</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m glad I got this very handy helper.  </li>
            <li>I got this cushion to make a chair at home more comfortable.</li>
            <li>works great for my 88 year old mom who is shrinking</li>
            <li>If you know someone who sews, it can be made easily as home.</li>
            <li>Easy to slip over when entering car.</li>
            <li>We strongly recommend this cushion.</li>
            <li>A very worthwhile product at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still as good as new.</li>
            <li>Well made, comfortable, and easy to install.</li>
            <li>And it looks fine, just like the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>These cushions are great for making a car seat much more comfortable for long drives.  </li>
            <li>Right size and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable for the car</li>
            <li>and it was really comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is so comfortable that I now use the cushion whether I am a driver or passenger.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and seems to help to decrease leg/back pain.  </li>
            <li>This works as a great booster seat in the car or back wedge if you need it.</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly, stayed firm</li>
            <li>Comfortable,  had mine for a couples years now.</li>
            <li>Light weight,  stays in place.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable seat cushion</li>
            <li>but this pillow sits well on the seat and doesn&#x27;t move and is comfortable.</li>
            <li>For the price I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s rather cheap but serves the purpose.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to sit on.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable, and when doing a lot of driving, I find that I am not fatigued.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and comfortable, and allowed me to drive my husband&#x27;s truck comfortably.  </li>
            <li>It is very helpful for a more enjoyable car ride.</li>
            <li>Love this works good, muche sturdier that my former one</li>
            <li>This cushion proved to be just the right height to help me see better all around.</li>
            <li>The original was fully covered both sides with a zipper to remove for laundry.  </li>
            <li>I needed it in my car to add some more height in the driver&#x27;s seat and this cushion did exactly that.</li>
            <li>I find that most car seats are made at an acute angle, especially smaller sedans.  </li>
            <li>love the large size; I&#x27;ve needed one like this for years.</li>
            <li>The right size and firmness!</li>
            <li>The cushion is great for short people who need to sit higher.</li>
            <li>The cushion is great for short people who need to sit higher .Helps</li>
            <li>Such good advice as I can now drive sitting at an angle which releaves all pressure on my leg.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t quite extend to the full seat depth (as seen in description).</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t do (for me, a full sized guy)</li>
            <li>As good a product as one I bought at a medical supply place.</li>
            <li>the full label is 15 X 14 X 3</li>
            <li>My Civic seat doesn&#x27;t have true height adjustment so time will tell about the utility, comfort &amp; durability.</li>
            <li>I wrote this review to give the true dimensions which Amazon had listed at 16 X 13 X 3.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants comfort and able to see over the steering wheel if you&lt;br /&gt;are</li>
            <li>Although I am very happy with the performance of my car, I was seriously thinking of getting rid of it because of the seat problem.</li>
            <li>It gets me up just enough to be able to see better.</li>
            <li>Product is as described and works excellently for my need:  to make my body be parallel to the floor in a car or chair so as not to cause back problems.  </li>
            <li>The zippered cover seems adequate.  </li>
            <li>but I quickly changed my mind as the cushion flattened out</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Right now it&#x27;s nice and firm and the color is more navy than the bright blue as pictured here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so short, this has helped me see better while driving!  </li>
            <li>Really see mixed reviews on this product - it does raise you up beautifully or it compresses too much and doesn&#x27;t raise you up.  </li>
            <li>Fits well and gives my wife the extra height needed to drive more easily.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable and works very well for him.</li>
            <li>I drove a rental that did have that capability and was surprised how much better</li>
            <li>If it was smaller it would fit better in my car seat.</li>
            <li>My wife really liked it initially, but after sitting a while the began to cut off her circulation.  </li>
            <li>Comes in handy it my low driver seat in my car.</li>
            <li>FOR.IT WAS WORTH BUYING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Better than our old one.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re very happy with this product which we got at a great price compared to some other cushions that were far more expensive.</li>
            <li>Adding a more butt &amp; back friendly seat for our older car was my primary purpose for this cushion.</li>
            <li>The web page was very user friendly.</li>
            <li>I looked at the dimensions given for this wedge and thought it should be just right and could replace the pillow I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li>This cushion puts me in the right place.</li>
            <li>This cushion works to get his pelvis and legs at the right angle and alleviates his pain.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>It is just the right thickness.</li>
            <li>This product arrived within the time frame expected it was in excellent condition,and as described by the sellers.the price was really good,and i am using it daily when driving.</li>
            <li>Easily tossed in the trunk for adult drivers.</li>
            <li>Really came in handy on a recent trip to Florida.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and raises me enough to make the headrest in my Honda Fit.</li>
            <li>Having the whole bottom of the foam exposed will cause shredding quickly and shift and wrinkle the cover.  </li>
            <li>If the cushion were either longer or shorter in depth, it could allow an open container to be placed in front of or on top of the cushion.</li>
            <li>This Cushion is really great, I drive a long to work and back to Home, because of this Cushion I do not feel fatigued when I&#x27;m done driving.</li>
            <li>I looked everywhere for one of these that would boost me up higher</li>
            <li>Bought this seat wedge to give me a higher driving position (why do car manufacturers make non-adjustable seats?)</li>
            <li>Quite helpful for someone who is short, enabling them to see better out the window.</li>
            <li>The seat cushion is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>and I needed to sit higher in my car driver&#x27;s seat to change the angle of my neck while driving.  </li>
            <li>This products exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with the results that I just ordered a second one</li>
            <li>You can remove the outer shell and place in washing machine in HOT water to remove all smells</li>
            <li>It is soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>so I would love if you brought this back</li>
            <li>It does make you sit up higher in the seat, probably about 3 inches.</li>
            <li>After hip replacement surgery, I needed an extra cushion when sitting in a car or on most chairs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a couple of days and so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>On another note, this cushion makes me sit higher.  </li>
            <li>and then I would not have to be exact about centering myself.  </li>
            <li>Although the wedge is exactly what I wanted for my mother in law&#x27;s car, it was no as pictured.</li>
            <li>The seat cushion is exactly what my mom was looking for and needed.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Sits me higher up and what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I would like to give this product a higher rating but the zipper broke almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>keep my back straight it very comfortable</li>
            <li>I am pleased to report that this foam does not compact flat.  </li>
            <li>The cushion is nice looking new &amp; seems comfortable with firm density foam.</li>
            <li>It was good, but my friend needed something a bit higher, so he is putting a small pillow under it.</li>
            <li>This is very helpful for anyone who is short, and needs to see better while driving.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to sit on and gives me just the right amount of height to help ease my back pain.</li>
            <li>as many do, the price is low by comparison, and it&#x27;s significantly cut the back and leg pain caused by sitting.  </li>
            <li>The item is pretty much as described, and I thought the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>This item was too large for my needs and had I known of their policy, I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li>This item is a wedge of foam loosely covered over the top with a cover.  </li>
            <li>The cushion is large though, and I have to push it through the back of the chair for it to fit.</li>
            <li>The 3 inch rear thickness really raises my 5&#x27;11+&amp;#34; around 165 lb. frame up high on the seat, disconcerting at first.</li>
            <li>The cushion works very well.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and just the rite comfort.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is reasonably priced as well.  </li>
            <li>but it really boosts me up a lot.</li>
            <li>This is way too big to fit in my car seat.</li>
            <li>With an L5-S1 herniated disc, this cushion seems to be the only one that will bring the car seat, and our home seating, up to a comfortable angle.  </li>
            <li>This accomplished what he was looking for...</li>
            <li>Shame on the provider for using such a cheap piece of foam in this wedge cushion.</li>
            <li>is provide much elevation.</li>
            <li>This cushion works very well to support an elderly passenger.</li>
            <li>Getting in and out of the car is much easier.</li>
            <li>Very usefull.  </li>
            <li>; daughter really needed this</li>
            <li>Very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I feel much safer driving.</li>
            <li>use it all the time is very comforteable</li>
            <li>I purchased the cushion and it arrived fast.</li>
            <li>which was about as much cushion as a deflated balloon.  </li>
            <li>THIS COMPANY.THEY CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS</li>
            <li>But the height of the cushion proved to be too much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s breathable fabric, so you don&#x27;t sweat too much,</li>
            <li>It does not lift you up that much.</li>
            <li>Also,it sticks to your clothes making a smooth entry possible.</li>
            <li>I have a rather sensitive lower back that needs plenty of support and most office chairs don&#x27;t give that.      </li>
            <li>but it is still usable and gives a nice firm foundation for longer car trips.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still nice and firm.</li>
            <li>helped boost me up-it definitely ended up being worth the price!</li>
            <li>Sitting tall in the saddle--a phase which reminds one of John Wayne--becomes important if you are short and your car&#x27;s passenger seat has no way to be elevated short of a factory visit, as is true with my Hyundai Sonata.  </li>
            <li>My wife says that with the cushion, the seat is about the right height and comfortable and I haven&#x27;t heard any other complaints since I put it in.</li>
            <li>As you get older, you get shorter.  </li>
            <li>My main concern regarding buying this unseen is that it would do that.  </li>
            <li>Bought as a gift for my older sister.</li>
            <li>Required  two zipped into one casing to get decent support.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to fit it in my car chair every single time.</li>
            <li>This has been very useful for my young driver who has a short torso.  </li>
            <li>and the snow blows have made the roads a mess with many pot holes.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it was more gel like, but it&#x27;s really just plain foam to me, the foam could be denser too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>He tried to use it in his Ford 500, but it sat him up too high.  </li>
            <li>really nice cushion but too thick for our use</li>
            <li>Priced very inexpensively, firm support, easy to remove cover.</li>
            <li>Being short this Cushion just gives me the right height.  </li>
            <li>I am only 5&#x27;1&amp;#34; so it also puts me up a little higher to see better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft, firm, yet very comfortable coshion</li>
            <li>Now with the new cushion, I can see over the&lt;br /&gt;steering wheel.  </li>
            <li>This cushion is giving me a new lease on life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is still a desire on my part to look for a larger cushion - but in the end, the item that I purchased is comfortable and quite acceptable for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend its purchase.</li>
            <li>ALSO NOTE that the Amazon vendor, Medical Department Store requires you get a Return Merchandise Authorization number within 30 days, will charge you a 20% restocking fee &amp; return shipping &amp; you pay for any initial free shipping if returning its non-defective products.</li>
            <li>Also, although the product is cheap, the shipping fee is way higher than usual and counts per cushion.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend for vehicles with higher roofs if you are tall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>It is too soft!  </li>
            <li>delivery a little slow and long way around but very happy.  </li>
            <li>The cushion I just received is clearly labeled 15&amp;#34; x 14&amp;#34; not 16&amp;#34; x 13&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It was firm, comfortable and the material was soft, yet sturdy.</li>
            <li>We bought this cushion for the use of a 96 year old lady.   </li>
            <li>and so far seems to be quite durable and well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I inquired with my auto dealer about an installation on my two year old model and was told a price that was a discouragement.  </li>
            <li>It is quite firm, but with repeated use, it loses some of its firmness and becomes much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I needed a sturdy and firm wedge cushion for my car seat and it had to be comfortable</li>
            <li>Comfortable yet firm.</li>
            <li>I appreciated tracking option.consider purchase yourself if your driver seat is low.</li>
            <li>So far it has retained its shape.</li>
            <li>So far it has kept its shape well.</li>
            <li>last quite a long time and are cheap enough to be replaced if they do age out or get damaged.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s 2014 Honda Accord electric drivers seat would not come up high enough for her.</li>
            <li>The pillow is not quite high enough.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not nearly that much &#x27;foam&#x27;</li>
            <li>Hence this seat, which is light and yet firm enough, elevated my diminutive wife high enough</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it is large enough and sturdy enough to help in the maintenance of my posture while sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is actually navy blue and the wedge is not as large as pictured.</li>
            <li>It is fairly comfortable but it could be a little wider and I am not a big person.  </li>
            <li>Have a new car that the seat dips lower in the back.  </li>
            <li>After suffering with a shooting pain down my right leg while driving, my Doctor suggested changing the angle of my car seat.</li>
            <li>It squeezes down to the thickness of the cloth cover, and offers no support to raise you higher than you are when sitting without any cushion.</li>
            <li>But I really noticed my lack of being able to see the street after hitting some pretty bad pot holes that I didn&#x27;t even see.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve taken it out to our second car so that I don&#x27;t have to keep changing the wedge from the first car to the second and back again.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses this in the car so she can see better - our seats are not adjustable up and down as they were in the previous car we had.</li>
            <li>but it is not firm enough.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>The cover on our old wedge was constantly coming off.</li>
            <li>was disappointed mostly in the fact that the dimension from front to back was more than 1 inch smaller and that the height was 1/2 inch shorter than described.&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of excess fabric in the cover.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was prompt and I always go to Amazon when I am looking for a particular article as I can usually find what I am looking for and they are reasonable on prices of merchandise.</li>
            <li>,cheap piece of foam, cover is a dark navy blue, doesn&#x27;t remotely look like picture.</li>
            <li>The cushion is relatively high density but compresses down almost completely when I sit on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve moved it from under me to behind and my lower back is much better.</li>
            <li>I would that it were a little higher</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was one of the least expensive seat cushions on Amazon, but does exactly what I wanted: it adds enough cushioning that my chair is more comfortable, and has the added benefit of slightly elevating and stretching my posture.</li>
            <li>I got a cheap cushion previously and it was not comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It is fine if you are wearing jeans, but I would be careful with delicate fabrics.  </li>

            <li> I like it for longer car rides, as the cushioning is superior to the car seat</li>

            <li> The height was perfect and the cushion is comfortable and stays in place easily while driving.  </li>
            <li> Real cheap cover.</li>
            <li> I loved them and so did many of my clients</li>
            <li> This is a well made cushion with a zip off cover that can be washed and a handy carrying grip.  </li>
            <li> To be perfect it could have a wipeable or removeable cover instead of cloth, I have spilled some stuff on it so will need a new one eventually.</li>
            <li> The size is near perfect.</li>
            <li> Cushion is comfortable,  and the height  is good,.  </li>
            <li> This is  the best cushion by far.</li>
            <li> I am impressed by how much better quality this cushion has vs. my old one.  </li>
            <li> When I first used this in my vehicle I thought it was great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable but maintains its shape all the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and doesn&#x27;t slide on my seat.</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with this cushion as it is well made and very comfortable to sit on in my car.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wedge cushion for more than a year and really love it.  </li>
            <li> (I am short), and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Love it though.</li>
            <li> Being fairly short, I needed something to raise me up and give me better visability, and this cushion has fulfilled that need perfectly.</li>
            <li> I needed it to see better when driving.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be more firmer.  </li>
            <li> Apart from that, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m subtracting one star because I thought that was unclear in the product description and thicker would be better.</li>
            <li> I ended up putting this cushion on top of another cushion inside a plastic zip-up bag</li>
            <li> and I drive more relaxed.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This one is much better</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that the cover is washable.</li>
            <li> so my visibility would be better</li>
            <li> Slides on leather seats but that is ok makes it easier to move around.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> That was not a need, but is okay.  </li>
            <li> Most slip and slide</li>
            <li> The saving grace is the fact that it is a zipper lined pouch, so some usable material may be able to fill it so it works as intended.</li>
            <li> SURE</li>
            <li> Better than Tush-Cush</li>
            <li> This cushion is wonderful; It eases any back or leg pain</li>
            <li> I love my cushion.</li>
            <li> Driving is so much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> sure it smoos</li>
            <li> I love this cushion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> and I can see so much better out towards the road from my car onto the road.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s called front seat driving vs back seat driving, but I am still pleased to have gotten her this excellent product.</li>
            <li> If you see the word &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; in any product, expect to spend much more.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this seat cushion for several months and we&#x27;re very happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li> If it would be made of a more rigid foam, it may do the job.</li>
            <li> Gives me the height I need to drive safely.  </li>
            <li> Love the zippered cover</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m glad I got this very handy helper.  </li>
            <li> I got this cushion to make a chair at home more comfortable.</li>
            <li> works great for my 88 year old mom who is shrinking</li>
            <li> If you know someone who sews, it can be made easily as home.</li>
            <li> Easy to slip over when entering car.</li>
            <li> We strongly recommend this cushion.</li>
            <li> A very worthwhile product at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still as good as new.</li>
            <li> Well made, comfortable, and easy to install.</li>
            <li> And it looks fine, just like the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> These cushions are great for making a car seat much more comfortable for long drives.  </li>
            <li> Right size and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable for the car</li>
            <li> and it was really comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is so comfortable that I now use the cushion whether I am a driver or passenger.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and seems to help to decrease leg/back pain.  </li>
            <li> This works as a great booster seat in the car or back wedge if you need it.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly, stayed firm</li>
            <li> Comfortable,  had mine for a couples years now.</li>
            <li> Light weight,  stays in place.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable seat cushion</li>
            <li> but this pillow sits well on the seat and doesn&#x27;t move and is comfortable.</li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s rather cheap but serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to sit on.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable, and when doing a lot of driving, I find that I am not fatigued.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and comfortable, and allowed me to drive my husband&#x27;s truck comfortably.  </li>
            <li> It is very helpful for a more enjoyable car ride.</li>
            <li> Love this works good, muche sturdier that my former one</li>
            <li> This cushion proved to be just the right height to help me see better all around.</li>
            <li> The original was fully covered both sides with a zipper to remove for laundry.  </li>
            <li> I needed it in my car to add some more height in the driver&#x27;s seat and this cushion did exactly that.</li>
            <li> I find that most car seats are made at an acute angle, especially smaller sedans.  </li>
            <li> love the large size; I&#x27;ve needed one like this for years.</li>
            <li> The right size and firmness!</li>
            <li> The cushion is great for short people who need to sit higher.</li>
            <li> The cushion is great for short people who need to sit higher .Helps</li>
            <li> Such good advice as I can now drive sitting at an angle which releaves all pressure on my leg.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite extend to the full seat depth (as seen in description).</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t do (for me, a full sized guy)</li>
            <li> As good a product as one I bought at a medical supply place.</li>
            <li> the full label is 15 X 14 X 3</li>
            <li> My Civic seat doesn&#x27;t have true height adjustment so time will tell about the utility, comfort &amp; durability.</li>
            <li> I wrote this review to give the true dimensions which Amazon had listed at 16 X 13 X 3.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants comfort and able to see over the steering wheel if you&lt;br /&gt;are</li>
            <li> Although I am very happy with the performance of my car, I was seriously thinking of getting rid of it because of the seat problem.</li>
            <li> It gets me up just enough to be able to see better.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and works excellently for my need:  to make my body be parallel to the floor in a car or chair so as not to cause back problems.  </li>
            <li> The zippered cover seems adequate.  </li>
            <li> but I quickly changed my mind as the cushion flattened out</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Right now it&#x27;s nice and firm and the color is more navy than the bright blue as pictured here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so short, this has helped me see better while driving!  </li>
            <li> Really see mixed reviews on this product - it does raise you up beautifully or it compresses too much and doesn&#x27;t raise you up.  </li>
            <li> Fits well and gives my wife the extra height needed to drive more easily.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable and works very well for him.</li>
            <li> I drove a rental that did have that capability and was surprised how much better</li>
            <li> If it was smaller it would fit better in my car seat.</li>
            <li> My wife really liked it initially, but after sitting a while the began to cut off her circulation.  </li>
            <li> Comes in handy it my low driver seat in my car.</li>
            <li> FOR.IT WAS WORTH BUYING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Better than our old one.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re very happy with this product which we got at a great price compared to some other cushions that were far more expensive.</li>
            <li> Adding a more butt &amp; back friendly seat for our older car was my primary purpose for this cushion.</li>
            <li> The web page was very user friendly.</li>
            <li> I looked at the dimensions given for this wedge and thought it should be just right and could replace the pillow I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li> This cushion puts me in the right place.</li>
            <li> This cushion works to get his pelvis and legs at the right angle and alleviates his pain.</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> It is just the right thickness.</li>
            <li> This product arrived within the time frame expected it was in excellent condition,and as described by the sellers.the price was really good,and i am using it daily when driving.</li>
            <li> Easily tossed in the trunk for adult drivers.</li>
            <li> Really came in handy on a recent trip to Florida.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and raises me enough to make the headrest in my Honda Fit.</li>
            <li> Having the whole bottom of the foam exposed will cause shredding quickly and shift and wrinkle the cover.  </li>
            <li> If the cushion were either longer or shorter in depth, it could allow an open container to be placed in front of or on top of the cushion.</li>
            <li> This Cushion is really great, I drive a long to work and back to Home, because of this Cushion I do not feel fatigued when I&#x27;m done driving.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for one of these that would boost me up higher</li>
            <li> Bought this seat wedge to give me a higher driving position (why do car manufacturers make non-adjustable seats?)</li>
            <li> Quite helpful for someone who is short, enabling them to see better out the window.</li>
            <li> The seat cushion is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> and I needed to sit higher in my car driver&#x27;s seat to change the angle of my neck while driving.  </li>
            <li> This products exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with the results that I just ordered a second one</li>
            <li> You can remove the outer shell and place in washing machine in HOT water to remove all smells</li>
            <li> It is soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> so I would love if you brought this back</li>
            <li> It does make you sit up higher in the seat, probably about 3 inches.</li>
            <li> After hip replacement surgery, I needed an extra cushion when sitting in a car or on most chairs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a couple of days and so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> On another note, this cushion makes me sit higher.  </li>
            <li> and then I would not have to be exact about centering myself.  </li>
            <li> Although the wedge is exactly what I wanted for my mother in law&#x27;s car, it was no as pictured.</li>
            <li> The seat cushion is exactly what my mom was looking for and needed.  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY</li>
            <li> Sits me higher up and what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I would like to give this product a higher rating but the zipper broke almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> keep my back straight it very comfortable</li>
            <li> I am pleased to report that this foam does not compact flat.  </li>
            <li> The cushion is nice looking new &amp; seems comfortable with firm density foam.</li>
            <li> It was good, but my friend needed something a bit higher, so he is putting a small pillow under it.</li>
            <li> This is very helpful for anyone who is short, and needs to see better while driving.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to sit on and gives me just the right amount of height to help ease my back pain.</li>
            <li> as many do, the price is low by comparison, and it&#x27;s significantly cut the back and leg pain caused by sitting.  </li>
            <li> The item is pretty much as described, and I thought the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> This item was too large for my needs and had I known of their policy, I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> This item is a wedge of foam loosely covered over the top with a cover.  </li>
            <li> The cushion is large though, and I have to push it through the back of the chair for it to fit.</li>
            <li> The 3 inch rear thickness really raises my 5&#x27;11+&amp;#34; around 165 lb. frame up high on the seat, disconcerting at first.</li>
            <li> The cushion works very well.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and just the rite comfort.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is reasonably priced as well.  </li>
            <li> but it really boosts me up a lot.</li>
            <li> This is way too big to fit in my car seat.</li>
            <li> With an L5-S1 herniated disc, this cushion seems to be the only one that will bring the car seat, and our home seating, up to a comfortable angle.  </li>
            <li> This accomplished what he was looking for...</li>
            <li> Shame on the provider for using such a cheap piece of foam in this wedge cushion.</li>
            <li> is provide much elevation.</li>
            <li> This cushion works very well to support an elderly passenger.</li>
            <li> Getting in and out of the car is much easier.</li>
            <li> Very usefull.  </li>
            <li> ; daughter really needed this</li>
            <li> Very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I feel much safer driving.</li>
            <li> use it all the time is very comforteable</li>
            <li> I purchased the cushion and it arrived fast.</li>
            <li> which was about as much cushion as a deflated balloon.  </li>
            <li> THIS COMPANY.THEY CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS</li>
            <li> But the height of the cushion proved to be too much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s breathable fabric, so you don&#x27;t sweat too much,</li>
            <li> It does not lift you up that much.</li>
            <li> Also,it sticks to your clothes making a smooth entry possible.</li>
            <li> I have a rather sensitive lower back that needs plenty of support and most office chairs don&#x27;t give that.      </li>
            <li> but it is still usable and gives a nice firm foundation for longer car trips.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still nice and firm.</li>
            <li> helped boost me up-it definitely ended up being worth the price!</li>
            <li> Sitting tall in the saddle--a phase which reminds one of John Wayne--becomes important if you are short and your car&#x27;s passenger seat has no way to be elevated short of a factory visit, as is true with my Hyundai Sonata.  </li>
            <li> My wife says that with the cushion, the seat is about the right height and comfortable and I haven&#x27;t heard any other complaints since I put it in.</li>
            <li> As you get older, you get shorter.  </li>
            <li> My main concern regarding buying this unseen is that it would do that.  </li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my older sister.</li>
            <li> Required  two zipped into one casing to get decent support.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to fit it in my car chair every single time.</li>
            <li> This has been very useful for my young driver who has a short torso.  </li>
            <li> and the snow blows have made the roads a mess with many pot holes.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it was more gel like, but it&#x27;s really just plain foam to me, the foam could be denser too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> He tried to use it in his Ford 500, but it sat him up too high.  </li>
            <li> really nice cushion but too thick for our use</li>
            <li> Priced very inexpensively, firm support, easy to remove cover.</li>
            <li> Being short this Cushion just gives me the right height.  </li>
            <li> I am only 5&#x27;1&amp;#34; so it also puts me up a little higher to see better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft, firm, yet very comfortable coshion</li>
            <li> Now with the new cushion, I can see over the&lt;br /&gt;steering wheel.  </li>
            <li> This cushion is giving me a new lease on life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is still a desire on my part to look for a larger cushion - but in the end, the item that I purchased is comfortable and quite acceptable for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend its purchase.</li>
            <li> ALSO NOTE that the Amazon vendor, Medical Department Store requires you get a Return Merchandise Authorization number within 30 days, will charge you a 20% restocking fee &amp; return shipping &amp; you pay for any initial free shipping if returning its non-defective products.</li>
            <li> Also, although the product is cheap, the shipping fee is way higher than usual and counts per cushion.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend for vehicles with higher roofs if you are tall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> It is too soft!  </li>
            <li> delivery a little slow and long way around but very happy.  </li>
            <li> The cushion I just received is clearly labeled 15&amp;#34; x 14&amp;#34; not 16&amp;#34; x 13&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It was firm, comfortable and the material was soft, yet sturdy.</li>
            <li> We bought this cushion for the use of a 96 year old lady.   </li>
            <li> and so far seems to be quite durable and well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I inquired with my auto dealer about an installation on my two year old model and was told a price that was a discouragement.  </li>
            <li> It is quite firm, but with repeated use, it loses some of its firmness and becomes much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I needed a sturdy and firm wedge cushion for my car seat and it had to be comfortable</li>
            <li> Comfortable yet firm.</li>
            <li> I appreciated tracking option.consider purchase yourself if your driver seat is low.</li>
            <li> So far it has retained its shape.</li>
            <li> So far it has kept its shape well.</li>
            <li> last quite a long time and are cheap enough to be replaced if they do age out or get damaged.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s 2014 Honda Accord electric drivers seat would not come up high enough for her.</li>
            <li> The pillow is not quite high enough.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not nearly that much &#x27;foam&#x27;</li>
            <li> Hence this seat, which is light and yet firm enough, elevated my diminutive wife high enough</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it is large enough and sturdy enough to help in the maintenance of my posture while sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is actually navy blue and the wedge is not as large as pictured.</li>
            <li> It is fairly comfortable but it could be a little wider and I am not a big person.  </li>
            <li> Have a new car that the seat dips lower in the back.  </li>
            <li> After suffering with a shooting pain down my right leg while driving, my Doctor suggested changing the angle of my car seat.</li>
            <li> It squeezes down to the thickness of the cloth cover, and offers no support to raise you higher than you are when sitting without any cushion.</li>
            <li> But I really noticed my lack of being able to see the street after hitting some pretty bad pot holes that I didn&#x27;t even see.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve taken it out to our second car so that I don&#x27;t have to keep changing the wedge from the first car to the second and back again.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses this in the car so she can see better - our seats are not adjustable up and down as they were in the previous car we had.</li>
            <li> but it is not firm enough.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> The cover on our old wedge was constantly coming off.</li>
            <li> was disappointed mostly in the fact that the dimension from front to back was more than 1 inch smaller and that the height was 1/2 inch shorter than described.&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of excess fabric in the cover.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was prompt and I always go to Amazon when I am looking for a particular article as I can usually find what I am looking for and they are reasonable on prices of merchandise.</li>
            <li> ,cheap piece of foam, cover is a dark navy blue, doesn&#x27;t remotely look like picture.</li>
            <li> The cushion is relatively high density but compresses down almost completely when I sit on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve moved it from under me to behind and my lower back is much better.</li>
            <li> I would that it were a little higher</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was one of the least expensive seat cushions on Amazon, but does exactly what I wanted: it adds enough cushioning that my chair is more comfortable, and has the added benefit of slightly elevating and stretching my posture.</li>
            <li> I got a cheap cushion previously and it was not comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It is fine if you are wearing jeans, but I would be careful with delicate fabrics.  </li>
            <li> The back is a little wide for my car, so it moves around a bit but does solve my sciatica pain from having my knees higher than my hips.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m only 4&#x27;8&amp;#34; and needed a little extra height when driving my new Jeep.  </li>
            <li> For my back issues, I need to sit very flat.  </li>
            <li> and I have bought similar items in the past that were much nicer.</li>
            <li> Going on 3 years this cushion has held up well &amp; it makes long trips in a previously uncomfortable seat, much better.</li>
            <li> The width is adequate for my 68+ old man skinny butt in a 1999 Honda Civic LX 4dr sedan fabric covered driver&#x27;s (uncomfortable) seat.</li>
            <li> But after a two hour drive with it, it was as flat as a pancake and it offered zero support.</li>
            <li> When I sit on it, it goes flat, and I&#x27;m about 115 pounds.</li>
            <li> as my experience with it is that it tends to squish flat.  </li>
            <li> and I will only use this when the tendonitis is aggravated in long car rides.</li>
            <li> The material is firm enough to add height and keep person from sinking into car seat but soft enough to be comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it puts me a little higher in the driver&#x27;s seat, which makes seeing the road a little easier.</li>
            <li> It gives firm support and meets my needs as far as making me sit flat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use primarily on long trips to help with both height and butt fatigue.  </li>
            <li> Used to get leg cramps while driving long distances in my wife&#x27;s car.  </li>
            <li> helps my tale bone when sitting a long time traveling.</li>
            <li> I find it necessary to center myself on the cushion each time I get into the car.  </li>
            <li> I get when riding for a long distance.</li>
            <li> So far seems to stay firm</li>
            <li> The cushion is a little too big and pretty hard</li>
            <li> which it was a little bigger but has definitely improved the comfort level of my car seat</li>
            <li> Due to the above, I would recommend this cushion.</li>
            <li> Gives me that extra few inches to help me see as I am short</li>
            <li> buy at least two for decent support</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the cover zips on so that it will not come loose as you get in and out of the car.</li>
            <li> and I sunk back down.</li>
            <li> I removed the cushion from the cover and sliced it in half with a serrated knife, put it back in the cover</li>
            <li> My rig is only a year and a half with 150,000 miles or so.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter to give her a little extra height while driving.  </li>
            <li> This cushion is very strudy and firm, unlike other cushions I have had in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am under 5 ft. and have such a hard time driving or even riding in cars because I am so short.</li>
            <li> It is also well made and firm enough to keep its shape.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely open-cell form (mushy) rather than closed-cell (firm, like memory foam), even though a dense form.  </li>
            <li> Expected something sturdier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days</li>
            <li> wide etc..</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only used it a few days</li>
            <li> and apparently I have a short torso because my visibility is not great without this.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little too big.</li>
            <li> I have had other relatives drive my vehicle and they too have commented on the cushion and comfort.</li>
            <li> The picture of this cushion is a bit deceiving, maybe due to a shadow?  </li>
            <li> Other sized people &amp; seats take heed.</li>
            <li> It is not what I wanted, and due to policy, I cannot return this product.</li>
            <li> The other reviews indicate the foam will flatten out after use, I guess I&#x27;ll find out.</li>
            <li> After trying other cushions</li>
            <li> We immediately ordered another one for the other car.</li>
            <li> I tried different angles of the seat and the back with poor results.  </li>
            <li> Long distance car travel was very hard on my hip and back until this seat wedge.  </li>
            <li> Has necessary firmness without being hard.  </li>
            <li> Initially, I thought it was too hard but got used to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an average person of 150 lbs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bargain &amp; my only complaint</li>
            <li> Seat cover is dark navy, which is not the color I would have chosen.</li>
            <li> OK...first, I have car where the passenger seat doesn&#x27;t raise up or down</li>
            <li> I thought it would squish down</li>
            <li> As soon as you sit in smashes down to nothing.  </li>
            <li> hes down a touch</li>
            <li> Ironically, the wedge in a car is perhaps just slightly thicker than it should be</li>
            <li> A slight annoyance is that since my car has leather seats, there&#x27;s no friction with the material and the cushion slides to the sides whenever I get in or out of the car, but once seated, it stays put.  </li>
            <li> Its fairly wide which results in poor stability while driving, you shift back and forth while turning!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> but i cut in half and seems to work.</li>
            <li> I work long hours on the computer and my chair edge is too hard -- after a while</li>
            <li> The only one small complaint I have is that the ends of the zipper on the cover are a little pokey, and could put a pull in your pant leg.  </li>
            <li> So it does what I needed it to do, though  its a little narrower than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> , I just wish it were a little thicker.</li>
            <li> His car is a little coup and we discovered the angle of the seat was aggravating his pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and both goals are well met.</li>
            <li> The seat wedge is firm</li>
            <li> recommend it for anyone who has trouble getting out of a bucket seat or just to raise the height a bit.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a few inches of lift and</li>
            <li> This was money wasted.</li>
            <li> If you end up in the edge it&#x27; not comfortable.</li>
            <li> but it is not secure to the seat.</li>
            <li> Even with that few miles my air seat foam is compacting.</li>
            <li> It is firm and doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;shift</li>
            <li> I would recommend this cushion to anyone having to do any long distance driving or one who spends a lot of time behind the wheel of their vehicle.</li>
            <li> Single cushion to thin.</li>
            <li> Not at all \\&quot;firm foam\\&quot; as describe!</li>
            <li> Also, it is a bit slick which I guess makes it easier to slide out but with the firmness and the width I find myself wishing</li>
            <li> This is from a small, 100 lb person.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a small frame weighing 130lbs.  </li>
            <li> It is not as thick as it appears in the picture, in fact, it&#x27;s about half as thick as it looks to be.  </li>
            <li> Very firm but cmfortable.</li>
            <li> Simple foam block with a very thin cover .</li>
            <li> Not what I was excepting; too small for the seat area not as thick width wise;&lt;br /&gt;would</li>
            <li> +After trying (and being disappointed by) a number of more expensive lumbar cushions, this one did the trick!  </li>
            <li> The Accord&#x27;s have terriable, terriable rock hard seats.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sag like some people have stated in their reviews, at least not for us.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as the marketing picture makes it appear.</li>
            <li> For my purposes it was too thick.</li>
            <li> I mean it holds</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see over the hood of my car, so was quite tense while driving.</li>
            <li> and my night vision is not good,</li>

            <li> Comfortable for the car</li>
            <li> The zipper is on the front, which makes it scratch the underside of the legs. It could be improved by putting the zipper on the back. It is not as thick as the marketing picture makes it appear. I was doing almost as well with a good dining chair cushion from Target.</li>
            <li> The cushion works very well.  I just wish it was thicker.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Fast delivery and just the rite comfort.</li>
            <li> It was good, but my friend needed something a bit higher, so he is putting a small pillow under it.</li>
            <li> The style of the cushion is great but it is not firm enough.</li>
            <li> Good product  Does the job</li>
            <li> We bought this cushion for the use of a 96 year old lady.   It is very helpful for a more enjoyable car ride.</li>
            <li> worked great for car seat cushion.  delivery a little slow and long way around but very happy.  may order another soon.  thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I could use it as a wedge for my office chair. I have a rather sensitive lower back that needs plenty of support and most office chairs don&#x27;t give that.      I looked at the dimensions given for this wedge and thought it should be just right and could replace the pillow I&#x27;ve been using.  After receiving it, I realized that was not the case.    So I&#x27;ve taken it out to our second car so that I don&#x27;t have to keep changing the wedge from the first car to the second and back again.  Ironically, the wedge in a car is perhaps just slightly thicker than it should be but it is still usable and gives a nice firm foundation for longer car trips.    So this is why I give this wedge cushion an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; rating.</li>
            <li> If you have leather seats DON&#x27;T buy these, you&#x27;ll slip all over.</li>
            <li> My car has a sport suspension, which means I feel every lump and bump in the road.  I&#x27;ve been using this wedge cushion for more than a year and really love it.  No more uncomfortable rides and it puts me a little higher in the driver&#x27;s seat, which makes seeing the road a little easier. Good product all around.</li>
            <li> After suffering with a shooting pain down my right leg while driving, my Doctor suggested changing the angle of my car seat. I tried different angles of the seat and the back with poor results.  After a trip to the local car parts store, the clerk there said what I needed was a seat wedge and to check out the one on Amazon.  Such good advice as I can now drive sitting at an angle which releaves all pressure on my leg.</li>
            <li> Adding a more butt &amp; back friendly seat for our older car was my primary purpose for this cushion. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and both goals are well met. It&#x27;s a soft, firm, yet very comfortable coshion and so far seems to be quite durable and well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I deducted 1 star is it&#x27;s size. It doesn&#x27;t quite extend to the full seat depth (as seen in description). The issue this causes me is in carrying a cup of coffee between my legs; there isn&#x27;t enough space between the edge of the seat &amp; the cushion or enough between the cushion&#x27;s front edge &amp; my body to position an open cup. If the cushion were either longer or shorter in depth, it could allow an open container to be placed in front of or on top of the cushion. All things considered, this IS a very nice cushion and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Has necessary firmness without being hard.  Seems to stay put once put in place.  I&#x27;ll likely add some anti-pad between the car seat and pad.</li>
            <li> This Cushion is really great, I drive a long to work and back to Home, because of this Cushion I do not feel fatigued when I&#x27;m done driving. I would recommend this cushion to anyone having to do any long distance driving or one who spends a lot of time behind the wheel of their vehicle.</li>
            <li> I am five foot six inches tall.  The auto I drive does not have power lift seat adjustment.  I drove a rental that did have that capability and was surprised how much better I felt driving the rental car.  I inquired with my auto dealer about an installation on my two year old model and was told a price that was a discouragement.  He suggest this type of of cushion.  It works perfectly to raise me up about an inch and the covering grabs on to the upholstery of the driver seat and does not slide around.  I have had other relatives drive my vehicle and they too have commented on the cushion and comfort.</li>
            <li> I find that most car seats are made at an acute angle, especially smaller sedans.  I find this \\&quot;jack-knife\\&quot; position very uncomfortable, and so ordered this wedge device to see if it relieved my soreness.  I am happy to report that it works for me. It is quite firm, but with repeated use, it loses some of its firmness and becomes much more comfortable.  Note that it does not have a cocyx cut-out (thus probably will be uncomfortable for those with sore tailbones). I like it for longer car rides, as the cushioning is superior to the car seat alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is reasonably priced as well.  I took off one star, as the cover is not stain-proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kone</li>
            <li> OK...first, I have car where the passenger seat doesn&#x27;t raise up or down and people complain that it&#x27;s a bit too low, so I thought I&#x27;d buy a cushion. I was hoping it was more gel like, but it&#x27;s really just plain foam to me, the foam could be denser too. The size is near perfect. It covers the bucket seat. It&#x27;s angled/tapered a bit too, so that levels out the seat too. My wife says that with the cushion, the seat is about the right height and comfortable and I haven&#x27;t heard any other complaints since I put it in.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for one of these that would boost me up higher (I am short), and it&#x27;s perfect. I thought it would squish down but it really boosts me up a lot. To be perfect it could have a wipeable or removeable cover instead of cloth, I have spilled some stuff on it so will need a new one eventually. Love it though.</li>
            <li> Bought this seat wedge to give me a higher driving position (why do car manufacturers make non-adjustable seats?) does the job perfectly. The seat wedge is firm but I&#x27;ve just completed a drive across the US and it was really comfortable.</li>
            <li> The wedge cushion that I received was initially a disappointment because of its small size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is large enough and sturdy enough to help in the maintenance of my posture while sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is still a desire on my part to look for a larger cushion - but in the end, the item that I purchased is comfortable and quite acceptable for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend its purchase.</li>
            <li> This cushion is all that I hoped for.  I am impressed by how much better quality this cushion has vs. my old one.  Being fairly short, I needed something to raise me up and give me better visability, and this cushion has fulfilled that need perfectly.</li>
            <li> The cushion is a little too big and pretty hard but maybe after I use it for awhile if will soften up.</li>
            <li> Quite helpful for someone who is short, enabling them to see better out the window.</li>
            <li> The seat cushion is exactly what I was looking for.  I have been having problems with my neck and I needed to sit higher in my car driver&#x27;s seat to change the angle of my neck while driving.  The height was perfect and the cushion is comfortable and stays in place easily while driving.  It is so comfortable that I now use the cushion whether I am a driver or passenger.</li>
            <li> This is described as 16X13X3. it is actually 18X16X3 so the product description is wrong..  This is way too big to fit in my car seat. I needed it to see better when driving. I&#x27;ve returned it.</li>
            <li> This products exactly as described.  I can only hope there&#x27;s no problem with how it functions.  I&#x27;ll use primarily on long trips to help with both height and butt fatigue.  If you know someone who sews, it can be made easily as home.</li>
            <li> The cushion is great for short people who need to sit higher. For my purposes it was too thick. I removed the cushion from the cover and sliced it in half with a serrated knife, put it back in the cover and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> +After trying (and being disappointed by) a number of more expensive lumbar cushions, this one did the trick!  With an L5-S1 herniated disc, this cushion seems to be the only one that will bring the car seat, and our home seating, up to a comfortable angle.  Because there can be different causes of lumbar pain, the cushion might not work for everyone; however, this is a cushion that doesn&#x27;t slide around as many do, the price is low by comparison, and it&#x27;s significantly cut the back and leg pain caused by sitting.  I&#x27;m so pleased with the results that I just ordered a second one so I don&#x27;t have to keep packing this around from the house to the car and back!</li>
            <li> The cushion is great for short people who need to sit higher .Helps keep my back straight it very comfortable</li>
            <li> This seat was purchase for my husband in order to raise him up from the low seats in our Nisson Ultimer.  He felt like he was sitting too low to the ground.  This accomplished what he was looking for...</li>
            <li> I needed a sturdy and firm wedge cushion for my car seat and it had to be comfortable (I suffer from chronic back pain) as well as affordable. This product met all my requirements with flying colors!</li>
            <li> great product but dont forget to wash. Well made, comfortable, and easy to install. You can remove the outer shell and place in washing machine in HOT water to remove all smells</li>
            <li> We tried this cushion in the car to help elevate person in the bucket seat. It is a great help for elderly in getting out of the car as well.&lt;br /&gt;Cushion is perfect size. It is also well made and firm enough to keep its shape.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for anyone who has trouble getting out of a bucket seat or just to raise the height a bit.</li>
            <li> This product is made with poor quality foam.  It gives no lift at all.  As soon as you sit in smashes down to nothing.  I&#x27;m an average person of 150 lbs.  I was expecting a few inches of lift and this cushion does nothing!  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this item.  It did raise up my seating height.  A slight annoyance is that since my car has leather seats, there&#x27;s no friction with the material and the cushion slides to the sides whenever I get in or out of the car, but once seated, it stays put.  Bottom line, my satisfaction outweighs the problem.</li>
            <li> This is a $11 item that you will be charged $10 shipping and handling. Its fairly wide which results in poor stability while driving, you shift back and forth while turning!&lt;br /&gt;For the cost I would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Note on returns to this seller: 2) A 20% re-stocking fee applies to refund returns. Shipping/handling charges are not refunded. Customized products are not restockable.</li>
            <li> This seat came with the a tear in the cover and I have bought similar items in the past that were much nicer.</li>
            <li> Well, I should have figured that cost equals value.  After using this cushion for 20 miuntes it felt good. But after a two hour drive with it, it was as flat as a pancake and it offered zero support. It&#x27;s a piece of junk, and will soon find its&#x27; way into the trash. This was money wasted. Shame on the provider for using such a cheap piece of foam in this wedge cushion.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter to give her a little extra height while driving.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This cushion does what I want it to. I can use it in the car or on my chair at my desk.</li>
            <li> The back is a little wide for my car, so it moves around a bit but does solve my sciatica pain from having my knees higher than my hips.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more firmer.  I was trying to release pressure off of my tail bone, but it still bother me.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little too big. Initially, I thought it was too hard but got used to it. If it was smaller it would fit better in my car seat. Apart from that, I&#x27;m glad I bought it. It does make a difference. Especially for those with back/disc problems.</li>
            <li> I use this cushion at work.  It is comfortable and seems to help to decrease leg/back pain.  The cushion is large though, and I have to push it through the back of the chair for it to fit.</li>
            <li> I got this cushion to make a chair at home more comfortable. I work long hours on the computer and my chair edge is too hard -- after a while, I feel it cutting off circulation in my legs. So I wanted padding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was one of the least expensive seat cushions on Amazon, but does exactly what I wanted: it adds enough cushioning that my chair is more comfortable, and has the added benefit of slightly elevating and stretching my posture. And it looks fine, just like the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it doesn&#x27;t do (for me, a full sized guy) is provide much elevation. The cushion is relatively high density but compresses down almost completely when I sit on it. It&#x27;s definitely open-cell form (mushy) rather than closed-cell (firm, like memory foam), even though a dense form.  I&#x27;d guess that it adds about 1/4\\&quot; cushion in front, and 1/2\\&quot; in back, when in usage. But that&#x27;s enough to solve my issue. However, I&#x27;m subtracting one star because I thought that was unclear in the product description and thicker would be better.</li>
            <li> The picture of this cushion is a bit deceiving, maybe due to a shadow?  It is not as thick as it appears in the picture, in fact, it&#x27;s about half as thick as it looks to be.  It&#x27;s even 1/4\\&quot; thinner than the dimension listed. It does seem to be good sturdy foam so I think it will hold it&#x27;s shape well.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet as I bought it for my mother to use when she rides in my car. I ended up putting this cushion on top of another cushion inside a plastic zip-up bag so I hope, between the two, it will work. I was disappointed when I took it out of the box and saw how thin it actually is.</li>
            <li> Expected something sturdier.</li>
            <li> This cushion works very well to support an elderly passenger. Getting in and out of the car is much easier.</li>
            <li> The product met all of my expectations. It is soft and comfortable. I recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;The size was a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> The right size and firmness!</li>
            <li> It gets me up just enough to be able to see better. I felt as if I were sitting on the floor.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and works excellently for my need:  to make my body be parallel to the floor in a car or chair so as not to cause back problems.  Very usefull.  As good a product as one I bought at a medical supply place.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see over the hood of my car, so was quite tense while driving. This cushion proved to be just the right height to help me see better all around. A very simple device, but it works well for me and I drive more relaxed.</li>
            <li> I love it. I can now see well above the steering wheel of my car.  My lumbar region is well supported.</li>
            <li> It helps, but slides around. It just doesn&#x27;t stay in place like the one I bought several years ago.  If you end up in the edge it&#x27; not comfortable.</li>
            <li> I got a cheap cushion previously and it was not comfortable.  This one is much better but it is not secure to the seat.</li>
            <li> My wife really liked it initially, but after sitting a while the began to cut off her circulation.  You&#x27;ll definitely need to take breaks, but it does correct the non-ergonomic angle of the car seats.</li>
            <li> my 4&#x27;11&amp;#34; daughter really needed this and now she can see over the steering wheel!  Seems to have kept it&#x27;s shape but only had it for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a shorty like me. Zip off cover will allow me to keep it looking good.&lt;br /&gt;I love the large size; I&#x27;ve needed one like this for years.</li>
            <li> Not what I was excepting; too small for the seat area not as thick width wise;&lt;br /&gt;would not purchase again; seat cover did not meet my expectation</li>
            <li> This works as a great booster seat in the car or back wedge if you need it. Very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I needed a seat cushion so my husband and I can share one car without constantly changing the seat height. This works just perfect.</li>
            <li> It makes all the difference in my Honda Accord. I am 5&#x27;3 and apparently I have a short torso because my visibility is not great without this. I&#x27;ve only had it a few days so I can&#x27;t speak to whether it will sink over time. Right now it&#x27;s nice and firm and the color is more navy than the bright blue as pictured here.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m only 4&#x27;8&amp;#34; and needed a little extra height when driving my new Jeep.  It worked perfectly, stayed firm and I love the fact that the cover is washable. A good buy!</li>
            <li> Love this works good, muche sturdier that my former one</li>
            <li> Comes in handy it my low driver seat in my car. It&#x27;s the same color as my car too. Comfortable,  had mine for a couples years now.</li>
            <li> I wished it did work but it simply does not help my herniated disc.  I will be returning this product and would like instructions on how to do so.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted for a driving cushion. Comfortable yet firm.</li>
            <li> This has been very useful for my young driver who has a short torso.  Easily tossed in the trunk for adult drivers.</li>
            <li> I put this in our Venza, now I can see over the hood of the vehicle!</li>
            <li> Seems like good quality.  Light weight,  stays in place.  I used it for the passenger seat in my Hyundai Sonata which is known for a low mounted seat on the passenger side.</li>
            <li> Please start making these again.....I loved them and so did many of my clients so I would love if you brought this back</li>
            <li> Did not help my back at all. I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> I use this to elevate myself when I drive. . I would that it were a little higher so my visibility would be better</li>
            <li> The cushion I just received is clearly labeled 15&amp;#34; x 14&amp;#34; not 16&amp;#34; x 13&amp;#34;. the full label is 15 X 14 X 3 To 1 1/2&amp;#34; NAVY. Those labeled dimensions are correct at 15&amp;#34; wide etc.. The width is adequate for my 68+ old man skinny butt in a 1999 Honda Civic LX 4dr sedan fabric covered driver&#x27;s (uncomfortable) seat. Other sized people &amp; seats take heed. The cushion has a thicker (Codura?) nylon, sewn on rear carrying handle &amp; short nap velour-like/flocked removable (zippered) cover. The cushion is nice looking new &amp; seems comfortable with firm density foam. The 3 inch rear thickness really raises my 5&#x27;11+&amp;#34; around 165 lb. frame up high on the seat, disconcerting at first. My Civic seat doesn&#x27;t have true height adjustment so time will tell about the utility, comfort &amp; durability. I wrote this review to give the true dimensions which Amazon had listed at 16 X 13 X 3. I will update review if my initial impression changes with further use. ALSO NOTE that the Amazon vendor, Medical Department Store requires you get a Return Merchandise Authorization number within 30 days, will charge you a 20% restocking fee &amp; return shipping &amp; you pay for any initial free shipping if returning its non-defective products. They will accept defective products within 10 days of delivery for credit, exchange or repair at their discretion. Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/9/2016: Changing to 5 stars. Going on 3 years this cushion has held up well &amp; it makes long trips in a previously uncomfortable seat, much better. It&#x27;s a bargain &amp; my only complaint is that I have to reposition it everytime I get back in the car.</li>
            <li> This 4&#x27;11&amp;#34; girl loves her &#x27;booster seat&#x27;. I use it to drive our truck.</li>
            <li> bought this along with a heated seat cover for my 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; elderly mother, She loves it!!! Used to sit on pillows to not have to look through the steering wheel</li>
            <li> Does the job perfectly and I would love to get another one but have been unable to find it on the Amazon site.</li>
            <li> This cushion provided added comfort on my SUV seat. Really came in handy on a recent trip to Florida. It does make you sit up higher in the seat, probably about 3 inches. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> really nice cushion but too thick for our use but i cut in half and seems to work. Slides on leather seats but that is ok makes it easier to move around.</li>
            <li> Cushion is comfortable,  and the height  is good,.  So it does what I needed it to do, though  its a little narrower than I thought it would be.  Color shown in picture is  incorrect.  Seat cover is dark navy, which is not the color I would have chosen.</li>
            <li> Very firm but cmfortable. Gives me that extra few inches to help me see as I am short</li>
            <li> This did the trick for my wife who neede alittle bit of a boost to keep the sun out of her eyes.</li>
            <li> The cushion is just what I wanted.  As you get older, you get shorter.  Now with the new cushion, I can see over the&lt;br /&gt;steering wheel.  Perfect!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Harris</li>
            <li> I wish it has a string to hold it in place so I don&#x27;t have to fit it in my car chair every single time.</li>
            <li> this is perfect.I feel much safer driving.The web page was very user friendly.I appreciated tracking option.consider purchase yourself if your driver seat is low.</li>
            <li> Used to get leg cramps while driving long distances in my wife&#x27;s car.  No problem in my car, just hers.  Used the cushion just recently Chicago to Nashville and back with no problems! Love it and will get a spare!</li>
            <li> The auto wedge seat cushion was received on time in excellent condition. It is doing the job it was made for.    I am very happy with it. Charles Trauth</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with this cushion as it is well made and very comfortable to sit on in my car.The shipping was prompt and I always go to Amazon when I am looking for a particular article as I can usually find what I am looking for and they are reasonable on prices of merchandise.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on line.  It is not what I wanted, and due to policy, I cannot return this product.</li>
            <li> After hip replacement surgery, I needed an extra cushion when sitting in a car or on most chairs.  This worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> Long distance car travel was very hard on my hip and back until this seat wedge.  I love it.  I am only 5&#x27;1&amp;#34; so it also puts me up a little higher to see better.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> use it all the time is very comforteable</li>
            <li> does just what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm. Great product AND A GOOD PRICE.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sag like some people have stated in their reviews, at least not for us. It helps shorter people use the larger seats in US cars.</li>
            <li> After reading several of the reviews for this seat wedge, I bought it. I am a big boy who drives a big rig. 8 to 14 hours a day 6 days a week. My rig is only a year and a half with 150,000 miles or so. Even with that few miles my air seat foam is compacting. My lower back was starting to hurt and I knew the junk I purchased at Wal-Mart wasen&#x27;t cutting it. This wedge does&#x27;t flatten like the others. It&#x27;s only been a couple of days and so far I am very pleased. Update from Oct.7. It&#x27;s still nice and firm. I mean it holds it&#x27;s shape well. I&#x27;ve moved it from under me to behind and my lower back is much better. No regrets. October 19 2012. NOW AFTER ONE YEAR AND I STILL LIKE AND USE THIS SEAT WEDGE. 10/29/2013</li>
            <li> We have a 2000 conversion van.  The seats are showing their age and we use this wedge in the van to save my husband&#x27;s back.  He tried to use it in his Ford 500, but it sat him up too high.  I would only recommend for vehicles with higher roofs if you are tall.</li>
            <li> This is a well made cushion with a zip off cover that can be washed and a handy carrying grip.  So far it has retained its shape. The cushion arrived in a timely manner. It is a good buy and I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cushion and it arrived fast. The cover for it didn&#x27;t cover the bottom of cushion. Real cheap cover.</li>
            <li> which it was a little bigger but has definitely improved the comfort level of my car seat</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to sit on and gives me just the right amount of height to help ease my back pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft! Not at all \\&quot;firm foam\\&quot; as describe! When I sit on it, it goes flat, and I&#x27;m about 115 pounds. Very disappointed! Also, although the product is cheap, the shipping fee is way higher than usual and counts per cushion. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I like it  helps my tale bone when sitting a long time traveling. thank you Gloria</li>
            <li> comfy and gives enough added height. seems durable. no rub-off.&lt;br /&gt;looks good and sits well on the seat&lt;br /&gt;the end</li>
            <li> I needed a wedge-shaped cushion to use in a car where the seat bottom tilts back and is non-adjustable.  For my back issues, I need to sit very flat.  I did not want &#x27;memory foam&#x27; as my experience with it is that it tends to squish flat.  My main concern regarding buying this unseen is that it would do that.  I am pleased to report that this foam does not compact flat.  It gives firm support and meets my needs as far as making me sit flat.  On another note, this cushion makes me sit higher.  That was not a need, but is okay.  The zippered cover seems adequate.  The cushion fits very nicely in the car seat.  Due to the above, I would recommend this cushion.</li>
            <li> The wedge cushion worked out great for the drivers seat in my car. It was firm, comfortable and the material was soft, yet sturdy.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and raises me enough to make the headrest in my Honda Fit. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8&amp;#34;, but the headrest in my car doesn&#x27;t fit comfortably behind my head. This cushion puts me in the right place. Comfortable seat cushion</li>
            <li> Does the job but if you have leather seats, you need something at the bottom to prevent it from sliding.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in good shape. Bought as a gift for my older sister. She seems to be extremely happy with it. It does the job of improving her viewing angle while driving.</li>
            <li> I am not that tall so I need to use pillows to drive. Most slip and slide but this pillow sits well on the seat and doesn&#x27;t move and is comfortable.</li>
            <li> The photo was not one of the product as the dimensions of the product received did not match and it&#x27;s not nearly that much &#x27;foam&#x27; which was about as much cushion as a deflated balloon.  The saving grace is the fact that it is a zipper lined pouch, so some usable material may be able to fill it so it works as intended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for a friend. It is comfortable and works very well for him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so short, this has helped me see better while driving!  Thank you for the great product!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> I wish it were thicker.  Oh well. Try again.</li>
            <li> This cushion has no vertical thickness when you sit on it.  It squeezes down to the thickness of the cloth cover, and offers no support to raise you higher than you are when sitting without any cushion.</li>
            <li> I HAD TO WRITE A REVIEW ABOUT THIS COMPANY.THEY CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS SATISFACTION.THEY WILL HELP YOU OUT IN ANYWAY THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE PRODUCT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.IT WAS WORTH BUYING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I needed it for tendonitis. But the height of the cushion proved to be too much and I tower above the steering wheel (I am 5&#x27;4\\&quot; so it could work for shorter people who need a boost). The firmness is about medium and I will only use this when the tendonitis is aggravated in long car rides.</li>
            <li> When I first used this in my vehicle I thought it was great, even perfect but I quickly changed my mind as the cushion flattened out and I sunk back down. Mind you, I only weigh 107lbs so after the 2nd use I tossed it. I&#x27;m going to an upholstery store to see if they can make me one with a dense memory foam.</li>
            <li> This works to make me taller in the seat.  It is fairly comfortable but it could be a little wider and I am not a big person.  I find it necessary to center myself on the cushion each time I get into the car.  Also, it is a bit slick which I guess makes it easier to slide out but with the firmness and the width I find myself wishing it were a bit wider and then I would not have to be exact about centering myself.  I am a size four so I don&#x27;t think I am alone with feeling this way.  I find myself wondering why the zipper was placed in the front unless it was for manufacturing ease.</li>
            <li> Although the wedge is exactly what I wanted for my mother in law&#x27;s car, it was no as pictured. It is actually navy blue and the wedge is not as large as pictured.</li>
            <li> Priced very inexpensively, firm support, easy to remove cover. No hole at the tailbone area was a plus for me. Better than Tush-Cush</li>
            <li> Simple foam block with a very thin cover .</li>
            <li> Great product... stays put while you get in and out of the car... very satisfied...</li>
            <li> The seat cushion is exactly what my mom was looking for and needed.  A great product.  It is durable and does the job.</li>
            <li> I can now see the Potholes.  Bad snow and ice this winter around here and the snow blows have made the roads a mess with many pot holes.  I purchased this car last Fall.  I noticed I seemed to be looking over the steering wheel. I tried the seat adjustment and there isn&#x27;t any for height.  But I really noticed my lack of being able to see the street after hitting some pretty bad pot holes that I didn&#x27;t even see.  I just got this cushion, and tried it.  Works great I can see the pot holes.  The other reviews indicate the foam will flatten out after use, I guess I&#x27;ll find out. So far I&#x27;m glad I got this very handy helper.  It must be the design of the car not that I&#x27;m shrinking.  They say we lose height as we age.</li>
            <li> I am under 5 ft. and have such a hard time driving or even riding in cars because I am so short. This cushion is wonderful; It eases any back or leg pain I get when riding for a long distance.</li>
            <li> I use this product when I drive a 13 passenger van.  It gives me the extra lift I need.  It was everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I love my cushion. I&#x27;ve been driving around in my car having to stretch my neck to look over the steering wheel, since I shrunk by several inches. This cushion is giving me a new lease on life. Driving is so much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Have a new car that the seat dips lower in the back.  Being short this Cushion just gives me the right height.  Seems to be keeping its shape and looks neat.</li>
            <li> my seats suck.  other reviews are crazy.  sure it smoos hes down a touch but i&#x27;m on it for an hour or two every day and this has been great.</li>
            <li> Being under 5 ft, I need quite a boost height-wise when I&#x27;m driving and this cushion is just enough of a lift for me when combined with an adjustable carseat. It&#x27;s very comfortable but maintains its shape all the time. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years and it&#x27;s still as good as new.</li>
            <li> MEDICAL DEPARTMENT STORES DOES NOT ACCEPT RETURNS FOR ANY REASON. This item was too large for my needs and had I known of their policy, I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> Two short people in our family.  These cushions are great for making a car seat much more comfortable for long drives.  The material is firm enough to add height and keep person from sinking into car seat but soft enough to be comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last quite a long time and are cheap enough to be replaced if they do age out or get damaged.</li>
            <li> I love this cushion. After trying other cushions I&lt;br /&gt;finally got one that makes it possible for me to see&lt;br /&gt;the front of my car and out the back. It is firm and doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;shift around. Perfect.</li>
            <li> This product arrived within the time frame expected it was in excellent condition,and as described by the sellers.the price was really good,and i am using it daily when driving.</li>
            <li> This item was totally unacceptable.  I had repeated an earlier order of the same item and got a totally different and inferior one.  This item is a wedge of foam loosely covered over the top with a cover.  The original was fully covered both sides with a zipper to remove for laundry.  Having the whole bottom of the foam exposed will cause shredding quickly and shift and wrinkle the cover.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Using it as a back cushion. Exceeded expectations</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cushion for a while, I ordered it because when I put on the seat belt it rubs on my neck. It&#x27;s OK, I just wish it were a little thicker.</li>
            <li> IT FITS IN THE FORD ESCORT SEAT WELL  AND FITS MY BOTTOM WELL.  EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED SEEMS TO BE WELL MADE</li>
            <li> Awesome and comfortable, good sized and came sealed in plastic...helped boost me up-it definitely ended up being worth the price!</li>
            <li> My husband has some chronic back and leg pain. His car is a little coup and we discovered the angle of the seat was aggravating his pain. This cushion works to get his pelvis and legs at the right angle and alleviates his pain. So far it has kept its shape well. He is very happy with the product. We strongly recommend this cushion.</li>
            <li> Using it as a car seat. Could have used something thicker and firmer. This is from a small, 100 lb person. You get the idea.</li>
            <li> Fits well and gives my wife the extra height needed to drive more easily.  A very worthwhile product at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s 2014 Honda Accord electric drivers seat would not come up high enough for her. This cushion solved the problem.</li>
            <li> I am a short person, and I have just purchased this seat cushion. It&#x27;s very comfortable. It boosts you a good two inches and I can see so much better out towards the road from my car onto the road. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  The sellers are great.  For the price I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s rather cheap but serves the purpose. Sits me higher up and what I needed.  So far seems to stay firm but I&#x27;ve only used it a few days and I&#x27;m a small frame weighing 130lbs.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay this price for another one.</li>
            <li> Sitting tall in the saddle--a phase which reminds one of John Wayne--becomes important if you are short and your car&#x27;s passenger seat has no way to be elevated short of a factory visit, as is true with my Hyundai Sonata.  Hence this seat, which is light and yet firm enough, elevated my diminutive wife high enough so she could see over the dashboard and out the front window, allowing her the ability to alert me to things she felt I had missed.  That&#x27;s called front seat driving vs back seat driving, but I am still pleased to have gotten her this excellent product.</li>
            <li> The pillow is not quite high enough. It wears well. Easy to slip over when entering car. The price was right.</li>
            <li> The cushion fits my car seat perfectly.  It is just the right thickness. I would order it again should the need arise.</li>
            <li> Single cushion to thin. Required  two zipped into one casing to get decent support. buy at least two for decent support</li>
            <li> I would like to give this product a higher rating but the zipper broke almost immediately.  Other than that, the foam is not too hard but gives you the lift you&#x27;re buying it for, and the cover is fine.</li>
            <li> This is very helpful for anyone who is short, and needs to see better while driving.  The item is pretty much as described, and I thought the price was reasonable.  It is comfortable to sit on.  The only one small complaint I have is that the ends of the zipper on the cover are a little pokey, and could put a pull in your pant leg.  It is fine if you are wearing jeans, but I would be careful with delicate fabrics.  You might need to just bend in the zipper with a pair of pliers - that would probably work.  I just haven&#x27;t gotten around to it yet, which should indicate how big a problem this isn&#x27;t. I still give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Better than our old one. I like the fact that the cover zips on so that it will not come loose as you get in and out of the car. The cover on our old wedge was constantly coming off.</li>
            <li> Really see mixed reviews on this product - it does raise you up beautifully or it compresses too much and doesn&#x27;t raise you up.  What I don&#x27;t like is the shipping cost $10+ and what I&#x27;m reading about the difficulty of returning</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re very happy with this product which we got at a great price compared to some other cushions that were far more expensive. If you see the word &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; in any product, expect to spend much more. My wife uses this in the car so she can see better - our seats are not adjustable up and down as they were in the previous car we had. We&#x27;ve had this seat cushion for several months and we&#x27;re very happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> My wife is about 5 feet nothing and was unable to see to drive the Highlander. I bought this cushion and that solved the problem. Now she&#x27;s off to the races!</li>
            <li> I have used this in my 2010 Accord for the last two years. The Accord&#x27;s have terriable, terriable rock hard seats. I wouldn&#x27;t sit in them without this wedge cushion.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and doesn&#x27;t slide on my seat. I got the product very quickly and it&#x27;s been great to have</li>
            <li> I thought I had to buy another car because I couldn&#x27;t see out the window. Saved $$$$ by getting this wedge cushion! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I drive a car which is low to the ground and my night vision is not good, so oncoming truck and SUV headlights tended to blind me.  Just elevating my seat with this cushion has helped with this situation.</li>
            <li> Either i am shrinking, or the car seats are getting lower and lower. Fortunaly there are car cushions that add the height and comfort that i need when driving. This cushion is very strudy and firm, unlike other cushions I have had in the past.  It is comfortable, and when doing a lot of driving, I find that I am not fatigued. This is  the best cushion by far.</li>
            <li> I needed it in my car to add some more height in the driver&#x27;s seat and this cushion did exactly that.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants comfort and able to see over the steering wheel if you&lt;br /&gt;are short. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cushion flattened out like a pancake after being sat on. This did not do the job for me. Kept it, because the company that sold it required the buyer to pay shipping and pay a restocking fee.</li>
            <li> This was a life saver as it is a perfect fit and way safer than the folded up towels we were using! We immediately ordered another one for the other car. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> My car seats are very uncomfortable. Although I am very happy with the performance of my car, I was seriously thinking of getting rid of it because of the seat problem. I ran across this wedge cushion on Amazon and decided to give this cushion a try. This cushion worked perfect. I&#x27;m no longer looking for a car replacement.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.  It&#x27;s lightweight and comfortable, and allowed me to drive my husband&#x27;s truck comfortably.  Before, the seat cut into the bottom of my legs, cutting off my circulation.  This elevates me just enough, providing that space. It&#x27;s breathable fabric, so you don&#x27;t sweat too much,</li>
            <li> ,cheap piece of foam, cover is a dark navy blue, doesn&#x27;t remotely look like picture. Sorry I purchased product.</li>
            <li> works great for my 88 year old mom who is shrinking</li>
            <li> It does not lift you up that much.It is too soft!  If it would be made of a more rigid foam, it may do the job.</li>
            <li> Before I even opened the pkg I read it was not returnable. I should have sent it back unopened. However I had no preintention of returning the item. But...&lt;br /&gt;It is not satisfactory.  The pillow slips and slides as you try to sit on it. Also,it sticks to your clothes making a smooth entry possible. Help</li>
            <li> Described dimensions were 16x13 with wedge from 3 in. to 1 in taper.&lt;br /&gt;Actual dimension were 15 1/2 x 11 3/4 with 2 1/2 to 1/2 inch taper.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed mostly in the fact that the dimension from front to back was more than 1 inch smaller and that the height was 1/2 inch shorter than described.&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of excess fabric in the cover.  Looks like the cover was made for a much larger foam cushion.</li>
            <li> This cushion was perfect for my car.  Right size and very comfortable.  Gives me the height I need to drive safely.  Love the zippered cover so I can wash it.</li>
