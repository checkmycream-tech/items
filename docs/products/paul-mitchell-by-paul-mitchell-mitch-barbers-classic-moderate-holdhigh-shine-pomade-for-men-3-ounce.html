            <li>Excellent product....  Fast shipping...</li>

            <li>It rinses off very easily with just water.</li>
            <li>I liked the shine, but decided I needed something with more hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is super easy to use , smells wonderful, adds just the right amount of pizzazz to what could be a ho -hum haircut.  </li>
            <li>/crusty (like when you use most gels).</li>
            <li>I love the pomade I received but it was not what I ordered.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite pomade.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple of years and paying more for it until I found it in Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 3 months now and have found that it works best if applied while hair is wet.</li>
            <li>This gives great hold yet give you that natural flexible look.</li>
            <li>and it is not as strong as the Clean cut product which is more waxy.</li>
            <li>After application it washes off easily from my hands.</li>
            <li>I read a review where someone felt the scent was strong.</li>
            <li>(good thing since it&#x27;s directly under my nose!)</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best for controlling it without leaving a greasy/oily mess on my hair, hands, or clothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be a great product if it didn&#x27;t have such a strong smell.</li>
            <li>It is important to note that these are demo sizes and not the 3 oz. size.</li>
            <li>Works great, not too greasy, easy to dry restyle.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this to use in my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a clean look and feel.</li>
            <li>I bought the barbers classic and the clean cut gels to see which was better</li>
            <li>Receive quickly and at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>This stuff works exactly as I imagined.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li>Wipurchased see e again in the future for sure.</li>
            <li>After trying many different products this is the first one I found that offers a true medium hold.  </li>
            <li>and clearly it is the clean cut.</li>
            <li>The end result is similar to the Reformer product but is not applied as easily.</li>
            <li>Reformer (Red Lid) is labeled as a texturizer with strong hold and a matte finish.</li>
            <li>While labeled as a strong hold I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily so.</li>
            <li>The shipping was incredibly fast aswell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is a close match but the smell is too much for me.</li>
            <li>I have very unruly hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect and it doesn&#x27;t feel like cold grease when trying to put it in my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you want nice hold without stiff hair, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Clean Cut (Yellow Lid)</li>
            <li>It provides a nice gentle shine to hair as opposed to the dull finish or paste provides.  </li>
            <li>I spike my hair/wear it messy and don&#x27;t love it when it is very brittle</li>
            <li>it gives.barbers classic</li>
            <li>Great stuff,,,,gives hair a wet look and shine,,,,it holds hair in place,,,,but not in a stiff and brittle way,,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If not then it is just like a normal product.</li>
            <li>It is not hard at all and didn&#x27;t meet my needs for spiky/messy hair.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a new pomade since my dfi dtails was discontinued.</li>
            <li>Disclaimer: I am very sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The normal consistency of this product is soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>It can give that messy look easily while holding your style in place without feeling brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not a fan of any pomade as it always seemed heavy with my hair type, medium to light.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair much more dull and flat.</li>
            <li>It stays shiny all day and if you use it very sparingly, your hair doesn&#x27;t clump together or look wet or</li>
            <li>I am guessing that this product should last a while because you really do not need much product to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li>Only stuff that really works all day...not just for a half an hour.</li>
            <li>super short hair and a small dab goes a long ways towards defining my cut.</li>

            <li> this helps and is probably an overly long review for some stuff you put in your hair</li>
            <li> It left my hair entirely too greasy &amp; I only used a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple different kinds of pomade which are tough to spread and are very sticky.  </li>
            <li> swim and have chronic dry hair</li>
            <li> Barbers Classic Pomade (White Lid) is like thin vaseline.</li>
            <li> Not much of a hold, and way to greasy of a shine</li>
            <li> I have to pair it with a dollop of styling gel so that the hair stays the way I want, but this is to be expected.</li>
            <li> This may work for some, but certainly not me.</li>
            <li> Usually get it from my local hair place.</li>
            <li> have to apply a large amount; expensive.</li>
            <li> Just need a little with water and wet your hair with hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a sort of wet look until I run my fingers through it a few times.</li>
            <li> Needed a little jell to keep my hair sharp but not greasy.</li>
            <li> It does not dry stiff or feel the least bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> I got it foe half the price on Amazon</li>
            <li> The product that I received when I purchased it from this vendor was much less pliable and seems like it has solidified.</li>
            <li> I did think that this product would leave the hair a little stiff but</li>
            <li> When this dries, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, sticky, or stiff.  </li>
            <li> Hair does not get stiff and there is not any flaking when you brush your hair, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Give you that classic mad men look with out being too stiff.</li>
            <li> This small Pomade for men does the trick.</li>
            <li> Your hair looks slick all day if you brush it in.  </li>
            <li> It is always a tricky balancing act to get a hair putty that gives you that sheek shine without making your hair feel dirt and greasy (especially to other people who might be running their hands through it!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One this I will say is that it doesn&#x27;t have a ton of hold (at least for my hair).</li>
            <li> Either exposure to heat or extreme cold turned the pomade into a goop that was unusable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean that in a bad way it is a way to make your hair shiny and loosely hold it in place.</li>
            <li> I hate buying stuff that ultimately doesn&#x27;t meet my needs.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> Product looked like it had gone bad.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried this once after my stylist recommended it &amp; boy, what a let-down. It left my hair entirely too greasy &amp; I only used a small amount. This may work for some, but certainly not me.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1Y4MRCWXXSTRD]]I am reviewing three similar products in the included video to compare and contrast the products. I spike my hair/wear it messy and don&#x27;t love it when it is very brittle/crusty (like when you use most gels). It is important to note that these are demo sizes and not the 3 oz. size. (In the video they are .35oz. I am guessing that this product should last a while because you really do not need much product to get the desired effect. I read a review where someone felt the scent was strong. It is definitely scented and I actually like the scent of all three. I don&#x27;t feel that it is off putting in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Barbers Classic Pomade (White Lid) is like thin vaseline. I don&#x27;t mean that in a bad way it is a way to make your hair shiny and loosely hold it in place. It is not hard at all and didn&#x27;t meet my needs for spiky/messy hair. If thats your thing then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reformer (Red Lid) is labeled as a texturizer with strong hold and a matte finish. This is why I did the video review. While labeled as a strong hold I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily so. I like the product and it is not as strong as the Clean cut product which is more waxy. This product is the consistency of drying glue. It Best suited me and I really liked it. It can give that messy look easily while holding your style in place without feeling brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean Cut (Yellow Lid) Product is labeled as a medium hold / Semi-matte styling cream. I felt that it had the strongest hold. Out of the jar it has the consistency of similar wax type products. The end result is similar to the Reformer product but is not applied as easily. It still doesn&#x27;t appear shiny when on and does not have a brittle finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps and is probably an overly long review for some stuff you put in your hair but I thought it was necessary. I hate buying stuff that ultimately doesn&#x27;t meet my needs.</li>
            <li> Needed a little jell to keep my hair sharp but not greasy. This small Pomade for men does the trick. Great price and it has been lasting me for months.</li>
            <li> The pomade I received from buying this product was American Crew Low shine Medium hold. I love the pomade I received but it was not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This stuff works exactly as I imagined. The shipping was incredibly fast aswell. Got her way before predicted.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite pomade.</li>
            <li> My favorite product.  Your hair looks slick all day if you brush it in.  If not then it is just like a normal product.</li>
            <li> Receive quickly and at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Introduced to me by my barber and it keeps my hair looking well groomed! It has a clean look and feel.</li>
            <li> Product looked like it had gone bad.  Either exposure to heat or extreme cold turned the pomade into a goop that was unusable.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  Although it is in the men&#x27;s Paul Mitchell line, it is a great product for either men or women.  It provides a nice gentle shine to hair as opposed to the dull finish or paste provides.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff,,,,gives hair a wet look and shine,,,,it holds hair in place,,,,but not in a stiff and brittle way,,</li>
            <li> I like the product , I like all of paul Mitchell products.I did think that this product would leave the hair a little stiff but it does not.but I do like the shine it gives.barbers classic , I will use again.</li>
            <li> I bought the barbers classic and the clean cut gels to see which was better and clearly it is the clean cut. the barbers classic is too goopy and messy for me. save your money and dont buy this.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to use in my hair. I liked the shine, but decided I needed something with more hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it in my beard instead and I love the result. The tiniest dab of it makes my beard look shiny, well-groomed, and brings out the color.  It stays shiny all day and if you use it very sparingly, your hair doesn&#x27;t clump together or look wet or matted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about it is that there is no oily residue on my hands after application. It rinses off very easily with just water. Smells good too (good thing since it&#x27;s directly under my nose!)</li>
            <li> Works great, not too greasy, easy to dry restyle.  Downside:  have to apply a large amount; expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have super short hair and a small dab goes a long ways towards defining my cut. Seller was splendid too.</li>
            <li> Not much of a hold, and way to greasy of a shine</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I am very sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a great product if it didn&#x27;t have such a strong smell. I have been trying to find a new pomade since my dfi dtails was discontinued. This is a close match but the smell is too much for me.</li>
            <li> It is ok. Very expensive for what you get. Glad I tried it but I won&#x27;t get it again!</li>
            <li> great price for a product that I pay $20 for at the salon. I got it foe half the price on Amazon</li>
            <li> Excellent product....  Fast shipping...</li>
            <li> Only stuff that really works all day...not just for a half an hour. Just need a little with water and wet your hair with hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swim and have chronic dry hair....works great.</li>
            <li> i made the leap and cut off my locks!!  at the hair salon , this styling gel was the difference between normal and awesome in my do!!!  it is super easy to use , smells wonderful, adds just the right amount of pizzazz to what could be a ho -hum haircut.  it also adds a nice sheen to the look!</li>
            <li> If you want nice hold without stiff hair, then this is the product for you. It also provides a nice shine and smells good too.</li>
            <li> It is always a tricky balancing act to get a hair putty that gives you that sheek shine without making your hair feel dirt and greasy (especially to other people who might be running their hands through it!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff definitely meets those qualifications. I have been using it for about 3 months now and have found that it works best if applied while hair is wet. One this I will say is that it doesn&#x27;t have a ton of hold (at least for my hair). I have to pair it with a dollop of styling gel so that the hair stays the way I want, but this is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Great product. Packed well and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for over a year. Usually get it from my local hair place. The normal consistency of this product is soft and pliable. The product that I received when I purchased it from this vendor was much less pliable and seems like it has solidified. Nor does it work as well in my hair. It leaves my hair much more dull and flat. As a result, I don&#x27;t recommend buying this product from this vendor.</li>
            <li> This was introduces to me by my sister who works at a salon. I was not a fan of any pomade as it always seemed heavy with my hair type, medium to light. This gives great hold yet give you that natural flexible look. Give you that classic mad men look with out being too stiff.</li>
            <li> After trying many different products this is the first one I found that offers a true medium hold.  It does not dry stiff or feel the least bit greasy.  It also adds a very nice shine to my graying hair.</li>
            <li> I have very unruly hair. This stuff is the best for controlling it without leaving a greasy/oily mess on my hair, hands, or clothing. After application it washes off easily from my hands. It&#x27;s also one-third the cost as opposed to buying it at a salon. My highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> Product was in time and happy to have it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and needed. Highly recommend this product. Wipurchased see e again in the future for sure. Thanks</li>
            <li> My stylist started using this on my hair when he was in Paul Mitchell school and I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since.  The consistency is perfect and it doesn&#x27;t feel like cold grease when trying to put it in my hair.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple different kinds of pomade which are tough to spread and are very sticky.  When this dries, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, sticky, or stiff.  It gives my hair a sort of wet look until I run my fingers through it a few times.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years and paying more for it until I found it in Amazon.</li>
            <li> Hair does not get stiff and there is not any flaking when you brush your hair, I recommend this product.</li>
