            <li>Two for this price is a great price!</li>
            <li>this was the perfect lotion.</li>
            <li>but this smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>The Price on Amazon is great!</li>
            <li>In my opinion this lotion is the perfect balance of thickness, non greasy feel, and aroma.</li>
            <li>This is very good lotion.  </li>
            <li>Great great great product!!!  </li>
            <li>Great price for the twin pack.</li>
            <li>However, still a great product.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see this on Amazon, Its about time</li>
            <li>Great job Plamers</li>
            <li>Works great, smells like Cocoa</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great and it is at a great price.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that I believe can be used in any climate.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>I have great skin and this helped me too</li>
            <li>delicious frangance and top quality.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes well and soaks in without being greasy, pleasant fragrance that doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a chick or chocolate bar.</li>
            <li>Applies evenly, pleasant scent, and thankfully not greasy.</li>
            <li>I also have the gold bond which it my opinion works well but not as good.</li>
            <li>Finding the two pack deal on Amazon was good to satisfy the increased household demand for moisturizer.</li>
            <li>good smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is not as sweet as the orginal which makes it perfect for men.</li>
            <li>I am happy but not 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>This lotion is thicker than most, and using this in the warmer months wasn&#x27;t so pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice but way to greasy...</li>
            <li>It has a nice not overbearing coca butter smell that compliments the man instead of making it smell like an infant.</li>
            <li>This body butter comes handy to lock moisture after shower and prevent skin from drying and scaling.</li>
            <li>I used another popular brand that didn&#x27;t do the trick</li>
            <li>Gold Bond just came out with a men&#x27;s lotion that is just as good but smells much better.</li>
            <li>My Husband is not the sort of man to wear cream because most of them irritate his skin and just bug him.</li>
            <li>I use this daily and it makes for a perfect after-shave lotion.  </li>
            <li>Smells ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week, and it&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Your lady will love you for it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s have always been a favorite of mind</li>
            <li>I used to buy Suave &amp;#34;Cocoa Butter with Shea&amp;#34; lotion as it worked great on my dry hands, and smelled good.  </li>
            <li>but it would be better if it wasn&#x27;t so strong.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a strong musky scent.</li>
            <li>This was a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product description is accurate.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is that the pump doesn&#x27;t work that great.  </li>
            <li>Buy in a different bottle &amp; you&#x27;ll be happy...</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a light, airy cocoa butter smell.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>More comforting than fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>this is the first time my husband has actually commented how great a moisturizer is and to get more...</li>
            <li>It really does absorb easily and fast and seems to do a good job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out makes my skin feel smooth and the smell is great.</li>
            <li>Nothing like original Palmers cocoa butter lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have been using their original version for years.</li>
            <li>great all day long!</li>
            <li>but my skin certainly looks better hydrated than it was before.</li>
            <li>So, if you have dry skin and scent is not an issue then there is nothing better at Target nor Walmart but if better scent is what your looking for go for the bonds!</li>
            <li>Nothing I seem to try will keep my feet cool all the way through the night</li>
            <li>When i smell the cocoa butter in this, compared to the other brands i can honestly say that palmer&#x27;s smells much more natural and rich, Kind of resembles the whipped chocolate that you eat.</li>
            <li>This is great lotion, very moisturizing, but the smell is a cross between sweet, cloying cocoa butter and spicy men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li>Smells natural and suitable for both men and women.</li>
            <li>At first I found the fragrance light</li>
            <li>but really the smell is too strong.  </li>
            <li>Gold Bond (mens) smells better for daily use but the sent is strong.</li>
            <li>Great everyday lotion.</li>
            <li>My skin is always soft (ladies love that)</li>
            <li>All the &amp;#34;Mens Scent&amp;#34; lotions or sprays always have the distinct scentâ€¦.this</li>
            <li>I think I may enjoy it more than the regular Palmers scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a good quality scent that goes well with other scents.</li>
            <li>It works well but doesn&#x27;t smell any different than the girl version, the bottles more manly but that&#x27;s it</li>
            <li>Like most of the reviews here, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different lotions that have a product catered to men.</li>
            <li>Be aware of that.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t dare put it on more of my body as the smell would be totally overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this daily for weeks now and love it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face hydrated and looking healthy all day long.</li>
            <li>Too much indeed for a man on the go, thanks for this product!</li>
            <li>My husband is very particular about what he puts on his skin.</li>
            <li>It seems to be very healing as well.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s way too much fragrance in here</li>
            <li>They either had too much fragrance</li>
            <li>I really have no basis of comparison</li>
            <li>I really like how it smells</li>
            <li>but this one works very well</li>
            <li>I really like using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula for Men.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent which is key because my wife does not like the smell of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s \\&quot;soaks in\\&quot; fast without leaving an oiled look.  </li>
            <li>It has a very neutral smell without added perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got him the whole set</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this lotion to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had my usual issue with dry, itchy skin at all this winter and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but once I spray on a little cologne it smells even better.</li>
            <li>Just arrived a couple days ago, but so far I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than at my local stores seems to be the same formula as the original but smells at little better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, fellas, is that if you&#x27;re in the market for a new lotion, give this a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from the cheap store brand, to the more expensive brand-name products.</li>
            <li>My only concern is that even though it is supposedly fast absorbing, it does leave a bit of an oily feel on the skin for a while after use.</li>
            <li>I do not notice as much shine as other products I have used in the past, a good thing.</li>
            <li>I do not usually use lotion</li>
            <li>Smells great, not very oily, a little bit goes a long way and my woman loves the smell...</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion, and I use it daily.  </li>
            <li>only flaw is it goes too fast</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I would like to say that this reminds me more of a thick cream moisturizer than a lotion, because this has some weight to it.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend picked this up for me for my hot, dry feet at night.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always open to trying new things.</li>
            <li>The minute he tried it his skin was not irritated and now for the first time in a long time using cream, he  is now using it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Bought this product for my dry skin and because it was rated highly.</li>
            <li>so I cannot really share if this is oilier than other brands</li>
            <li>Not only do you get your masculine smell back, but you don&#x27;t have to use her lotion anymore!</li>
            <li>I think this could be kind of heavy during the late spring and summer months.</li>
            <li>I live in a high altitude dry climate and needed a lotion to help with extremely dry skin, so dry that I would shock myself on everything.</li>

            <li> I got two bottles for a very low price and I feel that it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>

            <li> I put the other bottle in the refrigerator because it&#x27;s going to be a long long time before I get to it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this lotion, and I use it daily.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is that the pump doesn&#x27;t work that great.  Other than that, I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> Just arrived a couple days ago, but so far I really like this product. I am a guy so not really into smelling like a piece of fruit or a flower. It seems to be very healing as well.</li>
            <li> I use this daily. Especially during the winter. I haven&#x27;t had my usual issue with dry, itchy skin at all this winter and it smells great. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but way to greasy...</li>
            <li> Nothing like original Palmers cocoa butter lotion.  There&#x27;s way too much fragrance in here and it stinks mightily.  It also stings if you put it on chapped hands.  Its awful and I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> My Husband is not the sort of man to wear cream because most of them irritate his skin and just bug him. But since I is the regular plamers coco butter cream that I&#x27;m obsessed with, I encouraged him to give this one a try. The minute he tried it his skin was not irritated and now for the first time in a long time using cream, he  is now using it on a daily basis. We will definitely be buying this again thank you!</li>
            <li> This lotion is not flakey and spreads evenly wherever you put it on your body. It has a nice not overbearing coca butter smell that compliments the man instead of making it smell like an infant. Great price for the twin pack. I might consider putting it on Amazon&#x27;s automatic delivery program.</li>
            <li> My husband is very particular about what he puts on his skin. He loves this lotion. It&#x27;s manly but still provides the essential moisture needed for his skin.</li>
            <li> It does what it intends to do. However, for ultra dry skin, it does lack something. I am happy but not 100% satisfied. However, still a great product.</li>
            <li> Smells like Coco!&lt;br /&gt;Does it moisturize? Yes!</li>
            <li> I was happy to see this on Amazon, Its about time Palmaer&#x27;s put out a Cocoa Butter Lotion for men. I have been using their original version for years. This is a must buy. Two for this price is a great price! You can&#x27;t beat it at all. The smell is not as sweet as the orginal which makes it perfect for men. My skin is always soft (ladies love that) and after I shave, I use this cause of the dryness shaven cream gives you. Doesn&#x27;t burn at all, no stinging. Great great great product!!!  love it! I will keep myself stocked of this at all times! Great job Plamers</li>
            <li> Works great, smells like Cocoa</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well and soaks in without being greasy, pleasant fragrance that doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a chick or chocolate bar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a lotion that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out for awhile this was the perfect lotion. doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out makes my skin feel smooth and the smell is great. only flaw is it goes too fast i wish they would make a 1 liter or maybe a 6 pack but since using this theres no need for me to switch to another lotion.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion, HATE the pump! Buy in a different bottle &amp; you&#x27;ll be happy... Bought multiple bottles and EVERY pump clogged before the bottle was half empty?</li>
            <li> This lotion is thicker than most, and using this in the warmer months wasn&#x27;t so pleasant.  Also wasn&#x27;t a fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> All the &amp;#34;Mens Scent&amp;#34; lotions or sprays always have the distinct scentâ€¦.this smell ended up growing on me.  I think I may enjoy it more than the regular Palmers scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest buying it, if you donâ€™t like it, then donâ€™t buy it again.  Simple as that</li>
            <li> great all day long! delicious frangance and top quality.</li>
            <li> this is the first time my husband has actually commented how great a moisturizer is and to get more...he loves it, he has extremely dry legs and  arms...this works</li>
            <li> It works well but doesn&#x27;t smell any different than the girl version, the bottles more manly but that&#x27;s it, it&#x27;s just cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it makes for a perfect after-shave lotion.  Smells ok but once I spray on a little cologne it smells even better.</li>
            <li> Like most of the reviews here, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different lotions that have a product catered to men. They either had too much fragrance (I don&#x27;t wanna smell like a woman), or only last a few hours, so you might&#x27;ve needed another application. I&#x27;ve tried everything from the cheap store brand, to the more expensive brand-name products. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week, and it&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. EVER! The fragrance is a light, airy cocoa butter smell. The texture is somewhere between thick and thin, and does indeed absorb quickly. When I have to wash my hands at work, I&#x27;m usually lookin&#x27; at some ashy hands after I dry them (I&#x27;m black, so it always looks like they&#x27;ve just been powdered). Not with this lotion. My hands stay moisturized throughout the entire day. I also wear a different cologne, everyday, and I don&#x27;t worry about this lotion overpowering whatever smell that is. This was a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, fellas, is that if you&#x27;re in the market for a new lotion, give this a try. Your lady will love you for it. Not only do you get your masculine smell back, but you don&#x27;t have to use her lotion anymore! How is this NOT a win?! :)</li>
            <li> This body butter comes handy to lock moisture after shower and prevent skin from drying and scaling. Smells natural and suitable for both men and women. The pump has small lock to prevent accidental dispensing - simply turn the pump head clockwise/anticlockwise.</li>
            <li> I do not usually use lotion but this smells wonderful! I really have no basis of comparison so I cannot really share if this is oilier than other brands but my skin certainly looks better hydrated than it was before.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. I would like to say that this reminds me more of a thick cream moisturizer than a lotion, because this has some weight to it. When i smell the cocoa butter in this, compared to the other brands i can honestly say that palmer&#x27;s smells much more natural and rich, Kind of resembles the whipped chocolate that you eat. I think this could be kind of heavy during the late spring and summer months. The Price on Amazon is great! More comforting than fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft. Great product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend picked this up for me for my hot, dry feet at night. Nothing I seem to try will keep my feet cool all the way through the night so I&#x27;m always open to trying new things. At first I found the fragrance light but it soon turned overpowering to the point of repulsion. It took a few moments longer for my girlfriend to notice. She insisted that I take a shower to get the stench off. Bottom line....this lotion raped my nostrils. Not recommended!</li>
            <li> This lotion has a strong musky scent. It is a good quality scent that goes well with other scents. I prefer it as I don&#x27;t like flowery scented lotion but it would be better if it wasn&#x27;t so strong.</li>
            <li> Smells great, not very oily, a little bit goes a long way and my woman loves the smell...</li>
            <li> Great everyday lotion. Cocoa soothes the skin in the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> This stuff works for dry skin! I also have the gold bond which it my opinion works well but not as good. Gold Bond (mens) smells better for daily use but the sent is strong. Palmers smells like chocolate but works! So, if you have dry skin and scent is not an issue then there is nothing better at Target nor Walmart but if better scent is what your looking for go for the bonds!</li>
            <li> Once you put this on, there is no doubt about what you are wearing. Be aware of that. The smell will linger for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is also quite thick. If you need a thick lotion, its worth considering. I prefer something lighter.</li>
            <li> It really does absorb easily and fast and seems to do a good job of moisturizing.  I really like how it smells but really the smell is too strong.  I use a tiny bit on my face in the morning and that works but I wouldn&#x27;t dare put it on more of my body as the smell would be totally overpowering.  Still I like it. I put the other bottle in the refrigerator because it&#x27;s going to be a long long time before I get to it.</li>
            <li> I live in a high altitude dry climate and needed a lotion to help with extremely dry skin, so dry that I would shock myself on everything. I used another popular brand that didn&#x27;t do the trick but this one works very well, it actually absorbs into my skin unlike the other brand and the alcohol content is very low.</li>
            <li> This is great lotion, very moisturizing, but the smell is a cross between sweet, cloying cocoa butter and spicy men&#x27;s cologne.  Weird.  Gold Bond just came out with a men&#x27;s lotion that is just as good but smells much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for weeks now and love it. My only concern is that even though it is supposedly fast absorbing, it does leave a bit of an oily feel on the skin for a while after use.</li>
            <li> I really like using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula for Men. It was recommended to me by a family member. I have tried all types of lotions. In my opinion this lotion is the perfect balance of thickness, non greasy feel, and aroma. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than at my local stores seems to be the same formula as the original but smells at little better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter. It makes my skin feel very soft and clean. I got two bottles for a very low price and I feel that it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my dry skin and because it was rated highly. The smell isn&#x27;t what I expected from Cocoa butter but it is not the smell that matters. This stuff works great and it is at a great price. A WINNER in my book.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I was more expensive lotions for my face and then another for my body. I was using Kiehls products but it was very expensive. Once I tried this there is no turning back. This is my product from here out. It has a light scent which is key because my wife does not like the smell of cocoa butter. It keeps my face hydrated and looking healthy all day long. I do not notice as much shine as other products I have used in the past, a good thing. I use this product for face, feet, arms, elbows, neck, etc. I use a separate eye cream from Kiehls. This has saved me a lot of money in products from body lotion, aftershave moisturizer, facial lotion, and foot cream. Too much indeed for a man on the go, thanks for this product!</li>
            <li> I like this and I feel this moisturizes well with one application. After searching online for a local store I found this on target for way cheaper Palmer&#x27;sÂ® Cocoa Butter FormulaÂ® Body and Face Moisturizing Lotion for Men - 13.5 oz http://www.target.com/p/palmer-s-cocoa-butter-formula-body-and-face-moisturizing-lotion-for-men-13-5-oz/-/A-13728322#prodSlot&#x3D;medium_1_1&amp;term&#x3D;palmers+cocoa+butter+for+men</li>
            <li> Product description is accurate.  Works as advertised without fufu smell of women&#x27;s moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dermatologist told me to stop using under arm anti-perspirants and use a moisturizer instead.  I picked up a few versions at the local pharmacy to try.  Palmer&#x27;s \\&quot;soaks in\\&quot; fast without leaving an oiled look.  It has a very neutral smell without added perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my wife also likes it.  Finding the two pack deal on Amazon was good to satisfy the increased household demand for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion.  I couldn&#x27;t find this in stores, but my skin gets really dry since I work outside.  I won&#x27;t buy anything else besides this!</li>
            <li> last all day.  good smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I believe can be used in any climate. Applies evenly, pleasant scent, and thankfully not greasy. I tend to have dry skin in all seasons and this product can be used year round. I strongly recommend this lotion to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great I use it every day</li>
            <li> I used to buy Suave &amp;#34;Cocoa Butter with Shea&amp;#34; lotion as it worked great on my dry hands, and smelled good.  Unfortunately, I can only now find the new Suave &amp;#34;Smoothing with cocoa butter &amp; shea&amp;#34;, which unfortunately smells like a perfume bottle...not something I want to wear as a guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the risk after reading some other reviews and bought Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter online.  I am glad I did.  This is very good lotion.  I have found my Suave cocoa butter lotion replacement!</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s have always been a favorite of mind I have great skin and this helped me too keep it that way.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it I got him the whole set</li>
