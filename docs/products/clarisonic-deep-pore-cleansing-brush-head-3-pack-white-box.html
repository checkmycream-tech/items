            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>I replace my brush head every three months and Amazon is the best place to find the replacement heads at a fair price! :-)</li>
            <li>I purchased from Optimum Outlet.</li>
            <li>the book is a good read.</li>
            <li>Fit the unit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time in good condition.</li>
            <li>This time it was Optimum Outlet.</li>
            <li>It came in the original Clarisonic packaging and the brush head fits onto the unit perfectly.</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the quality.  </li>
            <li>mia!&lt;br /&gt;very happy with my choice.&lt;br /&gt;no complaints, and comparable price.&lt;br /&gt;:) :)</li>
            <li>IN ORDER TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION YOU NEED A CLEAN FACE</li>
            <li>Good customer service as well, as they verified the product was authentic and made effort to ensure satisfaction.</li>
            <li>This along with my face wash and the clarisonic have effectively prevented and cleared my breakouts.</li>
            <li>This is in my own case, of course.</li>
            <li>These brushes brought out everything - I had pimples all over my face because they are so effective.</li>
            <li>I just love a clean face!!  </li>
            <li>I love my Clarasonic and was looking forward to a lower cost alternative for the replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>and I use mine a lot more than what Clarisonic recommends.</li>
            <li>but this works a lot better</li>
            <li>Only2 of the 3 brush heads came in authentic box.  </li>
            <li>I love my Clarisonic now that I can use again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am impressed.</li>
            <li>This item is the authentic Clarisonic brush head.</li>
            <li>Love them, and love the price...  </li>
            <li>BTW,you can buy 4 authentic brush heads@</li>
            <li>They do seem to splash water more than I am used to, but for the price, I can deal with it.</li>
            <li>I was going to buy this product from Sephora, but at this price works out better per unit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great exfoliator and really prepares your skin for the moisturizers/skin products you use after cleansing.</li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments on my skin since using this brush head.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how many people were upset about the lack of plastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve examined them side by side and they are authentic.</li>
            <li>The deep pore cleansing brush has much more dense bristles so cleansers lather wonderfully.</li>
            <li>so....why pay more.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with these brushes.</li>
            <li>The longer I used them, the more pimples popped up.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but I had to stop using them because my skin couldn&#x27;t handle any more purging.</li>
            <li>The price is right and they fit my Mia  sonic care great.</li>
            <li>I also notice vibration and more sound from this brush from the vibration.</li>
            <li>They are my favorite out of all the brushes and sifter then the original brush which did irritate my face.</li>
            <li>So it is fairly easy for me to tell if the brush has come into contact with water.</li>
            <li>I ordered these because I&#x27;d read they got a deeper clean and were better at getting into corners around the nose.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are awesome for my large pores and the three-pack makes me more likely to change them in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick , each brush was in a box, they were all New, fit the machine &amp; worked great.</li>
            <li>I found these replacement heads and debated for a while about whether or not to risk buying them and have them turn out to not even be a genuine Clarisinic product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic deal and</li>
            <li>These were genuine Clarisonic cleansing brush heads at a discounted price.</li>
            <li>Great price for 3 replacement heads and they arrived only 3 days after ordering them!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and fit my clarisonic</li>
            <li>So far so good, but</li>
            <li>I hope this information can help you feel more comfortable with your purchase because it is worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a really good way to keep your skin clear.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original, unopened, sealed, retail packaging(even</li>
            <li>if it doesn&#x27;t come in it&#x27;s original package.</li>
            <li>They work well, and come in original boxes.</li>
            <li>These do not come in the original boxes as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>Came in the original boxes</li>
            <li>These brusheads really clean.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face feel so clean,</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and purchased here due to the good pricing.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, can really feel the difference with my skin when I use my Clarisonic cleaner.</li>
            <li>Is it true some are knock offs?</li>
            <li>Will absolutely be a return customer :)</li>
            <li>When I received these the first day I used them they seemed fine but within two days the brush was already degrading as though I have been using it for the three months that it recommends between changing brush heads.  </li>
            <li>They shipped my order quickly and I received my products within 5 days.</li>
            <li>Works super well.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good deal in contrast to paying full price at roughly $25-$30 in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I compared everything that you could imagine and they are absolutely 100% genuine.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>You may be better off ordering from Amazon (not a seller) or the Clarisonic site directly.</li>
            <li>I received them right away, too.</li>
            <li>If they could pass my rigorous inspection and satisfy my very high standards for a being genuine product, then I am confident they will do the same for you.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this particular head before but it fits the Mia2 and they look just like the original ones.  </li>
            <li>With my other brush head, after washing my face, my skin feels very soft and feels great without any drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I was very concerned and put them through a rigorous inspection and compared them to the other brush heads that I already had, that I knew for sure were authentic.</li>
            <li>All brand new and original.</li>
            <li>I have purchased from the manufacturer before and these are the real deal!</li>
            <li>First let me start off by saying that I am a person that would rather pay the premium price that department stores charge, rather than risk buying an unauthentic product online.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I love my Clarisonic Mia brush and these deep pore cleansing brush heads are no exception.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find a seller who could offer such a deal.</li>
            <li>I love the deep pore cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough it was softer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that they are the actual clarisonic cleansing head</li>
            <li>I have had a Clarisonic Pro cleansing device since it was first introduced.  </li>
            <li>but truthfully I credit my skin to the deep sonic cleansing of the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>and I have to say, I LOVE THE DEEP PORE brushes!</li>
            <li>The deep pore cleansing brush heads are my favorite of the brush heads made for Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I really like these!  </li>
            <li>That should have been my first clue but since the first review said they are authentic, I tried my luck again but with a different seller.</li>
            <li>Now, on the brushes themselves I love the deep pore cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>Gentle yet powerful.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how much money I saved!</li>
            <li>Most places you can only purchase 2 in a pack, so</li>
            <li>I use my pretty often, and this head has lasted awhile.</li>
            <li>Was ready for a replacement so used one right away...</li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering brush heads online too, as I usually purchase them in the stores, but this was a good deal</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly (faster than other items in my order with free shipping direct from Amazon) and were packaged in original Clarisonic boxes.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>After much thought I decided to take the chance and buy the three pack for about $40, which is much cheaper</li>
            <li>Do not believe the hype, you get what you pay for and these are not the real deal.</li>
            <li>Would Amazon really do this?</li>
            <li>and it really hurt my skin.</li>
            <li>It worked the whole time.</li>
            <li>like I really have gotten any and all make-up and dirt off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the real thing.  </li>
            <li>and my face is much happier.</li>
            <li>In the description it is kind of vague about whether they are claiming to be selling an authentic Clarisonic product.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed one bit, although I am only 1 brush into my pack of 3.</li>
            <li>I pretty much have clear skin now.</li>
            <li>They fit my Mia &amp; function but the bristles are too long.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference between these &amp;#34;deep pore&amp;#34; brushes vs. the brushes for normal skin.  </li>
            <li>love these deep pore cleansing brush heads as they get the job done, but are still gentle enough on the face.</li>
            <li>My whole family raves about the Clarisonic and the acne brush was much appreciated by my early 20&#x27;s children.</li>
            <li>If you have a Clarisonic I highly recommend these brush heads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still soft, but for me held its shape better then the other brushes.</li>
            <li>It does not mean they&#x27;ve been opened.</li>
            <li>When compared to the real thing you can clearly see that there are also way fewer bristles made into the brush.  </li>
            <li>I had used my normal brush head for about two weeks after purchasing my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>and I do not think I will be able to suffer through the soap flying from one brush, much less 3!  </li>
            <li>I was certainly weary because some reviews stated they were not authentic products, however, when I received them in the mail, they looked genuine and work as if they are the real thing-</li>
            <li>Very clean and no bristles missing or bent.</li>
            <li>My skin felt a lot smoother and cleaner after I started using these new brush heads.</li>
            <li>I bought from the store and they are identical and brand new.</li>
            <li>Save your money and just buy the real ones, these are a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed less break outs using this brush vs the acne one which looses it&#x27;s shape very quickly.</li>
            <li>However, I only use my clarisonic every other day because if I use it every day I find that my skin starts to peel a lot so not using it so much is better for me.</li>
            <li>They are the exact same thing you buy at the store except way cheaper price!</li>
            <li>Not hard but clean better than the normal, delicate or other brushes.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, at first I was disappointed, as I like things to be in their original packaging when I make a purchase.</li>
            <li>I purchased from SkinCare USA and the brush heads were delivered quickly with minimal packaging and with the plastic caps (with &amp;#34;Clarisonic&amp;#34; on them.)  </li>
            <li>All three replacement heads came with the clear cap that says \\&quot;Clarisonic\\&quot;, that protects the bristles.</li>
            <li>matter(they just came with the clear caps on and in a bubble wrap bag).</li>
            <li>They really get the grit and grime off my face after a day of wearing makeup and running around outside in a busy city.</li>
            <li>The photos i posted clearly showed that these products are fake/counterfeit.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft since using them.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my skin is as sensitive to the brushes as ornery people.</li>
            <li>Overall I thought the brushes were much rougher than the normal heads and my forehead got very sensitive and covered in red bumps.</li>
            <li>the brush part back onto the head they have been working fine for the few weeks</li>
            <li>The way the brushes look when they are brand new and unused is very different than when they have had water touch the bristles.</li>
            <li>These were brand new, unused, individually packaged.</li>
            <li>Tried it for about a week and finally went and bought a real one at the department store to compare-TOTALLY different.</li>
            <li>I was afraid they would be too harsh, but they are perfect.</li>
            <li>The third brush head was sealed in clear wrapping.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just that I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the deep pore cleansing brushes vs. the sensitive skin brushes.</li>
            <li>I am just weird about that kind of thing.</li>
            <li>These heads arrived very quickly and were in small plastic bags inside a larger white box.  </li>
            <li>The 3 brush heads I ordered came quickly and seem to be the same as ordered through other sites that were more expensive.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than other shopping networks/stores.</li>
            <li>It feels a lot different than the sensitive brush head, like I&#x27;ve been given a facial.  </li>
            <li>The boxes had the wrong photo/description meaning the sellers are producing their own boxes and essentially the brush heads.</li>

            <li> So it is fairly easy for me to tell if the brush has come into contact with water.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I&#x27;d read they got a deeper clean and were better at getting into corners around the nose.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are awesome for my large pores and the three-pack makes me more likely to change them in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick , each brush was in a box, they were all New, fit the machine &amp; worked great.</li>
            <li> I found these replacement heads and debated for a while about whether or not to risk buying them and have them turn out to not even be a genuine Clarisinic product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic deal and</li>
            <li> These were genuine Clarisonic cleansing brush heads at a discounted price.</li>
            <li> Great price for 3 replacement heads and they arrived only 3 days after ordering them!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and fit my clarisonic</li>
            <li> So far so good, but</li>
            <li> I hope this information can help you feel more comfortable with your purchase because it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a really good way to keep your skin clear.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s original, unopened, sealed, retail packaging(even</li>
            <li> if it doesn&#x27;t come in it&#x27;s original package.</li>
            <li> They work well, and come in original boxes.</li>
            <li> These do not come in the original boxes as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Came in the original boxes</li>
            <li> These brusheads really clean.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so clean,</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and purchased here due to the good pricing.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, can really feel the difference with my skin when I use my Clarisonic cleaner.</li>
            <li> Is it true some are knock offs?</li>
            <li> Will absolutely be a return customer :)</li>
            <li> When I received these the first day I used them they seemed fine but within two days the brush was already degrading as though I have been using it for the three months that it recommends between changing brush heads.  </li>
            <li> They shipped my order quickly and I received my products within 5 days.</li>
            <li> Works super well.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good deal in contrast to paying full price at roughly $25-$30 in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I compared everything that you could imagine and they are absolutely 100% genuine.</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> You may be better off ordering from Amazon (not a seller) or the Clarisonic site directly.</li>
            <li> I received them right away, too.</li>
            <li> If they could pass my rigorous inspection and satisfy my very high standards for a being genuine product, then I am confident they will do the same for you.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this particular head before but it fits the Mia2 and they look just like the original ones.  </li>
            <li> With my other brush head, after washing my face, my skin feels very soft and feels great without any drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I was very concerned and put them through a rigorous inspection and compared them to the other brush heads that I already had, that I knew for sure were authentic.</li>
            <li> All brand new and original.</li>
            <li> I have purchased from the manufacturer before and these are the real deal!</li>
            <li> First let me start off by saying that I am a person that would rather pay the premium price that department stores charge, rather than risk buying an unauthentic product online.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic Mia brush and these deep pore cleansing brush heads are no exception.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find a seller who could offer such a deal.</li>
            <li> I love the deep pore cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough it was softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that they are the actual clarisonic cleansing head</li>
            <li> I have had a Clarisonic Pro cleansing device since it was first introduced.  </li>
            <li> but truthfully I credit my skin to the deep sonic cleansing of the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> and I have to say, I LOVE THE DEEP PORE brushes!</li>
            <li> The deep pore cleansing brush heads are my favorite of the brush heads made for Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I really like these!  </li>
            <li> That should have been my first clue but since the first review said they are authentic, I tried my luck again but with a different seller.</li>
            <li> Now, on the brushes themselves I love the deep pore cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> Gentle yet powerful.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how much money I saved!</li>
            <li> Most places you can only purchase 2 in a pack, so</li>
            <li> I use my pretty often, and this head has lasted awhile.</li>
            <li> Was ready for a replacement so used one right away...</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering brush heads online too, as I usually purchase them in the stores, but this was a good deal</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly (faster than other items in my order with free shipping direct from Amazon) and were packaged in original Clarisonic boxes.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> After much thought I decided to take the chance and buy the three pack for about $40, which is much cheaper</li>
            <li> Do not believe the hype, you get what you pay for and these are not the real deal.</li>
            <li> Would Amazon really do this?</li>
            <li> and it really hurt my skin.</li>
            <li> It worked the whole time.</li>
            <li> like I really have gotten any and all make-up and dirt off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the real thing.  </li>
            <li> and my face is much happier.</li>
            <li> In the description it is kind of vague about whether they are claiming to be selling an authentic Clarisonic product.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed one bit, although I am only 1 brush into my pack of 3.</li>
            <li> I pretty much have clear skin now.</li>
            <li> They fit my Mia &amp; function but the bristles are too long.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference between these &amp;#34;deep pore&amp;#34; brushes vs. the brushes for normal skin.  </li>
            <li> love these deep pore cleansing brush heads as they get the job done, but are still gentle enough on the face.</li>
            <li> My whole family raves about the Clarisonic and the acne brush was much appreciated by my early 20&#x27;s children.</li>
            <li> If you have a Clarisonic I highly recommend these brush heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still soft, but for me held its shape better then the other brushes.</li>
            <li> It does not mean they&#x27;ve been opened.</li>
            <li> When compared to the real thing you can clearly see that there are also way fewer bristles made into the brush.  </li>
            <li> I had used my normal brush head for about two weeks after purchasing my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> and I do not think I will be able to suffer through the soap flying from one brush, much less 3!  </li>
            <li> I was certainly weary because some reviews stated they were not authentic products, however, when I received them in the mail, they looked genuine and work as if they are the real thing-</li>
            <li> Very clean and no bristles missing or bent.</li>
            <li> My skin felt a lot smoother and cleaner after I started using these new brush heads.</li>
            <li> I bought from the store and they are identical and brand new.</li>
            <li> Save your money and just buy the real ones, these are a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed less break outs using this brush vs the acne one which looses it&#x27;s shape very quickly.</li>
            <li> However, I only use my clarisonic every other day because if I use it every day I find that my skin starts to peel a lot so not using it so much is better for me.</li>
            <li> They are the exact same thing you buy at the store except way cheaper price!</li>
            <li> Not hard but clean better than the normal, delicate or other brushes.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, at first I was disappointed, as I like things to be in their original packaging when I make a purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased from SkinCare USA and the brush heads were delivered quickly with minimal packaging and with the plastic caps (with &amp;#34;Clarisonic&amp;#34; on them.)  </li>
            <li> All three replacement heads came with the clear cap that says \\&quot;Clarisonic\\&quot;, that protects the bristles.</li>
            <li> matter(they just came with the clear caps on and in a bubble wrap bag).</li>
            <li> They really get the grit and grime off my face after a day of wearing makeup and running around outside in a busy city.</li>
            <li> The photos i posted clearly showed that these products are fake/counterfeit.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft since using them.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin is as sensitive to the brushes as ornery people.</li>
            <li> Overall I thought the brushes were much rougher than the normal heads and my forehead got very sensitive and covered in red bumps.</li>
            <li> the brush part back onto the head they have been working fine for the few weeks</li>
            <li> The way the brushes look when they are brand new and unused is very different than when they have had water touch the bristles.</li>
            <li> These were brand new, unused, individually packaged.</li>
            <li> Tried it for about a week and finally went and bought a real one at the department store to compare-TOTALLY different.</li>
            <li> I was afraid they would be too harsh, but they are perfect.</li>
            <li> The third brush head was sealed in clear wrapping.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just that I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the deep pore cleansing brushes vs. the sensitive skin brushes.</li>
            <li> I am just weird about that kind of thing.</li>
            <li> These heads arrived very quickly and were in small plastic bags inside a larger white box.  </li>
            <li> The 3 brush heads I ordered came quickly and seem to be the same as ordered through other sites that were more expensive.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than other shopping networks/stores.</li>
            <li> It feels a lot different than the sensitive brush head, like I&#x27;ve been given a facial.  </li>
            <li> The boxes had the wrong photo/description meaning the sellers are producing their own boxes and essentially the brush heads.</li>
            <li> Long lasting bristles.</li>
            <li> Just be aware, when they &amp;#34;Deep Pore&amp;#34; they really mean it.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;d be skeptical about purchasing &#x27;clarisonic&#x27; replacement brushes from sellers other than Clarisonic or a reputable store such as Sephora.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry if you really thought they are real</li>
            <li> I expected the brush heads to be packaged in individual boxes, as shown in the picture, but all 3 brush heads were in the same plastic bubble package.</li>
            <li> I usually use the normal heads, but chose to order the deep pore cleansing brushes this time.</li>
            <li> Other reviews described them to be the same and although they do LOOK identical, they are NOT functionally the same.</li>
            <li> , they are cheap but just know that they are fake.</li>
            <li> Stop confusing consumers by writing that they are real.</li>
            <li> I find myself having to keep my eyes closed the entire time while using because there are suds flying everywhere - not the case with the brushes I buy at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I noticed the box felt different from the other box</li>
            <li> Usually I get the sensitive brush heads in the two pack for about $40</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin this might be too harsh for you, if not I&#x27;d say go for it!</li>
            <li> and my skin is very dry and burns when I put on moisturizing cream (cetaphil, which shouldn&#x27;t cause any burning).</li>
            <li> If you are like me you can understand what I mean, it just doesn&#x27;t feel the same(even if it is brand new and untouched)</li>
            <li> The ones I ordered were to rough for my skin.</li>
            <li> If you look on the Clarisonic site you will see that the acne brushes are green and not blue.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering my second round of these in the next few months and I look forward to it!</li>
            <li> I have never received used brushes like some if the other reviews.</li>
            <li> &quot; so these other sellers might be legit.</li>
            <li> brush heads are not real!</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Some other people may see some difference....</li>
            <li> These are very rough.</li>
            <li> feels like it&#x27;s been peeled and is very dry and hard if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I received the all three of them and was very skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of paying $25 for one brush, then you should definitely consider buying the three pack and saving money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> While she won&#x27;t go as far as to say this product is fake, I will.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;During washing, it is very harsh on my skin and after washing my skin</li>
            <li> so I have tried a couple different places to buy them and Amazon is the least expensive I have found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using the delicate head</li>
            <li> I am deeply disappointed and will go back to buying these at a business that will not sell me a product that I feel has been used or has something very wrong with their product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with that.</li>
            <li> Their boxes are the wrong description/photo.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided to risk it, these are  not Clarisonic brand brush heads!</li>
            <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So far so good, but I&#x27;m wondering if these brushes were meant to work with my clairisonic Mia. They don&#x27;t seem to rotate properly.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarasonic and was looking forward to a lower cost alternative for the replacement brushes. Other reviews described them to be the same and although they do LOOK identical, they are NOT functionally the same. I find myself having to keep my eyes closed the entire time while using because there are suds flying everywhere - not the case with the brushes I buy at Macy&#x27;s. I also notice vibration and more sound from this brush from the vibration. I bought the 3 pack and I do not think I will be able to suffer through the soap flying from one brush, much less 3!  I&#x27;ve tried several different things to see if it will minimize this issue to no avail. As the saying goes - you get what you pay for!  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product for a reasonable price.  It is a great opportunity to stock- up on replacement brushes for all year</li>
            <li> Was ready for a replacement so used one right away... felt great on my skin.  I have purchased from the manufacturer before and these are the real deal!</li>
            <li> I bought these replacement brush heads for my  Clarisonic and they came in a pack of 3. They came individually wrapped and neatly packaged. Very clean and no bristles missing or bent. I received them right away, too. I will definitely buy from them again! Very happy!!!!</li>
            <li> First let me start off by saying that I am a person that would rather pay the premium price that department stores charge, rather than risk buying an unauthentic product online. I found these replacement heads and debated for a while about whether or not to risk buying them and have them turn out to not even be a genuine Clarisinic product. After much thought I decided to take the chance and buy the three pack for about $40, which is much cheaper considering I would have to otherwise buy them from Dillards for $25, just for one. In the description it is kind of vague about whether they are claiming to be selling an authentic Clarisonic product. Also the term \\&quot;White Box\\&quot; in the title did not help me feel at ease with my purchase. I received the all three of them and was very skeptical at first. All three replacement heads came with the clear cap that says \\&quot;Clarisonic\\&quot;, that protects the bristles. However, non of them were in the sealed retail packaging, or any box for that matter(they just came with the clear caps on and in a bubble wrap bag). At first I was very concerned and put them through a rigorous inspection and compared them to the other brush heads that I already had, that I knew for sure were authentic. I compared everything that you could imagine and they are absolutely 100% genuine. The way the brushes look when they are brand new and unused is very different than when they have had water touch the bristles. So it is fairly easy for me to tell if the brush has come into contact with water. I am one of those people that has to have the product come in it&#x27;s original, unopened, sealed, retail packaging(even though I just throw the package in the trash). If you are like me you can understand what I mean, it just doesn&#x27;t feel the same(even if it is brand new and untouched) if it doesn&#x27;t come in it&#x27;s original package. I am just weird about that kind of thing. I will definitely continue to purchase my replacement brush heads from here and I am very satisfied with my purchase. They shipped my order quickly and I received my products within 5 days. If you are tired of paying $25 for one brush, then you should definitely consider buying the three pack and saving money. Three brushes will last a while and I use mine a lot more than what Clarisonic recommends. If they could pass my rigorous inspection and satisfy my very high standards for a being genuine product, then I am confident they will do the same for you. I hope this information can help you feel more comfortable with your purchase because it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Do not believe the hype, you get what you pay for and these are not the real deal. Save your money and just buy the real ones, these are a huge waste of money. The ones I bought were from Beauty choice. They even have the plastic cap on them that says Clarisonic but that is where the similarities end.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described. It came in the original Clarisonic packaging and the brush head fits onto the unit perfectly. Fantastic deal and well worth the price. I purchased from Optimum Outlet.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic Mia brush and these deep pore cleansing brush heads are no exception. They really get the grit and grime off my face after a day of wearing makeup and running around outside in a busy city.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time - just as described. I love this product, can really feel the difference with my skin when I use my Clarisonic cleaner. This is a really good way to keep your skin clear.</li>
            <li> I got these because I needed to change my brush head after six months since some bristles were starting to come out and these were a great deal. Usually I get the sensitive brush heads in the two pack for about $40 but this works a lot better i think and you get three heads for the price of two! My skin felt a lot smoother and cleaner after I started using these new brush heads. However, I only use my clarisonic every other day because if I use it every day I find that my skin starts to peel a lot so not using it so much is better for me. Great product!</li>
            <li> IN ORDER TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION YOU NEED A CLEAN FACE AND THIS PRODUCT DOES ITS JOB, BUY IT</li>
            <li> the book is a good read. I didnt care for how short the chapters were or how the book ended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this replacement brush head for about 2wks now and my skin is very dry and burns when I put on moisturizing cream (cetaphil, which shouldn&#x27;t cause any burning). With my other brush head, after washing my face, my skin feels very soft and feels great without any drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During washing, it is very harsh on my skin and after washing my skin feels like it&#x27;s been peeled and is very dry and hard if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> These were genuine Clarisonic cleansing brush heads at a discounted price. I was pleased to find a seller who could offer such a deal. I will be ordering my second round of these in the next few months and I look forward to it!</li>
            <li> Only2 of the 3 brush heads came in authentic box.  The third brush head was sealed in clear wrapping.  Makes me feel that I was ripped off.  I should have known by the pricing.  I will never buy another item from amazon through a third party.</li>
            <li> I love the deep pore cleansing brush.  It feels a lot different than the sensitive brush head, like I&#x27;ve been given a facial.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> These are very rough. I was told then read that some of these are knock offs. I went to the store and bought one. Sure enough it was softer. The ones I ordered were to rough for my skin. I love my Clarisonic now that I can use again. Is it true some are knock offs? Would Amazon really do this?</li>
            <li> I expected the brush heads to be packaged in individual boxes, as shown in the picture, but all 3 brush heads were in the same plastic bubble package. To be honest, at first I was disappointed, as I like things to be in their original packaging when I make a purchase. But after trying one, I am happy with the quality and purchase. And definitely can&#x27;t beat the price. Good customer service as well, as they verified the product was authentic and made effort to ensure satisfaction.</li>
            <li> These brusheads really clean.  My skin is so soft since using them.  I was afraid they would be too harsh, but they are perfect.</li>
            <li> These heads arrived very quickly and were in small plastic bags inside a larger white box.  I haven&#x27;t used this particular head before but it fits the Mia2 and they look just like the original ones.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that they are the actual clarisonic cleansing head and I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have had a Clarisonic Pro cleansing device since it was first introduced.  I use it twice a week and am often told I have &amp;#34;beautiful skin.&amp;#34;  Yes, I avoid the sun but truthfully I credit my skin to the deep sonic cleansing of the Clarisonic. I replace my brush head every three months and Amazon is the best place to find the replacement heads at a fair price! :-)</li>
            <li> I usually use the normal heads, but chose to order the deep pore cleansing brushes this time. This was my first time ordering brush heads online too, as I usually purchase them in the stores, but this was a good deal so I thought, why not. I was certainly weary because some reviews stated they were not authentic products, however, when I received them in the mail, they looked genuine and work as if they are the real thing- and I have to say, I LOVE THE DEEP PORE brushes! I am not disappointed one bit, although I am only 1 brush into my pack of 3. Overall, I am impressed.</li>
            <li> The deep pore cleansing brush heads are my favorite of the brush heads made for Clarisonic. This along with my face wash and the clarisonic have effectively prevented and cleared my breakouts. I pretty much have clear skin now.</li>
            <li> This item is the authentic Clarisonic brush head. Excellent quality and performance. The customer service is the best. I will definitely buy from them again and again and again.</li>
            <li> Love them, and love the price...  I have never received used brushes like some if the other reviews. They work well, and come in original boxes.</li>
            <li> Great value! The brush heads are awesome for my large pores and the three-pack makes me more likely to change them in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided to risk it, these are  not Clarisonic brand brush heads! They fit my Mia &amp; function but the bristles are too long. When compared to the real thing you can clearly see that there are also way fewer bristles made into the brush.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. Update, I returned these with no problem. The ones I purchased came from \\&quot;Fastvibes\\&quot; so these other sellers might be legit. BTW,you can buy 4 authentic brush heads@ ulta for $75.</li>
            <li> Great product. Unbeatable price. Much cheaper than other shopping networks/stores. Will recommend this product to everyone. Great for exfoliating the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes with my clarisonic ever since they came out. These brushes do a deeper cleaning thats why I like them.</li>
            <li> Work great on the Clarasonic device.  Well worth the price</li>
            <li> Great product and does the job.  My husband purchased for me and now he has taken over.</li>
            <li> I really like these!  They do seem to splash water more than I am used to, but for the price, I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy this product from Sephora, but at this price works out better per unit. My daughter who is 15 loves it as well.</li>
            <li> These work great and I change mine every 30 days.  The cost is perfect and is something that I continually purchase as I need them.</li>
            <li> I purchased from SkinCare USA and the brush heads were delivered quickly with minimal packaging and with the plastic caps (with &amp;#34;Clarisonic&amp;#34; on them.)  I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference between these &amp;#34;deep pore&amp;#34; brushes vs. the brushes for normal skin.  I would order again for the price and quantity.</li>
            <li> If you have a Clarisonic I highly recommend these brush heads. It&#x27;s a great exfoliator and really prepares your skin for the moisturizers/skin products you use after cleansing. I have had so many compliments on my skin since using this brush head. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Used these replacements for my Clarisonic.  Very pleased with the quality.  Fit the unit perfectly.  Prefer the deep pore brush head.  Not hard but clean better than the normal, delicate or other brushes.  Long lasting bristles.</li>
            <li> I have had a clarisonic for over 2 years and have been using the deep pore cleansing brush heads since they came out.  When I received these the first day I used them they seemed fine but within two days the brush was already degrading as though I have been using it for the three months that it recommends between changing brush heads.  I am deeply disappointed and will go back to buying these at a business that will not sell me a product that I feel has been used or has something very wrong with their product.</li>
            <li> Great price for 3 replacement heads and they arrived only 3 days after ordering them!&lt;br /&gt;I love these deep pore cleansing brush heads as they get the job done, but are still gentle enough on the face.</li>
            <li> Wow...three replacement heads for the price of one...fantastic! Can&#x27;t go wrong with that. All brand new and original. Arrived on time in good condition.</li>
            <li> Edit: The photos i posted clearly showed that these products are fake/counterfeit. The boxes had the wrong photo/description meaning the sellers are producing their own boxes and essentially the brush heads.The photos somehow disappeared ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brush heads are not real! I made 2 orders. First order was from Slick Design. I looked at the box and noticed it said acne cleansing instead of the deep pore. That should have been my first clue but since the first review said they are authentic, I tried my luck again but with a different seller. This time it was Optimum Outlet. I noticed the box felt different from the other box so I took one of each and compared them.....These sneaky sellers gave me the same brush heads! Both blue. If you look on the Clarisonic site you will see that the acne brushes are green and not blue. The box for the acne even shows a blue brush head which is an obvious sign that they are fake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they are cheap but just know that they are fake. Their boxes are the wrong description/photo. I&#x27;m sorry if you really thought they are real but they are not. Stop confusing consumers by writing that they are real. I will try to post a picture</li>
            <li> They are sold in a plastic bag with no markings, that said, they still have plastic covers and after &amp;#34;snapping&amp;#34; the brush part back onto the head they have been working fine for the few weeks I had them. Maybe they are seconds?  The price can&#x27;t compare with in store, but I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> met my expectations&lt;br /&gt;and fit my clarisonic mia!&lt;br /&gt;very happy with my choice.&lt;br /&gt;no complaints, and comparable price.&lt;br /&gt;:) :)</li>
            <li> The 3 brush heads I ordered came quickly and seem to be the same as ordered through other sites that were more expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen several reviews concerning the packaging not having plastic around them. If you&#x27;ve been to a sephora or ulta you will know it is because they don&#x27;t come with plastic around the box. I&#x27;ve compared these to one&#x27;s I bought from the store and they are identical and brand new. They are the exact same thing you buy at the store except way cheaper price! I could not believe how many people were upset about the lack of plastic. It does not mean they&#x27;ve been opened. That&#x27;s just the way clairisonic packages them. Look at the ones in the store if you don&#x27;t believe me. I&#x27;ve examined them side by side and they are authentic. Now, on the brushes themselves I love the deep pore cleansing brush. It&#x27;s still soft, but for me held its shape better then the other brushes. I don&#x27;t think my skin is as sensitive to the brushes as ornery people. I have also noticed less break outs using this brush vs the acne one which looses it&#x27;s shape very quickly. The deep pore cleansing brush has much more dense bristles so cleansers lather wonderfully. If you have sensitive skin this might be too harsh for you, if not I&#x27;d say go for it! They are my favorite out of all the brushes and sifter then the original brush which did irritate my face.</li>
            <li> Has ordered the 2nd time. Gentle yet powerful. I use it every other day. Works super well. It is awesome!!!.</li>
            <li> I tried to buy the replacements at Sephora but it&#x27;s expensive. This is great price and lasts.. and these brushes do work.</li>
            <li> After struggling with the decision over price vs. authenticity, I decided to take the risk and order these brushes for my Clarisonic Mia. They arrived quickly (faster than other items in my order with free shipping direct from Amazon) and were packaged in original Clarisonic boxes. Can&#x27;t believe how much money I saved!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 5 stars for the price but 3 stars for the product. Nothing wrong, it&#x27;s just that I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the deep pore cleansing brushes vs. the sensitive skin brushes. The former are fuller and the latter, thinner. It&#x27;s all the same after the face wash...so....why pay more. This is in my own case, of course. Some other people may see some difference....</li>
            <li> These were brand new, unused, individually packaged. I saved a ton of $$ from what I would&#x27;ve paid in store for the same thing. Will absolutely be a return customer :)</li>
            <li> These do not come in the original boxes as shown in the picture. I used one thinking nothing of it and it really hurt my skin. Tried it for about a week and finally went and bought a real one at the department store to compare-TOTALLY different. The real one was a lot softer and nicer, don&#x27;t buy, A big waste of money.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered a Clarisonic Mia Brush that shipped with a spare brush head.  That unit lasted about 7 months, so when it was time to replace it she ordered the Clarisonic Deep Pore Cleansing Brush Head 3 Pack (White Box) sold by EZ4 Shoppings.  After one month of use, the bristles are falling off.  While she won&#x27;t go as far as to say this product is fake, I will.  You may be better off ordering from Amazon (not a seller) or the Clarisonic site directly.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My whole family raves about the Clarisonic and the acne brush was much appreciated by my early 20&#x27;s children.</li>
            <li> I took one pad with me with the Clarisonic to Europe. Just one was enough. It worked the whole time. No problems.</li>
            <li> I just love a clean face!!  Makes my face feel so clean, like I really have gotten any and all make-up and dirt off.</li>
            <li> I even washed one of them in the washing machine to lean it.  I have been pleased with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and purchased here due to the good pricing.  Most places you can only purchase 2 in a pack, so I chose these three together.  Arrived in perfect condition and now I won&#x27;t have to restock for awhile.  Again, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Great price. Just be aware, when they &amp;#34;Deep Pore&amp;#34; they really mean it. These brushes brought out everything - I had pimples all over my face because they are so effective. The longer I used them, the more pimples popped up. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but I had to stop using them because my skin couldn&#x27;t handle any more purging.</li>
            <li> These are the best heads for the clarisonic mia. I use my pretty often, and this head has lasted awhile. The cheapest price I have found.</li>
            <li> I bought this pack of three for $50, making them ~17/each.  That&#x27;s a good deal in contrast to paying full price at roughly $25-$30 in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the real thing.  Came in the original boxes and I couldn&#x27;t see or feel a difference.</li>
            <li> The price is right and they fit my Mia  sonic care great. Would recommend this. Will reorder this when needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Clarisonic Mia2 for just over a year and you are supposed to change the head every two-three months so I have tried a couple different places to buy them and Amazon is the least expensive I have found. Get them here!!</li>
            <li> I had used my normal brush head for about two weeks after purchasing my Clarisonic. I ordered these because I&#x27;d read they got a deeper clean and were better at getting into corners around the nose. Overall I thought the brushes were much rougher than the normal heads and my forehead got very sensitive and covered in red bumps. I&#x27;ve started using the delicate head and my face is much happier.</li>
            <li> This was the best deal I found for the replacement brushes. Delivery was quick , each brush was in a box, they were all New, fit the machine &amp; worked great.</li>
            <li> Only one of the three brushes worked with my Mia and I thought it might have been my Mia, but it&#x27;s not. When I contacted the seller about this, they told me there was nothing they could do. So, I&#x27;d be skeptical about purchasing &#x27;clarisonic&#x27; replacement brushes from sellers other than Clarisonic or a reputable store such as Sephora.</li>
