            <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Like the way the pad cling to the holder making lotion application very easy.</li>

            <li> Basically a disappointment. The pads are way too small to effectly spread lotion&lt;br /&gt;The pads will wear out soon requiring frequent replacement.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a poor overall design</li>
            <li> I wish I had known that such a product existed a long time ago.  It is so difficult to apply lotion of any type to your back by yourself.  The Body Reach lets you apply lotion or any other cream to your back from the neck to the buttocks easily and thoroughly. It is available in 14&amp;#34; or 20&amp;#34; lengths and you can bend it to get it on exactly the right spot.  The price is very reasonable, the shipping is very fast, and the communication excellent.  Give one a try.</li>
            <li> Great product, does the job, well made.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this for putting medication on my back, ankle etc.  MY ERROR , I bought the 14&amp;#34; one and it is to short so I still have to twist my back and neck around when making application.  I will order a longer  one soon! !  I ordered extra pads for application as I was not sure how good they are.  I have washed (by hand)  six to eight times  and I am still using the same one.  There has not been any wear at the Velcro sights that hold it to the handle. They stay firmly in place while using and the&lt;br /&gt;Pad is dry for the next application 8 am.  I have no waste as I did when applying with spatula , Messy .! ! !</li>
            <li> love this able to reach all areas of my back and able to add or use a buff puff to really scrub my back. a plus for seniors</li>
            <li> Bends great. Extea pads r great</li>
            <li> This is a fine product.  The pads do absorb the lotion or less viscous stuff, but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>

            <li> Flexible enough to hit shoulder blades and spine (turn sideways for best results).&lt;br /&gt;Pads work well and hold up longer than I thought.</li>
            <li> works great for those hard to reach places that need medicine or lotion..</li>
            <li> It works just as I want it to.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly as advertised.  Bends and holds the bend</li>
