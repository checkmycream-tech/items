            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>i have used the pedispin, but wasn&#x27;t happy with it because it would stop spinning with even the slightest pressure against my callouses.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m happy that it is electric</li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;m really happy with my purchase...</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It is best to go easy</li>
            <li>I did not like very much to inefficient usage manual best</li>
            <li>Then I started to apply more pressure and the motor just quit!  </li>
            <li>Instantly better feet!</li>
            <li>I think I would prefer the kind where I could attach sand paper discs.</li>
            <li>my own fault.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>We are able to keep our feet smooth and feeling great.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping very good product</li>
            <li>Take easy, proceed gradually!  </li>
            <li>afterwords my heels were very smooth.</li>
            <li>However it works amazing and is easy.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any manual method.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this machine, have 3 of them.  </li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>I now use it about every three days and am quite pleased with its operation and results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for years and love it.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>on one hand, i was glad that i wouldn&#x27;t cut my feet to shreds while trying to remove the callouses, but i thought there had to be a better solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I find the manual filers in the drug to do a better job and faster too.  </li>
            <li>You are better off buying a pumice stone.</li>
            <li>Works ok but have to watch the speed as it cut a part of my foot</li>
            <li>so I had a pretty good idea on how to use it.  </li>
            <li>My husband is on his feet at work for 15 hours a day and his feet are now looking the best they have in a long time.  </li>
            <li>But all in all it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>It really works good</li>
            <li>My fiancee got me this product, and i was more than happy to use it, but as soon as i opened and charged the callus remover, it seemed to work properly for like 20 seconds</li>
            <li>Easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li>It is a  powerful device so use with caution it works and is very easy to clean</li>
            <li>work great and no damage to your feet.&lt;br /&gt;my 2nd one.</li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very sceptical about these kind of stuff</li>
            <li>of the only truly indispensable appliances I own!</li>
            <li>it was a great deal for the money I spent.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to not apply too much pressure or the unit will stop turning.</li>
            <li>It was working okay at first, but it didn&#x27;t seem like it was doing much.  </li>
            <li>I found this device to be worth the money.</li>
            <li>i thought it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>It is worth your money to buy it.</li>
            <li>It really works fabulously if you are consistent with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised other reviewers don&#x27;t like it because I find it works great.</li>
            <li>either I looked all over wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be the actual product for the price.</li>
            <li>You have to keep using a few times a week to really get rid of calluses, but using this and slathering a good cream on them will eventually work.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>The Bario works very well to take the callus off</li>
            <li>but really this one works i use it every time i need too</li>
            <li>but you need to be gentle with it</li>
            <li>If you apply more pressure at the rough spots on the heel, the motor stops working.  </li>
            <li>You do really need to order extra plates though cause you can go through them pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a high price for her work ØŒ</li>
            <li>Then you have to keep recharging or buy new batteries.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no trouble with the motor at all.</li>
            <li>She just barely ordered some replacement disks.</li>
            <li>So much easier when the electrical device does the work instead of you having to manually scrub with other sanding products!</li>
            <li>I like the fact there is no batteries and using electricity plugged into the wall because battery operated devices tend to be strong right away, but half way the power drops off the chart and it is useless.  </li>

            <li> There is not enough power on the plate and it takes a very long time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t someone come up with one that actually takes off calluses, doesn&#x27;t stop with pressure, and doesn&#x27;t take a very long time to finish task??</li>
            <li> I get really dry feet, especially in the summer when I&#x27;m wearing sandles all the time.</li>
            <li> the polishing plate is not rough enough and the power is not strong enough.  </li>
            <li> Will find out how long the shaving blade lsts</li>
            <li> I am suffereing from callus, dryness for long time.</li>
            <li> In fact, my only problem is I&#x27;m so enthusiastic about removing dead skin that sometimes I overuse it and cut myself, which is painful but</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because you read so many complaints on other comparable products.  </li>
            <li> It just is too weak to really do what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would get cracks that hurt all the time on the outside of my foot below my little toe and this no longer happens.  </li>
            <li> My husbands feet have such thick callouses and it causes him burning sensations and makes it hard for him to walk so we are using it per the directions, thank you so much</li>
            <li> If you press harder it shuts off.</li>
            <li> This callus remover is just not strong enough.</li>
            <li> and I found that I had a lot of rough skin due to sports activities and in three days of use and applying a foot cream</li>
            <li> Not worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> but this one is just -.- not worth it.</li>
            <li> It never powers down.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after trying a few other battery operated items.</li>
            <li> Soak your feet and then use this little gem.</li>
            <li> My sister was mentioning that she also wanted one since she also has dried cracked heals.</li>
            <li> Callus build up takes a few days to get rid of.</li>
            <li> i read a few reviews that say the unit stops with the slightest pressure, but that wasn&#x27;t the case for me.  </li>
            <li> So upset because this was soemthing my fiancee bought me, but its just waste of money, i usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> the motor in it is too small,</li>
            <li> I had a lot of problem in the past with my feet.</li>
            <li> Remember to replace the blades when they become dull.</li>
            <li> The motor will stop if you push too hard</li>
            <li> when i use it i can&#x27;t apply hardly applly any pressure or it stops.</li>
            <li> The motor will stop if you push too hard, but it is designed to do so.</li>
            <li> omewhat slow</li>
            <li> it did work, but i found it frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Totally useless.</li>
            <li> this is useless.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know where to begin on how useless.  </li>
            <li> I have athlete&#x27;s foot and my feet get all dry and cracked and disgusting.</li>
            <li> disappointing in my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and also I read a lot of bad reviews.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works very well. Does an excellent job. Will find out how long the shaving blade lsts</li>
            <li> Great product. The individual who does my pedicures has a similar product so I had a pretty good idea on how to use it.  I think I would prefer the kind where I could attach sand paper discs. Time will tell how well the permanent disc will hold up.  I suppose I can always still put a sandpaper disc on the unit. Just be sure to not apply too much pressure or the unit will stop turning. Works better than any manual method.</li>
            <li> I was worried about  this not working and also I read a lot of bad reviews.  However I am happy that I decided to purchase.  It is a  powerful device so use with caution it works and is very easy to clean</li>
            <li> Fast shipping very good product thank u Amazon you are best...</li>
            <li> I have a friend who has been using this electric callus remover on her feet for a year now and she loves this product. She just barely ordered some replacement disks. I get really dry feet, especially in the summer when I&#x27;m wearing sandles all the time. So I bought me one and I love it. My sister was mentioning that she also wanted one since she also has dried cracked heals. So I just purchased another one that I will be giving to her for her birthday in the next couple of days.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because you read so many complaints on other comparable products.  However it works amazing and is easy.  I like the fact there is no batteries and using electricity plugged into the wall because battery operated devices tend to be strong right away, but half way the power drops off the chart and it is useless.  Then you have to keep recharging or buy new batteries.  I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Our son had one of these and we would borrow it, but needed one for ourselves.  This is a great price and the product works great.  We are able to keep our feet smooth and feeling great.  My husband is on his feet at work for 15 hours a day and his feet are now looking the best they have in a long time.  I like to wear flip flops and this product keeps my feet looking great.  I would get cracks that hurt all the time on the outside of my foot below my little toe and this no longer happens.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> work great and no damage to your feet.&lt;br /&gt;my 2nd one. one for me, one for my wife. easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It really works good I would recommend this electric callus remover. it was a great deal for the money I spent.</li>
            <li> Works great. You do really need to order extra plates though cause you can go through them pretty fast. But all in all it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love this machine, have 3 of them.  Take easy, proceed gradually!  Remember to replace the blades when they become dull.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a replacement for the one he had(the cord broke). He uses it daily and loves it. He seems to have no complaints about the BARIO.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a high price for her work ØŒ omewhat slow I did not like very much to inefficient usage manual best</li>
            <li> The Bario works very well to take the callus off</li>
            <li> My friend from the east coast gave me this callus remover and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It was working okay at first, but it didn&#x27;t seem like it was doing much.  Then I started to apply more pressure and the motor just quit!  Totally useless.</li>
            <li> I just love it it&#x27;s awesome electric callus remover and I&#x27;m very sceptical about these kind of stuff but really this one works i use it every time i need too and it works like a charm but you need to be gentle with it do not press it on your feet</li>
            <li> I purchased this after trying a few other battery operated items. I found this device to be worth the money. The motor will stop if you push too hard but it is properly designed that way so you won&#x27;t hurt your skin. If it stops you are not using it properly. It is not designed to be a rotary sander.  Callus build up takes a few days to get rid of. It is best to go easy and I found that I had a lot of rough skin due to sports activities and in three days of use and applying a foot cream afterwords my heels were very smooth. I now use it about every three days and am quite pleased with its operation and results.</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are so many negative reviews on this product. I&#x27;ve had mine for years and love it. Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t work overnight. You have to keep using a few times a week to really get rid of calluses, but using this and slathering a good cream on them will eventually work. I&#x27;ve had no trouble with the motor at all. I did replace the sanding disc last year.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i have used the pedispin, but wasn&#x27;t happy with it because it would stop spinning with even the slightest pressure against my callouses.  it did work, but i found it frustrating.  on one hand, i was glad that i wouldn&#x27;t cut my feet to shreds while trying to remove the callouses, but i thought there had to be a better solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i saw this product listed i thought it would be worth a try.  i read a few reviews that say the unit stops with the slightest pressure, but that wasn&#x27;t the case for me.  and i&#x27;m happy that it is electric and i don&#x27;t have to deal with batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m really happy with my purchase...and so are my feet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost three years and I love it. I&#x27;m surprised other reviewers don&#x27;t like it because I find it works great. I have athlete&#x27;s foot and my feet get all dry and cracked and disgusting. I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of it, even with prescription cream. I use this once a week, when I get out of the shower so the skin is softened up a bit. It never powers down. In fact, my only problem is I&#x27;m so enthusiastic about removing dead skin that sometimes I overuse it and cut myself, which is painful but my own fault.&lt;br /&gt;One of the only truly indispensable appliances I own!</li>
            <li> this is useless.  i don&#x27;t know where to begin on how useless.  the motor in it is too small, when i use it i can&#x27;t apply hardly applly any pressure or it stops.</li>
            <li> It is worth your money to buy it. I had a lot of problem in the past with my feet. Also, I have athlete food. I am suffereing from callus, dryness for long time. When I use the Bario C.removal. my feet looks like never had a problem.</li>
            <li> the polishing plate is not rough enough and the power is not strong enough.  If you apply more pressure at the rough spots on the heel, the motor stops working.  I find the manual filers in the drug to do a better job and faster too.  This callus remover is just not strong enough.</li>
            <li> You are better off buying a pumice stone. Its a lot cheaper and a heck of alot quicker. There is not enough power on the plate and it takes a very long time. If you press harder it shuts off. Look elsewhere. Not worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> My fiancee got me this product, and i was more than happy to use it, but as soon as i opened and charged the callus remover, it seemed to work properly for like 20 seconds then it just stopped working with some burning smell, i thought i was cooking something then realized it was this callus remover. So upset because this was soemthing my fiancee bought me, but its just waste of money, i usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this one is just -.- not worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a year ago. It works perfectly on calluses. The motor will stop if you push too hard, but it is designed to do so. I would recommend the Bario Electric Callus Remover to anyone. I find that using it about every three or four days helps me keep the calluses under control. It is the best electric callus remover I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Soak your feet and then use this little gem. It really works fabulously if you are consistent with it. So much easier when the electrical device does the work instead of you having to manually scrub with other sanding products! This can make your feet look like &amp;#34;baby butt&amp;#34; skin if you use it regularly!</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use and maintain. Instantly better feet! U can&#x27;t beat the price either I looked all over wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be the actual product for the price. It was!</li>
            <li> Works ok but have to watch the speed as it cut a part of my foot</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a while back. It just is too weak to really do what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;I put it away. I just got it back out and tried it again.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing in my experience.&lt;br /&gt; Can&#x27;t someone come up with one that actually takes off calluses, doesn&#x27;t stop with pressure, and doesn&#x27;t take a very long time to finish task??</li>
            <li> This is working perfect !  My husbands feet have such thick callouses and it causes him burning sensations and makes it hard for him to walk so we are using it per the directions, thank you so much</li>
