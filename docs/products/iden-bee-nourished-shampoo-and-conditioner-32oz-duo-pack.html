            <li> This product really can change your hair.  My hair was feeling very limp and dry.  The salon recommended this and I am so glad I purchased it.  Through Amazon Prime, I received it in two days.  The scent is nice, the texture is smooth, and it really works.  My damaged hair feels and looks better after two weeks of using the products.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, don&#x27;t use the conditioner but for the price I could not pass it up.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very dry.  Not very happy with shampoo .</li>
            <li> This stuff does wonders for my hair and is about the same price as the stores around here with tax and what not.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo and the Conditioner is okay.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo/conditioner.  Great product!  It boost to stimulate new hair growth and I think it really works !</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Great for color-treated, long hair :)</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthier !</li>
            <li> This product seemed like it was pirated; i know this conditioner well and the color, texture and results were very different from the product I usually buy from this brand.  I don&#x27;t think i would trust this site again to purchase product.</li>
            <li> if u have problem with ur hair anything, try this one</li>
            <li> The conditioner doesn&#x27;t really make your hair too soft like some other brands, which I prefer. Only thing that made me rate this a 4 was the conditioner leaked a little from the top even though it was taped securely. Other than that I recommend this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really good. It is a little expensive but overall a great value.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> SHAMPOO IS GREAT.  CONDITIONER IS HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> Product is dark and not like what I normally use. I called Iden and they said they do not authorize Amazon to sell so I guess I am out if luck.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife. She said she was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo n cond works great/ it&#x27;s 1st cond that actually leaves my hair sooo soft!!! My hair is very damaged love it</li>
            <li> I WISH I COULD BUY THIS AGAIN. BEST HAIR PRODUCT AROUND AND exactly what I was looking for, and affordable!</li>
