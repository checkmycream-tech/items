            <li>The best time to use this concealer for me is at night time and for pictures...</li>
            <li>This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for covering up an area of spider veins on my leg.  </li>
            <li>Excellent concealer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for lining your brows to make them look sharper and cleaner!</li>
            <li>and it is absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is the best concealer I have ever owned</li>
            <li>Creases great too.</li>
            <li>And this concealer is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good product.</li>
            <li>This seems more concentrated, somehow, and its texture is perfectly silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this concealer for over 7 years and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It is even better than the tube/cream/whatever concealer!</li>
            <li>I have used MANY concealers, trying to find something that will cover my sun damaged face and not look like I have on theater makeup!  </li>
            <li>As for the product itself, it is a really great full-coverage concealer, really creamy, and has really good staying power.  </li>
            <li>Amazing Concealer is great, but also VERY pricey like this MAC product.  </li>
            <li>I really LOVE this concealer.  </li>
            <li>, it makes me look more wide-eyed and more alert</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase this again until I find something better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>Ok, so I didn&#x27;t order this product from Amazon</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make you feel or look like you are wearing a lot of makeup, like many do.</li>
            <li>And girls, go for it :)  </li>
            <li>but when applied right it looks perfect and natural.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t go anywhere without it, absolutely best cover up out there, doesn&#x27;t cake, full coverage, only thing that will hide my under eye circles at at 46</li>
            <li>Other than that, great concealer!</li>
            <li>Not creamy and easy to apply at all.</li>
            <li>but I feel strongly about reviewing it.  </li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re there), but this concealer is the real deal and the seller was fantastic and sent it super fast (got here literally a week before it was estimated to arrive) and it was very nicely packaged with cute tissue paper and everything.  </li>
            <li>(most of which are so perfectly copied it takes some serious examination to find any flaws...</li>
            <li>and I heard MAC makes good concealers, so I finally decided to try.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have a MAC store nearby now, so buying on Amazon was simple, easy, and quick!  </li>
            <li>It does such a great job at covering the darkness in the inner corners of my eyes and under my eyes that have come about with \\&quot;age\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived VERY FAST AND CORRECTLY.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL PRODUCT, NEW AND WITHOUT DEFECTS.</li>
            <li>SEND A REQUEST OF THE EXACT COLOR, ERROR-FREE.</li>
            <li>I use it for a lot of things to cover blemishes etc but the main reason why I use it is for my eyebrows!</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the shade is too light for summer tan skin</li>
            <li>I would definitely feel comfortable buying MAC products from this seller again.  </li>
            <li>in fact Amazon carries it for same price with free shipping as an add-on item.  </li>
            <li>(might be because sometimes I put a lot on) and also, one thing I really don&#x27;t like about this product is that it has a yellow/orangy hue/tone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other concealers and so far this one is the top of my list!</li>
            <li>I use this concealer for under eye circles, coverage is good but find the consistency to be very thick and kind of tough which causes it to dry in a chalky kind of way.</li>
            <li>It covers blemishes, acne scars, dark circles, etc better than anything I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I have encountered better concealers for less.</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s pretty consistent and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I would, however, caution against using this product for dark circles under your eyes as it can appear cakey if not applied with a light hand...</li>
            <li>A little bit expensive but the best concealer of the market</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t completely erase the blemished area.  </li>
            <li>and when I don&#x27;t wear foundation, when I just wear concealer to cover major spots, you can tell, depending on lighting because it doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone</li>
            <li>I only use it for small areas like undereye circles, scars, acne, etc, not for any significant portion of my face, and I can&#x27;t see myself ever running out of this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft, but not cakey, it covers all the dark spots and you can barely see it&#x27;s on, seems very natural.</li>
            <li>I tried to use the product but found that no matter how little I used or much I blended</li>

            <li> It is just thick enough and stays on very well.</li>
            <li> Small enough to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> After complaining to a friend over lunch that I was tired of throwing out $25 products that are basically dry and really do not do the job, she recommended NYX Above and Beyond!  </li>
            <li> When I use the concealer, the veins are slightly visible, but much less so than if I went without.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after having used the tube/cream version of the MAC concealer previously (color matched).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your face oily/shiny and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy (as if your pores are being clogged and your face can&#x27;t breathe), because some makeup products give me that feeling...</li>
            <li> that is no easy task.</li>
            <li> I usually add some bronzer powder over it to help it match my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It works well; hardly streaks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to select the correct color from a web site, but if you can find MAC products in a store and know what color you&#x27;re looking for, it&#x27;s a convenient way to order replacements.</li>
            <li> I like the concealer but the plastic see-though disc does not fit properly into the cover which makes it very annoying to open!</li>
            <li> Of course it covers, it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> Too thick for me.  </li>
            <li> Do NOT pay this ridiculous price for MAC - buy the NYX concealer.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong shade.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a fake</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> This product SHOULD say size shown in picture is ACTUAL SIZE!! It is enough to use for a week! Had I known that, I would have never given this an actual thought! I wouldn&#x27;t have made this purchase! DO NOT BUY!!! Rip off!!!</li>
            <li> THis concealer does the job. It covers acne scars and age spots without being cakey at all!!!!! I NEVER leave home without it!!!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SELLER. The product arrived VERY FAST AND CORRECTLY. ORIGINAL PRODUCT, NEW AND WITHOUT DEFECTS. SEND A REQUEST OF THE EXACT COLOR, ERROR-FREE.</li>
            <li> I use this concealer for under eye circles, coverage is good but find the consistency to be very thick and kind of tough which causes it to dry in a chalky kind of way. Tried with and without primer underneath, tried setting it with powder and tried it without the powder... Still, the creasing and chalky look was present. The best time to use this concealer for me is at night time and for pictures... Works wonders in pictures!!!</li>
            <li> I really LOVE this concealer.  It does such a great job at covering the darkness in the inner corners of my eyes and under my eyes that have come about with \\&quot;age\\&quot;.  Not only does it cover these darknesses well, it makes me look more wide-eyed and more alert and I actually have to say---younger.  I&#x27;ve tried other concealers and so far this one is the top of my list!</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth.  I love it.  Lasts all day for me.  Small enough to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> I tried to use the product but found that no matter how little I used or much I blended it just didn&#x27;t work well. This is not for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong shade.  I should have ordered something darker.  It works well; hardly streaks.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Did not purchase through Amazon but at a MAC store at my local mall. Once I get pass all the clown made up people working there I take a chance and by this. Of course it covers, it&#x27;s thick. Too thick for me.  Not creamy and easy to apply at all. Creases great too. I returned it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this concealer for over 7 years and LOVE IT!  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  We don&#x27;t have a MAC store nearby now, so buying on Amazon was simple, easy, and quick!  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for covering up an area of spider veins on my leg.  It is just thick enough and stays on very well. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the shade is too light for summer tan skin and it doesn&#x27;t completely erase the blemished area.  I usually add some bronzer powder over it to help it match my skin tone.  When I use the concealer, the veins are slightly visible, but much less so than if I went without.  I will purchase this again until I find something better.  I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent concealer.  It covers a scar without looking like I applied a concealer.  It blends well, and has a moisturizing effect, as well as a sun screen to prevent the scar from discoloring from sun exposure.  It&#x27;s hard to select the correct color from a web site, but if you can find MAC products in a store and know what color you&#x27;re looking for, it&#x27;s a convenient way to order replacements.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a fake</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t go anywhere without it, absolutely best cover up out there, doesn&#x27;t cake, full coverage, only thing that will hide my under eye circles at at 46 that is no easy task.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been nervous to buy MAC products anywhere besides a MAC counter or off their website because there are SO many fake MAC products floating around (most of which are so perfectly copied it takes some serious examination to find any flaws...but they&#x27;re there), but this concealer is the real deal and the seller was fantastic and sent it super fast (got here literally a week before it was estimated to arrive) and it was very nicely packaged with cute tissue paper and everything.  I would definitely feel comfortable buying MAC products from this seller again.  As for the product itself, it is a really great full-coverage concealer, really creamy, and has really good staying power.  Its been one of my go-to concealers for years.  I would, however, caution against using this product for dark circles under your eyes as it can appear cakey if not applied with a light hand...but when applied right it looks perfect and natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many and I heard MAC makes good concealers, so I finally decided to try. It&#x27;s so soft, but not cakey, it covers all the dark spots and you can barely see it&#x27;s on, seems very natural. I love it I love it I love it :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon I bought it at MAC! And this concealer is AMAZING! I love it! I use it for a lot of things to cover blemishes etc but the main reason why I use it is for my eyebrows! It&#x27;s great for lining your brows to make them look sharper and cleaner!</li>
            <li> I bought this after having used the tube/cream version of the MAC concealer previously (color matched). It is even better than the tube/cream/whatever concealer! This seems more concentrated, somehow, and its texture is perfectly silky smooth. I only use it for small areas like undereye circles, scars, acne, etc, not for any significant portion of my face, and I can&#x27;t see myself ever running out of this. It blends well and doesn&#x27;t settle into skin folds or anything over the course of an evening.</li>
            <li> I like the concealer but the plastic see-though disc does not fit properly into the cover which makes it very annoying to open!</li>
            <li> I purchased this concealer thru the MAC website, not on Amazon but I feel strongly about reviewing it.  I have used MANY concealers, trying to find something that will cover my sun damaged face and not look like I have on theater makeup!  Amazing Concealer is great, but also VERY pricey like this MAC product.  After complaining to a friend over lunch that I was tired of throwing out $25 products that are basically dry and really do not do the job, she recommended NYX Above and Beyond!  For 5 bucks at ULTA I was blown away.  in fact Amazon carries it for same price with free shipping as an add-on item.  Do NOT pay this ridiculous price for MAC - buy the NYX concealer.  You will NOT be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I didn&#x27;t order this product from Amazon but I bought mine at Macy&#x27;s and it is absolutely wonderful. So I wanted to write a review and recommend it! It covers blemishes, acne scars, dark circles, etc better than anything I have ever tried. This is the best concealer I have ever owned and I will definitely keep buying it. It doesn&#x27;t make you feel or look like you are wearing a lot of makeup, like many do. AND it&#x27;s pretty consistent and lasts a long time. It doesn&#x27;t make your face oily/shiny and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy (as if your pores are being clogged and your face can&#x27;t breathe), because some makeup products give me that feeling... Sooo thank you M.A.C.! And girls, go for it :)  Update: so after wearing this concealer for years, I have noticed it sometimes gathers under your eyes (might be because sometimes I put a lot on) and also, one thing I really don&#x27;t like about this product is that it has a yellow/orangy hue/tone and when I don&#x27;t wear foundation, when I just wear concealer to cover major spots, you can tell, depending on lighting because it doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone (I wear the lightest shade and it looks a bit on the orange side). Other than that, great concealer!</li>
            <li> A little bit expensive but the best concealer of the market</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why people don&#x27;t buy it from Mac&#x27;s website. Its cheaper there, only $18. It&#x27;s good product. I am just comparing prices.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s too pricey I have encountered better concealers for less.</li>
