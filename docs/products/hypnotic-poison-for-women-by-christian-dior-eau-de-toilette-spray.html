            <li>I&#x27;ve always found the Poison bottles to be really lovely, so</li>
            <li>I really am absolutely in love with it and bought a full-size bottle within three weeks.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re at the store - you just might fall in love with it like I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this perfume by Dior!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Dior describes this scent as vanilla with burnt almond,which doesnt sound all that great,but the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>and they love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really lovely.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason strippers wear this perfume: it&#x27;s sexy.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>My favorite winter perfume.</li>
            <li>Nothing better in the world except love and chocolate</li>
            <li>I have had many compliments.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the body lotion and just love the combination.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite for many years.  </li>
            <li>I can say that I am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>Sexy, sexy stuff</li>
            <li>, you ought to have to show I.D. to buy it:)</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love the body lotion, too, goes well together.</li>
            <li>Once had a guy tell me it smelled like \\&quot;sexy sunscreen\\&quot;..</li>
            <li>Years ago, my husband and I were walking through a department store when we were both stopped in our tracks by the most seductive, delectable fragrance either of us</li>
            <li>This perfume has an amazing, unique scent.  </li>
            <li>Warm sweet and sexy.</li>
            <li>It is a very sweet and sensual smell.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is amazing, distinct, and truly addicting.</li>
            <li>I originally fell in love with this fragrance when I smelled it on a friend.  </li>
            <li>Hypnotic Poison has some vanilla, musk and other frangrances for an awesome blend.  </li>
            <li>It is surprisingly strong and long-lasting for an EDT.</li>
            <li>I love the sweet smell of vanilla and cherries.</li>
            <li>The product was fine.  </li>
            <li>Everything with my purchase was fine, except for the shipping.</li>
            <li>But after it sits on skin for an hour, the original poison smells better and this smells week and nothing special.</li>
            <li>I have never bought a perfume without smelling it before, so I was taking a huge chance when I bought Hypnotic Poison.</li>
            <li>The Dior poison line is the most complimentary scents, I have surrounded myself with.</li>
            <li>, bottle didn&#x27;t have gold ring on neck, cap didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>Great perfume to wear on a romantic evening</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this light scented perfume for years.  </li>
            <li>I love gourmand fragrances, so Hypnotic Poison is right up my alley.</li>
            <li>It has a completely unique smell,unlike anything else,and lasts all day long,unlike alot of perfumes that need to be re-applied throughout the day.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Package was the original box.</li>
            <li>At first it smells better that the original poison.  </li>
            <li>I wear it for special occasions, when I want people to notice.</li>
            <li>I would describe it as a sweet almond or amaretto scent.  </li>
            <li>Got my last bottle from sephora and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Other than taking 3 weeks to get it the product is great.</li>
            <li>and I like clean, fresh scents.  </li>
            <li>If you love grounded tones of vanilla and musk that has a seductive and mysterious scent you will love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is exotic, mysterious, and alluring, not to mention sexy to the max.</li>
            <li>afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing was the fast shipping and very good packing for the product.</li>
            <li>I researched other sites for the lowest price and was surprised to find Amazon had the best price!</li>
            <li>In spite of its sultry sexiness, the fragrance is very classy and sophisticated .</li>
            <li>Sometimes its worth the treat.</li>
            <li>It is :feminine, RICH, not overpowering , and sensual - VERY sensual .</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find a better fragrance that&#x27;s sweet and lasting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;THE SPRAY IS OKAY FOR WOMEN IN GENERAL.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would like something with such a strong note of vanilla, but the other notes cut it with the perfect amount of spice, and it&#x27;s simply addictive!</li>
            <li>and I love the way it lingers, especially on my clothes and hair.</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>IF you get lucky, you&#x27;ll get the older stuff</li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite perfume &amp; I&#x27;ll be purchasing again next year.</li>
            <li>Exotic, mysterious, and very sensual.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite perfume,and is worth the money if you want to splurge.</li>
            <li>Just put some on and walk pass that certain someone you want to notice you.</li>
            <li>my wife loves it so much.</li>
            <li>This has a very sensual, seductive smell to it.</li>
            <li>She really likes it too!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as pictured, smell is much lighter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real thing</li>
            <li>mom says it&#x27;s just like the one she always gets and definitely seems genuine.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I will rate this perfume a 5 because the product arrived quickly, was genuine and DOES smell good, but in reality I&#x27;d probably rate it a 4, only because it wears a little strangely with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>It also occasionally smells very strongly like play-doh, although sometimes I only get vanilla/rootbeer scents from this perfume.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was a little old-ladyish, but I grew to love the smell.</li>
            <li>Rich and lasting.</li>
            <li>It can be very cloying in warm weather, to the point where you feel kind of sick.</li>
            <li>IT CAN BE IMPROVED FOR HIGH SCENT WHICH CAN BE USED BY BOTH MEN AND WOMEN.</li>
            <li>If you get a little bit onto your sleeve, it will be a lovely scent that lasts until you wash it.  </li>
            <li>when a saleswoman at the mall asked if I wanted any fragrance samples, I asked her to give me whatever her favorite Poison was, and she handed me a little vial of the Hypnotic.</li>
            <li>and I was still able to smell it a little</li>
            <li>Favorite perfume hands down!</li>
            <li>Why was there no box when the product was sold as new</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula, in the new btl., and new box.</li>
            <li>I new this scent was a lighter than Poison.</li>
            <li>Around where we live the mall does not sell this version anymore</li>
            <li>This is my new signature scent.</li>
            <li>Everyone has different taste so you should try first before buying.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s lovely when you&#x27;ve been married long enough that each asks the other what they&#x27;d like for their anniversary (or Christmas, birthday, Ground Hog Day...)</li>
            <li>I was so impressed,I ordered the large bottle,and the next day it was on my doorstep.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll just pay a little more and buy it directly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, thanks, Dior - I finally found my &amp;#34;signature scent.&amp;#34; My nana had Chanel No. 5</li>
            <li>It has a soft chocolate smell.  </li>
            <li>I felt absolutely bereft when I could not get even a whisper out of the atomizer of my last bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m complimented on it quite frequently.  </li>
            <li>So soft, milky &amp; powdery.</li>
            <li>What I purchased was a copy, smell a little lighter (original stays with you longer)</li>
            <li>No, not really, not when you consider I&#x27;ve been looking for *years* for that &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34; every other woman seemed able to identify before she was 15.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little to sweet for me, but my wife likes it.</li>
            <li>I still smell it on me the next day and of course perfume has different scents on different skin types so for me it smells exactly like I remember years ago!</li>
            <li>The bottle is very different from the normal bottles and it smells...</li>
            <li>I purchased my last bottle from Amazon, which was $5 cheaper than the web site I normally buy from.  </li>
            <li>The bitter almond, cinnamon and vanilla smell absolutely divine on my skin, and this lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a bit heavy for me since I prefer fresh scents.</li>
            <li>It is alot more expensive than any other perfume I wear,but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>Still mild and not sure it can be smelled by others.</li>
            <li>The one that I got it&#x27;s fake; starting from the black box, and the smell is sooo light and doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 minutes...</li>
            <li>I buy my mom this perfume every year, usually from a store or right from Dior</li>

            <li> Love the smell, always use it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> and it is my favorite to wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found the Poison bottles to be really lovely, so</li>
            <li> I really am absolutely in love with it and bought a full-size bottle within three weeks.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re at the store - you just might fall in love with it like I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this perfume by Dior!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Dior describes this scent as vanilla with burnt almond,which doesnt sound all that great,but the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> and they love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really lovely.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason strippers wear this perfume: it&#x27;s sexy.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> My favorite winter perfume.</li>
            <li> Nothing better in the world except love and chocolate</li>
            <li> I have had many compliments.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the body lotion and just love the combination.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite for many years.  </li>
            <li> I can say that I am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> Sexy, sexy stuff</li>
            <li> , you ought to have to show I.D. to buy it:)</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love the body lotion, too, goes well together.</li>
            <li> Once had a guy tell me it smelled like \\&quot;sexy sunscreen\\&quot;..</li>
            <li> Years ago, my husband and I were walking through a department store when we were both stopped in our tracks by the most seductive, delectable fragrance either of us</li>
            <li> This perfume has an amazing, unique scent.  </li>
            <li> Warm sweet and sexy.</li>
            <li> It is a very sweet and sensual smell.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is amazing, distinct, and truly addicting.</li>
            <li> I originally fell in love with this fragrance when I smelled it on a friend.  </li>
            <li> Hypnotic Poison has some vanilla, musk and other frangrances for an awesome blend.  </li>
            <li> It is surprisingly strong and long-lasting for an EDT.</li>
            <li> I love the sweet smell of vanilla and cherries.</li>
            <li> The product was fine.  </li>
            <li> Everything with my purchase was fine, except for the shipping.</li>
            <li> But after it sits on skin for an hour, the original poison smells better and this smells week and nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have never bought a perfume without smelling it before, so I was taking a huge chance when I bought Hypnotic Poison.</li>
            <li> The Dior poison line is the most complimentary scents, I have surrounded myself with.</li>
            <li> , bottle didn&#x27;t have gold ring on neck, cap didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> Great perfume to wear on a romantic evening</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this light scented perfume for years.  </li>
            <li> I love gourmand fragrances, so Hypnotic Poison is right up my alley.</li>
            <li> It has a completely unique smell,unlike anything else,and lasts all day long,unlike alot of perfumes that need to be re-applied throughout the day.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Package was the original box.</li>
            <li> At first it smells better that the original poison.  </li>
            <li> I wear it for special occasions, when I want people to notice.</li>
            <li> I would describe it as a sweet almond or amaretto scent.  </li>
            <li> Got my last bottle from sephora and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Other than taking 3 weeks to get it the product is great.</li>
            <li> and I like clean, fresh scents.  </li>
            <li> If you love grounded tones of vanilla and musk that has a seductive and mysterious scent you will love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is exotic, mysterious, and alluring, not to mention sexy to the max.</li>
            <li> afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing was the fast shipping and very good packing for the product.</li>
            <li> I researched other sites for the lowest price and was surprised to find Amazon had the best price!</li>
            <li> In spite of its sultry sexiness, the fragrance is very classy and sophisticated .</li>
            <li> Sometimes its worth the treat.</li>
            <li> It is :feminine, RICH, not overpowering , and sensual - VERY sensual .</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a better fragrance that&#x27;s sweet and lasting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;THE SPRAY IS OKAY FOR WOMEN IN GENERAL.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would like something with such a strong note of vanilla, but the other notes cut it with the perfect amount of spice, and it&#x27;s simply addictive!</li>
            <li> and I love the way it lingers, especially on my clothes and hair.</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> IF you get lucky, you&#x27;ll get the older stuff</li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite perfume &amp; I&#x27;ll be purchasing again next year.</li>
            <li> Exotic, mysterious, and very sensual.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite perfume,and is worth the money if you want to splurge.</li>
            <li> Just put some on and walk pass that certain someone you want to notice you.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it so much.</li>
            <li> This has a very sensual, seductive smell to it.</li>
            <li> She really likes it too!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as pictured, smell is much lighter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real thing</li>
            <li> mom says it&#x27;s just like the one she always gets and definitely seems genuine.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I will rate this perfume a 5 because the product arrived quickly, was genuine and DOES smell good, but in reality I&#x27;d probably rate it a 4, only because it wears a little strangely with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> It also occasionally smells very strongly like play-doh, although sometimes I only get vanilla/rootbeer scents from this perfume.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was a little old-ladyish, but I grew to love the smell.</li>
            <li> Rich and lasting.</li>
            <li> It can be very cloying in warm weather, to the point where you feel kind of sick.</li>
            <li> IT CAN BE IMPROVED FOR HIGH SCENT WHICH CAN BE USED BY BOTH MEN AND WOMEN.</li>
            <li> If you get a little bit onto your sleeve, it will be a lovely scent that lasts until you wash it.  </li>
            <li> when a saleswoman at the mall asked if I wanted any fragrance samples, I asked her to give me whatever her favorite Poison was, and she handed me a little vial of the Hypnotic.</li>
            <li> and I was still able to smell it a little</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume hands down!</li>
            <li> Why was there no box when the product was sold as new</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula, in the new btl., and new box.</li>
            <li> I new this scent was a lighter than Poison.</li>
            <li> Around where we live the mall does not sell this version anymore</li>
            <li> This is my new signature scent.</li>
            <li> Everyone has different taste so you should try first before buying.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s lovely when you&#x27;ve been married long enough that each asks the other what they&#x27;d like for their anniversary (or Christmas, birthday, Ground Hog Day...)</li>
            <li> I was so impressed,I ordered the large bottle,and the next day it was on my doorstep.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll just pay a little more and buy it directly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, thanks, Dior - I finally found my &amp;#34;signature scent.&amp;#34; My nana had Chanel No. 5</li>
            <li> It has a soft chocolate smell.  </li>
            <li> I felt absolutely bereft when I could not get even a whisper out of the atomizer of my last bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m complimented on it quite frequently.  </li>
            <li> So soft, milky &amp; powdery.</li>
            <li> What I purchased was a copy, smell a little lighter (original stays with you longer)</li>
            <li> No, not really, not when you consider I&#x27;ve been looking for *years* for that &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34; every other woman seemed able to identify before she was 15.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little to sweet for me, but my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> I still smell it on me the next day and of course perfume has different scents on different skin types so for me it smells exactly like I remember years ago!</li>
            <li> The bottle is very different from the normal bottles and it smells...</li>
            <li> I purchased my last bottle from Amazon, which was $5 cheaper than the web site I normally buy from.  </li>
            <li> The bitter almond, cinnamon and vanilla smell absolutely divine on my skin, and this lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a bit heavy for me since I prefer fresh scents.</li>
            <li> It is alot more expensive than any other perfume I wear,but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> Still mild and not sure it can be smelled by others.</li>
            <li> The one that I got it&#x27;s fake; starting from the black box, and the smell is sooo light and doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 minutes...</li>
            <li> I buy my mom this perfume every year, usually from a store or right from Dior</li>
            <li> I was comforted when my new bottle arrived less than a week later.</li>
            <li> and she said the fragrance didn&#x27;t last as long as it should have.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance wears well and is very long lasting .</li>
            <li> tried it on myself and it stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> so she hadn&#x27;t had it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am still angry that I paid full price for a duplicate.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this and the scent will last all day.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s got a little something extra to make it smell sexier too.  </li>
            <li> The price of this perfume is outrageous (from any source), but I love the fragrance so much</li>
            <li> I took the cap off of my bottle that was almost empty and trashed the bent one.  </li>
            <li> Well, I spritzed it on my hand, and spent the rest of the day with my nose practically glued to it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only perfume that stays on me for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Amazon price beats all other online websites.</li>
            <li> I see other comments regarding a &amp;#34;play dough smell&amp;#34;, which my husband has mentioned, but I found (and read elsewhere) that it seems to be a combination of lotion and the perfume.</li>
            <li> Since that time, I have tried other fragrances but nothing else matches this hypnotic scent.  </li>
            <li> Usually, I get tired of using the same fragrance, but was still hooked on this, so recently ordered my second EDT spray.  </li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and getting difficult to find sometimes.</li>
            <li> Slightly musky, with almost an amaretto smell to it.</li>
            <li> but when I noticed Amazon sells it slightly cheaper</li>
            <li> I was worried because I read reviews with people saying it was weak or didn&#x27;t smell the same</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Nothing compared to the ORIGINAL one..  :(  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as heavy as I would have thought from the name.  </li>
            <li> I have a few favorites, but nothing can compare to Hypnotic Poison.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Although, not as much as i&#x27;d like, because it is very very expensive.</li>
            <li> For the past couple of years Dior has stopped making this</li>
            <li> Goes well with an expensive bottle of French wine and then use your imagination.</li>
            <li> Turned out a sales associate had just spritzed a fragrance card for another customer as we walked past the perfume counter.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long, was disappointed for what it cost.</li>
            <li> Hypnotic poison is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Truly, a scent with a subtle statement--use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> Packaging wasn&#x27;t difficult, nothing was wrong with it when I received it in the mail, which is something I worry about when ordering anything fragile online.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lot disappointed that that&#x27;s not what I did in the first place :(</li>
            <li> Dramatic?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years; drawback is it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive and when my husband bought if for me for Christmas</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, but one spritz will stay with you all day.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> 1st time I ever got wrong item</li>
            <li> my worst $85 spent...  :(</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive, but Amazon has it a bit cheaper so kudos!</li>

            <li> My Mom&#x27;s favorite!  Best price with this seller!  Thank You!</li>
            <li> Best perfume EVER!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple of years, and I believe it is perfect for every season. Love the scent and I love the way it lingers, especially on my clothes and hair. Love love love it.</li>
            <li> I will rate this perfume a 5 because the product arrived quickly, was genuine and DOES smell good, but in reality I&#x27;d probably rate it a 4, only because it wears a little strangely with my body chemistry. It can be very cloying in warm weather, to the point where you feel kind of sick. It also occasionally smells very strongly like play-doh, although sometimes I only get vanilla/rootbeer scents from this perfume. I recommend this perfume for night-time and winter wear. It is surprisingly strong and long-lasting for an EDT. It is a nice, warm, spicy, creamy scent, but it is not for everyone. Avoid this perfume if you do not like vanilla.</li>
            <li> Just a classic perfume with an excellent scent that lasts through the day. It&#x27;s one of those that my wife and I love. Amazon price beats all other online websites.</li>
            <li> The Dior poison line is the most complimentary scents, I have surrounded myself with. Exotic, mysterious, and very sensual. Hypnotic poison is hard to find. My favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doubting this isn&#x27;t a knock off. The bottle is very different from the normal bottles and it smells... Off... Next time I&#x27;ll just pay a little more and buy it directly. I&#x27;m a lot disappointed that that&#x27;s not what I did in the first place :(</li>
            <li> I love Hynotic Poison! I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years; drawback is it&#x27;s expensive.  I purchased my last bottle from Amazon, which was $5 cheaper than the web site I normally buy from.  What I purchased was a copy, smell a little lighter (original stays with you longer), bottle didn&#x27;t have gold ring on neck, cap didn&#x27;t fit.  I took the cap off of my bottle that was almost empty and trashed the bent one.  Bottle is darker, lettering was plainer. I am still angry that I paid full price for a duplicate.  I love Amazon, this is the only problem I&#x27;ve ever had with a purchase.  But I&#x27;ll never purchase this cologne again from here...</li>
            <li> my wife has been looking at this for a while so I got it for her as a surprise... she loves it!</li>
            <li> I discovered this scent about three years ago, I have loved it ever since. I always keep a bottle of this in my collection. I wear it for special occasions, when I want people to notice. I always receive a number of comments on this perfume.</li>
            <li> I like and happy with.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE FAGRANCE AND I WEAR IT ALL THE TIME.</li>
            <li> This perfume has an amazing, unique scent.  It is a very sweet and sensual smell.  I would describe it as a sweet almond or amaretto scent.  If you like food scents, you will like it.  But it&#x27;s got a little something extra to make it smell sexier too.  It lasts all day.  If you get a little bit onto your sleeve, it will be a lovely scent that lasts until you wash it.  I always get a ton of compliments on this scent.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume - it suits my wife wonderfully, and she always gets compliments on it wherever we go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little to sweet for me, but my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> I cannot agree more with all the reviews posted. This fragrance is amazing, distinct, and truly addicting. A must have!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  It is a great fragrance.  Came in a nice package.  I would definately repurchase.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it so much. she said that it is the best gift since marriage</li>
            <li> This has a very sensual, seductive smell to it. Slightly musky, with almost an amaretto smell to it. Not overpowering or old-lady-ish.  A little goes a long way with this and the scent will last all day. Great perfume to wear on a romantic evening, my guy loves the way it smells.</li>
            <li> She really likes it too!&lt;br /&gt;It works well with her body chemistry!&lt;br /&gt;It is nice to find things that work and helps the relationship hotness work so well!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  Beautiful scent. Have worn for over ten years. Hope they never stop making it. It is the best.</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME IS OKAY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SPRAY IS OKAY FOR WOMEN IN GENERAL. IT CAN BE IMPROVED FOR HIGH SCENT WHICH CAN BE USED BY BOTH MEN AND WOMEN. THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I BOUGT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS, SHE USES MINE ALL THE TIME, THE PRICE WAS GREAT,  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Love the smell, always use it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying it. Although, not as much as i&#x27;d like, because it is very very expensive. Sometimes its worth the treat. Brilliant packaging, bottle and spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like I remember, I&#x27;m so in love! I was worried because I read reviews with people saying it was weak or didn&#x27;t smell the same but it does! I still smell it on me the next day and of course perfume has different scents on different skin types so for me it smells exactly like I remember years ago! Favorite perfume hands down!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long, was disappointed for what it cost.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite for years! I love the sweet smell of vanilla and cherries.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Thank you great service!</li>
            <li> The recipient specifically asked for this perfume and is very happy with it.  She wears it all the time.  Her boyfriend likes it, too.</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied!!!!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this scent years ago and it is my favorite to wear. It is reasonably priced and getting difficult to find sometimes.</li>
            <li> Dramatic? No, not really, not when you consider I&#x27;ve been looking for *years* for that &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34; every other woman seemed able to identify before she was 15. I&#x27;ve always found the Poison bottles to be really lovely, so when a saleswoman at the mall asked if I wanted any fragrance samples, I asked her to give me whatever her favorite Poison was, and she handed me a little vial of the Hypnotic. Well, I spritzed it on my hand, and spent the rest of the day with my nose practically glued to it. I never thought I would like something with such a strong note of vanilla, but the other notes cut it with the perfect amount of spice, and it&#x27;s simply addictive! I really am absolutely in love with it and bought a full-size bottle within three weeks. It&#x27;s a wonderful contradiction - sexy and sweet, daring and yet comforting. It&#x27;s not for everyone, but I would definitely recommend giving it a shot next time you&#x27;re at the store - you just might fall in love with it like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, thanks, Dior - I finally found my &amp;#34;signature scent.&amp;#34; My nana had Chanel No. 5, my mom has YSL Opium, and now I have Dior Hypnotic Poison. I am one seriously happy camper. :)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume by Dior!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you love grounded tones of vanilla and musk that has a seductive and mysterious scent you will love this fragrance. For the past couple of years Dior has stopped making this and I have looked everywhere for something that even came close to the scent. No one has anything like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive and when my husband bought if for me for Christmas I was one happy woman!</li>
            <li> I have never bought a perfume without smelling it before, so I was taking a huge chance when I bought Hypnotic Poison. At first, I thought it was a little old-ladyish, but I grew to love the smell. Boys love it as well, and they will tend to tell you that you smell like a cookie, in a good way.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. Smells so good.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed,I ordered the large bottle,and the next day it was on my doorstep. It is alot more expensive than any other perfume I wear,but it&#x27;s so worth it. It has a completely unique smell,unlike anything else,and lasts all day long,unlike alot of perfumes that need to be re-applied throughout the day. This is hands down my favorite perfume,and is worth the money if you want to splurge. Dior describes this scent as vanilla with burnt almond,which doesnt sound all that great,but the scent is amazing. Ive been wearing this perfume for 10 years,and probably always will. 5 stars all the way</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite perfume.  It is very hard to find.  It has a soft chocolate smell.  I buy it when I can find it.  Sometimes I run out but eventually I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same poison I remember I used years ago.</li>
            <li> The product was fine.  The perfume did not come in a box.  Why was there no box when the product was sold as new</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a better fragrance that&#x27;s sweet and lasting.  I just wish the price would drop on this product, no matter where you go it&#x27;s expensive, but Amazon has it a bit cheaper so kudos!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only perfume that stays on me for a few hours. I get great compliments. Not flowery scent.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Package was the original box.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this brand! The perfume smells really nice and after 4 years of being an ardent user, I am yet not over it.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, was packaged perfectly, every time I wear it someone asks me what I&#x27;m wearing.  I want to lie.  But I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a scent my husband likes as well as me.  He likes heavier florals and I like clean, fresh scents.  We both liked this and I get compliments from strangers.  I have friends who wear it as well and they love it.  It isn&#x27;t as heavy as I would have thought from the name.  It&#x27;s really lovely.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume at a great price.  Arrived promptly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason strippers wear this perfume: it&#x27;s sexy. Scents do not usually last on me, but Hypnotic Poison does. Yes, it is expensive, but one spritz will stay with you all day.</li>
            <li> Great great n great......</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent! Warm, exotic, vanilla/cinnamon scent. Rich and lasting. If you like Givenchy Indecence, you will love Hypnotic Poison! One of the best gourmand fragrances out there.</li>
            <li> I felt absolutely bereft when I could not get even a whisper out of the atomizer of my last bottle. I was comforted when my new bottle arrived less than a week later. Hooray! I used it even for my weeding job...nice to smell great even if it is just for me.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful fragrance--niether flowery nor woodsy/plastic smelling.  Truly, a scent with a subtle statement--use it sparingly. I&#x27;m complimented on it quite frequently.  Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Everything with my purchase was fine, except for the shipping. They should advertize the fact that they have to ground ship anything that is flammable. Other than taking 3 weeks to get it the product is great.</li>
            <li> The delivery was timely, love the perfume!</li>
            <li> I got the wrong product.  It&#x27;s a Dior perfume but don&#x27;t like the smell at all.  1st time I ever got wrong item</li>
            <li> My favorite winter perfume. Warm sweet and sexy.</li>
            <li> The one that I got it&#x27;s fake; starting from the black box, and the smell is sooo light and doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 minutes...&lt;br /&gt;Nothing compared to the ORIGINAL one..  :(  my worst $85 spent...  :(</li>
            <li> This is an unforgettable fragrance - one of Dior&#x27;s best ( ADDICT is another standout ) and well worth the hefty price . Why ? It is :feminine, RICH, not overpowering , and sensual - VERY sensual . In spite of its sultry sexiness, the fragrance is very classy and sophisticated . The fragrance wears well and is very long lasting . I believe it is one of the best perfumes EVER formulated . Best word to to describe it : intoxicating .</li>
            <li> Only perfume I wear. I get compliments from women and men alike.. Nothing better in the world except love and chocolate</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as a gift and she said the fragrance didn&#x27;t last as long as it should have.  I had bought her this fragrance at the store three times before.  She said that this fragrance &amp;#34;did not last as long&amp;#34; as the store bought fragrance.  She said there was something different about it.  When I told her that I ordered it online on Amazon, she asked me not to get it (Hypnotic Poison perfume) there again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mum because hypnotic poison is her favourite perfume and it smells amazing got it for her for mothers day and she loves it</li>
            <li> Not as pictured, smell is much lighter. It&#x27;s the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula, in the new btl., and new box. NOT THE ONE PICTURED, WHICH WAS THE REASON I ORDERED IT. IF you get lucky, you&#x27;ll get the older stuff, I don&#x27;t care how it&#x27;s stored, it lasts a lifetime &amp; smells intoxicating &amp; irresistible.</li>
            <li> I have a few favorites, but nothing can compare to Hypnotic Poison. I have had many compliments. I see other comments regarding a &amp;#34;play dough smell&amp;#34;, which my husband has mentioned, but I found (and read elsewhere) that it seems to be a combination of lotion and the perfume. I do not think I will ever find a scent as awesome as Hypnotic...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance. I researched other sites for the lowest price and was surprised to find Amazon had the best price! My package arrived on schedule with no issues.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I originally fell in love with this fragrance when I smelled it on a friend.  Usually, I get tired of using the same fragrance, but was still hooked on this, so recently ordered my second EDT spray.  Hypnotic Poison has some vanilla, musk and other frangrances for an awesome blend.  You can spray it on in the morning and it will remain with you all day.  I also ordered the body lotion and just love the combination.</li>
            <li> I love gourmand fragrances, so Hypnotic Poison is right up my alley. The bitter almond, cinnamon and vanilla smell absolutely divine on my skin, and this lasts for hours. Definitely a warm scent that is perfect during winter months, but great all year long as well. If you like sweeter scents, you should definitely check this out.</li>
            <li> The price of this perfume is outrageous (from any source), but I love the fragrance so much I just try to shop when I have reward points on my Amazon Visa or a coupon. It&#x27;s the real thing and I definitely get tons of complements.</li>
            <li> This is my fave perfume ever, I la-la-la-love it!!!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite for many years.  I try others when given as gifts or using testers in the stores but I never am as happy with it as I am with this.  And the compliments from my friends about how I always smell so awesome clenches it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she looved it. I think it&#x27;s a bit heavy for me since I prefer fresh scents. But if you like vanilla-jasmine scents, you should give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on myself and it stays on for a long time. I had one puff on my wrist but it stayed on for a day, I had a shower and I was still able to smell it a little afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing was the fast shipping and very good packing for the product. I can say that I am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> I buy my mom this perfume every year, usually from a store or right from Dior but when I noticed Amazon sells it slightly cheaper and it&#x27;s Prime eligible, I decided to get it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom says it&#x27;s just like the one she always gets and definitely seems genuine. She loves this scent and I think it smells gorgeous on her.</li>
            <li> Sexy, sexy stuff, you ought to have to show I.D. to buy it:) It is the quintessential romantic scent. It smells like every deliscious thing to eat and then some. People will definitely notice this one and it is strictly for fall and winter evenings. Goes well with an expensive bottle of French wine and then use your imagination. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is a copy of Dior&#x27;s Hypnotic Poison. It smells close but it is not the luxury quality fragrance I believed I was buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this light scented perfume for years.  Anywhere I go, I get strangers complimenting me and asking the name.  Even a waiter, while seated with my boyfriend, asked for the name!  I love the body lotion, too, goes well together.</li>
            <li> Packaging wasn&#x27;t difficult, nothing was wrong with it when I received it in the mail, which is something I worry about when ordering anything fragile online. Definitely my favorite perfume &amp; I&#x27;ll be purchasing again next year.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!  I get a lot of complements on the vanilla smell.  Lasts through out the day.  The best!</li>
            <li> At first it smells better that the original poison.  But after it sits on skin for an hour, the original poison smells better and this smells week and nothing special.</li>
            <li> I new this scent was a lighter than Poison. I bought this in Perfume hoping it would be stronger. Still mild and not sure it can be smelled by others.</li>
            <li> It was mistake buying a perfume just by reading amazon reviews. Everyone has different taste so you should try first before buying.  Every one will not like vanilla fragrance. A word of warning, Amazon does not take returns of perfumes, it treats them as chemicals.</li>
            <li> When my wife wears this fragrance, she is irresistable!&lt;br /&gt;Truly, when you wear this you will receive attention and compliments all day. Nothing else has the attraction power like Hypnotic Poison.</li>
            <li> Not the same fragrance and lasts about 10 min.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Got my last bottle from sephora and loved it.  This stuff was not anything like it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my mother for Christmas. She was so happy she cried. Around where we live the mall does not sell this version anymore so she hadn&#x27;t had it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing! It is exotic, mysterious, and alluring, not to mention sexy to the max. Just put some on and walk pass that certain someone you want to notice you. Trust me, he will notice. This is my new signature scent.</li>
            <li> My husband discovered Hypnotic Poison on a trip to Paris two years ago and loved it.  Since that time, I have tried other fragrances but nothing else matches this hypnotic scent.  Love it!</li>
            <li> So soft, milky &amp; powdery. Very sexy but still appropriate for daytime wear. Sweet/tart apricot wrapped in coconut/vanilla/almond. Once had a guy tell me it smelled like \\&quot;sexy sunscreen\\&quot;.. haha.</li>
            <li> Years ago, my husband and I were walking through a department store when we were both stopped in our tracks by the most seductive, delectable fragrance either of us had ever smelled. Turned out a sales associate had just spritzed a fragrance card for another customer as we walked past the perfume counter. My husband bought a bottle on the spot and it has become one of two fragrances I have worn since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lovely when you&#x27;ve been married long enough that each asks the other what they&#x27;d like for their anniversary (or Christmas, birthday, Ground Hog Day...). This year, he asked and I answered with my request for this. And even though it&#x27;s been years and years, I still am asked what that wonderful fragrance is I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
