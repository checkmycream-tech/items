            <li>eye catching goes on smooth and stays on all day!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Oreal 24 hour eye shadow really STAYS on, the colors are beautiful and sparkly.</li>
            <li>Love the Shimmer to the Shadow.</li>
            <li>Love the sparkle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a stunning pigment and consistency.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and stays on until you take it off.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and pigmented and sparkly (who doesn&#x27;t love a good sparkle?)</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I was expecting,</li>
            <li>and you can easily smooth the creasing out with your finger and it looks good as new ,but</li>
            <li>The lasting power is great.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful pink champagne color.</li>
            <li>but, you may like it for the shimmer if u are looking for a very light shimmer soft look!</li>
            <li>Lovely color very natural yet</li>
            <li>I really like it!!</li>
            <li>This is a particularly nice product if your eyes are a bit deep set as mine are.</li>
            <li>shimmery there is pretty much no color at all to the shadow, it will be great to put under my brows or if you want to have a super natural no makeup look, with still having a little shimmer on your lids, I do have the bronzed shade , and I love it ,</li>
            <li>but super pretty and very wearable!</li>
            <li>very pretty and stands out, but not too much color for wearing on the job</li>
            <li>Exactly what I remembered.</li>
            <li>It adds a nice sparkle to other makeup and gives me lots of compliments.  </li>
            <li>it almost looks like a new penny type color, so I was excited because any copper like color really makes my eyes pop</li>
            <li>for Infallible eye shadows are: pretty much just that they do crease through out the day , not a ton</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s super soft and pigmented.</li>
            <li>i really like this shadow.</li>
            <li>but I really like this one and wear it a lot.</li>
            <li>I don think its brand new bc</li>
            <li>But it looks very natural and shimmers.</li>
            <li>This eye shadow came in sealed and exactly the same shade as pictured.</li>
            <li>Most eye shadows that have any sparkle in them usually end up all over my face.</li>
            <li>If you have gotten infallible e/s before you know they are generally metallic finish shadows and this one is very wearable.</li>
            <li>I love the color but this kind of shadow has a tendency to crease, which I hate.  </li>
            <li>pretty colors , lasts a really long time, I have had my bronzed color for about 4 months</li>
            <li>Soft sparkly shade.</li>
            <li>It looks like it will last for a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>This is cute for a real subtle look its a little too light for my liking seems almost clear to me</li>
            <li>Although I did end up finding a longer lasting brand of the same color with more shimmer for just a few dollars more at &#x27;MicaBeauty&#x27;, so that was a bit disappointing that I had already bought this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had this eye shadow for a long time now, use it frequently, and have barely made a dent in it.  </li>
            <li>and I use it pretty much everyday</li>

            <li> this is my favorite! I will never buy another eye shadow again.</li>

            <li> Soft sparkly shade. Not as strong as I was expecting, but I think the picture does do it justice. It doesn&#x27;t stay on all day, esp in the heat, but long enough to wear.</li>
            <li> Most eye shadows that have any sparkle in them usually end up all over my face. The L&#x27;Oreal 24 hour eye shadow really STAYS on, the colors are beautiful and sparkly. No under-eye sparkles. Great shadow. Have purchased additional colors.</li>
            <li> Great Color!!!Great Fall Brown color.  Love the Shimmer to the Shadow. Add&#x27;s definition to any eye color. Will be buying again!!!</li>
            <li> Love the sparkle.  It adds a nice sparkle to other makeup and gives me lots of compliments.  Plus, it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have this color yet but I love these eye shadows! It does last all day! The trick is put a little concealer on your lid then the shadow. It works great!</li>
            <li> a good color for work. very pretty and stands out, but not too much color for wearing on the job</li>
            <li> This is cute for a real subtle look its a little too light for my liking seems almost clear to me but, you may like it for the shimmer if u are looking for a very light shimmer soft look! Great for first time make up wearers like teens!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful pink champagne color. If you have gotten infallible e/s before you know they are generally metallic finish shadows and this one is very wearable. The shine seemed to fade after  few hours even with primer and that is why I knocked one star off but I really like this one and wear it a lot.</li>
            <li> Good and cheap! Perfect</li>
            <li> This color is a perfect neutral nude! The lasting power is great. And it&#x27;s super soft and pigmented.</li>
            <li> I love the color but this kind of shadow has a tendency to crease, which I hate.  I only took off one star because the creasing is probably just how my skin reacts to it.</li>
            <li> It hás the perfect color and sparkle!!! Realy perfect! It stays Very long! Loved it!!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my granddaughter.  She loves the product.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE! It&#x27;s a stunning pigment and consistency. I&#x27;m hooked. It&#x27;s a rosy gold with a shimmery look on the eye. Didn&#x27;t seem to crease and works well alone or with other shadows to create a smokey eye.</li>
            <li> very good, i love it. it is a great eye shadow and perfect as an undershadow before applying darker colors, it really shines all day.&lt;br /&gt;Great service from company.</li>
            <li> I really like it!! Although I did end up finding a longer lasting brand of the same color with more shimmer for just a few dollars more at &#x27;MicaBeauty&#x27;, so that was a bit disappointing that I had already bought this. But it looks very natural and shimmers. It is beautiful!!! It looks like it will last for a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> Product was loose and old not happy</li>
            <li> Exactly what I remembered. Excellent staying power and a great price. The color also gets a lot of compliments!</li>
            <li> This is a particularly nice product if your eyes are a bit deep set as mine are. It brings them out at the inner corner. The color is a bit lighter than the picture appears. It goes on easily and stays on until you take it off.</li>
            <li> I don think its brand new bc it wasnt sealed</li>
            <li> Lovely color very natural yet eye catching goes on smooth and stays on all day!</li>
