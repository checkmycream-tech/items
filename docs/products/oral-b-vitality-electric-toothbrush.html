            <li>Nice toothbrush....</li>
            <li>Nice handle.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the SonicCare for cleaning, operation, etc . . .</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get the buzz indicating to switch quadrants, but I can figure out when to move the toothbrush on my own.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own before recharging, again.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive but effective</li>
            <li>But otherwise it&#x27;s great and the price was right!</li>
            <li>easy use and good quality</li>
            <li>Super happy with this product.</li>
            <li>my husband is very strong and</li>
            <li>you can spend a lot more for a &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; model, but this one honestly does the job, and does it well....</li>
            <li>good power, retains charge well, comfortable brush</li>
            <li>Excellent price, love the new rectangular head, and holds a charge for weeks.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this item, and as usual from Amazon what a good bargain!</li>
            <li>Excellent toothbrush, will use no other!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush and my teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>And I wasn&#x27;t paid to say this lol ;)</li>
            <li>My first, the Oral B Vitality did a great cleaning job...</li>
            <li>My dentist is pleased with the condition of my teeth, and I credit this toothbrush as a helpful tool to keep my mouth healthy.  </li>
            <li>Why pay more when this one does the job well?</li>
            <li>The bristles are more flexible and softer.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums love it.</li>
            <li>The packaging is over the top.</li>
            <li>and I find it much better.</li>
            <li>Ok I wanted an inexpensive travel oral b unit.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me being more disciplined</li>
            <li>Way better than manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are softer, and I found that I brush my gums more with this toothbrush, so my gums are in better shape...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had especially for this price frame.</li>
            <li>We love these toothbrushes, although we prefer the brush heads with the spinning part and the brush bottom.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>you more than get your value from this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>We had the ones that used batteries, but the charger is so much more convenient.</li>
            <li>Great product at reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li>The brush seems to have more power than you would expect for cost.</li>
            <li>This is way better than what Walmart sale.</li>
            <li>I love the two minute timer.</li>
            <li>Dock is ok, there are no pins on it, which is interesting (&amp;#34;wireless&amp;#34; charging?).</li>
            <li>So I bought the same model again, for maybe 20 bucks, and it is performing perfectly.</li>
            <li>Many others go for $100 or more -- and what for?</li>
            <li>Works very well and looks attractive on our door.</li>
            <li>I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>these three give a better cleaning result than using one alone.  </li>
            <li>This is a great replacement and so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>love this tooth brush</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I think it will be OK.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads are certainly more affordable.    </li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Just be sure once it&#x27;s charged to unplug the charger, and let the brush run out on</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is ok...  </li>
            <li>Built in two&lt;br /&gt;minute timer to make sure you do your part.</li>
            <li>and my hygienist will be pleased.</li>
            <li>This is why most products have stands that curve downward (like the toothbrush is sitting on top of a dome).</li>
            <li>For the price, I guess this is ok, be warned,</li>
            <li>Good replacement for the older Vitality version, which my spouse also liked.</li>
            <li>Very intense cleaning, good if you are prone to plaque or staining.  </li>
            <li>leaves my mouth feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not uncomfortable or a problem, just surprising.</li>
            <li>Excellent product that recharges for many more years than expected.  </li>
            <li>Replaced our old one that had lasted a good 10 years or more!</li>
            <li>This new one from Amazon was about $30 and works just great.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this toothbrush has been great so far.</li>
            <li>So far it is great</li>
            <li>Probably the best 15 bucks I&#x27;ve spent.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush and a must for people with sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Really cleans teeth good.  </li>
            <li>Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Great for work and great for not pressing so hard like one does on a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my next checkup will be great.</li>
            <li>recommended using an electric toothbrush as a way to better clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for an easy way to help maintain your teeth, this product is for you.</li>
            <li>further it has a great cleaning effect on the teeth, it does better than a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth clean and my gums healthy</li>
            <li>It handles easily.</li>
            <li>Works great and love that use can use different types of brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Easy to plug in an use after charged.  </li>
            <li>One button for both on/off, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>It work like its a really high end toothbrush, my teeth haven&#x27;t felt this good in a while.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>and it is just fine as well.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a perfectly fine, no frills electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of dental care, this item is a pleasure to use as it stimulates my mouth as it freshens and cleans.</li>
            <li>It moves a longer distance back and forth and does a great job cleaning teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>and I got ours at the same time and his is great too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product by SKIL tools.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I actually enjoy and look forward to brushing my teeth with this.</li>
            <li>And when you buy this one it tell you which heads are available for this model.</li>
            <li>It is important too know how to use electric toothbrush, otherwise it can damage your gums.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s unless you think a toothbrush purchase is so important you&#x27;ll keep (and keep track of)</li>
            <li>The color changing head &amp; built in timer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Vitality Deep Sweep Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is great.  </li>
            <li>Easy to keep the brush and toothbrush head clean.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Terrific product; I expect to get many years of good use out of this one, as well.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Just as good as my old one</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the new brush.</li>
            <li>Very powerful</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is pretty nice, works good and does its job well enough.</li>
            <li>It is powerful, easy to charge, and does a fantastic job at doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>always use original replacement parts.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of power and my teeth feel really clean after using it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like I have visited the dentist because my teeth are so clean.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels invigorated and so clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, powerful,</li>
            <li>Using this brush does make your teeth and mouth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as my old Oral-B electric toothbrush, but not bad, and the price was right.</li>
            <li>and I get a fulL week of brushing on one charge.</li>
            <li>I bought a cheap buy again after transformer, just 15 RMB, and economical.</li>
            <li>Good price, solid product and nothing to fancy.</li>
            <li>For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can really make a better investment.</li>
            <li>When the time comes to replace the head you&#x27;re going to look at it, wonder if it&#x27;s even replaceable, see the seam at the bottom of the neck, and assume the whole top comes off.</li>
            <li>Vigorous brush action and nice shape.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me that (1)</li>
            <li>Overall, this toothbrush is the real deal; don&#x27;t let the price fool you, its great for what it was made for.</li>
            <li>I have no experience with other electric toothbrushes, but this model is excellent so far.</li>
            <li>The ones we had originally lasted about 6 yrs (two brushes used by 5 kids (obviously they each had their own toothbrush head)</li>
            <li>The first performed well, but was unsanitary (filled with mold), so I thought I would try this one.  </li>
            <li>The new Oral-B seems to be doing an OK job - it is just taking some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>works great, typically these machines die after 1 year, I am hoping this one lasts longer than the warranty.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and holds a charge very well.</li>
            <li>So inexpensive and exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li>Great little toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Had it for a week and love it so far.</li>
            <li>For the price, it was absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth twenty dollars.</li>
            <li>It has worked well, cleaning my teeth better than my old SpinBrush and SpinBrush Ultrasonic.  </li>
            <li>This one seems plenty powerful, and I like the size of the head.</li>
            <li>but I got used to it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the replaceable brushes that matter anyway, get the right ones that suit your needs.</li>
            <li>This gets the job done at the right price.</li>
            <li>Timer helps me brush for the right time.&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li>Could not believe how much power this one has and how clean my teeth are.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleased with the product since I first started using one like this nearly a year ago.</li>
            <li>This is the lazy mans&#x27;  toothbrush, does a great job of cleaning your teeth, all you have to do is move the handle.</li>
            <li>The charger is small which is great and the charge lasts for about 4 days.</li>
            <li>double action brush head does a good job..</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the fanciness of more expensive models but does what I need to at a great price.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never been cleaner between cleanings and it&#x27;s easy to keep the entire product clean.</li>
            <li>On the downside, it is kind of loud but for the 4-6  minutes a day that I use it I can handle a little noise to end up with super clean teeth!</li>
            <li>it came very fast and this is the first time I have used a electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Keep the charge very well!</li>
            <li>I got this as a replacement for an earlier one which had a better timer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not risking it by getting a different toothbrush that costs more.  </li>
            <li>At first I was worried I&#x27;d have to spend $100</li>
            <li>My dentist recently commented that he could tell I was taking care better care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I never look forward to going to the dentist, but I will be interested to see if my &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34; record still holds.  </li>
            <li>Much better than a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I had a Oral-B Vitality for a number of years and this one is more compact but with the same performance.</li>
            <li>you buy it, be aware of that...</li>
            <li>Needless to say I am best friends with my dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first one i have used a year, but all of the braun oral -b brushes has one problem, that is that water are going inside the mechanism from the head where the brushes click.</li>
            <li>Worked the first two times after I took it out of the package.  </li>
            <li>The product isn&#x27;t too bulky, and I like that the company has many different types of brush heads (sold separately) to suit your need.</li>
            <li>Just something to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>For the money, I&#x27;d probably just go with the SpinBrush Ultrasonic (works really well, too!)  </li>
            <li>Up one star ;-)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for an affordable electric toothbrush for a while now, and this is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>My first Vitality brush handle lasted eight years.</li>
            <li>Now she only wants me coming in once a year!!!!</li>
            <li>Works well Easier to us than a conventional brush and seems to clean the teeth better</li>
            <li>My teeth are left feeling very clean</li>
            <li>This new one is a bit rough but makes your teeth feeling super smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try the other brushes that available for this model.</li>
            <li>I like to remove the head and dry everything just to be safe and remove any moisture-loving bacteria.</li>
            <li>Just be sure and use a new head every three (3) same as you would change your toothbrush every 3 month.  </li>
            <li>As a dental hygiene major, we learned a lot about how beneficial it is to switch from regular toothbrushes to electric, and i can definitely say that it works significantly better!!</li>
            <li>It does do a good job cleaning, BUT the vibaration is way too hard, i;&#x27;d prefer a much gentler, softer cleaning</li>
            <li>It really cleans my teeth and gums, and leaves no remaining plaque.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush really cleans and massages my gums.</li>
            <li>It cut&#x27;s through those plastic packages like  butter as fast as you can move the tool.</li>
            <li>I would and do highly recommend their products to family and friends!</li>
            <li>the timer on it really helps me cause</li>
            <li>Really cleans up the teeth.</li>
            <li>but I really do.  </li>
            <li>Automatic timer two minutes - but no speed selections and can at times be very noisy.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>Feels like a massage in your mouth and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like my Braun.  </li>
            <li>thanks oral-b for elimination</li>
            <li>I was truly surprised by how powerful this brush is, so much so that my whole head vibrates during the cleaning.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that this comes with the charger, so I don&#x27;t have to replace batteries.</li>
            <li>I like the brush so much that my husband decided to get one, as well.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner now</li>
            <li>different brush heads will fit it.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>very vibrating in the mouth, and yes, b4 you pull this toothbrush out of your mouth, hit the STOP button otherwise toothpaste&lt;</li>
            <li>well, soft, you cannot do with this toothbrush, way too powerful.</li>
            <li>My husband needs the bigger brush than the old style, and he says it feels like it&#x27;s doing a better job.  </li>
            <li>It is important to fully discharge the battery about every six months in order to maintain a strong long lasting battery.  </li>
            <li>, This is my first time using this brand, i was very surprised at the quality of the construction and the performance of the brush for the price i paid.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell you much more on it, other than it arrived on time</li>
            <li>The new one works fine but came with a different brush head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting it again because my dentist said my teeth were incredibly clean for not getting regular cleanings like I&#x27;m supposed to.</li>
            <li>It is not expensive, but powerful enough to feel the difference after using the Conair Interpak electric brush.</li>
            <li>really everything except the relatively high cost of the replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li>the vibration IS like a jackhammer, not like my old Sonic one, they were very gentle,</li>
            <li>Overall it is good for introduction to electric toothbrushes, but I&#x27;m going to get more expensive one when this one brakes.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted to replaced a four year old Oral-B which I broke with carelessness.</li>
            <li>Obviously the technology has gotten a lot better in 16 years because although my last one worked well it was nothing compared to this one.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love this little toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this little guy.  </li>
            <li>We were so happy with how they worked &amp; how long they lasted, we just ordered the same brush and have no doubt these ones will also last several years.  </li>
            <li>the toothbrush is too powerful, but yes, you can feel the last 2 minute warning...</li>
            <li>GOOD BUY CONSIDERING THE OVERPRICED MODELS WITH UNNECESSARY FEATURES.</li>
            <li>Make sure to dry the ENTIRE brush after each use.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush was charged for the entire recommended charge time, and I left it off the charger every day for 7 days, and it still brushes my teeth just fine.</li>
            <li>What were you thinking Oral-B when you packaged this great toothbrush in such unfriendly and tough plastic.  </li>
            <li>I like this new design.</li>
            <li>Did not have to run to store to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>For years, my dental hygienist has told me that my teeth were in &amp;#34;very good, not perfect, but very good&amp;#34; condition before being cleaned.</li>
            <li>I was not really wanting to spend $40 or more on one knowing that my last inexpensive one lasted for 16 years!  </li>
            <li>This is my second one because I broke the charger on my first one and it was cheaper to replace over buying just a new charger.  </li>
            <li>It runs just a little bit weaker since the battery is low on day seven, but runs enough for a good brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether this is better for brushing, health-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, but most other toothbrushes don&#x27;t have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If should be intuitive, and if for some reason Braun doesn&#x27;t want to make it intuitive, they should imprint some arrows or simple wording on the neck such that the user can see how to do it by looking at the toothbrush, without a research project or a special tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are new for auto brush, do choose another gentler model, for it can&#x27;t be changed as frequently as a manual brush.</li>
            <li>Yes, I get a new toothbrush, but I&#x27;m feeling like I buy an old one.</li>
            <li>After using this toothbrush for a few months I find it to be just fine.  </li>
            <li>I was relieved when I came across this more simple option and it works just like the old one; hopefully it&#x27;ll last as long too!</li>
            <li>this brush worked to clear up some gingivitis where others wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Hmm...how old is the toothbrush?</li>
            <li>Loud.</li>
            <li>Going to use the old one as a travel brush.</li>
            <li>I had an old Oral-B electric toothbrush and after about 16 years it bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>After brushing, my teeth feel like they do after a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>soft* circles............</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen many other toothbrushes that are way more expensive.  </li>
            <li>At first, it was a little much</li>
            <li>1st time to shift into an auto brush,this brush is quite rude while working in my mouth, last month I bought another Oral-B for my dad, better for new hand and sensitive gum.</li>
            <li>This was better than I expected, since the first one we had died, and I mean died, the charger was no longer taking a charge to charge the tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I charged it the first time 16 hours (as indicated) and I only brushed my teeth 3 times before I had to charge it again.</li>
            <li>Feels solid and high quality.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in action between this reasonably priced Oral-B versus my old (more expensive) version.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>A little more rough than the Oral B I fried</li>
            <li>Quite fast, &amp; the multiple movements of the bristles leave my teeth feeling much cleaner than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>ove new products and when I get them I put them to the ultimate test within the 30 day trial.</li>
            <li>But I only paid $20 for it about 10 years ago, and I didn&#x27;t want to pay $100 for a new one now.  </li>
            <li>Buy generic replacement heads, it&#x27;s much cheaper (read reviews of generic product before purchasing).</li>
            <li>I did so much research on electric toothbrushes as this was my first electric toothbrush, and I was set on spending a lot more on one of the more expensive models, but looking back, all that time spent reading reviews was a waste of time as this tooth brush is what I was looking for all a long.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend&#x27;s last toothbrush developed an odor because he would leave the handpiece pretty wet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;(Yes, if you know what the special tool does, you can maybe use something else, maybe a small screwdriver, but you&#x27;re going to want three hands to do it.)</li>
            <li>Switched out the head of this for the more conventional round brush, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>but there was barely any.</li>
            <li>so I obviously can&#x27;t comment on longevity but as far as cleaning teeth....</li>
            <li>I bought this Oral-B toothbrush to replace my 7 year old Oral-B that finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>i feel less plaque on my teeth, for a better result use periogen oral rinse to destroy tartar and use a waterflosser to take of all of the plaque</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s messy and must have been designed for a very large mouth.  </li>
            <li>But, I like the brush head better on this than the little round oral-b ones.</li>
            <li>My old toothbrush finally bit the dust, and I chose a similar one to what I already had.  </li>
            <li>Chinese friends pay attention to, the toothbrush is 100 v to 130 v, domestic voltage can not be used directly, need to change the transformer.</li>
            <li>I have some minor gum disease and he thought this would help clear it up.</li>
            <li>It seems it loses charge quickly.</li>
            <li>I tried it for a few months, and my teeth just didn&#x27;t feel as clean, so I switched back to the other style.</li>

            <li> Great product, worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a very good toothbrush, is worth to recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrush....</li>
            <li> Nice handle.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the SonicCare for cleaning, operation, etc . . .</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get the buzz indicating to switch quadrants, but I can figure out when to move the toothbrush on my own.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own before recharging, again.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but effective</li>
            <li> But otherwise it&#x27;s great and the price was right!</li>
            <li> easy use and good quality</li>
            <li> Super happy with this product.</li>
            <li> my husband is very strong and</li>
            <li> you can spend a lot more for a &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; model, but this one honestly does the job, and does it well....</li>
            <li> good power, retains charge well, comfortable brush</li>
            <li> Excellent price, love the new rectangular head, and holds a charge for weeks.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with this item, and as usual from Amazon what a good bargain!</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush, will use no other!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush and my teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> And I wasn&#x27;t paid to say this lol ;)</li>
            <li> My first, the Oral B Vitality did a great cleaning job...</li>
            <li> My dentist is pleased with the condition of my teeth, and I credit this toothbrush as a helpful tool to keep my mouth healthy.  </li>
            <li> Why pay more when this one does the job well?</li>
            <li> The bristles are more flexible and softer.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums love it.</li>
            <li> The packaging is over the top.</li>
            <li> and I find it much better.</li>
            <li> Ok I wanted an inexpensive travel oral b unit.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me being more disciplined</li>
            <li> Way better than manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are softer, and I found that I brush my gums more with this toothbrush, so my gums are in better shape...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had especially for this price frame.</li>
            <li> We love these toothbrushes, although we prefer the brush heads with the spinning part and the brush bottom.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> you more than get your value from this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> We had the ones that used batteries, but the charger is so much more convenient.</li>
            <li> Great product at reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li> The brush seems to have more power than you would expect for cost.</li>
            <li> This is way better than what Walmart sale.</li>
            <li> I love the two minute timer.</li>
            <li> Dock is ok, there are no pins on it, which is interesting (&amp;#34;wireless&amp;#34; charging?).</li>
            <li> So I bought the same model again, for maybe 20 bucks, and it is performing perfectly.</li>
            <li> Many others go for $100 or more -- and what for?</li>
            <li> Works very well and looks attractive on our door.</li>
            <li> I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> these three give a better cleaning result than using one alone.  </li>
            <li> This is a great replacement and so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> love this tooth brush</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I think it will be OK.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads are certainly more affordable.    </li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Just be sure once it&#x27;s charged to unplug the charger, and let the brush run out on</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is ok...  </li>
            <li> Built in two&lt;br /&gt;minute timer to make sure you do your part.</li>
            <li> and my hygienist will be pleased.</li>
            <li> This is why most products have stands that curve downward (like the toothbrush is sitting on top of a dome).</li>
            <li> For the price, I guess this is ok, be warned,</li>
            <li> Good replacement for the older Vitality version, which my spouse also liked.</li>
            <li> Very intense cleaning, good if you are prone to plaque or staining.  </li>
            <li> leaves my mouth feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not uncomfortable or a problem, just surprising.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that recharges for many more years than expected.  </li>
            <li> Replaced our old one that had lasted a good 10 years or more!</li>
            <li> This new one from Amazon was about $30 and works just great.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this toothbrush has been great so far.</li>
            <li> So far it is great</li>
            <li> Probably the best 15 bucks I&#x27;ve spent.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush and a must for people with sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Really cleans teeth good.  </li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great for work and great for not pressing so hard like one does on a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my next checkup will be great.</li>
            <li> recommended using an electric toothbrush as a way to better clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for an easy way to help maintain your teeth, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> further it has a great cleaning effect on the teeth, it does better than a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth clean and my gums healthy</li>
            <li> It handles easily.</li>
            <li> Works great and love that use can use different types of brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Easy to plug in an use after charged.  </li>
            <li> One button for both on/off, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> It work like its a really high end toothbrush, my teeth haven&#x27;t felt this good in a while.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> and it is just fine as well.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a perfectly fine, no frills electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of dental care, this item is a pleasure to use as it stimulates my mouth as it freshens and cleans.</li>
            <li> It moves a longer distance back and forth and does a great job cleaning teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> and I got ours at the same time and his is great too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic product by SKIL tools.</li>
            <li> This fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I actually enjoy and look forward to brushing my teeth with this.</li>
            <li> And when you buy this one it tell you which heads are available for this model.</li>
            <li> It is important too know how to use electric toothbrush, otherwise it can damage your gums.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s unless you think a toothbrush purchase is so important you&#x27;ll keep (and keep track of)</li>
            <li> The color changing head &amp; built in timer is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Vitality Deep Sweep Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is great.  </li>
            <li> Easy to keep the brush and toothbrush head clean.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Terrific product; I expect to get many years of good use out of this one, as well.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Just as good as my old one</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the new brush.</li>
            <li> Very powerful</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is pretty nice, works good and does its job well enough.</li>
            <li> It is powerful, easy to charge, and does a fantastic job at doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> always use original replacement parts.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of power and my teeth feel really clean after using it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like I have visited the dentist because my teeth are so clean.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels invigorated and so clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, powerful,</li>
            <li> Using this brush does make your teeth and mouth feel clean.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as my old Oral-B electric toothbrush, but not bad, and the price was right.</li>
            <li> and I get a fulL week of brushing on one charge.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap buy again after transformer, just 15 RMB, and economical.</li>
            <li> Good price, solid product and nothing to fancy.</li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can really make a better investment.</li>
            <li> When the time comes to replace the head you&#x27;re going to look at it, wonder if it&#x27;s even replaceable, see the seam at the bottom of the neck, and assume the whole top comes off.</li>
            <li> Vigorous brush action and nice shape.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me that (1)</li>
            <li> Overall, this toothbrush is the real deal; don&#x27;t let the price fool you, its great for what it was made for.</li>
            <li> I have no experience with other electric toothbrushes, but this model is excellent so far.</li>
            <li> The ones we had originally lasted about 6 yrs (two brushes used by 5 kids (obviously they each had their own toothbrush head)</li>
            <li> The first performed well, but was unsanitary (filled with mold), so I thought I would try this one.  </li>
            <li> The new Oral-B seems to be doing an OK job - it is just taking some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> works great, typically these machines die after 1 year, I am hoping this one lasts longer than the warranty.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and holds a charge very well.</li>
            <li> So inexpensive and exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li> Great little toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Had it for a week and love it so far.</li>
            <li> For the price, it was absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth twenty dollars.</li>
            <li> It has worked well, cleaning my teeth better than my old SpinBrush and SpinBrush Ultrasonic.  </li>
            <li> This one seems plenty powerful, and I like the size of the head.</li>
            <li> but I got used to it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the replaceable brushes that matter anyway, get the right ones that suit your needs.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done at the right price.</li>
            <li> Timer helps me brush for the right time.&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li> Could not believe how much power this one has and how clean my teeth are.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with the product since I first started using one like this nearly a year ago.</li>
            <li> This is the lazy mans&#x27;  toothbrush, does a great job of cleaning your teeth, all you have to do is move the handle.</li>
            <li> The charger is small which is great and the charge lasts for about 4 days.</li>
            <li> double action brush head does a good job..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the fanciness of more expensive models but does what I need to at a great price.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been cleaner between cleanings and it&#x27;s easy to keep the entire product clean.</li>
            <li> On the downside, it is kind of loud but for the 4-6  minutes a day that I use it I can handle a little noise to end up with super clean teeth!</li>
            <li> it came very fast and this is the first time I have used a electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Keep the charge very well!</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for an earlier one which had a better timer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not risking it by getting a different toothbrush that costs more.  </li>
            <li> At first I was worried I&#x27;d have to spend $100</li>
            <li> My dentist recently commented that he could tell I was taking care better care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I never look forward to going to the dentist, but I will be interested to see if my &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34; record still holds.  </li>
            <li> Much better than a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had a Oral-B Vitality for a number of years and this one is more compact but with the same performance.</li>
            <li> you buy it, be aware of that...</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am best friends with my dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first one i have used a year, but all of the braun oral -b brushes has one problem, that is that water are going inside the mechanism from the head where the brushes click.</li>
            <li> Worked the first two times after I took it out of the package.  </li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t too bulky, and I like that the company has many different types of brush heads (sold separately) to suit your need.</li>
            <li> Just something to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> For the money, I&#x27;d probably just go with the SpinBrush Ultrasonic (works really well, too!)  </li>
            <li> Up one star ;-)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an affordable electric toothbrush for a while now, and this is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My first Vitality brush handle lasted eight years.</li>
            <li> Now she only wants me coming in once a year!!!!</li>
            <li> Works well Easier to us than a conventional brush and seems to clean the teeth better</li>
            <li> My teeth are left feeling very clean</li>
            <li> This new one is a bit rough but makes your teeth feeling super smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try the other brushes that available for this model.</li>
            <li> I like to remove the head and dry everything just to be safe and remove any moisture-loving bacteria.</li>
            <li> Just be sure and use a new head every three (3) same as you would change your toothbrush every 3 month.  </li>
            <li> As a dental hygiene major, we learned a lot about how beneficial it is to switch from regular toothbrushes to electric, and i can definitely say that it works significantly better!!</li>
            <li> It does do a good job cleaning, BUT the vibaration is way too hard, i;&#x27;d prefer a much gentler, softer cleaning</li>
            <li> It really cleans my teeth and gums, and leaves no remaining plaque.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really cleans and massages my gums.</li>
            <li> It cut&#x27;s through those plastic packages like  butter as fast as you can move the tool.</li>
            <li> I would and do highly recommend their products to family and friends!</li>
            <li> the timer on it really helps me cause</li>
            <li> Really cleans up the teeth.</li>
            <li> but I really do.  </li>
            <li> Automatic timer two minutes - but no speed selections and can at times be very noisy.</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> Feels like a massage in your mouth and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like my Braun.  </li>
            <li> thanks oral-b for elimination</li>
            <li> I was truly surprised by how powerful this brush is, so much so that my whole head vibrates during the cleaning.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that this comes with the charger, so I don&#x27;t have to replace batteries.</li>
            <li> I like the brush so much that my husband decided to get one, as well.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner now</li>
            <li> different brush heads will fit it.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> very vibrating in the mouth, and yes, b4 you pull this toothbrush out of your mouth, hit the STOP button otherwise toothpaste&lt;</li>
            <li> well, soft, you cannot do with this toothbrush, way too powerful.</li>
            <li> My husband needs the bigger brush than the old style, and he says it feels like it&#x27;s doing a better job.  </li>
            <li> It is important to fully discharge the battery about every six months in order to maintain a strong long lasting battery.  </li>
            <li> , This is my first time using this brand, i was very surprised at the quality of the construction and the performance of the brush for the price i paid.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell you much more on it, other than it arrived on time</li>
            <li> The new one works fine but came with a different brush head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting it again because my dentist said my teeth were incredibly clean for not getting regular cleanings like I&#x27;m supposed to.</li>
            <li> It is not expensive, but powerful enough to feel the difference after using the Conair Interpak electric brush.</li>
            <li> really everything except the relatively high cost of the replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li> the vibration IS like a jackhammer, not like my old Sonic one, they were very gentle,</li>
            <li> Overall it is good for introduction to electric toothbrushes, but I&#x27;m going to get more expensive one when this one brakes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted to replaced a four year old Oral-B which I broke with carelessness.</li>
            <li> Obviously the technology has gotten a lot better in 16 years because although my last one worked well it was nothing compared to this one.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this little toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this little guy.  </li>
            <li> We were so happy with how they worked &amp; how long they lasted, we just ordered the same brush and have no doubt these ones will also last several years.  </li>
            <li> the toothbrush is too powerful, but yes, you can feel the last 2 minute warning...</li>
            <li> GOOD BUY CONSIDERING THE OVERPRICED MODELS WITH UNNECESSARY FEATURES.</li>
            <li> Make sure to dry the ENTIRE brush after each use.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush was charged for the entire recommended charge time, and I left it off the charger every day for 7 days, and it still brushes my teeth just fine.</li>
            <li> What were you thinking Oral-B when you packaged this great toothbrush in such unfriendly and tough plastic.  </li>
            <li> I like this new design.</li>
            <li> Did not have to run to store to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> For years, my dental hygienist has told me that my teeth were in &amp;#34;very good, not perfect, but very good&amp;#34; condition before being cleaned.</li>
            <li> I was not really wanting to spend $40 or more on one knowing that my last inexpensive one lasted for 16 years!  </li>
            <li> This is my second one because I broke the charger on my first one and it was cheaper to replace over buying just a new charger.  </li>
            <li> It runs just a little bit weaker since the battery is low on day seven, but runs enough for a good brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether this is better for brushing, health-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but most other toothbrushes don&#x27;t have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If should be intuitive, and if for some reason Braun doesn&#x27;t want to make it intuitive, they should imprint some arrows or simple wording on the neck such that the user can see how to do it by looking at the toothbrush, without a research project or a special tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are new for auto brush, do choose another gentler model, for it can&#x27;t be changed as frequently as a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Yes, I get a new toothbrush, but I&#x27;m feeling like I buy an old one.</li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush for a few months I find it to be just fine.  </li>
            <li> I was relieved when I came across this more simple option and it works just like the old one; hopefully it&#x27;ll last as long too!</li>
            <li> this brush worked to clear up some gingivitis where others wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Hmm...how old is the toothbrush?</li>
            <li> Loud.</li>
            <li> Going to use the old one as a travel brush.</li>
            <li> I had an old Oral-B electric toothbrush and after about 16 years it bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> After brushing, my teeth feel like they do after a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> soft* circles............</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen many other toothbrushes that are way more expensive.  </li>
            <li> At first, it was a little much</li>
            <li> 1st time to shift into an auto brush,this brush is quite rude while working in my mouth, last month I bought another Oral-B for my dad, better for new hand and sensitive gum.</li>
            <li> This was better than I expected, since the first one we had died, and I mean died, the charger was no longer taking a charge to charge the tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I charged it the first time 16 hours (as indicated) and I only brushed my teeth 3 times before I had to charge it again.</li>
            <li> Feels solid and high quality.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in action between this reasonably priced Oral-B versus my old (more expensive) version.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> A little more rough than the Oral B I fried</li>
            <li> Quite fast, &amp; the multiple movements of the bristles leave my teeth feeling much cleaner than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> ove new products and when I get them I put them to the ultimate test within the 30 day trial.</li>
            <li> But I only paid $20 for it about 10 years ago, and I didn&#x27;t want to pay $100 for a new one now.  </li>
            <li> Buy generic replacement heads, it&#x27;s much cheaper (read reviews of generic product before purchasing).</li>
            <li> I did so much research on electric toothbrushes as this was my first electric toothbrush, and I was set on spending a lot more on one of the more expensive models, but looking back, all that time spent reading reviews was a waste of time as this tooth brush is what I was looking for all a long.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s last toothbrush developed an odor because he would leave the handpiece pretty wet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(Yes, if you know what the special tool does, you can maybe use something else, maybe a small screwdriver, but you&#x27;re going to want three hands to do it.)</li>
            <li> Switched out the head of this for the more conventional round brush, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> but there was barely any.</li>
            <li> so I obviously can&#x27;t comment on longevity but as far as cleaning teeth....</li>
            <li> I bought this Oral-B toothbrush to replace my 7 year old Oral-B that finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> i feel less plaque on my teeth, for a better result use periogen oral rinse to destroy tartar and use a waterflosser to take of all of the plaque</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy and must have been designed for a very large mouth.  </li>
            <li> But, I like the brush head better on this than the little round oral-b ones.</li>
            <li> My old toothbrush finally bit the dust, and I chose a similar one to what I already had.  </li>
            <li> Chinese friends pay attention to, the toothbrush is 100 v to 130 v, domestic voltage can not be used directly, need to change the transformer.</li>
            <li> I have some minor gum disease and he thought this would help clear it up.</li>
            <li> It seems it loses charge quickly.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a few months, and my teeth just didn&#x27;t feel as clean, so I switched back to the other style.</li>
            <li> the battery keeps charge longer than my other one though.the vitality brushes batteries don&#x27;t last as long as the older models.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a short period of time I find myself asking, &amp;#34;why didn&#x27;t I change to an electric toothbrush sooner?&amp;#34;  Satisfied base level electric toothbrush with the right price tag.</li>
            <li> A more expensive model we had used did not last very long.</li>
            <li> As a serious reviewer, I rarely ever give out &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; 5-Star and 1-Star ratings.</li>
            <li> this brush is a basic single function brush that does what the more expensive oral b brushes do without all the extras.</li>
            <li> I cannot even remember how long I had the last one.</li>
            <li> Hope it will last as long.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts long enough that my husband and I just take turns using the one charger.</li>
            <li> But last a long time.</li>
            <li> I like that the charger base is smaller than the old kind.</li>
            <li> My old one broke down after years of use.</li>
            <li> Is a very downside of the product because the charging is slow and the battery doesn&#x27;t last much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make no mistake,,, it&#x27;s less expensive than the top end and uses the same brush heads.</li>
            <li> I had the same exact model previously; it lasted at least 5 years, and finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> And if,I should loose it, I am not crying like I did when  I lost my $99 brush a few months back.</li>
            <li> My last oral B lasted 8 years, still works but has a huge crack in the base of the toothbrush from dropping it so much</li>
            <li> Wish I would have bought it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and at a very low price.</li>
            <li> I tend to daydream while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth and forget how long I&#x27;ve been brushing.  </li>
            <li> Works well so far, a few weeks of using it.  </li>
            <li> I never realized how long 2 minutes was!</li>
            <li> The brush head is a little bigger than I would like, but smaller replacement heads can be ordered.  </li>
            <li> After six years, it finally stopped recharging (which meant I had to start working harder!).  </li>
            <li> The engineers who designed the head decided it needs to drain (probably due to the double-action mechanism), so there are slot openings in the front and back of the head.</li>
            <li> However for this particular product, I&#x27;m feeling forced to make an exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought a couple for my son and I after my previous one finally died.  </li>
            <li> powerful little sucker!</li>
            <li> The tiny vibrations aren&#x27;t painful like other brushes i&#x27;ve used, and it leaves me feeling twice as clean as before!</li>
            <li> Bristles aren&#x27;t too soft or hard.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the brush head is a little big and it moves in different directions.</li>
            <li> If you feel trouble, buy high-end universal voltage model.</li>
            <li> If you like a rough brushing this is the toothbrush for you.</li>
            <li> worth the price but not excellent</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works as well as the traditional round toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it vibrates, but that was what I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes for a few years now-- about 3 generation&#x27;s worth and I have to say that this one is such a disappointment, especially coming from a company with a track record like Oral-B.</li>
            <li> So when you brush your teeth thenext day, or over the next few days, it starts to smell.</li>
            <li> it gives 4 beeps, the 30 sec ones in between, did not work.......</li>
            <li> You would think that Oral-B, with all of it&#x27;s innovations over the past few generations of electric toothbrushes behind them, would make these a little more acceptable size-wise.</li>
            <li> Since you&#x27;re putting this thing in your mouth, it&#x27;s not a far stretch to assume that spit (slightly thicker than water) will make it&#x27;s way in.</li>
            <li> and it was no better than the circular Oral that my dentist recommended later (about $50).</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a winner &amp; affordable.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I both have one, &amp; we won&#x27;t buy any other brand from now on.</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts 15 years like my other Oral B did.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nary a hint on the thing that the brushes can come off some other way.</li>
            <li> My other two each lasted three years.</li>
            <li> Other replacement Oral-B toothbrush heads work also.  </li>
            <li> Some people said it was to powerful and vibrated rough - SO WRONG!  </li>
            <li> The base is tiny compared to the bulky one on my last Oral-B, yet it is very well-balanced and it takes up little space on the glass shelf above the sink in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> In fact, we purchased these because his former Oral-B Vitality&lt;br /&gt;lasted at least six years.  </li>
            <li> Gets the job done but good grief!</li>
            <li> I think just like with any product, some people will love it, and some will hate it.</li>
            <li> so they got used 4 - 6X/day) and finally stopped fully charging &amp; running slowly.  </li>
            <li> But my old Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush was getting to the point where it didn&#x27;t run very long and seemed to be as tired as I usually feel in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I let it run down about twice a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will cut down on cavities and bring gum disease under control</li>
            <li> so when the battery ran down I decided to buy another one just like it.  </li>
            <li> Takes up less room on counter.  </li>
            <li> My previous Oral-B vitality lasted me seven years.</li>
            <li> Holy cow, does this toothbrush vibrate!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking about a slight buzzing sensation--</li>
            <li> I replaced the brush head with the type I previously used.</li>
            <li> I guess for less than $30 for this toothbrush</li>
            <li> It tends to send little bits of toothpaste flying when running.</li>
            <li> When I go for my cleaning, the dental hygienist always remarks on how little plaque I have on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For whatever reason(s) it took me a little while to adapt to this one after using my SonicCare Elite for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> I am a little concerned that the speed of the brush -- which can not be regulated -- may eventually damage the enamel.  </li>
            <li> I bought one in Germany (Braun&#x27;s home base) for about â‚¬ 17 ($ 20) and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> It gets deeper into your gums when angled properly (45 degrees towards the gumline) and rubbed lightly along the base of the teeth!!</li>
            <li> and it lasted me quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> I had a round spinning brush head and did not think I would like this brush head</li>
            <li> Dead on arrivial.....</li>
            <li> Using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It arrived a little late.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush but the packaging is AWFUL!  </li>
            <li> the biggest of all of my past electric toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a buzz that alerts you, but then you have to feel around for the button which is slippery and hard to locate sometimes.  </li>
            <li> at least that&#x27;s what my dentist says.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts at least a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this again in 7-8 years when my toothbrush loses the ability to recharge.</li>
            <li> High quality with charge base.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weird to get use to.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful what you&#x27;re cutting through.</li>
            <li> Approximately six</li>
            <li> A few weeks in, I started to notice there was a weird &amp;#34;breathy&amp;#34; smell to it, but excused it as an effect of the crazy vibrating motor within (maybe it was some lubricant grease in the motor or something).</li>
            <li> And, when water runs down the handle toward the base, sometimes the brush will stop then start up again, like it is &#x27;shorting&#x27; out.  </li>
            <li> Highly expensive (over $100) for handle alone</li>
            <li> Small base.  </li>
            <li> Your world will vibrate like crazy when it&#x27;s in your mouth.</li>
            <li> The replacement brush heads are expensive!  </li>
            <li> We have had very expensive rechargeable toothbrushes that breakdown or crack within a year.  </li>
            <li> you have to google or consult a youtube video to replace a toothbrush head, it&#x27;s an idiotic design.</li>
            <li> generics are very useless and bad for gums..</li>
            <li> that painful process from my life.</li>
            <li> because I hate going to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> brush motion too violent, gave away</li>
            <li> Since it is an &#x27;inductive&#x27; charging toothbrush, it doesn&#x27;t seem to like it when water gets to the base area.  </li>
            <li> When you stand the toothbrush up on it&#x27;s charger stand, residual water tends to drip to the base.</li>
            <li> Plus there is no &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; on the toothbrush, when you put brush on the base, saying it is charged....</li>
            <li> The battery though, is horrible.</li>
            <li> Simply terrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice toothbrush.... I&#x27;ve used them for years.... you can spend a lot more for a &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; model, but this one honestly does the job, and does it well.... highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have no experience with other electric toothbrushes, but this model is excellent so far. It really cleans my teeth and gums, and leaves no remaining plaque. I never got this result using a regular brush, no matter how aggressively I brushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price was great. Ergonomics are good. Makes me want to brush.</li>
            <li> Good replacement for the older Vitality version, which my spouse also liked.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works great.  My old toothbrush finally bit the dust, and I chose a similar one to what I already had.  My dentist is pleased with the condition of my teeth, and I credit this toothbrush as a helpful tool to keep my mouth healthy.  I&#x27;ve seen many other toothbrushes that are way more expensive.  Why pay more when this one does the job well?</li>
            <li> Dr. recommended it so I tried it.  It&#x27;s a little weird to get use to.  It makes my teeth feel like I just got them cleaned every day.  I like that part.</li>
            <li> friend is happy with it</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for me. I cannot even remember how long I had the last one. I love this little toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I changed over from an Oral B Pulsonic that lasted 5 1/2 years until the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. The Oral B Vitality Deep Sweep is an improvement in brush motion. It moves a longer distance back and forth and does a great job cleaning teeth and gums. The bristles are more flexible and softer. Very pleased with the new brush. Hope it will last as long. Update 2 months later: Best toothbrush i&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush but the packaging is AWFUL!  Lucky for me that (1) my husband is very strong and (2) he found a really big pair of scissors.  What were you thinking Oral-B when you packaged this great toothbrush in such unfriendly and tough plastic.  If there was a trick to getting into this package, we couldn&#x27;t find it.  It was just brute strength only.  My husband said, &amp;#34;whoever thought this up should be fired&amp;#34; and I totally agree.  It took us a combined ten minutes to open it.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my Dentist and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Item just arrived so I have not used it yet. It contained a paper that said &amp;#34;$10.00 in Total Savings&amp;#34; if you register, but the link does not work. It also contained a &amp;#34;$3.00 off coupon on one 3 count replacement brush heads&amp;#34;, but that expired last July. Hmm...how old is the toothbrush?</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really cleans and massages my gums. It is easy to use and holds a charge very well. The only thing you must remember is to turn it on after putting it in your mouth and turn it off before removing it from your mouth. It tends to send little bits of toothpaste flying when running. My teeth and gums love it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!! I will never buy a manual toothbrush again!! feel as if I just left the dentist every time I brush my teeth!</li>
            <li> So far so good. While I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of dental care, this item is a pleasure to use as it stimulates my mouth as it freshens and cleans.</li>
            <li> I bought this for all family members its really good. Keep the charge very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine about two years and it&#x27;s still going strong.  Even now, it can go two weeks without charging, but it does get slow.&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I got ours at the same time and his is great too.  In fact, we purchased these because his former Oral-B Vitality&lt;br /&gt;lasted at least six years.  We have had very expensive rechargeable toothbrushes that breakdown or crack within a year.  Never again.</li>
            <li> Really cleans teeth good.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> Great deal.  Cheaper than any where else.  Had one for a couple years and finally would not hold the charge.  Could not believe how much power this one has and how clean my teeth are.  Bought two, one for myseldpf and one for my husband.</li>
            <li> These work well.  I would tell my friends to get these.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done but good grief! The packaging is over the top. It took scissors, tearing, pulling, breaking nails--everything I had to get to the toothbrush through the packaging. Ridiculous. But once that gauntlet was run, I had what I wanted and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Love it!! It&#x27;s a well designed product and my mouth feels totally refreshed. I&#x27;m sure my next checkup will be great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a roto-dent that was sold by dentists 20 years ago. Highly expensive (over $100) for handle alone and it was no better than the circular Oral that my dentist recommended later (about $50). I&#x27;ve had that one for 15 years.  Now I&#x27;ve upgraded to this on my dentists suggestion and I find it much better. To the person that gave it a 2 star rating for the packaging alone; I agree about bubble wrapping but its here to stay and not a reflection on the product itself.  If packaging drives you nuts (like me and my cut fingers) check this product out on Amazon. I&#x27;ve had one since June 2011 and use it every week. It cut&#x27;s through those plastic packages like  butter as fast as you can move the tool. Just be careful what you&#x27;re cutting through. It will cut A LOT.  I&#x27;ve accidentally cut through owners manuals, tethers etc. It&#x27;s a fantastic product by SKIL tools. SKIL 2352-01 3.6-Volt Lithium-Ion Multi-Cutter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Ok I wanted an inexpensive travel oral b unit. This fit the bill. Great for one week trips. Charge it up before I go on biz trip and I get a fulL week of brushing on one charge. And if,I should loose it, I am not crying like I did when  I lost my $99 brush a few months back.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for one that just ran out of juice.  Excellent toothbrush, will use no other!</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Does a great job.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> The brush works well in cleaning off tarter and gum surfaces----excellent purchase--highly recommend</li>
            <li> Good product great for travel</li>
            <li> Chinese friends pay attention to, the toothbrush is 100 v to 130 v, domestic voltage can not be used directly, need to change the transformer. If you feel trouble, buy high-end universal voltage model. I bought a cheap buy again after transformer, just 15 RMB, and economical. All in all, this is a very good toothbrush, is worth to recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for an earlier one which had a better timer.&lt;br /&gt;This one only has a 2 minute timer instead of 4 30 second intervals, if I had realized that I  would not have bought it.</li>
            <li> I had it maybe two months tops and it stopped working. It won&#x27;t recharge. Will probably see if I can still get my money back on it. I definitely won&#x27;t purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Feels like I have a cleaning at the dentist two times per d&lt;br /&gt;at!</li>
            <li> It was the wrong power source, it cost most to convert it into my local power source ie 110-220 watts&lt;br /&gt;Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> Last one of these kept working for 8 years. Brushed 3 times a day and replaced head regularly. Oh and don&#x27;t forget to fully discharge and recharge the battery from time to time.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my g/f and she loves it.. Good price, solid product and nothing to fancy.</li>
            <li> Got this toothbrush once before and it lasted me quite a few years.  Approximately six and then it died out.  I&#x27;m getting it again because my dentist said my teeth were incredibly clean for not getting regular cleanings like I&#x27;m supposed to. She was dreading cleaning a bunch of plaque but there was barely any. Now she only wants me coming in once a year!!!! GOOD because I hate going to the dentist.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me being more disciplined but I&#x27;m not risking it by getting a different toothbrush that costs more.  This one does the trick for the awesome price.  And I wasn&#x27;t paid to say this lol ;)</li>
            <li> I have been using this same product for about 4 or 5 years and it is still working, however now, the recharging process is finally starting to malfunction. So, after its record of faithful service I decided to order another. I would and do highly recommend their products to family and friends!</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush.  Works with about six different tooth brush heads. Versatile.</li>
            <li> Works well Easier to us than a conventional brush and seems to clean the teeth better</li>
            <li> Way better than manual toothbrush. Feels solid and high quality. My teeth are left feeling very clean and I actually enjoy and look forward to brushing my teeth with this.</li>
            <li> Works great will buy another when needed</li>
            <li> Feels like I&#x27;ve just gone to dentist for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Love this.  My teeth feel great!</li>
            <li> Great rechargeable electric toothbrush. Cleans teeth well. Charge last for several days (5-7)  before needing to be recharged. 2 minute timer lets you know when you&#x27;ve brushed sufficiently enough.</li>
            <li> Replaced our old one that had lasted a good 10 years or more! At first I was worried I&#x27;d have to spend $100+ since most I searched for were $60 and way over! I was relieved when I came across this more simple option and it works just like the old one; hopefully it&#x27;ll last as long too!</li>
            <li> Loud. But, I like the brush head better on this than the little round oral-b ones. The brushes are softer, and I found that I brush my gums more with this toothbrush, so my gums are in better shape... at least that&#x27;s what my dentist says.</li>
            <li> Splatters toothpaste all over the walls and mirror because of the way the brushes flap.  Wish I&#x27;d purchased a different model, like the one I used to have.</li>
            <li> Switched out the head of this for the more conventional round brush, which I prefer. Other than that, it&#x27;s a winner &amp; affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this it&#x27;s the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had especially for this price frame. It work like its a really high end toothbrush, my teeth haven&#x27;t felt this good in a while. Since I got it I&#x27;ve been brushing twice a day and the timer on it really helps me cause before I know I wasn&#x27;t brushing for two minutes. I&#x27;m excited to try the other brushes that available for this model. And when you buy this one it tell you which heads are available for this model.</li>
            <li> We love these toothbrushes, although we prefer the brush heads with the spinning part and the brush bottom. I&#x27;ve been using these for over 10 years and always get praise from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I will probably never know why some of these Oral-B machines are in the $ 20 range and others over $ 100. I bought one in Germany (Braun&#x27;s home base) for about â‚¬ 17 ($ 20) and it works just fine. So I got one for the 110V world (different charger) for $ 25 and it is just fine as well. It&#x27;s the replaceable brushes that matter anyway, get the right ones that suit your needs.</li>
            <li> My husband needs the bigger brush than the old style, and he says it feels like it&#x27;s doing a better job.  I like that the charger base is smaller than the old kind.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Great dental checkups for over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;Use with a Water-pick.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!  Excellent price, love the new rectangular head, and holds a charge for weeks.  Definitely would buy again!</li>
            <li> Excellent electric toothbrush. Wish I would have bought it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Love it. My old one broke down after years of use. Good reliable product.</li>
            <li> So inexpensive and exactly what I needed!  Have owned one (another brand) which was twice as pricey, like this one as well</li>
            <li> Very good toothbrush. My dentist recommended it</li>
            <li> good to useï¼Œjust need to prevent from throwing out the toothpaste</li>
            <li> Best dog toothbrush ever. I have been using electric toothbrushes to brush my dog&#x27;s teeth. This is a powerhouse toothbrush.</li>
            <li> brush motion too violent, gave away</li>
            <li> I like this new design. Really cleans up the teeth. And that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  Price is perfect.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a short period of time I find myself asking, &amp;#34;why didn&#x27;t I change to an electric toothbrush sooner?&amp;#34;  Satisfied base level electric toothbrush with the right price tag.</li>
            <li> I did so much research on electric toothbrushes as this was my first electric toothbrush, and I was set on spending a lot more on one of the more expensive models, but looking back, all that time spent reading reviews was a waste of time as this tooth brush is what I was looking for all a long. It is powerful, easy to charge, and does a fantastic job at doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I take the brush head off every week or so and wipe the metal on the brush so that no rust or corrosion occurs since the brush is constantly exposed to water. My dentist recently commented that he could tell I was taking care better care of my teeth. For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can really make a better investment. Overall, this toothbrush is the real deal; don&#x27;t let the price fool you, its great for what it was made for.</li>
            <li> Had it for a week and love it so far. Leaves your mouth and gums feeling great. Bristles aren&#x27;t too soft or hard. Vibration is perfect and it is a good size.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son he use every day and works great he is happy</li>
            <li> Great little toothbrush. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> ove new products and when I get them I put them to the ultimate test within the 30 day trial. This toothbrush was charged for the entire recommended charge time, and I left it off the charger every day for 7 days, and it still brushes my teeth just fine. It runs just a little bit weaker since the battery is low on day seven, but runs enough for a good brushing. For the price, it was absolutely worth it. My teeth feel cleaner and I didn&#x27;t have to spend $80-$100 on an electric toothbrush. I think just like with any product, some people will love it, and some will hate it. I went from a regular toothbrush to this, and it does what I need. If I&#x27;m gone for 4 or 5 days, I don&#x27;t throw the charger in my bag at all, and just bring my brush. If your debating, I say pull the trigger and try it. It&#x27;s only $30.</li>
            <li> I like the brush motion.  I had a round spinning brush head and did not think I would like this brush head but I really do.  It is a great brush for under $30.</li>
            <li> For years, my dental hygienist has told me that my teeth were in &amp;#34;very good, not perfect, but very good&amp;#34; condition before being cleaned. Our discussion came to the conclusion that it was my use of an electric toothbrush that was the reason. But my old Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush was getting to the point where it didn&#x27;t run very long and seemed to be as tired as I usually feel in the morning.  But I only paid $20 for it about 10 years ago, and I didn&#x27;t want to pay $100 for a new one now.  This new one from Amazon was about $30 and works just great. I never look forward to going to the dentist, but I will be interested to see if my &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34; record still holds.  It works great and didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> Great product, worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> double action brush head does a good job..</li>
            <li> Great product. I have bought one for each family member.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH!! As a dental hygiene major, we learned a lot about how beneficial it is to switch from regular toothbrushes to electric, and i can definitely say that it works significantly better!! It gets deeper into your gums when angled properly (45 degrees towards the gumline) and rubbed lightly along the base of the teeth!! The tiny vibrations aren&#x27;t painful like other brushes i&#x27;ve used, and it leaves me feeling twice as clean as before!</li>
            <li> Ease of use for physically challenged persons.</li>
            <li> A wonderful toothbrush. It has a lot of power and my teeth feel really clean after using it.</li>
            <li> My kids use these.  The ones we had originally lasted about 6 yrs (two brushes used by 5 kids (obviously they each had their own toothbrush head) so they got used 4 - 6X/day) and finally stopped fully charging &amp; running slowly.  We were so happy with how they worked &amp; how long they lasted, we just ordered the same brush and have no doubt these ones will also last several years.  The brush heads are a subscribe &amp; save item so we have them on auto-delivery for every 3 mos (as recommended by our dentist).</li>
            <li> If you like a rough brushing this is the toothbrush for you. My last oral B lasted 8 years, still works but has a huge crack in the base of the toothbrush from dropping it so much, figured it was time to upgrade. Going to use the old one as a travel brush. This new one is a bit rough but makes your teeth feeling super smooth and clean. Great on the gums. For what I paid for this it&#x27;s great for me.</li>
            <li> No issues at all. The brush rotation feels excellent on my teeth.  The last time I bought an Oral-B electric toothbrush it lasted for 5 years.  For $28 you more than get your value from this product. Very happy (and returning) customer.</li>
            <li> Very good toothbrush for the money. Definitely a good value and it is priced competitively on Amazon.com. Automatic timer two minutes - but no speed selections and can at times be very noisy.</li>
            <li> Damn good!!  You can do without flossing if you get the hang of it!!.</li>
            <li> A little more rough than the Oral B I fried but it does the trick and I didn&#x27;t have to mortgage the farm to buy one!</li>
            <li> For the money very nice........</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheaper, the only problem for us is that we need to buy a transformer if we want to use it.</li>
            <li> It seems it loses charge quickly.</li>
            <li> good power, retains charge well, comfortable brush</li>
            <li> just 2 months working. He was losing strength until stopped. Not recommended. I will give a star</li>
            <li> Small base.  Takes up less room on counter.  Nice handle.  Good feel.</li>
            <li> Cleans great, would give 5 stars but vibration is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> this brush worked to clear up some gingivitis where others wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works really well and it stays charged for a while.</li>
            <li> Great I use this every day</li>
            <li> Works as expected and at a very low price. Much better than a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works great. We had the ones that used batteries, but the charger is so much more convenient. The charge lasts long enough that my husband and I just take turns using the one charger.</li>
            <li> it is a wonderfull machine for my tooths</li>
            <li> I had a Oral-B Vitality for a number of years and this one is more compact but with the same performance.</li>
            <li> Feels like a massage in your mouth and cleans very well. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Like these tooth brushes.hope the battery keeps charge longer than my other one though.the vitality brushes batteries don&#x27;t last as long as the older models.</li>
            <li> The base is tiny compared to the bulky one on my last Oral-B, yet it is very well-balanced and it takes up little space on the glass shelf above the sink in my small bathroom. It&#x27;s a rather basic electric brush -- few bells or whistles -- but does everything I need it to do, and very well.</li>
            <li> Great product at reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Buy generic replacement heads, it&#x27;s much cheaper (read reviews of generic product before purchasing).</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush for the price. The brush seems to have more power than you would expect for cost. Seems to do a good job of maintaining dental hygiene</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is pretty nice, works good and does its job well enough. The battery though, is horrible. Simply terrible! I charged it the first time 16 hours (as indicated) and I only brushed my teeth 3 times before I had to charge it again. Batter barely last over a day. Is a very downside of the product because the charging is slow and the battery doesn&#x27;t last much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy it, be aware of that...</li>
            <li> works great, typically these machines die after 1 year, I am hoping this one lasts longer than the warranty.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I EVER had! Quite fast, &amp; the multiple movements of the bristles leave my teeth feeling much cleaner than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned. My husband &amp; I both have one, &amp; we won&#x27;t buy any other brand from now on.</li>
            <li> Great for the price! Would definately buy again!</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is great! Every time I brush my teeth it&#x27;s like I have visited the dentist because my teeth are so clean. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would give this five stars if it came with a travel case. Otherwise, it fits my needs perfectly. Light and easy to use. No problems!</li>
            <li> Husband love this!  Can&#x27;t tell you much more on it, other than it arrived on time and he is happy with it.</li>
            <li> OMG ! This is way better than what Walmart sale.</li>
            <li> Great price/value. Happy with how well it works and the availability of inexpensive replacement heads.</li>
            <li> My previous Oral-B vitality lasted me seven years. I think that&#x27;s a great investment for an $18 toothbrush. And I bet the only reason it quit is because I started using generic replacement heads. That&#x27;s when the problems started. Anyway, this toothbrush has been great so far. I love the two minute timer. And I have since ordered an additional two toothbrushes for each of my kids.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this item, and as usual from Amazon what a good bargain!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Works well, good value for the cost. A more expensive model we had used did not last very long. Will see how this one fares.</li>
            <li> this is the 2nd electric toothbrush I have owned.  The first performed well, but was unsanitary (filled with mold), so I thought I would try this one.  It&#x27;s a bit rougher in the mouth but my teeth actually feel cleaner (and no mold!).  The reason I docked it a star is that it does not shut off after 2 minutes.  There is a buzz that alerts you, but then you have to feel around for the button which is slippery and hard to locate sometimes.  It&#x27;s still a pain after one month so I may have to consider that when I purchase again.  But otherwise it&#x27;s great and the price was right!</li>
            <li> Works well. Wider than it looks on the image, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. It has a timer that vibrates only once after 2 minutes. It does not vibrate every 30 seconds. Dock is ok, there are no pins on it, which is interesting (&amp;#34;wireless&amp;#34; charging?). There&#x27;s only one way to know if the toothbrush charging or not, and that is to click the button when it is on the dock; if it turns on then it it not charging, it if doesn&#x27;t start to vibrate then it is plugged properly. It is important too know how to use electric toothbrush, otherwise it can damage your gums. Overall it is good for introduction to electric toothbrushes, but I&#x27;m going to get more expensive one when this one brakes.</li>
            <li> I use both a Sonicare and the Braun.... I REALLY like my Braun.  Easy to hold, gives good signals, battery life is great...  Makes brushing a pleasure.  Gets the job well done.....dentist agrees!</li>
            <li> Some people said it was to powerful and vibrated rough - SO WRONG!  I love this little guy.  My mouth feels invigorated and so clean.  I highly recommend this one.  Hope it lasts 15 years like my other Oral B did.</li>
            <li> Great product.  With a great price.  It arrived a little late.</li>
            <li> cleans so well.. don&#x27;t need to get my teeth cleaned at the dentist anymore. thanks oral-b for elimination that painful process from my life. always use original replacement parts. generics are very useless and bad for gums.. price is great as well..</li>
            <li> Good value. Works great.</li>
            <li> worth the price but not excellent</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush on the recommendation of my dentist. I have some minor gum disease and he thought this would help clear it up. I was truly surprised by how powerful this brush is, so much so that my whole head vibrates during the cleaning. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable or a problem, just surprising. I really appreciate that this comes with the charger, so I don&#x27;t have to replace batteries. It also comes with an additional brush head. I like the 2 minute timer feature so I know when to stop brushing. I like the brush so much that my husband decided to get one, as well.</li>
            <li> easy use and good quality</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain for this price. So far it is great</li>
            <li> Damn good toothbrush at an amazing price. I had the same exact model previously; it lasted at least 5 years, and finally gave up the ghost. It does not owe me a penny. So I bought the same model again, for maybe 20 bucks, and it is performing perfectly. Many others go for $100 or more -- and what for? Terrific product; I expect to get many years of good use out of this one, as well.</li>
            <li> Works very well and looks attractive on our door.</li>
            <li> When the time comes to replace the head you&#x27;re going to look at it, wonder if it&#x27;s even replaceable, see the seam at the bottom of the neck, and assume the whole top comes off. That&#x27;s the only hint you&#x27;ll see. Then you&#x27;ll break it. There&#x27;s nary a hint on the thing that the brushes can come off some other way. If indeed they can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So avoid this like the plague (or plaque!). That&#x27;s unless you think a toothbrush purchase is so important you&#x27;ll keep (and keep track of) the package (instructions (!!) printed on back), which you&#x27;ll have trashed getting the brush out, and the &amp;#34;special tool.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have to google or consult a youtube video to replace a toothbrush head, it&#x27;s an idiotic design. If should be intuitive, and if for some reason Braun doesn&#x27;t want to make it intuitive, they should imprint some arrows or simple wording on the neck such that the user can see how to do it by looking at the toothbrush, without a research project or a special tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Yes, if you know what the special tool does, you can maybe use something else, maybe a small screwdriver, but you&#x27;re going to want three hands to do it.)</li>
            <li> wonderful product and at a good price</li>
            <li> Great for work and great for not pressing so hard like one does on a manual toothbrush.  There is no overcharging.  I just leave it in the charger and connected in the wall along with my cell phone and waterpic.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Very intense cleaning, good if you are prone to plaque or staining.  Charge lasts at least a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth twenty dollars. I had the pro before and I got spoiled.</li>
            <li> I had an old Oral-B electric toothbrush and after about 16 years it bit the dust.  I looked at a bunch of different electric toothbrushes and decided to give this one a try.  I was not really wanting to spend $40 or more on one knowing that my last inexpensive one lasted for 16 years!  Well, I have only had it a short amount of time so I obviously can&#x27;t comment on longevity but as far as cleaning teeth....this toothbrush ROCKS!  Obviously the technology has gotten a lot better in 16 years because although my last one worked well it was nothing compared to this one.  After brushing, my teeth feel like they do after a professional cleaning.  I went to a movie yesterday (popcorn and all) and when I got back I brushed my teeth and it even managed to get some popcorn hulls out that I didn&#x27;t even know were stuck!  On the downside, it is kind of loud but for the 4-6  minutes a day that I use it I can handle a little noise to end up with super clean teeth!</li>
            <li> The tooth brush arrived on time and in good condition,great product and a good price.</li>
            <li> Just what the dentist ordered!</li>
            <li> Dead on arrivial.....</li>
            <li> Great motion, almost makes you want to brush your teeth!</li>
            <li> Even though I am meticulous about taking care of my teeth, I still have problems and have had to have multiple root canals and dental implants.  Needless to say I am best friends with my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He recommended using an electric toothbrush as a way to better clean my teeth.  He also said that it&#x27;s not necessary to spend a lot of money on a fancy electric toothbrush since a basic one like this will do the job just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works! Since I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day, I haven&#x27;t had any  problems with my teeth.  When I go for my cleaning, the dental hygienist always remarks on how little plaque I have on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s sturdy and it lasts for several years.  I keep in in the recharger, so it&#x27;s charging all the time.  I let it run down about twice a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The 2 minute timer.  I tend to daydream while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth and forget how long I&#x27;ve been brushing.  For optimal results, you should brush 15 seconds in each quadrant for a total of 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an easy way to help maintain your teeth, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> this is my second braun vitality. the first one i have used a year, but all of the braun oral -b brushes has one problem, that is that water are going inside the mechanism from the head where the brushes click. further it has a great cleaning effect on the teeth, it does better than a toothbrush. i feel less plaque on my teeth, for a better result use periogen oral rinse to destroy tartar and use a waterflosser to take of all of the plaque but i am rating this item on a 4 star, cause it has not a longer life. these three give a better cleaning result than using one alone.  do not buy expensive electric toothbrushes , do not spend more than $ 25  i am taking of my stars cause on 2 may 2015 it died. had bought it in november 2014</li>
            <li> Does the job. Very easy to use!</li>
            <li> My husband was happy with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this Oral-B toothbrush to replace my 7 year old Oral-B that finally bit the dust.  Excellent product that recharges for many more years than expected.  The company website states that the battery should last for over a year and I proved them correct on that fact.  It is important to fully discharge the battery about every six months in order to maintain a strong long lasting battery.  Amazon provides the best price on this product in addition to speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> good battery life, timer is handy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this electric toothbrush for my Grandson.  I have used one for 30 years.  It is great.  Just be sure and use a new head every three (3) same as you would change your toothbrush every 3 month.  It will cut down on cavities and bring gum disease under control is you have any.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter the day she got her braces off and she uses it every day. She even takes it with her on days away from the house.  Quality product.</li>
            <li> 1st time to shift into an auto brush,this brush is quite rude while working in my mouth, last month I bought another Oral-B for my dad, better for new hand and sensitive gum.If you are new for auto brush, do choose another gentler model, for it can&#x27;t be changed as frequently as a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Worked the first two times after I took it out of the package.  Never again.  Need to return.  Watch for this, the package came with a coupon that expired in 2014.  Age may or may not had had anything to do with my issue.  You decide.</li>
            <li> Since using this I always get good reports from my dentist.  Keeps my teeth clean and my gums healthy</li>
            <li> My SonicCare crapped out after 7years.  This is a great replacement and so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> My second purchase of this toothbrush.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works as well as the traditional round toothbrush head.  I tried it for a few months, and my teeth just didn&#x27;t feel as clean, so I switched back to the other style.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great for travel.</li>
            <li> Perfect for home and travel</li>
            <li> love this tooth brush</li>
            <li> This is my second one because I broke the charger on my first one and it was cheaper to replace over buying just a new charger.  I&#x27;ve been pleased with the product since I first started using one like this nearly a year ago.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t tell me it can not be used in China.</li>
            <li> Love this. Made such a difference in teeth cleaning appts. Bought one for each house</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t too bulky, and I like that the company has many different types of brush heads (sold separately) to suit your need. The color changing head &amp; built in timer is fantastic. I never realized how long 2 minutes was!</li>
            <li> Vigorous brush action and nice shape.</li>
            <li> A great upgrade from my battery operated toothbrush.  Holds a charge for about a week.  Easy to use, powerful, leaves my mouth feeling very clean.  The brush head is a little bigger than I would like, but smaller replacement heads can be ordered.  Tip:  Make sure to dry the ENTIRE brush after each use.  My boyfriend&#x27;s last toothbrush developed an odor because he would leave the handpiece pretty wet.  I like to remove the head and dry everything just to be safe and remove any moisture-loving bacteria.</li>
            <li> My dental assistant recommended this toothbrush to me when I told her I couldn&#x27;t afford the $100 one they were selling at the office.  It has worked well, cleaning my teeth better than my old SpinBrush and SpinBrush Ultrasonic.  So why &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; four stars?  The replacement brush heads are expensive!  And, when water runs down the handle toward the base, sometimes the brush will stop then start up again, like it is &#x27;shorting&#x27; out.  Since it is an &#x27;inductive&#x27; charging toothbrush, it doesn&#x27;t seem to like it when water gets to the base area.  Not a show stopper or anything.  Just something to be aware of.  For the money, I&#x27;d probably just go with the SpinBrush Ultrasonic (works really well, too!)  But since I now have this, I will keep using it until it craps out and dies.  It&#x27;s a good brush and my teeth feel really clean.  And the dental assistant is &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; when I tell her I&#x27;m using the Oral B Vitality brush.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush has taken some getting used to after using a SonicCare Elite for a number of years.  I really liked the SonicCare for cleaning, operation, etc . . . really everything except the relatively high cost of the replacement brush heads.  The new Oral-B seems to be doing an OK job - it is just taking some getting used to.  It was recommended by my dental hygienist as the one to buy.  So - based on that - I got one.  I think it will be OK.  The replacement heads are certainly more affordable.    UPDATE: Up one star ;-)  After using this toothbrush for a few months I find it to be just fine.  For whatever reason(s) it took me a little while to adapt to this one after using my SonicCare Elite for quite awhile.  I am now very satisfied with this brush and would buy another if/when needed.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had this same toothbrush and it lasted three or four years with no problems so when the battery ran down I decided to buy another one just like it.  It works great and you can keep it on the charger.</li>
            <li> No frills. Doesn&#x27;t have the fanciness of more expensive models but does what I need to at a great price.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed when the grandchildren came to visit and had forgotten tooth brushes</li>
            <li> So far, so good. This is my third Oral-B Vitality. My other two each lasted three years. This one seems plenty powerful, and I like the size of the head. It handles easily. Yes, it vibrates, but that was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Works well so far, a few weeks of using it.  Just as good as my old one and I like the head.</li>
            <li> Bought a couple for my son and I after my previous one finally died.  Works great and love that use can use different types of brush heads.  You have to go to the oral B site to check to see which ones are compatible for the brush besides the one in the pic</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old Oral-B electric toothbrush, but not bad, and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Did not have to run to store to buy a new one.  Eventually the battery won&#x27;t charge on any of these brands.  But last a long time.</li>
            <li> Idk why one needs a $150 or $200 dollar toothbrush when this does what is needed for one-tenth the price. Had one that I bought in 2007 so bought this online as a replacement. I&#x27;ll buy this again in 7-8 years when my toothbrush loses the ability to recharge.</li>
            <li> This is a perfectly fine, no frills electric toothbrush. It is exactly what I expected. There aren&#x27;t any bells and whistles, but who needs bells and whistles to brush their teeth? This gets the job done at the right price. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in action between this reasonably priced Oral-B versus my old (more expensive) version. You don&#x27;t get the buzz indicating to switch quadrants, but I can figure out when to move the toothbrush on my own.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this toothbrush.  The last one I had lasted several years. Replacement heads are inexpensive if bought online and know where to look. Quite pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> This was better than I expected, since the first one we had died, and I mean died, the charger was no longer taking a charge to charge the tooth brush.  Just be sure once it&#x27;s charged to unplug the charger, and let the brush run out on it&#x27;s own before recharging, again.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Vitality, This is my first time using this brand, i was very surprised at the quality of the construction and the performance of the brush for the price i paid.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price! I&#x27;ve been looking for an affordable electric toothbrush for a while now, and this is exactly what I wanted. It is not expensive, but powerful enough to feel the difference after using the Conair Interpak electric brush. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Oral-B Vitality Deep Sweep Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is great.  Easy to plug in an use after charged.  Cleans teeth great.  Other replacement Oral-B toothbrush heads work also.  Easy to keep the brush and toothbrush head clean.  My last Oral-B Vitality toothbrush lasted for 10 years.  One button for both on/off, easy to use.  There is a 2 minute timer also, which is wonderful to have.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is ok...  But the coupon included has been expired for two months.  Yes, I get a new toothbrush, but I&#x27;m feeling like I buy an old one.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral B Electric toothbrush for over six years.  My first, the Oral B Vitality did a great cleaning job...my dentist likes it!  After six years, it finally stopped recharging (which meant I had to start working harder!).  I just replaced it with this model.  It seems to do a deeper cleaning in the cracks and crevices.  It is a great brush, and my gums like it!  It goes without saying, that any toothbrush needs some help, like flossing, and water picking.  I would definitely continue using and recommending this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Works well and a LOT cheaper than a Sonicare</li>
            <li> GOOD BUY CONSIDERING THE OVERPRICED MODELS WITH UNNECESSARY FEATURES.</li>
            <li> Super happy with this product. My teeth have never been cleaner between cleanings and it&#x27;s easy to keep the entire product clean.</li>
            <li> powerful little sucker!</li>
            <li> this brush is a basic single function brush that does what the more expensive oral b brushes do without all the extras. High quality with charge base.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted to replaced a four year old Oral-B which I broke with carelessness.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but effective</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this toothbrush.  I especially like that it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li> This is the lazy mans&#x27;  toothbrush, does a great job of cleaning your teeth, all you have to do is move the handle. Built in two&lt;br /&gt;minute timer to make sure you do your part.My first Vitality brush handle lasted eight years.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electronic toothbrush and now I am converted. At first, it was a little much and I had toothpaste going everywhere but I got used to it pretty quickly. My teeth feel so much cleaner now and my hygienist will be pleased. My only complaint is that the brush head is a little big and it moves in different directions. There are two brush sections, when I would rather have one. The toothbrush itself is great and vibrates when it has been 2 minutes automatically. The charger is small which is great and the charge lasts for about 4 days. You cannot beat the price either! I got it for under $20 with the coupon. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best electric for the money. Make no mistake,,, it&#x27;s less expensive than the top end and uses the same brush heads. Save some money. It&#x27;s the brush head that counts.</li>
            <li> Using this brush does make your teeth and mouth feel clean.  I am a little concerned that the speed of the brush -- which can not be regulated -- may eventually damage the enamel.  I would use the softest brush heads you can.</li>
            <li> Probably the best 15 bucks I&#x27;ve spent. My teeth always feel so great after using them. I take this overnight when I travel because I can&#x27;t stand how my teeth feel after using a manual tooth brush compared to this.</li>
            <li> Using it everyday.  Timer helps me brush for the right time.&lt;br /&gt;Many different brush heads will fit it.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> great product at a very good price</li>
            <li> As a serious reviewer, I rarely ever give out &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; 5-Star and 1-Star ratings. However for this particular product, I&#x27;m feeling forced to make an exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes for a few years now-- about 3 generation&#x27;s worth and I have to say that this one is such a disappointment, especially coming from a company with a track record like Oral-B. Here are the 4 deal-breakers for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The size of this thing. You would think that Oral-B, with all of it&#x27;s innovations over the past few generations of electric toothbrushes behind them, would make these a little more acceptable size-wise. This one is quite a handful-- the biggest of all of my past electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Vibration intensity. Holy cow, does this toothbrush vibrate! Your world will vibrate like crazy when it&#x27;s in your mouth. I&#x27;m not talking about a slight buzzing sensation-- I&#x27;m talking jackhammer-level effects! If you happen to pull the toothbrush out of your mouth (or start it up before putting it in), you will leave your bathroom with specks of splattered toothpaste all over your shirt. I&#x27;m not sure whether this is better for brushing, health-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) &amp;#34;The Smell&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of months now. A few weeks in, I started to notice there was a weird &amp;#34;breathy&amp;#34; smell to it, but excused it as an effect of the crazy vibrating motor within (maybe it was some lubricant grease in the motor or something). Well, I just figured out what it is. The engineers who designed the head decided it needs to drain (probably due to the double-action mechanism), so there are slot openings in the front and back of the head. And yes, water does drain out of it as intended... when it&#x27;s just water. Since you&#x27;re putting this thing in your mouth, it&#x27;s not a far stretch to assume that spit (slightly thicker than water) will make it&#x27;s way in. The problem is that it&#x27;s a way for stuff to get stuck in there. So when you brush your teeth thenext day, or over the next few days, it starts to smell. The only way around this that I&#x27;ve found is too remove the head and rinse it out every night. Not a big deal, but most other toothbrushes don&#x27;t have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The recharge stand. I don&#x27;t know what the engineers were thinking, but they made the stand curve inward (like a bowl). This design increases the amount of toothpaste build-up at the foot of the toothbrush. When you stand the toothbrush up on it&#x27;s charger stand, residual water tends to drip to the base. This is why most products have stands that curve downward (like the toothbrush is sitting on top of a dome). This model invites build-up to happen.</li>
            <li> it came very fast and this is the first time I have used a electric toothbrush and it does a great job</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace an Oral B Vitality brush I loved that had worn out.  The new one works fine but came with a different brush head.  It swivels and I cannot use it without spraying the surfaces around my bathroom sink.  It&#x27;s messy and must have been designed for a very large mouth.  I replaced the brush head with the type I previously used.</li>
            <li> For the price, I guess this is ok, be warned, the vibration IS like a jackhammer, not like my old Sonic one, they were very gentle, this one&lt;br /&gt;seems very vibrating in the mouth, and yes, b4 you pull this toothbrush out of your mouth, hit the STOP button otherwise toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;splatters go everywhere. It does do a good job cleaning, BUT the vibaration is way too hard, i;&#x27;d prefer a much gentler, softer cleaning&lt;br /&gt;thats why I am giving this a 2star. This toothbrush is **Very powerful** yes like a jackhammer, beware, you can;t leave it on the *on* position and run under water after you brush, things splatter everywhere......I don&#x27;t know this is a lil too &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; for me, even the 30 second *so called timers* you can&#x27;t even feel them, **i just read that there are NO 30 second timers on this brush, no wonder I could not feel the pulses**cuz the toothbrush is too powerful, but yes, you can feel the last 2 minute warning...it gives 4 beeps, the 30 sec ones in between, did not work.......I think for this price, you get what you pay for. I know my dentist always said brush is *soft* circles............well, soft, you cannot do with this toothbrush, way too powerful. I would not buy again. Plus there is no &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; on the toothbrush, when you put brush on the base, saying it is charged....I guess for less than $30 for this toothbrush you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush and a must for people with sensitive teeth</li>
